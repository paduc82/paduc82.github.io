<h2>            Any way to stop showing notifications for&#58; &#34;this installation is forbidden by system policy&#34;</h2>
                    I keep getting this notification: "this installation is forbidden by system policy contact the administrator", the thing is that i dissabled the device installation because the monitor driver that microsoft's update &nbsp;keeps trying to push down my throat
 is faulty, and messes up my secondary display, while the generic one works perfectly. So the only thing i need is a way to not show that notification anymore because i keep getting it to often.&nbsp;

            <span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, (and System Repair didn't work from the above post by Sreekanth), try to
 boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to find the names of the corrupt files (though it is a LONG list).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning
 startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with the upgrade from an earlier version of Windows section of the following: </span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system cane with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<p><span><span>Hi Theprospect,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome Microsoft Answers community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have a Windows Vista installation disc, you need to restart (boot) your computer using the installation
 disc. If you do not restart your computer from the disc, the option to repair your computer will not appear.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have a Windows Vista installation disc:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Insert the installation disc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Restart your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button , and then click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: If your computer
 is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For more information, see BIOS: frequently asked questions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;4. Choose your language settings, and then click Next.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;5. Click Repair your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;6. Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click Next.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;7. On the System Recovery Options menu, click Startup Repair. Startup Repair might prompt you to make choices
 as it tries to fix the problem, and if necessary, it might restart your computer as it makes repairs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;If Startup Repair is a preinstalled recovery option on your computer:<br />
<br />
1. Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Do one of the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts.
 You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system
 you want to repair, and then press and hold F8.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight Repair your computer, and then press
 ENTER. (If Repair your computer is not listed as an option, then your computer does not include Startup Repair as a preinstalled recovery option.)<br />
<br />
4. Select a keyboard layout, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
5. Select a user name and enter the password, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
6. On the System Recovery Options menu, click Startup Repair. Startup Repair might prompt you to make choices as it tries to fix the problem and, if necessary, it might restart your computer as it makes repairs.<br />
<br />
For more information on startup repair you can refer the link below.<br />

<p>I am sorry to say this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping for simple "Yes" or "No" answer to my query. Instead I got a reply saying "<span>India is part of XBOX live regions so the info for repairs is the same". This is like saying neither "Yes" nor saying "No".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So I take the overall answer as "No". (If still some body comes back with reply saying "Yes" I can consider that as "Yes" only if verifiable</span><span>&nbsp;contact details are shared).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don't need to know the address of the repair center, since if the device fails within warranty, you can sign your console up for repair on a website, and you will get a free shipping label with the necessary contact details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You simply put the console in a box, attach the label, and have it shipped to the next repair center. Be it in India or wherever else won't matter to you, as you don't have to pay anything during warranty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the console is out of warranty, you will have to pay for a replacement console, as Microsoft simply takes your broken console, and sends you a different refurbished console for a standard flat repair fee, which is often so high, that some people decide
 to simply buy a new console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the chance of having to send in a console:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have owned an original Xbox 360 Pro from 2006, which I had to send in after Microsoft extended the warranty for the "3 red lights" issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then I have owned a Xbox 360 Elite, a Xbox 360 S, a Xbox One Day One Edition from 2013, and now a Xbox One X Scorpio Edition. None of these consoles had to be sent in for repairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I wouldn't worry about where repair centers are, and simply enjoy a working Xbox console.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi MVMishra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Arminator answered that question in his comment right here, "If the console is out of warranty, you will have to pay for a replacement console, as Microsoft simply takes your broken console, and sends you a different refurbished console for a standard flat
 repair fee, which is often so high, that some people decide to simply buy a new console."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repair center addresses are not made available to the public and as mentioned earlier, there is no need to know the address because all of that is already applied to the shipping label or given to you by email after an out of warranty order is created. Shipping
 is also to the nearest repair center near you so you won't know which one is closest to you until you actually have this issue and need to set up an out of warranty repair.</p>

<h2>            MS Wedge Mouse randomly disconnects</h2>
                    I've just bought a Wedge Mouse the other day... and i've noticed
<div>that it keeps randomly disconnecting on my HP Elitebook 8540w</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A quick fix i found so far to this issue is to hit the Windows-Key</div>
<div>to switch between Metro/Desktop and then the Mouse immediatly</div>
<div>starts working again.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>An appropriate fix would be nice though since it happens way to&nbsp;</div>
<div>often to just ingore it.</div>
                </div>

            So i followed the links that Imran supplied and was able to fix my issue. It really
<div>seems to be a problem with Broadcoms Bluetooth Chips.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here are the steps to solve this issue (<i>while not perfect it does the trick</i>):</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>Open Device Manager</li><li>Go to Properties of your Bluetooth Device (in my case: Bluetooth -&gt; Broadcom 2070 Bluetooth)</li><li>Switch to the Power Management Tab</li><li>Uncheck "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power"</li><li>Done</li></ol>
<div><br />
<div>This will prevent the Computer from turning off your Bluetooth Device and thereby</div>
<div>stop the disconnects for your Mouse.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Caution:</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>This will also have the effect that the mouse doesn't seem to go to sleep. So obviously if you</div>
<div>aren't going to use your mouse for a prolonged time, make sure to hit the power button</div>
<div>at the bottom of the mouse to save your battery.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope that helps anyone else who encountered this issue.</div>

<h2>            USB is not an available boot device</h2>
                    My computer is old and apparently cannot boot from a USB port. I found this out after buying Windows 10 on a USB. I tried burning the USB to disk, but it won't let me. How can I go about getting Windows 10 on my computer? Thanks in advance for any help!&nbsp;

            <p>The problem isn't that your computer is old. My computer is old (instruction manual written in hieroglyphics) and it boots from a USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the BIOS doesn't know what's on the other side of the USB connector. Is it a bootable drive ... or is it a
<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/ede3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
squirming tentacle</a>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why you have to <em>tell</em> the computer to boot from a USB drive. I do this by pressing F12 while my computer is restarting. That brings up a list of devices attached to my computer, and I choose the USB drive. Your computer manufacturer may have
 configured a different 'F' key.</p>

<h2>            Error 0x80070490 when downloading Forza Horizon 3 October patch</h2>
                    
<p>As the title says, I am getting this error when updating Forza Horizon 3. When the update fails there are 5 windows errors that are shown in the Windows Event Viewer.</p>
<p>I have tried the Windows Store diagnostic tool which cleared the store cache and I also tried re-registering the windows store apps as per these instructions&nbsp;<a href="http://mywindowshub.com/re-register-modern-apps-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mywindowshub.com/re-register-modern-apps-windows-10/</a>.
 These haven't worked so far.</p>
<p>These are the Windows Event Viewer errors in order from first to last:</p>

            <p>The solution for me was to create a windows installer using the Media Creation tool and do a clean install and choose&nbsp;the option to keep all apps and files. This fixed the issue and I did not lose any programs,&nbsp;files or configurations I had before.</p>

<p>The CAUSE of the&nbsp;first were&nbsp;USBHUB.sys and ntoskrnl.exe which are Windows Components so something else<br />
drove them&nbsp;to fault.<br />
<br />
The CAUSE of the second was additionally IASTOR.sys which is the Intel Matrix Storage Manager driver.<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers at Toshiba.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Update the Intel Matrix Storage Manager driver at Toshiba if there, and check Intel Downloads.<br />

<strong>Is this a Upgrade installation of Windows 7 or did Windows 7 come on the system from the factory?</strong></p>
<p>A possible cause could be Windows Updates, especially drivers. Even drivers not usually thought of as<br />
USB related, such as video/display, network (NIC &amp; WiFI), and others, can be the cause.</p>
<p>Norton especially, McAfee, Kaspersky, SpyBot,&nbsp;Adaware and <strong>others</strong> could be causing or have a role<br />
in this issue. Try uninstalling them to see if that helps. Use their maker's Removal Tools and/or<br />
special instructions. (Antivirus/antispyware/security programs.)<br />
<br />

<p>Remove <strong>ALL </strong>USB devices from the computer. Be sure to check for updated drivers for ALL USB<br />

<h2>            Play&#47;Pause key not working on Microsoft keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I have a Microsoft Comfort Curve Keyboard 2000 v1.0, which includes volume controls, which work, search button, which works, and a play/pause button. which does not work. I previuously had a PS/2 HP keyboard, which had play/pause, stop, and skip buttons,
 which up until recxently worked. Now they don't. I use Windows 8.1 pro. Any ideas as to how I could fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: I've tried updating drivers, they are up to date, and I'd checked the Services panel, and HID service is running, but they play/pause button still refuses to work.</p>

            Hi Cole,
<br />please look at system journal  (Event Viewer) for possible information about hangs.
<br />Try to disable power saving settings  in BIOS and system settings.

            Hi Cole
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />I see some important updates for your laptop that you should apply.
<br />
<br />BIOS Update April 2019
<br /><a href="https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER05498561M/1/Latitude_3189_1.8.1.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER05498561M/1/La...</a>
<br />
<br />Chipset Driver Update January 2019
<br /><a href="https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER03973349M/4/Chipset_Driver_FY41X_WN32_10.1.1.35_A01_02.EXE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER03973349M/4/Ch...</a>
<br />
<br />Display driver April 2019
<br /><a href="https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER05424243M/1/Intel-UHD-Graphics-600-P600-series-Modern-Driver_TC92T_WIN_25.20.100.6519_A07.EXE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER05424243M/1/In...</a>
<br />
<br />Apply these updates, restart then check if the problem is resolved. If not, here are some further steps you can take. If they don't, you should take it back to the school and let their system administrator or desktop support technician look into what might be causing this issue. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />Check if its working...
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isn't fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. It's possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you don’t have any. If you don't have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=outlet+tester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=s...</a>). Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system won’t be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. Slack's Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.
<br />
<br />10. Replace Charger or Battery Module
<br />
<br />Ultimately, if you don't see any improvements after trying all the above, then it’s maybe best that you replace either the charger or battery itself. This will require contacting your laptop manufacturer and placing an order. Batteries and the chargers are not necessarily cheap, especially if its an older system. But, if you have no choice, its something you will just have to do to get your system back in working order.

<p>That's actually an education computer designed for K-12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than throwing every generic troubleshooting procedure at your computer and hoping something works, lets analyze:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lots of things are going on inside your computer when you are not actively using it, which generally means typing on the keyboard or moving your mouse. That's when Windows and your application software (aka apps) are doing their housekeeping, like running
 scans, syncing, indexing, updating, etc. This happens at a much slower pace, if at all, while you are actively using your computer, in order to provide you with the most amount of computer resources for your work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even so, these so-called background activities should not use up so much of your computer's resources that they cause your computer to freeze. They might if your computer has very little RAM - if you've got 2 GB or less - and/or a very small hard drive -
 32 GB or less. After all, that's a K-12 computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've got more resources than that, then there is one thing that will suck up as much of your computing power as you've got, which&nbsp;<em>will</em> cause your computer to freeze, and that happens when an attacker has successfully joined your computer to
 their botnet. A good example is when your computer is mining cryptocurrency. That will freeze a computer quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's really nothing you can do about that aside from a clean install. But talk to your school before you do that.</p>

<h2>            Surface 2 won&#39;t even factory reset&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>My Surface 2 was working fine defiantly as of July 10th, and for a few days after.
</span></p>
<p><span>Then I started getting a Bitlocker error when I started it up asking for the product key due to an error with "C:\\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\srt\srttrail.txt". I acquired and entered the product key, but it didn't seem to work because I was still getting
 the error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then it got worse, and every half hour maximum, my tablet would go to the 'there was an error we are gathering data...'screen, citing "KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My surface wouldn't let me do any form of reset or recovery including a Factory reset, which I tried to do from both the control panel and the start-up screen, and it wouldn't let me get and install any updates either.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once, I almost got a factory reset to start, got 1% of resetting your PC' when I was brought back to the options screen with 'something went wrong with resetting....no changes were made" again, and another time I got a message saying "Unable to reset
 your PC. A required drive partition is missing".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded a new Surface 2 Recovery Drive for my USB just incase that helped but it didn't.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 shut down, will not start</h2>
                    <p>I received my Surface Pro 4 in the mail and did the updates and it crashed. I took it back to the store and they replaced it today. When I got home I turned it on and started working on Differential Equations&nbsp;in Onenote. I had half battery life left and
 the device just&nbsp;turned black. I was on it for about 25 minutes.&nbsp;The device will not turn back on. I have tried recharging it for 1 hour and it still will not turn on. Is there maybe some trick I can do to make&nbsp;the screen work?&nbsp;This is ridiculous! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Transfer files and folders</h2>
                    <p>I have a Sony Vaio 17" laptop,(running windows 7), that has a bad motherboard. I want to transfer the contents of the hard drive from that computer to a new Toshiba 17" laptop running Windows 10. I have an adapter for the hard drive and I can see it as an
 additional drive on the new computer. How do I transfer the contents of the Sony hard drive to the Toshiba's hard drive. Can the programs be transferred too or will I need to reload them from the install discs. Thanks for any help you can give me.</p>

            Hi Nathan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt by typing CMD in Start Search, right click result to Run as Administrator, copy and paste or type the following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) Read over this Complete Guide to Managing Updates after Version 1803: <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-update-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-up...</a>
<br />
<br />6) If Updates still won't run go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

Seems you go back to the early days of the TRS-80 !! &nbsp; , &nbsp;Lol &nbsp;!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply want to transfer files between my Laptop's USB Superspeed Ports (2) and Smartphone without the Smartphone erasing or overwriting the original Windows 10 Home USB Superspeed Ports drivers.<br />
<br />
I can transfer files back and forth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I lose some of the original Laptop's USB Superspeed Port drivers</p>

<h2>            Dell laptop won&#39;t boot unless I close and open lid after anniversary update</h2>
                    <p>Since I updated my Dell Inspiron 15 to the Windows 10 Anniversary edition I've come up with two problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first was that it the laptop would automatically restart if Shut Down was selected with no possibility of really shutting down. This was solved by turning off the<strong> Fast Startup
</strong>in power options. Now it takes too much time considering I'm using a SSD<br />
<br />
The second one is still unresolved and it is that <strong>the laptop freezes every time I turn it on at the Dell logo and the only way of making it boot is by closing and opening the lid again</strong><strong>.
</strong>After that it boots normaly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried different power options with no success. Power troubleshooter doesn't detect anything. It also happens with no usb devices attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Solution please?</p>

            Hi Tyacoon Nexus,<br />
Vistalizator is a legal, free program which offers the real Windows language packs. It works on all versions of vista. Choose the version for your edition of vista here:
<a href="http://www.froggie.sk/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.froggie.sk/download.html</a>&nbsp;(each download includes all Windows supported languages)

I am sorry but you can not change Languages with Vista&nbsp;Home Premium using Microsoft Language Packs.<br />
<br />
You need Vista Ultimate or Enterprise to do that.<br />
<br />
<strong>Use 3rd Party software at your own risk.</strong><br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
<p><strong><span>Language change:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/35a1b021-d96c-49a5-8d8f-5e9d64ab5ecc1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/35a1b021-d96c-49a5-8d8f-5e9d64ab5ecc1033.mspx</a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>“How do I get additional Language files?”</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/5ecc6229-00d6-4a82-9364-b86068d2d23f1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/5ecc6229-00d6-4a82-9364-b86068d2d23f1033.mspx</a></span></strong><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span><br />
<strong><span>“Change the Country or region Setting”</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>1. To change your&nbsp;German Language&nbsp;Vista Operating System to English, you will have to buy a&nbsp;German Vista Upgrade&nbsp;Ultimate Disk/Licence.<br />
<br />
Then download the English Language Pack&nbsp;through Windows Update.<br />
<br />
The Upgrade to Vista Ultimate&nbsp;has to be done in the original Language Vista came in.<br />
<br />
2. Your other Option is to buy a FULL version of English Vista Operating System you want, and do a clean install.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Try and get a Recovery disk from the Manufacturer in the required Language,<br />
<br />
Cheers.</span></p>

            I just want to say THANK YOU for this suggestion. Vistalizator works on Vista Home Basic (SP2 - 32 bit) also! It's a wonderful program that helped me to finaly get my computer on English.<br />
All I had to do is download Vistalizator from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.froggie.sk/download/Vistalizator.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;and my desired language pack from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.froggie.sk/lp32sp2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a>.<br />
Install the software and then find your downloaded language pack. Let it load in through the Vistalizator and after restart, you've got yourself a Vista on English :) Further details on instalation can be seen here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.froggie.sk/usage.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.froggie.sk/usage.html</a>
<div>Good luck all :)</div>

            <p>Hi Damon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delayed reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, your PC’s external devices can be the cause of problems. Try unplugging all your devices, and then plugging them in one at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that worked, but one of your devices causes your display to go black when you plug it back in, unplug your devices again, plug them in one at a time—except the device causing the problem—and restart your PC. If you can determine which device
 is causing the problem, contact your device manufacturer for support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If unplugging external devices doesn't fix the problem, start your PC in Safe Mode and then try the following troubleshooting steps below.</p>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Restart your PC. When you reach the sign-in screen, hold the Shift key and select the Power button, and then select
<span>Restart</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
</li><li>
<p>After your PC restarts, select <span>Troubleshoot</span> &gt;
<span>Advanced options</span> &gt;&nbsp; <span>Startup settings</span> &gt;
<span>Restart</span>. After your PC restarts, you should see a number of options. Press 5 or F5 for
<span>Safe Mode with networking</span>. </p>
</li></ol>
<p>Once your PC is in Safe Mode, reinstall your display adapter driver.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Type <span>device manager</span> into the search box on the taskbar, and then select
<span>Device Manager</span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Expand <span>Display adapter</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Right-click the display adapter and select <span>Uninstall</span> &gt;
<span>OK</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Restart your PC.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>If the issue persists, then try to repair Windows 10 and check&nbsp;if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I suggest you to download the Windows 10 ISO and create a Media Creation tool and then perform Automatic Repair.</span></p>
