<h2>            Microsot Outlook Professional Plus 2013 &#40;15.0.4420.1017&#41; 64-bit possible IMAP issue with Google Mail account...</h2>
                    <p>I just recently installed and started using Outlook 2013 in order to prepare for questions that will inevitably come up as my customers begin to use it for various things.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
It setup fairly easily and works great with the Exchange 2010 corporate server, seems to work great with Hotmail (without the need for any addons) and works with one of my GMAIL accounts without problems.&nbsp; However, one of my Google email accounts will only
 synchronize up to August 1, 2012 and starts giving the following Synchronization error:<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<span>15:06:21 Synchronizer Version 15.0.rup</span></p>
<span>15:06:21 Synchronizer Version 15.0.rup</span></p>
<p><span>15:06:21 Synchronizing Mailbox '&lt;snipped or removed&gt;@gmail.com'</span></p>
<p><span>15:06:23 Synchronizing local changes in folder 'Inbox'</span></p>
<p><span>15:06:25 Error synchronizing folder</span></p>
<p><span>15:06:25
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>[800CCC0F-0-0-560]</span></p>
<p><span>15:06:25 Canceled<br />
&nbsp; <br />
And if I force a send/receive - it just attempts to synchronize for hours (I let it go for over 24 hours once) and never finishes and the only way to break out is to end Outlook 2013 from Task
 Manager.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I have tried this on two different computers/Windows 7 64-bit with SP1 installed - fully patched and get the same results in Outlook 2013.&nbsp; At the same time on two other machines, I have no such problems with Outlook 2010 64-bit installed on Windows 7 with
 SP1 64-bit.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
<br />
My other gmail account does not have any issues synchronizing on the same systems.&nbsp; The one having the problem *is* larger by MANY times - having thousands of messages.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
<br />
I have removed and added the account several times on both systems.&nbsp; Including manually deleting old OST files and such.&nbsp; Have changed timeouts as well.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I have also read through several other posts on other forums...&nbsp; Such as:<br />
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/officeitpro/thread/06d240f1-30d7-41ad-9724-038e4da2c46a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/officeitpro/thread/06d240f1-30d7-41ad-9724-038e4da2c46a</a><br />

<p><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>And have, so far, been unable to resolve this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I don't think I should have to do anything to my GMAIL account since I have been using it with Outlook 2007 and currently
 still use it with Outlook 2010 without any of the issues I see in Outlook 2013.&nbsp; I don't buy any 'by design' issue since&nbsp;it works in several other editions of Outlook - just not the latest.&nbsp; I only point out that this is 64-bit because I have not tried 32-bit
 Office 2013 yet -&nbsp;not because I believe the problem has to&nbsp;do with that.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Any idea of what to try and/or what the issue would be?</span></p>

<p>I appreciate the response...<br />
&nbsp; <br />
It was the first account I setup on the second computer - and it failed all on its own.&nbsp; I also set it up as its own profile (as opposed to being an additional account in a profile) and it had the same problem on the original computer.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
 on&nbsp;one of those as well as two different corporate Exchange 2010 accounts - meaning that one has MORE accounts than what I am attempting now.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I should also mention that one of the two machines&nbsp;is a clean installation of Windows 7 w/SP1 x64 and Office 2013 is the ONLY Office Suite installed on this particular system.&nbsp; There is no older components or past configurations that should affect this particular
 installation.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Right now it is just frustrating that I can have another laptop sitting right next to this one whose only real difference is Office 2010 vs. Office 2013 that works fine (and has for a year+.)&nbsp; Although I may have an unusual case with the number of accounts
 - given the academic environment and research related fields my customers work it - it's not all that unusual for my situation and also fails when only using that single account.&nbsp; I have even thought of deleting all my email on said account - seeing if that
 might assist in fixing this - but that seems like quite the extreme solution and given it works with the older Office releases - I'm unsure why it would be a problem on that side of the equation.&nbsp; *grin*</p>

Sorry for the delayed response time - real life intervenes.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
In the meantime I tried a new install on another system and experienced the same trouble.&nbsp; Then I bit the bullet and did some major cleanup of the account via Outlook 2010 on another computer and tried it as a different profile - and on that very same system
 - it 'sort of' worked.&nbsp; Took an extremely long time to update and still has quirky moments - but for now - I'll cope.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Another strange thing happened just yesterday.&nbsp; The Hotmail account I have connected just 'went blank' with no reported (publically - have not looked in the event logs, etc.) issues.&nbsp; Then it started connecting and synchronizing again a couple of hours later
 - slowly making its way back to 2013 over a period of many hours.&nbsp; Considering where the system was connected (dual DS3 on a university campus) - bandwidth was unlikely a factor on my end for the amount of time things were taking.&nbsp; I also had no other issues
 with my other gmail account or my two other exchange accounts open at the same time on that system.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
So far - although Office 2013 overall has been good to me - except for these quirks in email operations.&nbsp; Could be I am more unique in having so many accounts - but I know for a fact that many of my customers have their corporate exchange email, a private email
 like a gmail account or something and perhaps a few others too - so - in my experience - I am not that unique and one would think Outlook 2013 should be able to handle that as well as Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010 - especially 2010 - since you no longer had
 to have separate profiles for different exchange accounts - indicating a move towards better multiple email account support.</p>

            I am flabbergasted at Outlook 2013. The same configuration with several gmail, hotmail and one exchange account that worked flawlessly with OL 2010, fails miserably with OL 2013. I really regret the update to Office 2013. Not even with a new profile and
 a single gmail account the situation software is table, after 20-30 min of running it freezes up "Synchronizing Folders." All of this is a double whopper bearing in mind how the OL 2013 engineers were boasting about the new IMAP connector. What a complete
 and absolute disaster. Of the same order of Vista. I wonder who did the QA, did they use any real life IMAP account with tens of folders and thousands of messages?
<div><br />
<div>What is most annoying is the absolute lack of acknowledgment by Microsoft. They could at least jump in and say they are looking into it...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unless the next version of Office is much much better than this one (like Windows 7 was to Vista) I will not stay with MS Office. A pity, cause Outlook used to be an outstanding email client.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Windows Insider - Mouse Visual Glitch</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a unique issue with my mouse pointer - after logging in, the pointer becomes twice as tall, adding a blank line between each line of pixels in the pointer model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue began in 10130, but has persisted through my most recent update to 10240.&nbsp; It persists using both my Deathadder and a logitech mouse.&nbsp; Given that the change happens after I log in, I'm assuming it's a settings issue of some kind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps I have taken to try to resolve the issue:</p>
<p>-Restart the computer</p>
<p>-unplug and reattach the mouse (both of them)</p>
<p>-Update/Reinstall mouse drivers</p>
<p>-change pointer size/color in options (including restarting between changes)</p>
<p>
</p><p>this issue began after installing an older game (Red Alert 2), but uninstalling the game has had no impact.&nbsp; If anyone has any input, it would be much appreciated - this issue has gotten aggravating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: did some tinkering - the issue only happens when using an Inverted scheme, Standard scheme, or Black scheme - but not the default schemes, and not for cursors I download.</p>

            Same problem here.&nbsp; Started with an Nvidia update from Windows Update (which is odd, because I have the latest driver from Nvidia's website for my GT 640 installed) and it carried over from build 10162 to 10240.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; It only does this for the cursor
 icon that shows text position...&nbsp; UNLESS I turn off mouse pointer shadows, in which case it does it for ALL mouse pointers.

            Hi - This is definitely NOT normal.<br />
<br />
A couple of things you could try are :<br />
<br />
1) Ensuring your battery is properly seated into your phone and not loose or has a bad contact<br />
2) Back up the data on your phone using a program like PC Suite (<a href="http://www.nokia.com/pcsuite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/pcsuite</a>) and then reset your phone using the *#7370# code<br />
<br />
Once complete, try using the phone a few days without restoring the data to see if the problem still occurs.<br />
<br />
If it does then you should approach your local Nokia Service Centre for further assistance.

<p>It starts, but the start menu doesn't work and you can't type into the search window. After a couple of minutes the keyboard stops working and then the mouse stops. After that it requires a hard boot. I will be installing my last backup from before the upgrade.</p>

    <title>Flip orientation&#58; Forms control scroll bars - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrmambo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flip orientation&#58; Forms control scroll bars</h2>
                    I'm trying to create a simple tool for my teacher wife that lets students enter the daily temperature either in a table or by using a scoll bar laid on top of a thermometer graphic. I have the scroll bar working thru forms control, but it will only orient
 with the lowest temperature/value at top and the highest at the bottom--to make it look like a thermometer I need to invert this.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to have low values appear at the top of a vertical scroll bar as part of forms control?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I want to do (example):</div>
<div>100 degrees</div>
<div>90</div>
<div>80</div>
<div>70</div>
<div>etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But it will only do:</div>
<div>0 degrees</div>
<div>10</div>
<div>20</div>
<div>etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>which confuses the kids (first graders).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            You're correct - I missed the 2008.
<div><br />
<div>However, you can still use the first method and require the kids to use the slider to change values.</div>

            I don't know of any way to change it, but one workaround I've used is:
<div><br />
<div>1) Link the slider to an out-of-the-way cell (say Z1). You can hide this cell's column if desired.</div>
<div>2) In the table (say, cell A5) put the formula</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; =100-Z1</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;(100 being the Max value of the slider)</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the kids can enter the value directly in the table, it's a bit trickier, but it's still not too hard. Assume that the table entry is in cell A5 for this example.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) Do the steps above.</div>
<div>2) Type Opt-F11 to open the Visual Basic Editor (VBE).</div>
<div>3) In the Projects window, find your workbook - &nbsp;labeled VBAProject(workbookname).</div>
<div>4) Double click the worksheet your table is on (click the triangle to the left of the workbook project name and the Microsoft Excel Objects folder, if necessary).</div>
<div>5) In the worksheet code module type or paste this code (from "Private" through and including "End Sub"):</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Const cdMaxSlider As Double = 100 &nbsp;'&lt;-- Change as needed</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dim rLinkCell As Range</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dim rTableCell As Range</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set rLinkCell = Me.Range("Z1") &nbsp;'&lt;-- Change as needed</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set rTableCell = Me.Range("A5") '&lt;-- Change as needed</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On Error GoTo End_Change</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = False</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If Not Intersect(Target, rTableCell) Is Nothing Then</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If Not rTableCell.HasFormula Then</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rLinkCell.Value = cdMaxSlider - rTableCell.Value</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rTableCell.Formula = "=" &amp; cdMaxSlider &amp; _</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "-" &amp; rLinkCell.Address(False, False)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;End_Change:</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = True</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; End Sub</div>
<div><br />
<div>6) Type Opt-F11 to exit the VBE and return to XL.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now when the kids make an entry in A5, Z1 will automatically be updated by the event macro (which in turn updates the slider), and the formula is returned to A5.</div>

<h3> arudlang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana&#47;Search button still active for a moment after turning off screen</h2>
                    <p>I have been plagued by this bug for some time and has not been fixed so would like to bring some attention to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nokia Lumia 928 with 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Naturally, when using the phone the capacitive buttons for back, home, and search are always active (that in itself is annoying). Those buttons are supposed to be INACTIVE when the screen is off/locked.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>When using the phone normally, if I press and release the power button on the side I expect the screen to turn off, and stay off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens:</p>
<p>If you press and release the power button, the screen goes blank BUT if you press the capactive search button with a second of turning off the screen, say you bump it accidentally on the way to putting the phone into your pocket or similar, the phone "wakes
 back up" and the screen comes on and goes to Cortana search.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may or may not catch this happening and if you don't then the screen stays on in your pocket and wreaks all kind of havoc rearranging your home tiles and dialing people and all sorts of not-great things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Microsoft if you would please, do me a solid, make sure order of operations is enforced so those buttons at the bottom of the screen are inactive the INSTANT the power button is pressed to turn off the screen. Not a second after the screen is already
 off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thaaaaat would be greaaaaat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also switch the xbox music app back to the windows phone 7 version that was fast and didn't suck if you want to but that's a separate subject.</p>
<p>

    <title>Office 365 repetitive Activity Alert - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mat_in_it  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 repetitive Activity Alert</h2>
                    <p>I have a very strange issue happening. I changed my password over a month ago, and the Activity Alert for that exact event (exact same time and date) keeps sending emails to my admin account. It's one event, but Office 365 Activity Alert &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;
 has been sending Notifications about this singular event to my admin email multiple times a day for over 35 days now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could cause this, and how do I clear it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you kindly.</p>

<p>Hi Mat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check whether this alert policy works well now, I'd like to suggest you change your password again to see if Office 365 Activity Alert still send you Notifications mails everyday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this issue persists, please share with me more info about it:</p>
<p>1. The detailed steps about how you create this alert policy.</p>
<p>2. Does this issue happen to other accounts?</p>
<p>3. What have you changed before this issue happens?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp;<br />
1: This policy was created before I started, which was about a year ago.<br />
2: This does not happen for any other user, nor has it ever happened for my user account before whenever I've change my password.<br />
3: I have not changed anything in Office365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon your recommendation, I have just now changed my password, and will monitor the alerts, and will let you know.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Neo Wu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wanted to update the current status of this issue. I changed my password, and receive
<strong>1</strong> Admin Alert Notification for event "User Password Changed" for that event, on the proper date and time, as expected. However, since then, I've received 4 more notifications for the event that happened 36 days ago. There is some kind of alert
 loop going on for that particular event, that isn't affecting any other events, and never has before or after this one problematic event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time,</p>
<p>Mat</p>

<p>Maybe you can create a form that acts as a report. Or, as the KB article suggests, use an Access client app. I know, not ideal, but it's a work in progress.</p>

    <title>Activating Office 2019 via Microsoft Parner key&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mateusz bender  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activating Office 2019 via Microsoft Parner key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm administer MS software in a small company and was granted access to the Microsoft Partner Network site where the ISOs and keys are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 / 2016 was a bit of an annoyance in this, because one was not compatible with the other, and the ISO version worked with the keys available from the MS Partner site, while the 365 version had to be activated with an Office 365 account with the
 proper licence attached (we have a few of those, but we're mostly relying on<span>
</span><span>Office 365 Business Essentials licences for new hires).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When preparing new workstations for new people I'd install the ISO version, since I could get it activated with our VL key without worrying which Office 365 licence that person would receive.</span></p>
<p><span>Now MS has switched from Office 2016 to Office 2019 (the 2016 option is no longer available in the MS Partner portal) and the code available there doesn't seem
 to work with the Office Online installer any more. Or, at least, there's no manual on what I'm supposed to do and how I'm supposed to prepare an install for our workers.</span></p>
<p><span>There's some mention of using a KMS server, but I don't think our company has a licence for a KMS server at all to begin with...</span>
</p>
<p>How do I prepare new workstations and activate Office 2019 on them now?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I think I figured it out. The deployment kit has a default configuration which is not fit for the VL activation and channel that should be used in this case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found what I need in this MSDN article: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/office2019/deploy</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still downloading the Office data, so I haven't actually tested the new configuration, but I have a strong suspicion it'll work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the suite we are licenced to use, all I can see is "Office Professional Plus 2019" in the MS Partner site... I THINK this translates to the "ProPlus2019Volume" product ID that needs to be used in the config XML for the deployment tool...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Yup, the updated product ID worked. :) I guess this solved my problem.</p>

<h2>            Problem with synchronzing my smartphone with Windows Mobile Center</h2>
                    After using the windows Mobile Device Center successfully for quite sopme time I have got problems now after I updated windows last Thursday (July 30th) When starting my computer the grafik card is automatically set to 8 bit depth. And I can't synchronize
 my phnoe with outlook anymore. I have tried to de-install the updates which did not work. I could somehow solve the problem with my display now being on 32 bit again. But as soon as I start the device center the dissolution of my display changes to 8 bit.
 And I still can't synchronize my mobile phone. If anybody got an idea I should be really happy. Thanks.

Hmm, I do not understand why the update changed the resolution of your display.&nbsp; Have you tried a System Restore back to a point BEFORE the update?

    <title>Suggestions for Word Styles in sample document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wethotuwasatoad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suggestions for Word Styles in sample document</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
This is a follow-up to two other threads containing great information about using Styles in Word. Those two threads are located here:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_win10-mso_2010/change-the-normal-style-font-without-changing/bb505ecd-04d6-4487-a727-78030b31ae82">Change the Normal (Style) font without
 changing several other Styles in Word 2010</a></strong><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_win10-mso_2010/list-of-word-styles-and-their-intended-specific/c387648f-65a9-4a01-ba50-e26679043c87?auth=1">List of Word Styles and
 their intended specific purposes</a></strong><br />
<br />
The purpose of <em>this </em>thread is to hopefully obtain some specific examples of what styles would be assigned (and in what order if relevant) by experienced and knowledgeable Word-Styles users for various parts of a sample document.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The sample document (see below) contains representative content (eg Titles, Heading, Lists, Body, etc) from a hypothetical Employee Training Manual. I think this is a good type of sample for this purpose due to the variety of content and formatting it contains.<br />
<br />
I attempted to use the forum Heading &amp; Indent tools to depict the structure of the content but that did not go well. As a second option, I have pasted two screenshots below to display the intended level structure of the document and below that, an unformatted
 list of all the displayed content for those who would like to reply to simply copy and paste.<br />
</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
• Neither the formatting (ie Font, Color, etc) nor indentation shown in the screenshots is suggestive of how/what styles should be applied, but is aimed only at clearly delineating lines at different levels.<br />
• It is not my desire nor expectation that someone feel obligated to "stylize" or comment on every line included below. Rather, I'm most interested in learning more about the rationale, order, and specific styles selected in specific situations by experienced
 users.<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

<p>I'd start with Title and Subtitle, use Heading 1 for the major headings and Body Text for the ordinary text below them. The next level of headings could use Heading 2. Since only some are bulleted, I'd be inclined to add the bullet manually as needed. Where
 you will get into trouble is with the numbered lists if they need to restart after a heading and if you really have as great a variety as you show. I think I'd have a numbered paragraph as Level 3 in the list that includes Heading 1 and Heading 2 (it could
 be Heading 3 but formatted to match other body text) and then have similarly formatted body text paragraphs that could be used for bulleted paragraphs, definitions, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the sort of document that would cause anyone to pull his hair out, but if you stick to as few styles as you can get away with, combined with as little direct formatting as possible, it will be easier to maintain.</p>

<br />
As mentioned in a previous thread (see links in my OP), resource or reference websites (including the article referenced above by Doug Robbins) generally do not include suggestions for which
<em>specific</em> styles may be most appropriate or beneficial to assign in particular situations.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A couple of questions from the screenshots are:<br />
<br />
1) Which style(s) would you favor for the section titled "Definitions (company/industry terminology)"? Prior to our dialog, I would have applied some Paragraph Style to the definitions and then manually applied Bold to the terms themselves. But is this a setting
 in which you would superimpose a Character Style over the underlying Paragraph Style?&nbsp;If so, which Character Style would you apply?<br />
<br />
2) How would you stylize the very last section, "Communication"? It is a subordinate heading under "Section II" but then has its own subheadings (ie Section II &gt; Communication &gt; Sample Phone Scripts &gt; Phone Script_A, etc). Most puzzling however is the script
 portion under those headings. I realize that it could be manually formatted using a Right-aligned tab followed by a Left-aligned tab combined with a hanging indent. But could/would it be better accomplished using a style — particularly if you want to use different
 fonts for the speakers (or for different speakers) and their actual scripts?<br />
<br />
Thanks again.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Two possible alternatives to using tabs: You could use a table, starting a new row for each paragraph, or you could define "numbered" styles that use Employee, Other Party, Subject, Body, etc., as the number. For tips on this, see

            I found the Search Box to be distracting too. Here is the fix. Right click on a blank spot on your Task Bar, then go to Properties &gt; Toolbars. Near the bottom is a drop down box that will allow you to customize the Search Function. I've got mine set for
 the Search Icon instead of the ugly search box.

<p>Yep instead of complaining people could simply just customize search the way they want it. Oh wait most people using the tech preview never actually delve into the thing even though that's the whole point of being a beta tester. I suspect most people got
 on the insider program just&nbsp;to get a free upgrade a year early. But as you said you can just reduce the search box to an icon or get rid of it altogether.</p>

<p>Hi AmD2654321,</p>
<p>As the Shared with me section is only a view for the files share with us, it’s not a library. We cannot use the URL to add service/add a place in Office desktop applications. This view only can be displayed in the web portal.</p>
<p>We understand it’s more convenient if users can view all the files shared with ourselves in OneDrive for Business not only in the cloud. It is suggested you post your requirement via<a href="https://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/262982-onedrive/category/86090-onedrive-for-business" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 Uservoice</a>. This is the best way to influence our products. Your good ideas will help us perfect our products.</p>

<p>Hello Siyad,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the information you provided, it seems that the EMSMDB.DLL file is missing. Please try to following options to see if it helps:
</p>
<p>1. Try <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Online Repair</a>. </p>
<p>2. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-25663bc3-11ec-4412-86c4-60458afc5253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair Outlook data files(.pst and .ost)</a>. </p>
<p>3. Download <a href="https://diagnostics.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365</a> and follow the prompts to scan and fix Outlook desktop client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists after you have tried the methods above, I want to collect some more information for further check:
</p>
<p>1. The version number of your Office 365 ProPlus. Open any other Office applications and go to
<strong>File-&gt;Account</strong>, capture a screenshot of the version number. </p>
<p>2. Capture a screenshot of the entire error message. </p>
<p>3. Please check if other Office applications are affected.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<br />
<br />Well based on the NDR you posted here i could see that you are exceeding limits or probably your IP is blocked
<br />
<br />"tenant has exceeded threshold"

            The executable for the Office Picture Manager is named OIS.EXE. If it has been installed, you should find it in the Office12 folder along with WINWORD.EXE and the other Office programs.<br />
<br />
If it hasn't been installed, go to the Control Panel, click Programs &amp; Features, click the Office 2007 icon and click the Change button. In the installer, choose the Add &amp; Remove Features option; on the next page, expand the Office Tools icon, click Office
 Picture Manager, and choose Run From My Computer. When you click the Continue button, you might be prompted to insert the distribution CD, but usually the installation files are already on your hard drive.<br />

<p>Just bought a Nokia 6303 today and was about to send it back: sometimes able to call landlines, sometimes not; sometimes taking calls; sometimes not; wouldn't connect to voicemail.</p>

<p>That solution worked and save me a huge amount of trouble.</p>

<p>Hi Dianne,<br />
<br />
One of the possible reasons why your PowerPoint presentation skips is because some slides are hidden. To resolve your concern, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open your PowerPoint file with the skipping slides.</li><li>Click on the View tab and select Slide Sorter. Look at the thumbnails of the slides in your presentation. If any of the slide numbers have a box around them and a slash through them, then the slides are hidden and will be skipped during a presentation.
</li><li>Right click a slide that’s hidden and click Hide Slide to toggle the features off. Repeat for all the hidden slides in the slide show and then save the file.
</li><li>Relaunch your PowerPoint presentation file and check if the issue persists. </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the steps provided worked for you. </p>
        </p>

            No, I checked. &nbsp;The slides are supposed to progress on mouse click. &nbsp;What's happening is when I click to move to the next slide, nothing happens. &nbsp;When I click again, it skips a slide. &nbsp;So every other slide is being skipped. &nbsp;It's happening with ALL my
 powerpoint presentations...I have several. &nbsp;So I'm figuring there must be a hardware problem. &nbsp;I've never known anyone to have this problem before.

<p>It does sound like hardware. I presume you don't always use the same (dodgy) template??</p>

<h2>            When I log in to Windows 10 Preview I get 2 account pictures</h2>
                    <p>When I log in to Windows 10 Preview I get 2 Account pictures. How can I delete 1 of them? Also, occasionally it shows the desk top background that I have on Windows 8.1. It seems that the two are tied together. How can I prevent this?&nbsp;

            <p>This is a known bug that occurs if you disable the <strong>Users must enter a password</strong> requirement in Control userpasswords2. If you reinstate that pw requirement it goes away. It does no harm to just ignore the duplicate pictures.

            Guest acct is turned off by default. Reinstating the password requirement and the second user picture goes away. If either user icon is selected it opens the same acct so it is not for the Guest acct.
