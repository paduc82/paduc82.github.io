            I too got updated to <span>1806 build 10222.20010 (64 bit on Win10). The ribbon shown in the screenshots above is very different (and much better) than what I have in the applications (still have the old one). Is it something removed the incremented version
 10216 -&gt; 10222 ?? I would like to the see the ribbon and tab style shown above to be implemented. It looks much cleaner than the previous iterations.</span>

<h2>            Outlook.com deleted emails not going to Deleted folder</h2>
                    <p>Platform: Chrome browser accessing Outlook.com</p>
<p>I received some emails directly into a sub-folder; these emails were moved to the sub-folder via a rule.</p>
<p>Both the sub-folder and the folder were created by me.</p>
<p>After reading the emails, I selected all of them and deleted them.</p>
<p>As expected, the emails disappeared from the sub-folder.</p>
<p>However they have not appeared in the Deleted folder.</p>
<p>There are other emails in the Deleted folder, but none of these emails.</p>
<p>I tried the Recover option but this also did not display the missing emails.</p>
<p>I am aware that emails are kept for only 5 days in the Deleted folder,</p>
<p>but these emails arrived yesterday, were deleted this morning and never appeared in the Deleted folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not using IMAP, POP3 or other remote access protocol here;</p>
<p>just accessing Outlook.com over the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted emails from the Junk folder since the failed operation above; this worked.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately you have not read my question very accurately. Its about deleting emails, not restoring them, so the article "Restore deleted email messages in Outlook.com" is not relevant. I did select the restore/recover category in the drop-down list for
 classification of the problem but that was because it was the best fit - there's no delete emails category.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restoring the emails did not arise because of the problem I have described: The emails NEVER appeared in the Deleted folder. I did try the Restore option to verify that the deleted emails would not then appear in the Deleted folder and also because I expected
 Support would suggest that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't need to recover these particular emails, which is fortunate since I clearly can't. However my basic question remains:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did these emails NEVER appear in the Deleted folder after deleting them?</p>

            I completely understand your question. &nbsp;I, too, have the exact same problem. &nbsp;i set up my outlook.com account in my home outlook 2007 program. &nbsp;It then created the account with an DELETED, DRAFT, INBOX, JUNK, SENT, and SEARCH FOLDERS sub folders. &nbsp;When
 i delete an email from the INBOX, JUNK, DRAFT, or JUNK folders it is gone for good; it
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>never</em></span></strong> goes to the DELETED folder where I would have an opportunity to review/restore it before final deletion. &nbsp;This works perfectly with my other NON-outlook.com accounts. &nbsp;I have compared
 the account setting to ensure that they are set identically, so that can't be the issue. &nbsp;I have tried to go offline and then delete an email from my INBOX. &nbsp;The only thing that happens is that a line goes thru the headers, and it stays in the INBOX (does
 not go to DELETE) until I go online again; and then it is gone forever. &nbsp;THIS IS A PROBLEM!!!

    <title>Removing a .PST file to remove emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarah0209  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing a .PST file to remove emails</h2>
                    I wanted to move my emails between work computers so I transferred the .PST file but I actually took the file, I didn't copy it or delete it so the old computer will no longer open Outlook because the file is gone. Our IT department said they can fix it
 no problem but my question is - is they replace the .PST file, will the old computer still have some of my old emails archived? Or can I assume the .PST file I took contains all the data. Some emails archived were personal correspondence I had with HR, managers,
 etc. so those are the only one I'm worried about. I know some people think I could just have deleted those emails from the archive but in my role, we get thousands of emails to archive and I wouldn't be able to get them all. Thanks in advance for any assistance!&nbsp;

<p>Hi Palcouk,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response! When I right clicked my archive folder to find where the source of the file was, it only brought me to a file that was called OUTLOOK.PST. The folder didn't have an archive file. Do you think that might be the same thing? Or are
 there two files - one is a general outlook.pst so it works and one is an archive file?&nbsp;</p>

            If you have just purchased the handset, as in the past couple of weeks, then it is probably best to take it back to where you got it from as they can usually exchange faulty handsets.<br />
<br />
If that is not an option, you might want to update the software.<br />
<br />
You can do this yourself using the Nokia Software Updater.<br />
<br />
Go to <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4579163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0034ff">http://europe.nokia.com/A4579163</font></a> to download the Nokia Software Updater.<br />
<br />
Remember to back up your information as this can be lost during the upgrade process.

<p>&nbsp;Hi, I've a similiar problem. I used my 6500 classic for almost 10 months without having any problems (despite the pretty short battery life). But two months ago it started to turn itself off every five to twenty minutes. I first thought of a broken battery,
 but a former nokia-seller told me that a battery failure would only cause the phone turning off while using it for calls. But mine is turning itself off erratically. It also sometimes turns itself on again or just keeps dead. After turning itself on again,
 the screen shows completely white for a second or two. I'm really confused, don't know, what to do. Should I sent it back to nokia for a total check up? Just heard weird things about the costumer service... Does anybody has an advice? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

<h2>            Azure AD powershell module and Azure DRS</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Couple of questions around Azure DRS.</p>
<p>I am using Azure DRS to workplace join Win 8 &amp; 7 devices and Azure AD join for Win 10 devices, together with device writeback to on-premise to allow ADFS conditional access based on registered device claims. Everything is working as expected, however in
 Azure portal under a user, I can see the workplace joined device for Win 7 &amp; 8, but not the Win 10 device. Is there a way I can view Win 10 devices registered in this way?</p>
<p>I have tried in powershell to view devices. I have latest AAD powershell module installed (version 1.0.9031.1), but I can't see the device cmdlets that were introduced last year (e.g. Get-MsolDevice etc.). How can I access and use these cmdlets please? Can
 I view Win 10 devices in first question this way?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
                </div>

<p>Hi Ajm1265,<br />
<br />
According to the <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/ad/2015/05/28/azure-ad-join-on-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Azure AD Join blog</a>, you should be seeing devices in the Azure Admin Portal, which means that your situation is not an expected behavior.<br />
<br />
As this is an Office 365 for Business online services forum, we’d suggest you post the issue to the
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure/en-US/home?forum=WindowsAzureAD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Azure AD forum</a> for further help.<br />
<br />
Regarding the missing PowerShell commands, you may try <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/28552.microsoft-azure-active-directory-powershell-module-version-release-history.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
re-installing an older version</a> of Azure AD PowerShell module to see if the new device management cmdlets are available. If you are unable to use the cmdlets on an older version and would like to troubleshoot the issue further, or would like to report an
 issue with the newest version, you may do so on the Azure AD forums I mentioned above.<br />
<br />
Thank you for understanding.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Sheen</p>

    <title>Adding Facebook Account - Windows Phone 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> remidumas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding Facebook Account - Windows Phone 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I updated to Windows Phone 8.1 a few days ago. Of course there are many problems as expected (battery drain, hellish music app, etc), but what bugs me the most is that I can't add a Facebook account anymore. Prior to the update, you could go In Settings&gt;Email+accounts
 and add a Facebook account there, thus enabling you to send Facebook chat messages directly from the Messaging app. Now I did add Facebook as a Social app, so I can see Facebook information about my contacts and everything, but I can't send or receive messages
 from Facebook Chat directly to my messaging app. Is this intentional? I know Facebook plans on removing messaging from their app, but are they also removing it from everything else, forcing people to use Facebook Messenger? God I hope not, being able to do
 everything from the Messaging app was a big win for me when switching to Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Well I hope you guys can help me, or at least inform me, because I can't seem to find anything.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance!</p>
<p>- Remi</p>

<h2>            Outlook not send files attached with shortcut</h2>
                    When I click on the Attach Files icon and use any of my recent items, they do not attach to my email. This happened with Windows 8 and now with Windows 10. It's a great feature, but after sending countless emails only to get the reply, "You forgot the
 email" when I haven't, I'm ready to blow a gasket. IT says it's a common problem and can't be fixed on our end. Surely after a couple of years Microsoft has fixed this bug???

            Are you attaching the actual file or a shortcut to the file?  That command should be attaching the actual file (or a web link to the copy in sharepoint or onedrive, neither of which should trigger the alert - and don't here). Shortcuts, save for the web links, are blocked file types for security reasons. 
<br />
<br />FWIW, its not a common problem with the general public, but if the file is attached and you still get the warning, you can disable the warning. It's in file, options, mail - about 2/3 of the way down. 
<br />
<br />Ask IT to open a support case with Microsoft - they would be able to look at your configuration and identify the problem

            I'm trying to send the actual file. I use the recent items drop down. I send the email. The receiver then replies to my email that there was no attachment. So, the recent items listings are not attaching. I can only attach the file when going into 'browse
 this pc'.

 automatically logs in when started.&nbsp; Also, you can choose whether it loads when you reboot your phone.<br />

    <title>Why are APA-citations in Word not fully APA-compliant&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jan altena  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why are APA-citations in Word not fully APA-compliant&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Word's set of tools for managing references and citations are excellent save for one anomality; for a 5+ authors reference, the in-text APA citations should differentiate between the first and the subsequent citations of a particular reference. The first
 citation should include the names of all authors whereas subsequent citations should only include the name of the key author and a symbolic 'et al.' to represent the co-authors.</p>
<p>Word does not differentiate the citations as required but includes all the authors' names at all citations.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>This omission to differentiate the citations forces users to much wasteful manual editing.</p>
<p>The issue has been on the Community before. In 2013 for example, but the problem ramains unresolved still in 2018! Why.</p>

<p>Because no-one responsible for this tool at MS cares to fix it... Non-compliant citations in APA, Chicago, etc. have been a 'feature' of MS Word ever since the tool was introduced with Word 2007.</p>

<p>Is this an intellectual properties issue between MS and APA? A big shame if it were since my university compells me to abide by APA formatting and MS Word is, in my experience, by far the best word processor.</p>

            It doesn't matter which version or edition of Office you're using - all have the same defects. If you want something that is standards-compliant, try using the EndNote addin, for example.

            Please note that as defined by OS X there is a distinction between the <span style="font-weight: bold">
return</span> key &amp; the <span style="font-weight: bold">enter</span> key, whereas the Windows OS supports 2
Page Break</span> in Mac Word, <span style="font-weight: bold">Shift+return</span> creates a
fn</span> key modifies it to elicit <span style="font-weight: bold">enter</span>. I.e., on a Macbook Pro a page break would be created by a combination of 3 keys:
<br />
In case you didn't realize it, the <span style="font-weight: bold">Cmd+enter</span> keystroke by default is assigned to
 for controlling text flow &amp; in my personal experience I'd say I use them 100/1 as opposed to manual page breaks.<br />

            I don't believe you screwed anything up :-) it's just a matter of how that feature works. Technically, the Footnotes are a separate, subordinate 'plane' of the document. If the insertion point is in a footnote when you do the search the search is limited
 to that plane. Likewise, if the insertion point is in a Header or a Footer only Headers or only Footers will be searched. If the insertion point is in the body of the document the entire document -- including the footnotes, Headers &amp; Footers -- will be searched.<br />
<br />
You can also take advantage of the <b>Edit&gt; Find&gt; Advanced Find &amp; Replace</b> dialog rather than the
<i>Search in Document</i> device. Assign a keyboard shortcut to the <b>EditFindDialog</b> command for convenience if you wish.<br />

            <p>MS made a huge change in the way Office 2016 or 365 is installed and activated. It requires an email account BEFORE it asks for the product key.&nbsp; This makes it very different/difficult for Office 2016 or 365 to be factory installed AND activated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a computer that "came with" Office 365 they no longer provide a separate product key. Some builders put an "Office 365" (some variation of that text) icon on the start menu with the product key "hidden" in it somehow. When you click on it, it will ask
 for the email account you want to use to activate it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't find that start menu icon, you should contact the store your bought it from (I'm sure they have heard the question many times before!), or go to the computer builder help site to find out specifically where they hid Office in your purchase.

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Welcome to Microsoft Community Answers forum. Allow me to assist you on how to find the Spell check button/feature when composing an email in Outlook.com. Customers with an updated version of browsers will not see the Spellcheck
 button in Outlook.com. These browsers have their own spellcheck tool installed. If you do not see the button for spell check along the top of the compose page in Outlook.com, then your browser is considered to be modern.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To check the spelling of a message you are composing in Outlook.com:
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Click Spell check in the message's toolbar.</span><font color="#000000">
</font></li><li><span>To correct a misspelled word (marked with a red underline), right click on it and select the desired alternate spelling.</span><font color="#000000">

    <title>Outlook 2016 - Not displaying email alerts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fraser hunter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Not displaying email alerts</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently been rolling out Windows 10 Enterprise N 1709 to our clients. Recently noticed that when emails come in, there are no notification boxes appearing at the bottom right hand side, however there is the very small envelope on the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been searching online and read that Outlook 2016 should be appearing under the 'Get notifications from these senders' list, but it's not there. I've also checked 'Mail' options and 'Display a Desktop Alert' is also selected. This is what I see.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc110d9e-82eb-49e9-bcc0-67d270da0642?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc110d9e-82eb-49e9-bcc0-67d270da0642?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52f5c9f5-704f-4df5-a78b-08cdfe601492?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52f5c9f5-704f-4df5-a78b-08cdfe601492?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way that I can get Outlook 2016 into the list? I assume that once it's in there the alert box should start appearing again at the bottom right hand side of the screen when a new email has come into the inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>Managed to figure it out - we had a script that automatically grouped all of our Office applications into a folder within our Start Menu. I re-installed office so that the programs were in the root, now Outlook shows up in notification centre.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes when windows update updates the window defender definitions my windows defender shuts off. Why? This shouldnt happen. I think the higher ups should be notified about this-being that the defender should always be turned on to protect us from viruses.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there any other anti-virus software installed on your computer?<br />
</li><li>Are you getting any error messages every time Windows Defender shuts down?<br />

            No antivirus but Defender. I sit though the entire process and havent received any error messages. Its happened about 3 times in the last month so its not turning on automatically after the update has installed so now i run the update as soon as im ready
 to start doing something and finish that and now I have to check windows defender to see it its turning itself back on.

            <p>I've just seen it happen after taking in the latest cumulative update, KB3200970. A Defender definitions update did come in with it. It doesn't happen when
<em>just </em>a Defender update comes in. It does seem to happen, lately, with each big, cumulative update. However, it quickly turns itself back on, after the notice is clicked. I wouldn't worry much.</p>

            <p>We suggest you to avoid installing any cleaner or anti-virus software that may interrupt the function of Windows Defender. Make sure that Windows Defender is always on. To do this follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Start menu</strong>, type <strong>Windows Defender</strong> and hit enter.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Settings</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Turn Real-time protection on.</li></ol>
<p>We also recommend you to install the latest update for Windows Defender.<br />
<br />

</p><p><span>Hi Community,</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>we have an issue with Outlook 2016 and our CTI-Solution.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>We are migrating from Office 2007 to Office 2016.
</span></p>

<p><span>After the installation of Office 2016 our CTI-Solution isn't working anymore.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>For the old Outlook 2007 we have had to copy a tapi32.dll into the same Directory as the Outlook.exe is located.</span></p>

<p><span>After that we can use the Dialing-Function of the Outlook Client.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>With Outlook 2016 this isn't working anymore.</span></p>

<p><span>It works, when we have done this Tasks into the %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Office\root\office16 Directory:</span></p>

<li><span>Is it ok to delete the original Outlook.exe.manifest.XML File? Can this have negative effects to the application?</span></li><li><span>Is there a way to load the tapi32.dll via the Outlook.exe.manifest.XML File?</span></li></ol>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In the old Outlook 2007 Version it was enough to simply copy the tapi32.dll into the application Directory.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I hope someone have a hint for us.</span></p>

    <title>Maximum Sub Folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garry g. green &#40;the real one&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Maximum Sub Folders</h2>
                    <p>I currently have 8 Top Level Folders.&nbsp; I am trying to add a subfolder to one of the Top Level folders.&nbsp; I receive a message that I have reached the limit of custom folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an organized individual, having one big IN BOX is not efficient nor an option.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a BUG or a limit?&nbsp; If it is a limit (and sure hope not - I just converted all of my email to OUTLOOK.COM and advised my contacts).?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, can MS provide us with what the limits are, and if they can be removed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, we've had various statements about the maximum number of TOP LEVEL FOLDERS.&nbsp; I have 8.&nbsp; I am getting this error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a MAJOR BUG OR LIMITATION.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone from the product team please make a statement.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We don't need yet another person saying "I will be pleased to help you" and unfortunately not offering any benefit.&nbsp; Can someone who knows the code and the software that supports OUTLOOK.COM PLEASE make a statement.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is using the WEB interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

It is a limit and there are various flavors of it.&nbsp; AS far as I know there is a max of 128 folders period.&nbsp; Some say 128 top level folder and unlimited sub folder but as you have seen that does not seem to be the case.<br />
<br />
This is mostly a peer to peer site so I doubt you will get a definitive answer from some-one who knows (in fact I wouldnt even know who that might be)<br />
<br />
8 folders as a max is an error and if you are using a browser I would clear the cookies and cahche<br />
