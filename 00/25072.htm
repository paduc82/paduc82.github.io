<h2>            E71 Download&#33; buttom</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just bougth an E71 earlier today, and I can't seem to find the Download! buttom anywhere. It's supposed to be on the Menu page, but for some reason it's not and there's just nowhere to find it in the phone. The Download! buttom I'm talking about is the
 one where all the application you've already downloaded are stored. Like I've just downloaded the youtube app, and I have no idea where it is now.</p>
<p>I've also download the Ovi Store app, which I can now access directly from the Menu page. I think there should be this folder called Download! on the&nbsp;Menu page&nbsp;where I should normally find the Ovi Store app, as well as the youtube one and all others I will
 download later.</p>
<p>Do you guys think there's a bug somewhere, or is there anything I'm missing here ??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank's !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS. On the Menu screen now I have : Comminic - Office - Log - Connectivity - Tools - Media - Installations (Where there is another link to the Ovi stores I downloaded btw) - GPS - Web - Ovi Store - Help - MyWorld.</p>

<p>all the apps i'm installing go by default in installations folder</p>
<p>maybe some apps go into specific folders</p>
<p>for ex if u install some media player app maybe the app will install it's shortcut in the media folder</p>
<p>the download button you are reffering to it's just an old version of ovi store and it comes preinstalled by default. after u click it it will download the latest version of ovi store and then it will dissapear. or at least this is what happened in my case</p>

<p>Hey Lucian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fair enough for Download! to disappeared as it's an old version as you're saying. But like I've just downloaded the youtube app and I can't seem to find it anywhere.</p>
<p>Plus earlier when I downloaded youtube, I was at this page in the phone where there was the youtube app to download as well as a few others like facebook and I can't really remember what. I can't even seem to find that page anymore. I think it was the Download!
 one I seem to have lost now, as I'm pretty sure it was on the initial Menu screen.</p>

<p>i'm sure it's there somewhere :) like i said the installations folder is the folder all apps install in. make sure you check all the folders and if u still can't find it turn off your phone and then turn it back on and see if you find it. if not... try reinstalling
 it again.</p>
<p>good luck</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>btw. go to:</p>
<p>-menu</p>
<p>-installations</p>
<p>-app manager</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and see if you can find it in there. it it's there then uninstall it and then install it again.</p>
<p>i don't know what else to say. try and you shall find ;)</p>

<p>Ohhh !!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem solved !! It was very much under "Media", where the facebook app also is to download and so on so on..</p>
<p>Yeah, guess you were right, there's no more the Download! buttom like on the e63 for example, and everything is directly downloaded where it's supposed to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One last quick question though : This middle white buttom on the keyboard, the one that normally flashes all the time when you have a missed call or something, how do I turn it off as it keeps flashing by itself without any reason !</p>

            <div>To see if your computer has a fingerprint reader
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Open Biometric Devices by clicking the <span>Start</span> button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_818.jpg" />, and then clicking
<span>Control Panel</span>. In the search box, type <span>biometrics</span>, and then click
<span>Biometric Devices</span>.</span> </p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you have a fingerprint reader, but it isn't listed in Biometric Devices, you probably need to install a driver for it that works with this version of Windows. If you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or have an older fingerprint reader, your
 fingerprint reader might continue to work with Windows, but it won't be listed in Biometric Devices. In that case, you can try updating the driver. If you're using fingerprint management software and you want to uninstall it to update it to a newer version,
 make sure you know your Windows password. You'll have to restart your computer and log on again after uninstalling the fingerprint management software.</p>
<p>If you have more than one fingerprint reader or you're replacing an existing one with a new one, you might need to scan and save (often referred to as
<span>enroll</span>) your fingerprints before you can use the fingerprint reader with Windows. This is because some fingerprint readers save fingerprints in different formats and they can't be shared with other fingerprint readers. To enroll your fingerprints
 with a fingerprint reader, in Biometric Devices, click <span>Use your fingerprints with Windows</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You&nbsp;<strong>may</strong>&nbsp;have to enable the Biometrics for Windows 8.1 to pick up the Biometrics setting.&nbsp; Interestingly, the configuration is supposed to be defaulting to&nbsp;<em>enabled</em>&nbsp;even if you do not configure the
 options -- this appears to work as indicated in Windows 8 -- Windows 8.1 may not be picking up the default due to the manner in which the native (built in) fingerprint software sees the setup.</p>

<p>FYI - my about section says that I have Microsoft for Mac 2018, but I didn't see that option so I put 2016.</p>

    <title>Word and Outlook 2010 slow to open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr. t.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word and Outlook 2010 slow to open</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have Office 2010 professional plus 32 bit edition on Vista Business 32 bit edition and have used for several months.</p>
<p>About 3 weeks ago a new problem started. Word and Outlook take a long time to open.&nbsp; Word does not open at all for close to a minute, while Outlook will open.&nbsp; However when trying to access an email in Outlook, it takes a long time.&nbsp; Once they are "active",
 they both appear to work fine.&nbsp; It appears to be only at startup.</p>
<p>I have researched the web and Microsoft database.&nbsp; I have tried to use the Microsoft diagnostics utilities (which says nothing is wrong) and I have searched these forums.</p>
<p>I have opened them in Safemode and conducted a clean boot.</p>
<p>However the problem still persists.&nbsp; Can anybody help?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Mr. T.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Mobile Lumia 535 update problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to update my phone's software for the past 2 weeks. I have tried more than 20 times and failed. The closest that I got was 95%.</p>
<p>Every time that the update fails it restarts from 0% instead of resuming from where it failed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying to update my phone's software so many times the feature to block phone number crashes all the time and I receive the following message:</p>
<p><em>"Something went wrong. That didn't work, though it's not clear why. Try it again."</em><br />
</p>
<p>While trying to update my phone's software I have ensured the following -<br />
</p>
<p>1. My phone's battery level is always more than 50%. (It is connected to a power source)</p>
<p>2. My phone's available storage space is greater than 2 GB.</p>
<p>3. I have a stable internet connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have received many different error messages with the most recent ones having the error code: 80070570, 80070012, 801881d0 and 801882d2. Also, my phone turned off abruptly a couple of times while trying to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Someone please help me with this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nandesh</p>

            <p>Hi NandeshNair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you're&nbsp;having&nbsp;difficulties processing a Operating System update on your Windows Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the situation you're describing I would recommend&nbsp;to utilize the Lumia Software Recovery Tool.</p>
<p>This program, once installed on your Windows 7 or never PC will allow you to download and install the latest available for your device Operating System as well as it's Firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download the &nbsp;Lumia Software Recovery Tool from here :</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/mobile/support/faq/?topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/mobile/support/faq/?topic=FA142987</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Bare in mind that the process will wipe your phone's content and as such&nbsp;I strongly recommend backing up your phone's data before hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists,&nbsp;&nbsp;you might be dealing with a hardware issue, the fact that the phone turns off on it's own would indicate that. If so please contact the place of purchase for servicing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You,</p>
<p>Marek.&nbsp;</p>

<br />On the new computer, Outlook created a new .ost file for my email, but I can't find my previous calendar, contacts, or notes 
<br />folders.
<br />
<br />I've added the old .pst file as an Outlook data file, but those folders aren't in it. I've tried to add the old .ost file, in case those folder are there, but it won't let me add that file.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />The bad news is that if your account was configured as an IMAP account (your contact/calendar info stored in folders with the added description of "This Computer Only" - you will have to use a 3rd party OST2PST conversion tool to access those folders in the OST file IF you don't have access to your old computer.
<br />
<br />If you do have access to your old computer, you will need to export the data in the "This Computer Only" folders to a PST file and copy that file to the new computer. Once copied, add it to Outlook via File --&gt; Open &amp; Export --&gt; Open Outlook Data File. When that's done, then strongly suggest that you go to File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data File tab --&gt; select the newly added PST file and make it the "default data file" for the profile. This will now be where the default contact/calendar folders will be located preventing the situation you have just run into going forward.
<br />
<br />An .ost file can only be opened by the Outlook profile/email account originally used to create it. If Outlook can't find an .ost file, it will automatically create a new one, sync the email folders and the "This Computer Only" folders will be empty meaning that data will be lost. Also, should you ever just remove the IMAP account, the associated .ost file will also be deleted.

<h2>            Microsoft movies &#38; to on iPad</h2>
                    A company based on software I find it very frustrating with the continue requirement that you have to have their hardware devices to play the movies you purchased makes me want to use Amazon video services over Microsoft. For two reasons one because they
 don't limit me on how many movies I can watch at once and which devices I have to use to watch it. &nbsp;I feel Microsoft doesn't actually want to be customer orientated.&nbsp;

<h2>            Confused by needing to have Office 365 installed on my phone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an Office 365 Home Edition account. I also have a Lumia 950 phone. It came with things like Word, Excel, OneNote. I knew that I could put the Office apps onto my phone using my Office 365 account, but I didn't think I needed to do that, since my phone
 already has Word, Excel, etc. Today, while eating out with my friends, I tried to create a new Word document using my phone. It told me that I couldn't do that. That to create a new Word document I would need to have Office 365 installed, then it gave me a
 link to try and get it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need Office 365 on my Lumia 950 running Windows 10 Mobile? Huh? Then, if Word, Excel, etc. on my phone is not Word, Excel, etc., what in heck are they?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in order to create a new Word document on my phone, if I need to install the "real" Word, Excel, etc. onto my phone, I presume I need to do that through my Office 365 subscription home page. I can do that, but then what happens to what's there already
 on my phone? Does it get overwritten?</p>

<h2>            Unwanted Changes to Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>My outlook.com has again been downgraded. &nbsp;New changes to appearance have made my e-mail list and e-mails difficult to read. &nbsp;It looks just awful. &nbsp;I guess this is the "mobile experience". &nbsp;Well, it sucks, and I want it back the way it was before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time Microsoft changes outlook.com they make it worse!</p>

    <title>Trouble with Office 365 MSWord - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jon_bell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble with Office 365 MSWord</h2>
                    I have installed office 365, everything works fine and I am signed into all application except for MSWord. Everytime I try to open a blank document or saved file, MSWord crashes and say Microsoft Word has stopped working' it checks for probems, attempts
 to recover my information and then it it states 'A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available'.
<br />
<br />
I have tried uninstalling and then reinstalling the whole Suite several times, attempted the quick fix and internet fixes as well. I am able to open WSWord in safe mode, but am unable to do anything else. I have have unchecked all the add-ons in MSWord to see
 if that was the issue and this did not help. I am also able to open all of my documents on an older version of MSWord so I know the files are not corrupt.<br />
<br />
I have spent hours trying to fix this issue and need some assistance ASAP as I need this application to complete my university assignments.

            Same over here.<br />
Picture file names are really important in our company, as they can be for everyone. Information stored in the file name about a specific version of the picture, the subject and more gets lost this way.<br />
<br />
Using Skype app on windows 10.<br />
Sometimes .jpg pictures pop up at the receiver (being the colleague next to me, ideal for good testing) with the original file name. Clicking the preview thumbnail opens the picture in the set picture viewer (standard W10 Photos app in my case). Most pictures'
 filename will change into a random code. But there are also pictures that keep their original file name. It looks like the last also don't show a thumbnail preview picture in IM.<br />
<br />
Very weird behaviour because either of the 2 kind of pictures are:<br />
- JPG format<br />
- Custom made pictures saved in Photoshop with same setting for JPG<br />
- Sent from same computer, user &amp; Skype app<br />
- File size does not seem to influence this behaviour. I have seen both scenarios for file sizes smaller and larger than 10MB, ruling out a change in result of how Skype handles pictures after a set file size.<br />
<br />
I remember having this issue earlier like 1 or 2 years ago. At that time I was still using the normal desktop app, not the W10 app from the store. I think you were able to solve the problem at that time by right clicking the picture in the IM window and hit
 'save as' instead of first clicking the preview after which it will be opened in your set picture viewer and then saving it from there.<br />
<br />
Also I have done the test of sharing a picture either by the picture button or the document button -&gt; no difference.<br />
<br />
Hope to receive help on this too.<br />
Thanks<br />

            Update:<br />
<br />
Installed the normal desktop app from the website and this solves the problems.<br />
<br />
Still look forward of fixing this in the W10 app from the store so I can continue using this one.<br />

Keep me updated.

This problem I had which was holding me back to switch to the new Skype app seems to be fixed!<br />
<br />
I can send and receive images and when&nbsp;<strong>Right-clicking -&gt; Save as..</strong> it shows and saves the original file name and not a temporary generated code.<br />

            <p>Just wondering if you have Norton Antivirus? I do, and just noticed it quarantined a file related to the update just before the error popped up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file was in folder 'CSIDL_WINDOWS\softwaredistribution\download' so I assume as a file in the update is downloaded, Norton&nbsp;quarantines it, then the error pops up as the file has disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll report back how I go after restoring the bunch of files that Norton quarantined and then running the update again.</p>

<p>
</p><p>For example, during one attempted update, &nbsp;it tagged icmui.dll v. 10.0.15025.1000 as suspicious and quarantined it, quickly followed by the 0x80070002 error.</p>

            Troubleshooting with Windows Update Troubleshooter (to find and launch it, I typed "Windows Update" in Control Panel's search box) and rebooting the PC helped me to get the Windows Update ready to install.<br />
Thank you!

<p><span>Hi Akhanit,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By default, a customers Outlook.com account will not automatically delete any emails unless the customer has set up rules to delete emails. Also, syncing the email
 account to an email client application may delete emails depending on how the account was set up. To assist in resolving your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>When you searched for the emails, were there any errors or were there no results returned?</span></li><li><span>Which browser are you using to access Outlook.com?</span></li></ul>

<h3> sam on maui  say:</h3>
<h2>            Would it be possible to have an IE to Spartan&#47;Edge import tool&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Right now going from IE to Edge/Spartan is a bit of a pain because I'm literally restarting from scratch, especially in terms of bookmarks/favorites. I was wondering if it'd be possible for Microsoft or a 3rd party to make an import tool for my IE bookmarks
 (at least) to go from one to the other? As-is, its very inconvenient for me to try using Edge/Spartan, nevermind a typical computer user (like my 67 year old mother).</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I don't think the inconvenience of things would cause a mass exodus or anything, it will be a legitimate point of complaint, I think.</p>

<p>If the file lives in SharePoint then the best thing would be to simply drag/drop the document from the document library straight into the body of the email (I presume you are using Outlook). This will instantly add the URL to the body of your email.</p>
<p>Please mark this as an answer if it answers your question. Good Luck!</p>

<p>hi johnpacker5970,</p>
<p>if you are using <strong>outlook web app</strong> in office 365, the files from the sharepoint site libraries can‚Äôt be attached directly in the application. you need to navigate to the site libraries and click
<strong>open with explorer</strong> to sync the files, and then you can drag the files such as powerpoint files to the new email in the application.<br />
note: <strong>open with explorer</strong> is only supported by ie.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=581c5f16-93d4-4607-8c1c-4f3f814d2d03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d581c5f16-93d4-4607-8c1c-4f3f814d2d03" /></a>&nbsp;<br />
if you are using the outlook client, as michael said, you can drag the files from the local place or sharepoint site libraries directly to the new email.</p>
<p>if something is misunderstood, please post back.</p>
