            Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/61c27274-613c-4c22-a9c7-739faa73fde4" title="Alex_078">
<p>
</p><p>When updating your Skype and Microsoft accounts, you will receive a message prompt that you will only retain your Skype contacts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, Skype contacts are tied to the account and are saved on Skype's servers. They will not be removed unless the user remove it himself/herself. If the missing contacts are not Microsoft account contacts, then one possible reason might be you are
 accessing a different Skype account. I advise that you sign out and sign back in using the credentials you used to
<strong>initially </strong>create your account. </p>

<p>Hi Danida_U!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>I have a few Skype accounts, but I don't see my contacts only in the Skype account merged with the Microsoft account. This is the primary account and all my important contacts are there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know how can I see a list of all my Skype accounts? May be all my contacts from the primary account were transferred to a different account about which I've forgotten?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

<p>Hi Alex, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, we do have a way to check all your Skype account. You can access the <strong>
<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft accounts diagnostics link</a></strong> for that. Enter your associated email address and click
<strong>Continue</strong>. You will see the accounts that are under your email address.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Follow-up question: </strong>Are the missing contacts Skype contacts or are these contacts from your Microsoft account which do not have individual Skype accounts?

<p>Hi Danida,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The missing contacts are&nbsp;<span>Skype contacts from the Skype account that was merged with my Microsoft account while new version of Skype was proposed for Win 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Yesterday I checked all my Skype accounts
</span>through the link you provided, but there were no missing contacts in none of them. After that I reset the password of my primary Skype account (that one the contacts were in) and after login with a new password my missing contacts had appeared for a
 second, and after that disappeared and changed with one new contact that I'd added recently.</p>
<p>I don't know what exactly had caused the problem - merging of accounts or the new Skype version.</p>
<p>Do you have some ideas about that or how to solve the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

<h2>            PowerPoint 365-Where are the colors, fonts, &#38; effects located versus PPT 2010&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have MS Office 365 and it is a major downgrade from Office 2010 in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use PPT a lot and in Office 365 PPT I cannot find the "colors", "fonts" &amp; "effects" under the "Design" tab like I used to.&nbsp; I loved the color choices and the "effect" choices that were available in 2010.&nbsp; I've also noticed that the "Word Art Styles" in
 PPT 365 are extremely limited compared to that of PPT 2010.&nbsp; I was hoping for an upgrade with this product but am very sorry that I bought it and installed as I feel it went backwards and is very blah and bare bones minimum with PPT 365.&nbsp; It's like Microsoft
 didn't want to put any effort into not only maintaining what they had, much less make any improvements.&nbsp; It's so limiting and frustrating and lacks many creative options that were there in 2010.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where are these options in MS Office PPT 365?&nbsp; The "colors", "fonts" &amp; "effects" that were under the "Design" tab in MS Office PPT 2010???</p>
<p>Especially the "colors" &amp; "effects".&nbsp; The fonts are easily changeable with the standard font list on the "Home" tab.&nbsp; I want my colors and effects back to create and further what I was doing with PPT 2010.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's like the focus more on you sharing all your work with everyone when that is exactly what I want to avoid.&nbsp; I do designs and need to keep them private and not uploaded to some dumb cloud or the internet for all to see.&nbsp; That's exactly why I chose to
 install Windows 7 Pro versus Windows 10.&nbsp; It's forced spyware.&nbsp; </p>
<p>

            <p>When a shape is selected, click the Format tab. The shape formatting options are in the Shape Styles group.&nbsp; If you've selected text, the text formatting options (fill, outline, effects) will be in the WordArt Styles group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're about to complain that calling it "WordArt Styles" is misleading, I'm right there with you.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that you can customize the ribbon; you can probably create a new group on the Home tab or on a new Art's Tools tab and put the features you want there.&nbsp; Or on the Quick Access Toolbar so they're in front of you all the time and not moving around
 depending on what you've selected.</p>

<h2>            Show complete note on mobile homescreen via onenote widget&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just switched from Google keep to OneNote and instantly liked it :)</p>
<p>Though, there's one basic feature missing from OneNote. I can't seem to find a way to show a complete note(s) on android home screen. I managed to find a widget which shows the recent notes but it shows only the notes title :(&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I really want to see what's in there without opening the application.<br />
<br />
For example, I sometimes forget that I have to go to the supermarket after work. But if there were a 4x4 widget on my screen, screaming: MILK! BEANS! CORN! I would notice it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Keep shows it in a pretty sleek way.</p>

<p>I too want to be able to display a Onenote note as a widget on my Android tablet and phone.&nbsp; Can't do so at this time.&nbsp; &nbsp;I find Google Keep's method typically (of Google) insufficient -- it only displays a middle segment of a Keep note, not the note from
 the top down.... lame, Google.&nbsp; Microsoft is lamer with no note display at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best, and perhaps only, implementation of this (displaying a note as a widget on a home screen) is the new'ish Samsung Note app (not S-Note!).&nbsp; Though the note taking part of the app isn't as elaborate as Onenote, it does work well and allows any note
 to be displayed on the screen as a widget.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Facebook login has been discontinued as of this&nbsp;January 2018. Prior to removing this option, notification was sent so that users logging in to Skype via Facebook will be able to transfer their contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even you used the same email from your Facebook account, the contact will not be visible as these contacts were only available on your Facebook login unless contacts were transferred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By using your email linked to your Facebook, you have created a new account hence, the contact you have added or saved when you were still logging in using your Facebook account before will not be visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to ad your contacts again if you were not able to export them when you still have options signing in to Facebook.</p>

            actually the battery is great on the n97 but keep in mind ifyou are always connected to internet of wifi for your widgest, you have email and other apps going all the time it consumes a great amount of energy (battery). with modest use i can get 4 days
 out of my phone with semi heavy/heavy use i get 1-2 days which in my case is great. i used to have to charge my n95-3 half way through the day so it would not die. and there is no need to charge the battery for 24hrs. that was the case with old batteries,
 today all you need to do is charge it until the battery says its full.&nbsp;

            I would agree with radical24, 4 days with modest use and 1-2 days with heavy use. I think this is pretty good as I can make it through the whole day and then charge it back to full over night. I have also read that always charging the phone to full is
 the best way to prolong the life of the battery and it doesn't need to be drained completely.

<p>Well, to me I used to have N95 8GB &amp; it lasted 2 days with mederate to heavy use. My new N97 lasts maximum 1 &amp; a half day with moderate use, but with heavy use, like google maps, wifi, music, &amp; so on, it barely last one day... It's really sad to have a newer
 mobile with less durable battery althugh it's 1500 mAh.</p>
<p>Guys, it is really essential to charge the battery 24 hrs at 1st use? I charged the battery around 12 hrs only when I 1st used it.</p>
<p>I'm afraid the battery is ruined....</p>
<p>Any idea?</p>

<p>Did you read the list of things that your phone does and what you do with it? Of course it is not going to last 3 or 4 days. Try this. Unplug your laptop and see how long it lasts before the battery dies. The N97 is usually connected to the Net for most
 of the day, then you browse, then call, then music, etc... and you are sad that the battery needs to be charged at the end of the day. And so what is the big deal about charging a battery. That is what the power adapter is for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As these are newer batteries, you can charge them at will however do not let it go completely flat. Charge it after using it, and this will in fact increase the battery life, but do remember that there are a finite amount of charges in any battery. Your
 battery is fine.</p>

            Hmm I have NO AUTO widget etc.. connection taking place.. and I have an extra battery.. I replace the battery everyday and charge it on a desk charger.. Even though I drain the battery daily I am happy with the battery life..&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Short Battery life wouldn't be important too ... just would find a way to charge it more often.. mobile charging solutions etc.. The RAM and C: space kills the N97, nothing else.

<h2>            Unable to play  WMA audio files on Windows 10</h2>
                    I am unable to&nbsp;play media files on Windows 10.&nbsp; I tried to play a music file on Windows media player on Windows 10.&nbsp; First I tried Windows media player, then Groove Music and then Power DVD. None of the players would play my file.&nbsp; The file is from a n
 Audio CD that I copied onto my hard drive.&nbsp; Over the years I copied thousand of songs from Audio CD's a few from downloads.&nbsp; One message said I was playing a file that I did not have a license to plat. The song was copied from an Audio CD that&nbsp;I own. If there
 is a licensing issue, it would affect thousands of songs all copied from CD's that I own.&nbsp; It would take hours to re-record all my CD's onto my hard drive.&nbsp; Also, my music (also Videos and some pictures) are on a USB hard drive plugged onto my&nbsp; laptop.&nbsp; Does
 it matter because I am accessing the files from a separate hard drive.&nbsp; I do not have enough room on my C drive for all my music, video, and picture files. The file type is a
<strong>WMA file</strong>.&nbsp; How do I fix this problem?

            <p>Hi Dan - I don't think it's the hard drive. The fact that these are WMA files suggests you originally copied them with Copy Protection turned on. There is an old answer in the thread below giving links to reset DRM - I can't test it because I don't have
 any CP files myself but it may work for you... please let me know if it doesn't help because then I can take it off my list! - Cheers, Ric.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>If you have set MSN as your Homepage, check if the home page is changed to Spanish.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;Click on Tool, Internet options from the Internet Explorer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp;Under page change it to </span><span><a href="http://us.msn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://us.msn.com</a><span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method1</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Here are the scenarios based on which the msn default pages are loaded.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A.&nbsp;Based on your Internet Service Providers location. If your Internet Service provider is located in United States, by default msn your home location on the MSN page would be set to United States.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
B.Check if you are using Internet Service provider other than United States: </span>
</p>
<p><span>If your Internet Service Provider is non US based, MSN loads the default home page based on the
 location of the ISP.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
C. If you would like to access the United States Home page, you can follow this web address:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</span><span><a href="http://us.msn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://us.msn.com/</a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Get MSN Homepage in your language<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Allow spam to a distribution group</h2>
                    
<p>The business I work for uses a distribution group for customers to email them.</p>
<p>Apparently a lot of customer emails are getting marked as spam and the users are not checking their junk mail folder and customer emails are getting lost.</p>
<p>Is there a way to allow all spam to come through to just this distribution group, so absolutely no emails get marked as spam?</p>

                    The dash board on the right hand side, how do you remove it or move it to another location. Taking up too much room.

    <title>Build 16193 Applications fails to launch due to Smartscreen issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Build 16193 Applications fails to launch due to Smartscreen issues</h2>
                    <p>I have updated to the latest build but now I cannot open many applications like Outlook 2016, Excel, Word, Avast Antivirus, etc.</p>
<p>It seems it is all related to Smartscreen failing:</p>
<p>Faulting application name: smartscreen.exe, version: 10.0.16193.1001, time stamp: 0x6ebf76b0<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried to uninstall the update, but that is also not working due to another error in the SystemsSettings module:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I do not want to revert back to clean Windows, but because this issue is stopping me from actually getting my work done, I think I will not have any other option.</p>
<p>Hoping this issue gets immediate attention by the Insider guys and get fixed really soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, has anyone experienced something similar? have you gotten around disabling SmartScreen everytime an application starts?</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

<p>1. if you do not test insider builds in a work computer, how do you think bugs are going to be catched, in a "lab environment" that does not work with real world applications? I would rather send feedback on day-to-day activities for end users which should
 be the target for these builds to be cleaned up and fixed.</p>
<p>2. I will take a look at the ISO, to see if I can go back to a workable version.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

<p>If you have real work to do you should have it on a computer that does not have Insider builds.&nbsp; You can also have a computer that has insider builds and critical apps for testing.&nbsp; Insider builda can crash your computer.</p>
<p>I have made quite a few Clean Installs on my test machines after crashes.</p>

<p>While you have a point that "eating dogfood" (testing on a working computer) is a good way to shake out bugs, and you clearly understand the risks, it's probably better to do something like I used to do: &nbsp;clone your work system as closely as possible either
 onto another machine or into a virtual machine, work from that cloned system, but still have your original work system ready to go in case you get stuck with a beta build. &nbsp;That way you have the luxury of leaving the beta system up so you can investigate a
 little further and give more details to your bug report, but you aren't stopped from doing your day job.</p>

<p>I have a second computer, but I need to re-synch back from the cloud, which kind of stinks...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, with every build I have always been able to work around the kinks, and the MS team has always been very fast on developing a patch or fixing whatever was wrong (i.e. Edge was left unresponsive, and then they fix it right away).</p>
<p>But this time, they went too far by trying to fix an issue with their security system and leaving everything else non-functional. That is just too much.</p>

<p>No, I'd rather continue to do my real work on the same computer I use everyday to provide real world scenarios feedback to MS. So far, nothing has been so harsh as to stop all other applications from working, or at least you were able to go back to the previous
 build. Today that is not the case and they need to up their QA. This is a case of poorly testing just to push an update to patch a security hole.</p>
<p>In any case, I already have a second computer, but need to re-synch with my work on the cloud, and on top, re-image the other computer or wait a couple of days until the next patch comes out. With the weekend coming up, probably that will not happen before
 next Wed.</p>

<p>I had the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to roll-back from 16193 -&gt; 16188. &nbsp;Unfortunately, Windows update immediately started the process to re-update me back 16193. &nbsp;To prevent the re-update from happening, before the update process for 16193 actually started (i.e. during the "preparing
 the update" stage), I changed my Windows Insider status from Fast ring to Slow ring, and restarted the computer before the update was ready to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reboot, the update fail message appeared for 16193 (which is fine) -- so, far I have not been prompted or "forced" to re-update</p>
<p>

Uninstall the Share it app then reinstall a fresh new copy. Then, turn off the modem and turn it back on. Try to connect to the wifi network, check if the signal will be stable.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am creating a macro button that will go to a sheet 'QTD' and refresh a table I am pulling in from and SQL server.</p>
<p>I then want to take the pivot I built off of that data and refresh.</p>
<p>I know how to do a refresh all macro for pivots but the problem I have with the refresh all is that it doesnt know the order of refreshing.</p>
<p>It refreshes the pivot before it refreshes the acrual data.</p>

</p><p><span><span>Welcome to the Skype Community forum.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm sure, this could be annoying. Don't worry, I'll look into this for you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you're referring to your address book, technically, by&nbsp;performing a complete uninstall and reinstall of&nbsp;the application should delete your Mac address book contacts from your Skype account. However, the risk of doing this is that your Skype conversation
 might get deleted too. If you're okay with that, you may follow the instructions below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Quit Skype by selecting <strong>Skype</strong> &gt; <strong>Quit Skype</strong>.</li><li>Open your Applications folder and drag your copy of Skype to the trash.</li><li>Then open <strong>~/Library/Application Support </strong>* and drag the Skype folder to the trash. The
<strong>~</strong> sign represents your home folder. To find your home folder, open Finder and, from the menu bar, select
<strong>Go </strong>&gt; <strong>Home</strong>.</li><li>Open <strong>~/Library/Preferences</strong> and drag <strong>com.skype.skype.plist</strong> to the trash.</li><li>Open Finder and search for “Skype” using the search feature in Mac OS X. Move all of the results returned to the trash.</li><li>Click <strong>Ctrl</strong> and the trash icon, and select <strong>Empty Trash</strong>.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li><li><a href="http://www.skype.com/go/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Download and install the latest version of Skype</span></a>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>*By default, the Library folder is hidden in Mac OS X v10.7 “Lion” and higher. To find your Library folder, open Finder and, from the menu bar, select
<strong>Go</strong>, press and hold the option key, and then select <strong>Library</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you wish to keep your history, deleting your Mac contacts one by one is another option.
</span><span>Please let us know if you have questions.</span></p>
<p>

            <p>I have seen situations where MSP2013 files saved as MSP2010 or MSP2007 cannot be opened with MSP2010 or MSP2007, and it has often been caused by the original MSP2013 file being horribly messed up in some way. Does it have tasks with deadines?</p>
<p>Recently, I was sent a MSP2013 file which would not open in my MSP2010, but after my client cleaned it up on his end after several tries, finally it opened on my end.</p>
<p>Ask your client to make one very clean MSP2013 file, with just one task and one resource assigned, save that as MSP2007, send that to you and see if you can open that one. If you can, then the problem is something he has done.</p>

<p>

            <p>Thank you, Trevor and Julie, those are great suggestions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My client tried creating a clean new MP2013 file and I still could not open it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made sure that my MP2007 is updated with SP3, and have asked my client to verify they have updated with SP1. &nbsp;We'll keep trying. &nbsp;One of the other consultants with an older version also can't open the 2013 files, so it makes me think it is a problem on
 their end.</p>
