    <title>Best solution to extract timesheet data from multiple workbooks into - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wfp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best solution to extract timesheet data from multiple workbooks into one summary workbook</h2>
                    <p>I currently have 10 employee timesheets in excel. Their time is posted in&nbsp; separate WBs by Location/ Project on one tab. All employee project lists are organized differently, such that they may have worked on several of the same projects, but many are unique
 to each. I am looking for suggestions on the best solution (even if it is not the simplest) to extract the time from each employee timesheet and list it in a summary workbook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each project should be matched by row, so that the data can be analyzed by project and totaled. The current Timesheet is set up with&nbsp;4 columns. Column A is LOCATION. Column B is PROJECT. Column&nbsp;C is HOURS. Column D is OVERTIME. There is a mixture of salaried
 and hourly timesheets, so overtime counts for hourly and not for the salaried employees. There are&nbsp;several tabs in the employee timesheet WB, but only one tab contains the subject data. The timesheet WB is also a .xlsm, macro-enabled WB, if that may impact
 a proposed solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution would be performed routinely (bi-weekly), so my thoughts were to set the programming up such that it would&nbsp;extract data from that week's specific payroll folder, without having to change file names to make the programming function properly.
 Ideally, I would like to be able to push a button in the Summary Sheet/ WB and all data would be extracted and compiled from the 10+ employee workbooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure the answer or combination of solutions&nbsp;are probably out there somewhere. If so, I would appreciate some direction to the recommended solutions.</p>
<p>

            <p>There are a lot of specifics that you don't address (like ranges, names of sheets and folders, etc.) but the macro is fairly straight forward. I have assumed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The name of the subfolder you mentioned can be determined through date logic - you need to replace&nbsp;DateLogicForFolderNaming with the actual logic, and&nbsp;"yyyy-mm-dd" with the date format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) The sheet with the data in each file is named "Time", and the data starts in cell A1, and column A is completely filled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) The folders are stored in H:\TimeSheets</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) The employee name is part of the file name - which is what I am storing in column E to identify the employee</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) You want values and not formulas, and the formatting in each column is already in place.</p>

            <p>Bernie,</p>
<p>I am just now getting back&nbsp; to this. Some questions before I get too&nbsp; far.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Does the&nbsp;macro extract each employee's timesheet information and store it in separate columns in the Summary WB?</li><li>Will it match each employee's time to specific projects, so all project&nbsp;time is accounted for in 1 row? I do not recognize which piece of code may provide this function. The issue here is that each employee timesheet will have different project listings.</li><li>Also, there may be some empty rows, which I see you mentioned it assumes the columns are completely filled.</li><li>The extraction would start in Column B rather than A. (B9:E22)</li><li>Would this be easier if named ranges were created for specific data extraction?</li></ol>

            <p>This can be solved using INDEX &amp; MATCH functions as shown the screen-shot below:</p>
<p>Here in both the formulas I have assumed the data to be only till row no 5.</p>
<p>You need to change these to your last data row.</p>
<p>For example if your last data row is say 1000 then</p>
<p>the formula in cell J2 will change to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =INDEX($C$1:$I$1000,ROW(),MATCH("BIRTH*",C2:I2,0))&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and
</p>
<p>the formula in cell K2 will change to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =INDEX($C$1:$I$1000,ROW(),MATCH("FILE*",C2:I2,0))</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to then copy these formulas in respective columns up till row number 1000 (your last data row).</p>
<p>

<p>As you are travelling you will not be able to send emails from Outlook as most of the<span>&nbsp;</span>ISP does not allow outgoing emails if not on home network.</p>
<p>You may have to use that particular local service provider settings in order to send emails.</p>

<h2>            get outlook forms category and subcategory using VBA for Organizational forms library</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I'm trying to get the list of all published forms from Organizational forms library. I used the code 21.1 from Sue Mosher's book Microsoft Oultook 2007&nbsp; Programming (Folder.GetTable method), which worked fine, but I need to get the Form Category and Form
 Sub Category as well. Using Oultook Spy I have found the constants, but they aren't working for me.</p>

<p>I came across a solution with CDO, which worked fine, but was too slow.</p>

            How long has 14352 been installed? as I have found if you try hibernate before it has done housekeeping it will wake up to complete, also turn fast start up off.

<p>Right click on the video adapter and select 'Properties'</p>
<p>now under 'Drivers'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; select 'Un-install'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accept and ok it.....</p>
<p>then restart computer.</p>
<p>Let computer settle down for a round five minutes &nbsp; then check 'Device manager' again and see what the 'Display adapter' settings are again.</p>

<p>Windows should install the proper driver ...but if not, then you would need to install the driver your self&nbsp;&nbsp; by getting it from the manufacturer of your Video card/ and or the computer ....</p>
<p>unless you already have the driver disk for your own Video card or 'On board video circuit'</p>

            You may be seeing Outlook.com because your account was automatically upgraded from Hotmail. Hotmail customers who were upgraded automatically to Outlook.com were notified in advance via email.<br />
<br />
Why was my account chosen to be upgraded automatically?<br />
<br />
When we launched Outlook.com preview, we shared plans to eventually upgrade all Hotmail customers to Outlook.com. To help ensure a smooth transition, the upgrade will be gradual. Your upgrade is part of the process.<br />
<br />
<b>Can I switch back to Hotmail?</b><br />
<br />
If you were automatically upgraded to Outlook.com, the option to switch back to Hotmail isn't available.<br />
<br />
To see if you have the option to switch back, check for the Switch back to Hotmail link in Outlook.com. Go here for steps on how to check for the link.<br />
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/switch-back-hotmail<br />

Some accounts that are "co-branded" are not currently eligible to be upgraded to Outlook.com. This includes accounts that were offered through companies like Bell Canada and Telstra, as well as some MSN accounts.

This will be addressed soon, so please be patient. <br />

If you want to try it out, then I suggest creating a new email address and temporarily forwarding your old mail to the new inbox. But, keep in mind that you won't be able to "merge" these accounts later. &nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Installing &#34;Shared with Me&#34; Folders Locally from One Drive</h2>
                    I have installed OneDrive on my computer but I don't have access to any folders that are shared with me on my computer. I can only save into the folders listed within my personal One Drive files. For example, my colleague shared a folder with me and it
 only shows up in my "shared with me" link on the left side of my One Drive from the web access. When I open a file within the shared with me folder, I can't save my changes to the same document. Am I doing something wrong?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Sara &amp; Johnny,<br />
<br />
I would like to explain that Shared with me is a view rather than a folder or a library, each user can click it to see a list of the documents that other users have specifically shared with him. The files are actually stored in other user's OneDrive for Business
 library, if you cannot edit it, please check if you've been given the read only permission when another user share that file.</p>

    <title>Computer powering down after Windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keithjrn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer powering down after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have had this problem and I have viewed similar comments from others in the Community. I have found the simple solution.
</p>
<p>On the off chance I checked the&nbsp;Power&nbsp;&amp; Sleep settings. For some inexplicable reason the settings had changed during the Windows 10 upgrade. In Windows 7 I had the Power settings on "Never". When I looked at the settings it was set to Switch off monitor
 after 10 minutes of inactivity and Power down after 15 minutes inactivity. This is exactly what was happening. I have since reset the settings to Never for both monitor and power. Bingo!! It works perfectly. Windows 10 is performing brilliantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Powering up does still take longer that with Windows 7 but I can live with that.</p>

<h3> cts3806  say:</h3>
<h2>            updates for 2008 office for mac won&#39;t install</h2>
                    I'm getting a message that updates cannot be installed on my version of Office 2008. Specifically,<br />
<br />
"Office 2008 12.3.0 Update can't be installed on this disk. A version of the software required to install this update was not found on this volume."<br />
<br />
I'm instructed to look up "I can't install Office 2008 for Mac updates" at microsoft.com/mac/help.mspx. No such info is available there (because of the recent forum migration?).<br />
<br />
I'm working with Version 12.2.9 (110113), according to "about Word."<br />

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went to painstaking effort to gather all this information for myself and thought everyone else would find it helpful. &nbsp; After the multitude of failed updates to 12.0.0 and a miserable conversation with Microsoft Support for Mac who refused to respond
 to an invalid signature which they could fix: but wouldn't offer. &nbsp; Only that I should either buy Microsoft Office 2011 or 2016. &nbsp; Of course they want my money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are regulations about invalid signatures imposed by the FTC and Microsoft should really be reported to the Attorney General.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps I took and I was able to get past all the **** and update all the way to 12.3.6 which is as far as you can go. &nbsp; I was told that Office 2008 would be 'unstable' in El Capitan OS 10.11</p>
<p>

            Installing from&nbsp;the command line often works for me where double-clicking the installer won't. It may sound intimidating but it's really quite simple.
<div>
<ol>
<li>Open the Terminal application found in /Applications/Utilities.</li><li>Enter the following into the window: "<b>sudo installer -pkg</b> ". Note the trailing space.</li><li>Drag the <b>Office Installer.mpkg</b> file into the Terminal window. This will fill in the location of the file.</li><li>Finish the command with: " <b>-target /</b>".</li></ol>
<div>The whole line will look something like "<b>sudo installer -pkg /path/to/Office Installer.mpkg -target /"</b>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hit the return key and you'll be prompted for an administrator name and password. After you enter your credentials you'll see the Terminal work away. Hopefully, the last line will read something like "installed successfully".</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

<div><br />
<div>You will need a backup strategy for your data as everything will be wiped from the phone in the process.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            How to request a refund, since Skype won&#39;t allow me to merge accounts with Microsoft with a remaining balance&#63;</h2>
                    My understanding is that I can't merge my Microsoft and Skype accounts if I have a remaining credit balance. How do I request a refund for an order purchased in 2015? The automated refund request form only allows for requests on orders made in 2016 and
 2017. I haven't had any luck with the chat service. Any help is appreciated.

<h2>            Top 10 query sometimes gives more than 10 records</h2>
                    
<p>I have a form for user to chose top 10 major in different area. User select 'ON' code will generate 10 records, but select 'SG' generate more than 10 records. Only top 10 records fit my report page. More than 10 will spill to 2nd page of report which I don't
 like.</p>
<p>Here is the query that report is based on:</p>
<p>SELECT TOP 10 UCase([MajorDescription]) AS Major, Count(StudAddress.SID) AS STUDENT<br />
FROM (Major INNER JOIN StudAddress ON Major.MajorCode = StudAddress.MajorCode) INNER JOIN qryByBldg ON StudAddress.SID = qryByBldg.SID<br />
GROUP BY UCase([MajorDescription])<br />
ORDER BY Count(StudAddress.SID) DESC;</p>
<p>Here is the qryByBldg that user makes selection and above query is based on:</p>
<p>SELECT StudAddress.SID, Course.BLDG, STUDENT.SEM<br />
FROM (StudAddress INNER JOIN STUDENT ON StudAddress.SID = STUDENT.SID) INNER JOIN Course ON (STUDENT.SECT = Course.SECT) AND (STUDENT.SEM = Course.SEM)<br />
GROUP BY StudAddress.SID, Course.BLDG, STUDENT.SEM<br />
HAVING (((Course.BLDG)=IIf([forms]![frmRoster]![fraSpecial]=1,"ON",IIf([forms]![frmRoster]![fraSpecial]=2,"SG",IIf([forms]![frmRoster]![fraSpecial]=3,"RC")))) AND ((STUDENT.SEM)=[forms]![frmMainForm]![fraSemester]));</p>

<p>You are&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;use the ORDER BY clause to specify a tie breaker field.&nbsp; If you really don't care which record wins the tie, use a unique field (e.g. the primary key) or maybe a date/time field.&nbsp; Your TOP 10 query does not have enough fields to do that
 so you may be stuck mucking about in the report such as Hans described.</p>
<p>BUT, your base query might generate incorrect results.&nbsp;&nbsp;This query does not use any aggregate functions&nbsp;(Count, Sum, etc), so you should not&nbsp;have a Group By clause.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should turn off the Totals option and&nbsp;maybe(?) set the Unique Values&nbsp;property to Yes.</p>
<p>The Having clause should only have calculated fields that use an aggregate function.&nbsp; If you continue to use the Totals option (adds the Group By clause) even when you do not have any&nbsp;fields like that, then, in spite of what the stupid query designer does
 with criteria,&nbsp;you should switch to&nbsp;SQL view and change HAVING to WHERE to correct the query.</p>

<p>If there are ties for the last place, a&nbsp;"Top n" query will return all ties - it has no way to decide which one(s) should be included and which one(s) should be excluded.</p>
<p>You can force your report to include only 10 records even if the query returns more:</p>
<p>Place a text box in the Detail section.</p>
<p>Set its Visible property to No.</p>
<p>Name it txtCounter.</p>
<p>Set its Control Source to =1.</p>
<p>Set its Running Sum property to Over All.</p>
<p>Create an event procedure for the On Format event of the Detail section of the report:</p>
<p>Private Sub Detail_Format(Cancel As Integer, FormatCount As Integer)<br />
&nbsp; Cancel = (me.txtCounter &gt; 10)<br />
End Sub</p>

Just to verify, what changes have you done prior to getting this issue? Is this happening on other browsers as well? Are you using a wired or a wireless internet connection?<br />

We'll be waiting for your response.

            I've made no changes to my laptop before this issue.&nbsp; I have not yet tried other browsers, hence the question about if Chrome or Firefox are really better than IE.&nbsp; My laptop has a wired connected to the internet.

            If you rename the normal template with Word closed, all the macros it contained will be missing from the new one that Word will create when next you start it.
<br />
<br />
If the two macros then appear in the list, they are not in the normal template but some add-in or document template (relating to a document currently open). You would have to open the relevant template to remove macros it contains. If this is an add-in template
 then presumably you would have a good reason to delete its macros?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Open Excel</p>
<p>Press Alt+F11 to open the Visual Basic Editor</p>
<p>In the VBE, look in the Project Explorer pane (should be top left) for "<strong>VBAProject (PERSONAL.XLSB)</strong>".&nbsp; In (below)&nbsp;that, look for any modules containing any macros.&nbsp; If they are not there, then these macros may belong to an add-in.&nbsp; Check
 which add-ins are loaded via File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Rich</p>

<h2>            Firewall blocking of Office 2010 beta version</h2>
                    I have Vista Ultimate 64 bit with service pack 2 running and am using Microsoft Live Onecare for virus protection.&nbsp; I was able to activate the Beta version by turning off the firewall.&nbsp; However, each time I attempt to use any of the installed office products
 I receive a message that updates need to be downloaded.&nbsp; This is being blocked by the firewall.&nbsp; I cannot&nbsp;add Office or any of its components to an allow list. Outlook is blocked so I cannot sent or receive mail from my ISP unless I temporarily turn off the
 Oncare firewall.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

<br />
<div>Maybe OneCare is not compatible with Office 2010. So use the Windows firewall and Microsoft Security Essentials.</div>

    <title>Open a Report in Preview - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesjoey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open a Report in Preview</h2>
                    <p>I want to open reports in Preview from a list box that is based on a table populated with my reports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The table has 3 fields:</p>
<p>ReportID, ReportName and ReportAlias.</p>
<p>ReportAlias is the name that actiually appears in the list box and ReporName is the actual name of the report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using&nbsp;the following in the On Double Click of the list box&nbsp;to open the report but it prints the report instead of preview:</p>
<p>
</p><p>DoCmd.OpenReport Me.lstReports.Column(1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I open the report in preview mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, James</p>

            Sounds like you might have converted it to a field. What do you see if you press Alt+F9? If you see some kind of field code, then try using Ctrl+Shift+F9 to convert the text back to plain text.

    <title>Outlook capitalized the next letter after an apostrophe EVERY time. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adrianward  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook capitalized the next letter after an apostrophe EVERY time.</h2>
                    Hey there-
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm having an issue where EVERY time I use an apostrophe in Outlook for Mac (e.g., "I'm," "I'll,"), but letter immediately following the apostrophe gets capitalized (e.g., "I'll" --&gt; "I'Ll") as some sort of autocorrect malfunction (I assume). &nbsp;In addition,
 I'm no longer able to type - I'm not sure where the cursor moves (or what menu is being activated), but I just get an error "boop" sound every time I try to continue typing. &nbsp;The only solution I've found is to click where I want my next word to be, type that
 word, then go back and correct the automatically capitalized letter. &nbsp;Obviously, that's less than ideal.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anyone else had this problem? &nbsp;Does anyone know of a solution?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
<div>Adrian</div>

<p>Hi Kathy,</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback. However, currently, there is no such a feature to make users including an admin see all their alerts on all sites and subsites. We can only see alerts site by site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the situation, I invite you to <a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273492-sites-and-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
submit feedback</a> to our related team about it. Many features of the current programs have been designed and upgraded based on customers’ comments.</p>
<p>Community members who have relevant experiences are welcome to share your ideas.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Sky</p>
