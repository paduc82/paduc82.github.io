                    <p>My wife and i use each other's hotmail account for verification but when we travel, neither one of us can get into our account.&nbsp; I want to change the verification account to a g mail account that I set up but all you do is keep telling me that I have to
 enter her account and there doesn't seem to be a way to change it.</p>

            Dear Tom,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />All security information is stored in Microsoft account. In order to change veryfication email or the phone number please use tips in this support article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/...</a>
<br />
<br />Also I advise you to add your phones to each account as trusted device to list of trusted devices <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12369/microsoft-account-add-a-trusted-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12369/...</a> This should prevent from locking account when abroad.

<p>I did manage to get it changed by completely ignoring Microsoft's instructions.&nbsp; No way I could explain how I did it though as it was very convoluted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a question for you though, Am I the only one remaining in this world that does not have a Cell Phone?&nbsp; When people ask me for my cell # and I tell them I don't have one, they continually try to explain that they will not give it out or spam me
 using it.&nbsp; I have voice mail on my land line and if that is not enough, too bad.</p>

            Dear Tom,
<br />
<br />When you are going abroad and try to access your account, system checks the location and device. If those two are unfamiliar system may block access to the account due to security reasons (as it thinks that it may be compromised <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10494/microsoft-account-how-to-access-a-compromised-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10494/...</a> )
<br />
<br />In order to avoid this situation you can do the following:
<br />1. Add your device ( except phone ) to the list of trusted devices <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12369/microsoft-account-add-a-trusted-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12369/...</a>
<br />2. Enable 2step verification <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12408/microsoft-account-how-to-use-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12408/...</a> or (which is much better in my opinion) use Microsoft Authenticator app <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4026727/microsoft-account-how-to-use-the-microsoft-authenticator-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/402672...</a>
<br />3. Update security information and add your phone number <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/...</a>
<br />
<br />This should allow you to get access to your account in any location (tested myself, as I had the same problem, and as for now it works)
<br />
<br />If you are not using any devices and you are traveling and you will try to access your account, system most probably will block your account due to suspicious activity, as it would think that someone else is trying to access your account.

    <title>Outlook 2007 cannot send mail &#40;only receive&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markfrommichigan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2007 cannot send mail &#40;only receive&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Running Outlook 2007 under Windows 8. &nbsp;Worked fine until a few days ago. &nbsp;Now I can still receive most e-mail OK, however outgoing messages (from any of my 6 different email addresses at both frontier.com and gmail.com) fail every time ("0x80042109 Outlook
 cannot connect to your outgoing (SMTP) e-mail server...").</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>• Compacting my PST file</p>
<p>• Repairing my PST file using the SCANPST.EXE utility</p>
<p>• Turning off mail scanning in my Avast antivirus</p>
<p>• Repairing the Outlook 2007 installation using the original install CD</p>
<p>• Turning on SSL encryption (that just caused all my receiving tasks to fail also; didn't help the outgoing at all)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My outgoing frontier.com connections use port 587 without encryption (incoming uses port 110 with no encryption). &nbsp;My gmail connections do use SSL (ports 995 and 465), but I also can't send (and sometimes can't receive) the gmail accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't want to have to uninstall and reinstall the entire Office 2007 suite (apparently I can't do Outlook all by itself; in the Programs list all of Office is lumped together). &nbsp;I'd also rather not lose all my old e-mails. &nbsp;Help!!</p>

            <p>Hey, I finally fixed the problem!&nbsp; Apparently my DSL modem was blocking all the outgoing SMTP ports!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered this when I tried the Telnet connections from my work laptop (connecting via my home WiFi), and it failed as well.&nbsp; That finally made me realize that the problem was in my DSL connection and not in my desktop PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't remember making changes to the security settings in the modem, but I changed the setting from "Typical" to "Minimum" and now my outgoing mail works OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Diane, sorry for all the grief I put you through trying to solve this!!&nbsp; Wanted to post my final resolution so you'd have the info in case some other poor schmuck encounters the same&nbsp;problem in the future.&nbsp; Thanks for all your help!</p>

            <p>I just got a text on my phone, as well as emails to my Gmail and Outlook email addresses, with a 6-digit verification code (no other code). They all appeared at about the same time this evening. &nbsp;It sounds fishy (phishy?), and I'm concerned that it went
 to all three accounts, one of which (Outlook) is not directly connected to the other two. Thunderbird goes to the Outlook server by default each time I open it, but that should have raised any red flags, and the only other sign-in I've done at Microsoft was
 just now, to send this message.</p>

                    <p>My Hotmail account has been changed to Outlook and now every email I send has a read receipt attached to it. There is nowhere in the Options tab to turn it off. I can choose not to reply to read receipts but no other options..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read that Outlook.com does not have the option to send them so why is mine sending them? It's really hacking me off as is everything else to do with this so called 'upgrade'</p>

                    I am trying to copy Outlook files to OneDrive and for 2 of my email accounts I keep getting error 0x80070021. &nbsp;Will not let me copy to OneDrive. &nbsp;My 3rd account copied just fine. &nbsp;I am using Outlook 2010. My operating system is Win 8.1. &nbsp;Can somebody help
 with this? I am not real computer savvy so don't make it too difficult for me to understand.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello Teresa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to help us resolve this issue, please let us know the following.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the 2 accounts (from which you are not able to copy data), what are the type of email account/s you are using in Outlook 2013; i.e. POP3, IMAP, Exchange Active Sync (EAS) or Microsoft Exchange?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime you may try the following step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The possible cause for this issue is when Outlook might be running on the background even after it is closed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Close Outlook 2013 window if open. &nbsp;</li><li>Hold <strong>CTRL + SHIFT + Delete</strong>, open <strong>Task Manager</strong> &gt;
<strong>Processes</strong> &gt; <strong>Outlook.exe</strong></li><li>Right-click on Outlook.exe and select <strong>End Process</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Check if you are able to able to copy Outlook data to OneDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know the status and send us the requested information.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            The 2 accounts I can't copy are POP3. &nbsp;The 1 I could is IMAP. &nbsp;When I close Outlook and go to Task Manager, Outlook.exe is not running. &nbsp;I am using Outlook 2010, not 2013.

<h2>            IM Chat not in N8&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Nokia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an N8 now, decided to stick on with you and did make recommendations to many of my friends also. But thats when i realized that there is no IM Char in N8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that there are plenty of apps available in Ovi store for chatting. I had IM Chat in my previous Nokia, but u didn't support Gtalk, but then i learnt that u have made some improvements in IM and released new phones that supports gtalk too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when i decided to go for N8 i was sure that i'l have IM Chat with Gtalk support. But you know what, you cheated me in that. Its not that u r not supporting Gtalk, you have taken the IM Chat completely out of the Phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything is nice with N8, happy with the phone, but u have to give me my IM Chat. I am not interested in using Nimbuzz / ebuddy or any others. Just give me my IM Chat, i want to use NOKIA IM CHAT not any other chat or just let google give gtalk for Symbian
 3. i'l be ok with that too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You gotta help me with it Nokia</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a N8 as well since last Wednesday...</p>
<p>I'm very happy with the phone...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found a link explaining that Nokia Chat will come to Symbian^3 (N8)&nbsp;soon:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I little bit of patience :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You're right...&nbsp; the Nokia Chat is better than ebuddy ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used Nokia Chat on my E72 without any issues.</p>
<p>While ebuddy crashed always on my E72...</p>

<p>There isn't any!! That's why there are Apps like Nimbuzz and Fring! I don't see why you guys keep complaining!! Nokia chat was buggy and laggy even people at Beta labs admitted to that and I read one of their posts that they are working on the new one for
 S^3 so please stop asking for one! You get it when its ready! Till then use Nimbuzz which works great, I don't see why you can't use it!</p>

<p>Clearly you havent been using Ovi Chat.. Ovi chat has a lot more features then Nimbuzz. Dont get me wrong, I have been using Nimbuzz for a couples of years now and always recommended to program to many Nokia users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On day I tried&nbsp;Ovi chat on my nokia 5800 and I&nbsp;it worked like a charm. Cool features wich I cant find in Nimbuzz. Well i'm very disappointed nokia N8 isnt supporting Ovi Contacts/chat/IM.. Nokia really tricked me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday I found an installation file of Ovi contacts for N97 and I tried it. And guess what,&nbsp;it "worked" for 24 hours. It looks like nokia blocked me allready.. WHY????</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its a shame, I wouldnt recommend a Nokia to any one I know. Been using Nokia for 10 years now, but they really cant compete with other brands like Android and even Windows Phone 7 is taking a strong stand is this market......</p>

<h2>            Email marketing - Outlook.com delivery issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had been doing email marketing campaigns for almost a year now, and from time to time we are experiencing delivery problems, majorly to Microsoft-based mailboxes (outlook.com, hotmail.com, live.com, windowslive.com, etc.). We are using IBM Silverpop tools
 to send marketing emails. <br />
Here is a trimmed report, that does not contain any specific data like domains, email addresses and etc.:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1dfd9392-1f33-418f-93d4-a747b56e9105" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1dfd9392-1f33-418f-93d4-a747b56e9105" /></a></p>
<p>Some basic things we though from the start and checked:</p>
<p>1. Email list is the same in "Sent" row; Silverpop, however, trims the list itself. Question has already been sent to their support.
</p>
<p>2. This is not the only list experiencing problems. It is one of the most clear, where an error can be seen.
</p>
<p>3. SPF and DKIM entries have been placed in domain DNS and have not been changed throughout the time.
</p>
<p>As seen from the report, the problem occurs on periodic basis - sometimes it is sending fine, producing low level of bounces, and sometimes - straight opposite. We could not track down, how is it connected. Can you please have a look at the report and point
 out what can cause that kind of "floating" campaign results? <br />
<br />
Regards, </p>
<p>Oleg Vasilyev</p>

            <p>Hello, Sachin!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answering the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The question is not connected to myself, it is about delivery issues for our clients. What applications do they use is out of my knowledge, we do not gather such statistics.
</li><li>Most probably email templates have been changed prior to the issue. On another side, all of them are written with respect to the following rules and do score no more than 2 out of 4 per Silverpop engine: http://prntscr.com/c1uhdd</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, we do not receive bounce-back error messages from Silverpop, therefore currently I cannot supply you with this information. I will request it now.

<p>I had filled it for 1 of 5 of our domains. There may be more in the future. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we are making campaigns from an array of domains, how can I request for more forms? I can send a list of domains we are sending from in a private message for security reasons.

    <title>How can I create dropdown-list from a horizontal source data which is - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I create dropdown-list from a horizontal source data which is connected&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello</span>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe a similar thread has already been created, but here is what I want to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I already created a "Vertical Drop Down List for Data Validation in Excel".
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But now I want to add a horizontal drop down list for data validation which connects several rows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This means, if I select the PRODUCTNAME "Car" it Excel should add the corresponding "DESCRIPTION" and the "DETAILS" in two the following rows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Example</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><b><span>ProductName</span></b><span>: Car</span></p>
<p><b><span>Description</span></b><span>: I like cars
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Details</span></b><span>: Manual, license and an apple.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/263e038d-9f77-466e-b966-fbf34ffc77b8" />
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If I select later on one product I want the corresponding description AND the details to appear next to it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I want to avoid the if command, because I'll have to add like 1000 (!) product names.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I added a screenshot for a visual explanation.</span></p>

            <p>Well, I'm not good with tables, and there's probably a neat trick with table layouts that will do it really well.&nbsp; So, not being good with tables, I'll stick with good old VLOOKUP()</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With your dropdown on a sheet in cell B1,&nbsp; and assuming your table is over on a sheet named Ralphs Travel Service,</p>
<p>then in B2:</p>
<p>=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(B1,'Ralphs Travel Service'!B:C,2,False),"")</p>
<p>and in B3</p>
<p>=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(B1,'Ralphs Travel Service'!B:D,3,False),"")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IFERROR() should never come into play if your dropdown is getting its list of selections from column B (Product Name) of the table, but it never hurts to be safe.&nbsp; If no match is found instead of showing "#N/A!" it will simply return a blank stare.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, a litttle experimenting shows that if your table is named Table1, then this would work, for the Description field:</p>
<p>=VLOOKUP(B1,Table1[[Product Name]:[Details]],2,FALSE)</p>
<p>and for the 'details'info:</p>
<p>=VLOOKUP(B1,Table1[[Product Name]:[Details]],3,FALSE)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a couple of sites showing how to set up your data validation using a column from a table, if you want that also:</p>

<h2>            Any way to &#34;freeze&#34; or &#34;lock&#34; the location of an object on a PowerPoint slide&#63;</h2>
                    I'm using PowerPoint as a sort of "poor man's CAD" to create a layout for a small business.&nbsp; My background of the slide is a .JPG image of the shell of the building, which occupies most of the area on the slide.&nbsp; Frequently I mistakenly have this object
 "selected" when I click off other objects like walls, doors, counters, furniture, etc., even though I try to hit ESC to de-select everything.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to freeze or lock the location of an object on a single PowerPoint slide, other than to put it in the Slide Master?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            There's no easy way to lock a shape on a slide, but you could create a new slide master or just a new layout for this specific slide, put the image on the layout, then create a new slide, assign it that layout and go to town. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>This might not be the best method if you have a lot of slides to create but it'd be fine for a moderate number.</div>
<div><br />
<div>OR</div>
<div><br />
<div>You could set the background fill of a slide to be an image, make it your JPG file. &nbsp;You might have to adjust the image a bit, maybe add some background around it, but that'd also be an effective way to get the job done.</div>

<h2>            Bug - Copy-paste in Powerpoint 15.17 for Mac turns text fields read-only</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>encountering lots of new bugs since the upgrade to Office 15.17 for Mac...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example this one :</p>
<p>- create a text field on page 2 with text "Hello"</p>
<p>- copy it</p>
<p>- paste it on page 3</p>
<p>- try to modify the text to append "World" after "Hello".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Mac beeps gently but does not write anything, just like the text field was write-locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only solution is to use the quick styles shortcut, change the style of the text field, then cancel the action (Cmd-Z), then the text is yet again writable.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions to avoid that bug ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Thibault&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>edited - This bug seems to happen <em>sometimes</em>. Still hard to reproduce exactly as described above...</p>

            I tried to copy and paste a text box between slides, I assume that's what you refer to by "text field". I'm not able to reproduce your problem here, copy and paste is working normally with 15.17 under Yosemite. Are you using El Capitan?

<p>Another example this morning: I open a PPTX, click on a text to insert a word, first insert a newline (it works), and try to insert characters (it does not work).</p>

<h2>            Text box in Word won&#39;t move any farther to the left</h2>
                    So I just inserted a simple text box into Word 2013, but it's slightly indented. I.e., whereas if you start typing regular text it starts right where the hourglass in the ruler is, when typing in the box the text starts slightly to the right of the hourglass.
 So I tried dragging the text box to the left to get rid of this space, but it wouldn't move. Is there any solution to this?

            <p>If the text box is In Line With Text, it's constrained by the margins. With any other text wrapping, you should be able to drag it anywhere. But it may be that all&nbsp;you need to do is change the internal margin of the text box:</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried to check your mouse/hardware before upgrading to Build 15019 if it has been working smoothly?</li><li>Have you tried unplugging USB cables and wait for a little while for the device driver to be unloaded by Windows?</li><li>For USB wireless devices, have you tried unplugging the USB wireless receiver?</li><li>Have you tried any troubleshooting steps so far?</li></ul>
<p>

                    <p>On my test bed system, I have been able to update to 14901 and 14905. The known issues were tolerable and expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installs 14915 and 14926 have both resulted in a severely broken system. Clicking/running Start button, Cortana and any other store apps generates an Explorer.exe error window "Class not registered". This includes the Setting app and Edge. This prevents
 any "restore to previous build" via the GUI. Even tried shift-restart and attempted to run the "restore previous build", but that resulted in "no admin account" error. That is a whole another issue? Or related? So I have performed abiout 5 clean 14393 installs
 to "get the system back" to a working build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is the way things sometime go with beta/Insider releases in the fast lane, but this is now getting serious. I know I should have performed backupups, so don't even start with that. I have been beta testing since Win95 (gold CD to prove it). I
 now have to spend time to do yet another clean install on the test bed since this is the method it will be deployed to the masses. I have 4 other test systems that will not see 14915, 14926 or any other insider build until it clears the test bed system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try a clean 14926 install and see how that goes.</p>

            Those are not general issues with the current builds.&nbsp; It sounds more like local computer issues.&nbsp; You can try a clean install, but you can also try a repair install since that should also fix the issues.&nbsp; Just a note, the "masses" will not receive a clean
 install.&nbsp; That would wipe out everyone's files.&nbsp; The method will be an update install.&nbsp;

            First thing I noticed is the 3rd party software as posted many times that 3rd party Virus type programs may cause problems when installing Beta upgrades, my suggestion is to remove such programs then do the upgrade and reinstall them as I haven't had any
 issues upgrading my systems as I don't use any of the 3rd party on my Preview systems.

            <p>No no no... You miss understood, or I misspoke, whichever. I meant that I will clean install 14393. Set it up as insider system. Then allow the upgrade to 14926. This test will be without any "3rd Party" software.&nbsp; But, this is not a strange 3rd party software
 setup.&nbsp;It is a more real world scenario.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bigger issue is&nbsp;not the fact that it bricked&nbsp;the OS (but, this is a pretty big issue by itself), the bigger issue is NOT being able to perform a rollback! This is the more critical issue here folks. This will be
 a uuuuge problem if it is not fixed before the public release!</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, 14926 preview was a downloaded via WU on a fresh 14393. That was the method for both 14915 and 14926.&nbsp; The clean installs of 14393 were done with the ESD2ISO resulting DVD.&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi Pawel,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you mentioned, you are using older version of Office because you use EndNote X7, I’ll suggest you upgrade both Office for mac to version 16.9 and EndNote X8.2. Word
 v16.9 has compatibility issues with EndNote X7 and to resolve this issue, EndNote team released a latest version which is compatible with the Word V16.9.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
 Microsoft Word 2016 Mac version 16.xx Users!</span></a></span></p>

<h2>            remove the &#34;GET THE NEW OFFICE&#34; popup when I start office</h2>
                    I'm not ready to upgrade to the new version of office. However, every time I start an application I get this popup that blocks part of my screen. &nbsp;Is there anyway to disable it from happening? &nbsp;I already disabled automatic updates after this happened,
 but it hasn't gone away.

            Thanks for the suggestion, but I believe this won't fix my problem. &nbsp;After the notice appeared on someone's computer I disabled automatic updates, but the notification that pops up when they start the program is still there
