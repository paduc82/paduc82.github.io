<h2>            Account recovery.  Can&#39;t remember username</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I registered for a outlook.com email account when they were first rolled out. (Years ago)&nbsp; But can't remember exactly the username.&nbsp; I am sure it was either one of two I would have chosen.&nbsp; (I'm sure of this because I missed out on getting a Gmail username
 I wanted)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried going through the password recovery routine but it fails to send the verification code to the recovery address that I was also pretty sure of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never got around to using the account until now.&nbsp; But can't get in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is there a human that can take a look at the account and ask me a few questions that might get me access?</strong>&nbsp;The online recovery system just sent me the usual "<span>Unfortunately, our automated
 system has determined that the information you provided was not sufficient for us to validate your account ownership."</span></p>
<p>They would be able to tell I was the owner if they took a look at the log files and account details, I'm sure.&nbsp; Maybe I entered a typo when I registered?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Steve</p>

<h2>            Office 2016 continually signs me off of all Office Apps and will also sign me off when attempting to perform add-ins such as a dictionary. in Word</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">I have had this problem in the past before I had to reformat my PC and I think that it was resolved then by a
 registry tweak. Periodically when I am working in Word, Excel, Publisher, etc., I notice the little yellow triangle up at the top letting me know that I have been signed out of that particular Office application. Similarly, if I try and add a dictionary via
 the "define" method within the body of a document, it signs me out and states, "...trouble connecting to the office store to help you get a free premium dictionary. Please try again later." When I try and log back in, it does it again. In Word, if I try and
 use the "Insert, Store or My Add-ins" functionality, it does the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">I have tried to remove the accounts from Credential Manager. I have removed the the entries under the identities
 in the registry. I have used the uninstall tool and reinstalled Office. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks</span></p>

<p>Thanks for getting back to me. I ran the tool independently with Word and it had me install some updates. I then proceeded to run it with a few more apps and I installed those updates as well. After completing this, I rebooted my computer and re-scanned
 the system with those same apps and it said "No issues detected". I attempted to add a dictionary again and I was challenged to sign in again using the "Insert, Store" option and also using the "Synonyms, Thesaurus, Get a Dictionary" option. When I try to
 get a dictionary, sometimes I am immediately logged out and give the "...trouble connecting to the office store to help you get a free premium dictionary. Please try again later. " response or I manage to get to the actual option screen and can choose a dictionary
 and the response is "We're having trouble connecting to the Office Store to help you get a free or premium dictionary. Please try again later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure where to go from here. Thanks</p>

            <p>This problem with logging me out of apps while using them or when launching the apps periodically still exists. The issue with adding a dictionary still exists however I did find an alternate means of adding a dictionary to MS Word. I searched for the Merriam
 Webster dictionary by searching "merriam webster dictionary add-in for ms word" and one of the search finds was "https://store.office.com/en-001/app.aspx?assetid=WA102925879&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-001&amp;ad=US&amp;appredirect=false" and I got the Dictionary Merriam Webster
 Free add-in and that worked to get the dictionary loaded.</p>
<p>The issues now are I am still not able to add other add-ins from the application and also the problem with all MS Office 2016 apps logging me off.</p>

<p>Hello Doug. Thanks for replying. First of all, I generally launch Word or Excel from a Quick Launch icon on the task bar or by opening up an actual document by double clicking on it. Other applications such as OneNote or Publisher, I start from either the
 Start screen or actually from the Start menu.</p>
<p>When I say that they log me off, I will notice periodically that where my name sits in the upper right hand corner of the screen, I will get a yellow triangle with an exclamation point in it. When I click on my name it states" ACCOUNT ERROR Sorry we can't
 get to your account right now. To fix this, please sign in again" and then it prompts me with a link to sign back in again. This happens multiple times whenever I am using one of the applications. For example, tonight I was working on a document for about
 an hour and I noticed on four occasions that the yellow triangle was up there and I proceeded to sign back in again. I don't know how long the triangle was up there before I noticed it each time.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is any other information that you feel may help.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Charles</p>

<p>Doug,</p>
<p>Attached are examples of what is happening. Each time I try and add an add-on, any/all of the MS apps sign me out. As you can see, it prompts me to sign back in to add a dictionary to Word, or a report developer to Excel, and so forth. This is what I meant
 when I said that it logs me out.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Hi Doug...</p>

</p><p>I am not completely understanding what you are referring to. When I select the Add-ins icon on the ribbon under Developer, this is what I get. Any further clarification would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I build a PC from scratch to which a friend gave me a copy of his Windows&nbsp;7 Ultimate 32bit where of course I got a 30day trial. I then therefore paid for a legitimate key of Windows 8.1 Pro 32/64bit and downloaded the installer
 which I realised didn't give me the option to move to 64bit. I have tried using the installer to put it on USB and boot from BIOS to it, yet still no option to update to 64bit. I then tried to burn the ISO on a DVD+RW where the process failed(all using Microsoft
 software). I'm currently previewing Windows 10 and would like to know if there is any way for my to change to 64bit(I know I will loose all data and software) or is my only option to wait for the official Windows 10 release and buy the DVD?

<h2>            MS Project Remaining Work Issue</h2>
                    <p>I am using MS project 2016 and would like to export information to excel showing the remaining work (hours) of each resource for each month remaining. I am required to report remaining work in this way to our management team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be done for 'work' but doesn't take into account the associated % complete of the work performed on each task.</p>
<p>

<p>DamianASmith,</p>
<p>You don't say exactly how you are exporting the data to Excel but you could export monthly actual work along with monthly work and then subtract the former from the latter to get the monthly remaining work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Points increase for rewards&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I'm usually a gold level member on Bing Rewards. I was looking at my account today and saw I had 5xx points and thought I could redeem them for my usual $5 Starbucks card or $5 Amazon card. However, when I looked at the rewards section, to my surprise
 I saw that now the $5 gift cards are 2,5xx points?! What the heck did I miss? Can anyone explain? Thanks!</p>

<p>I don't know of any software that does this automatically.&nbsp; You can do it manually.&nbsp; Rightclick the embedded object, there should be an Excel Object or similar item on the pop up menu; choose that then Open.</p>
<p>When the Excel file opens, save it whereever you like.</p>
<p>Or at least in some circumstances, you can try this:</p>
<p>Save your presentation to a new filename</p>
<p>Add .ZIP to the end of the file name</p>
<p>Doubleclick to open the file and look within for Excel files.</p>
<p>Drag them to any convenient location.</p>

<p>No PPT files actually; but since you have PPT 2010, save as PPTX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any of the new PPTX, PPSX, PPTM, etc. file formats are really zip files and can be renamed and opened as a zip to get at the innards.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Try this snippet. It works for PPT 2007/2010. You can adapt it for earlier versions.&nbsp;When you open the extract&nbsp;excel files in Excel you may need to unhide the window for the workbook.</p>
<p>Sub ExtractXLObjects()<br />
Dim sld As Slide<br />
Dim shp As Shape<br />
Dim obj As Object</p>
<p>For Each sld In ActivePresentation.Slides</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each shp In sld.Shapes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If shp.Type = msoEmbeddedOLEObject Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debug.Print shp.OLEFormat.ProgID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If InStr(1, shp.OLEFormat.ProgID, "Excel.Sheet.12") = 1 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set obj = shp.OLEFormat.Object<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call obj.SaveAs("c:\temp\" &amp; obj.name &amp; ".xlsx")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoEvents<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />

            Steve, this was a brilliant insight -- how did you figure this out???<br />
<br />
I just used this approach to solve a really bad "Switcher" problem I've been having -- when Win7 colleague send me .XLS files with embedded files, I simply cannot open or view them on my Mac.<br />
<br />
Below is the solution. Posting in the hopes that others will find this useful.<br />
<br />
-ZB<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Holy Moly, I just figured out a solution!<br />
<br />
I'll do some experimenting to figure out if this work with other file combinations, but I found a thread talking [This is to you Steve!] about this and it worked!<br />
<br />
Problem:<br />
- Colleague sends me a .XLS which has an embedded .PDF on one sheet<br />
- Office: Mac 2011 will not open the .PDF because of lack of OLE support<br />
<br />
Solution:<br />
- Copy the .XLS file to a new file<br />
- Rename the file from &lt;filename.xls&gt; to &lt;filename.zip&gt;<br />
- Open the .ZIP with Archive Utility<br />
- Browse into the resulting "decompressed" folder to filename&gt;xl&gt;embeddings<br />
- Find the file of interest, named something like &lt;oleObject2.bin&gt;<br />
- Rename to &lt;oleObject.pdf&gt;<br />
<br />
VOILA! The PDF is recovered in its fully glory.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; Wait.&nbsp; *Zaphod's* this guy. Hey, that's you!&nbsp; ;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS has documented the internals of the new Office XML files pretty well; they explain that they're really zip files.
</p>
<p>I'm surprised that this works with XLS (rather than XLSX) files and that the PDF is stored internally as a PDF rather than with some kind of OLE wrapping. But hey, if it works, it works, and thanks for letting us all in on the trick.</p>

    <title>Import Contacts to Skype for Business Online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Import Contacts to Skype for Business Online</h2>
                    <p>My company is gonna deploy skype for business online (cce). We have an On Premise Exchange 2016 Server.<br />
We will shut down our old PBX.<br />
<br />
Is there a chance to get our contacts in Skype for Business, when we import the contacts with a .csv-file to our Exchange 2016 Server?<br />
<br />
If we would get Office365 and Bulk-import them to Exchange Online - would the imported contacts be available for the Skype for Business Onlne users? And could we import them to a group for the whole company?<br />
<br />
With UCS, there is a Read-Only folder with Skype for Business Contacts, in which u can't import some personal contacts...<br />
<br />
What would be the possibility to import users to Skype for Business Online? Or does Skype for Business Online only use existing Exchange online contacts?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your quick help to my questions!</p>
<p>regards</p>

            Hi Fabio,<br />
<br />
After running the test, you do need to get Exchange Online so you can bulk add contacts via adding a distribution group or an Office 365 group in Skype for Business. Moreover, the steps mentioned in my first reply are just for internal users, external contacts
 added in a distribution group will not show up in the distribution group in Skype for Business client based on my further test.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks,<br />
Sam<br />

<p>You have a trial version of MS Office which requires a different key than the one on the bottom of your laptop, which is for Windows 7 activation only.</p>
<p>You need to purchase Microsoft Office or a product key. Purchase a Product Key from Microsoft Store:<br />

<p>Personally I would buy not just a key but the retail box (which includes a key). Should you ever need to reinstall Office the boxed version includes the media.</p>

<p><strong>v=spf1 ip4:10.10.10.1/16&nbsp; mx ptr:Sender.domain.com </strong><br />

            You posted your question in the MyPhone area of the forum.&nbsp; However, based on the way you asked your question, I am getting the feeling you are NOT using the MyPhone service as a means to backup your data but rather you had deleted your contacts by removing
 a partnership on your device (and/or PC).&nbsp; If you removed the partnership, your Contacts should STILL be in Outlook on your PC (as long as you use Outlook).&nbsp; Is that the case?

                    I have found the if you use the media tool for upgrading Windows and make it as usb stick you can upgrade or clean install both Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Professional from the same media. Just make certain you follow the prompts correct when you create
 the usb and do the upgrades. Rufus is not necessary.&nbsp;

    <title>How can I substitute these formula numbers to reference first visible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nidenikolev  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I substitute these formula numbers to reference first visible cell, not an actual number&#63; &#91;VBA&#93;</h2>
                    <p>I have code in VBA to filter column F to "X" values and then go to column AS and select the first visible cell:
</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><code><span>PS_WS</span><span>.</span><span>Range</span><span>(</span><span>"F:F"</span><span>).</span><span>AutoFilter Field</span><span>:=</span><span>6</span><span>,</span><span>

</span><span>&amp;</span><span> Rows</span><span>.</span><span>Count</span><span>).</span><span>End</span><span>(</span><span>xlUp</span><span>).</span><span>Row

</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"" &lt;=== this is where I need a formula</span></code></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the .formula part I don't know how to input this formula (=AR2-AX2) because the row number won't be row 2, it'll be starting at the first visible row after autofiltering. How do I replace the numbers after AR and AX&nbsp;to reference the first visible cell
 in that calculation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(E.g. AR(first visible cell) - AX(first visible cell) would be the formula I'm looking for))</p>

            You can not, resp. Excel can not do that because the areas can not be contiguous.
<br />
<br />But in VBA it is easy to convert the formulas to values, because the Range object has a Areas collection and you can use the Value property.
<br />
<br />So if we assume that Where refers to the visible cells:
<br />
<br /><pre><code>  Dim Area As Range
  For Each Area In Where.Areas
    Area.Value = Area.Value
  Next</code></pre>

    <title>Why is my BRAND NEW laptop downloading so slow&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why is my BRAND NEW laptop downloading so slow&#63;</h2>
                    I just purchased a brand spankin new Hp pavillion Dv6-3019wm, so there are no viruses, only a ton of bloat ware that I have since uninstalled. The lap top came with Windows 7 pre-installed on it. The only problem I am having with it is that my download
 speed on google chrome, and IE is extremely slow. I did an online speed test, and it clocked in at a mere 0.65 Mbps. My previous laptop, with windows vista ran at 10 mbps. So I know that it isnt my router, or internet connection. And yes, my router is compatible
 with Windows 7, I have just checked. &nbsp; &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So far I've done the following:</div>
<div><span>-Cleaned the registry</span><br />
<span>-Updated drivers</span><br />

<div><span><span>And still.... No dice.
 Has anyone else had this problem, and resolved it? Any input will be GREATLY appreciated. &nbsp;This is extremely&nbsp;frustrating, to the point where I wish I had just stuck with my old vista.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

    <title>Access database locks up when trying to add or delete a record through - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skipper25  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access database locks up when trying to add or delete a record through vba code</h2>
                    <p>I converted a Access 2002 db and its linked data to 2007.&nbsp; There was Access 2002 on the computer prior to upgrading to 2007.&nbsp; Both databases (mdb and accdb )work OK on 2007 on this computer.&nbsp; When the databases (both versions)&nbsp;are copied to another computer
 that has only had 2007 loaded, the databases do not work properly.&nbsp; On one form (add/change/delete) the initial entry is checked in code for duplicates and displays messages asking for confirmation to add.&nbsp; A message comes up for adding, but&nbsp;screen locks.&nbsp;I
 have to kill Access from the Task Manager.&nbsp; On another form I can add data.&nbsp; A picture of a lock with a 1 in it displays&nbsp;when data is entered in each control, but the record is created.&nbsp; To delete the record I call it up in&nbsp;combo box and select the delete
 button (VBA). It displays a message which freezes the form.&nbsp; I can exit the form.&nbsp; If I insert a break in the code and step through it the record will delete.&nbsp; There are no missing references and&nbsp;it compiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed the program and database on a couple of computers with 7/64 bit and XP without problems.&nbsp; The computer that it doesnot work on has&nbsp;the Home Premium version of 7 64 bit.&nbsp; Is that the problem maybe?&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>No, the version and bitness of Windows has very little to do with how well Access behaves.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry for taking so long to reply, but I've been trying more things to get this to work. &nbsp;The decompile didn't do anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created an empty/virgin database for the prog and the data, and then imported the objects and the data respectively from the
 better and done this at the beginning -- after all -<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>It's Microsof</strong></span>t.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tom, if anyone else is having this problem, with 2007, 10, 13, etc., starting with an MT might be the way to go.</p>

    <title>Legitimate email from my SaaS is put in Junk folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joey_gnarf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Legitimate email from my SaaS is put in Junk folder &#40;outlook.com&#47;live.com&#47;hotmail.com&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting complaints from my clients that email they send out to outlook.com/live.com/hotmail.com addresses using my SaaS is being put in the Junk email folder. I could succesfully replicate this issue. I am quite
<strong>not amused</strong> by this. The emails are fine, the headers are fine, and according to Microsofts own Mesage Header Analyzer there's no issue at all (confidence lvl 1, verdict NSPM, bulk complaint 0 and phishing confidence lvl 0)! And of course the
 sending IPs are not on any blacklists. SPF is set up as it should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My clients send out important emails to their customers and these legitimate emails being put in the Junk folder is causing problems. Having the customers of my clients manually add my clients email addresses to the safe senders list is not an option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can this problem be resolved? Can I whitelist my submitting host for these Microsoft accounts?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for a swift solution!</p>

<p>Hello Joey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are possible reasons why you're experiencing this issue with the emails in Outlook. It may be caused by the Policies for the account. For more information regarding the Policies and Guideline, kindly check this
<strong><a href="https://mail.live.com/mail/policies.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly fill out the form provided on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/getsupport?oaspworkflow=start_1.0.0.0&amp;wfname=capsub&amp;productkey=edfsmsbl3&amp;ccsid=635688189955348624&amp;wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>
 to whitelist the host. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep us updated for us to provide more help. </p>

<p>I am not personally experiencing this issue, the customers of my customers are, the ones who use the stated Microsoft mail services. As far as I can tell the mails my systems send out are in compliance with policies. Since the Message Header Analyzer (and
 simply going over the headers line by line) gives no insight into where the problem lies, I have nothing to go on and no possible issue to address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, whitelisting my IP would most likely solve the problem. I've requested whitelist for sending to hotmail.com, live.com, msn.com and outlook.com. Hopefully this will suffice. Do you have any idea how long processing a request for whitelisting
 takes?</p>

<p>"Microsoft had it 3 times and it still doesn't work" - Microsoft who?&nbsp;Microsoft doesn't deal with repairs in the UK. so i'm not sure who you've sent the device to and what was their response. again "still doesn't work" doesn't mean much.</p>

<p>Hi Monger Robert,</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Generally speaking, when you viewing Address Book or when creating a New Email and then clicking Address Book in Outlook client, the yellow dots will not persists in the Global Address List. Like below picture:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
