</blockquote>
<p><br />
"Not able to click anything" because you can't see anything clickable?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is your keyboard working?&nbsp;&nbsp; Many users see a "black" screen in this situation and can then just use their keyboard to work around it.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. the simplest action that I can think of would
 be&nbsp; Win-P, CursorUp, Enter.&nbsp;&nbsp; See if that changes anything?&nbsp;&nbsp; If you had a second monitor to attach to your machine you might see more.&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW I agree with the suggestion to get help from where you bought your new machine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another related factor to consider I think is that your boot options are probably UEFI.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, I'm wondering if that could be why you see blue instead of black?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm
 still using straight BIOS, so UEFI is only a theoretical consideration for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; )</p>

            I think that this might be related to the issue I had. That sounds to me like a blank start screen.
<div><br />
<div>After installing the most recent updates, when I search for anything it makes the start screen go blank. None of the search results are displayed; all of the tiles disappear. Even if I exit the search or go back to the desktop and then hit the start button
 everything is gone. However, if I search for something that doesn't exist (or at least use a search that doesn't return any apps such as zzz), then the search results properly display, the tiles come back and then I can search for the app that I was originally
 looking for just fine. However, it took me quite a while to figure out how to get this to work. For a while it just seemed like the apps were appearing and disappearing randomly.<br />

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>noticed recently that I have MSI(some numbers).tmp (they are not affecting my experience on my pc) on my D hard drive</p>
<p>Googled it up and I saw they were Microsoft Installers, for some reason I don't have acces to the maps, I first need to click on get acces and than I can open/delete them but its very annoying because I can't find my own maps and programs, my pc up to date,
 I did a reset, and searched the almost the whole internet, can somebody help me pls?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps: they are not from a program I install everything in maps</p>
<p>Pss: i don't really need to delete them but can I simply let them go in a special map or something</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me soon :)</p>

<p>Your post is confusing because I can't figure out what you mean by the word "maps". How can you install stuff "in maps"? How can one possibly let these tmp files "go in a special map"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, Windows Installer is known to randomly create such temporary folders even on non-system partitions (I don't know why it should ever touch those), and sometimes leaves them behind when it's interrupted or simply forgets to clean up after itself. Poor
 coding, no doubt. I just take ownership of the files/folders if required and get rid of them. Doesn't happen often enough that's it's a huge issue for me.</p>

            <div>Hi Tiki26,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- What's the make and model of your printer?</div>
<div>- Were you able to print without any issues earlier?</div>
<div>- If&nbsp;yes, do you remember making any changes to your computer before this problem started to occur?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span>Mostly, this error can be caused by two factors:</span></p>
<p><span><span>· </span></span><span>Runtime components of Visual C++ Libraries are missing.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Conflict with other software installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Try these methods to fix the error message.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Scenario 1: </span></strong><span>Reinstall the runtime components of Visual C++ Libraries to resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Download the latest runtime components from the link below. Please check the system requirements before installation.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a7b7a05e-6de6-4d3a-a423-37bf0912db84&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)</a></span></strong></p>
<span>
<p><span><strong>Scenario 2: </strong><span>If the issue still persists after installing the above package, it could be due to software problem. Perform clean boot to check whether it is a software conflict issue.</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s&nbsp;an article you may refer to, for steps with reference to the same.</span></p>

    <title>laptop no longer connects to home wifi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> really frustrated mom  say:</h3>
<h2>            laptop no longer connects to home wifi</h2>
                    <p>My son's Dell laptop will no longer connect to our home wifi. It is just under a year old, and worked just fine until about a month ago. Other devices (other Windows 7 laptop, Windows 8 desktop, xbox) connect without issues. It is a Dell Inspiron N7110 running
 Windows 7 Home Premium, Service Pack 1. The laptop detects the network and says that signal strength is&nbsp; either "good" or "excellent", yet it seems to get stuck in the process of connecting, cycling between saying&nbsp;"connecting" and "limited access" next to
 the network name.&nbsp; At the top of the connection window, it says Currently connected to:&nbsp;<strong> Identifying...(network name)</strong>&nbsp; followed by
<strong>No network access</strong>.&nbsp; I have tried running the troubleshooter, and resetting the network adapter, but this has not solved the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Movie Maker - can&#39;t save my movie</h2>
                    <p>I made a 30 second video for school and I can't save it in any format...If I click send via email or facebook or literally try to save the movie in any way this is what happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p>click save option "recommended for this project" (for example)</p>
<p>Save to desktop as a MPEG video file</p>
<p>"Saving movie" bar comes up but never progresses for hours....stays at 0</p>
<p>I click "cancel"</p>
<p>It says "Windows Movie Maker has stopped working"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone told me that I have to finalize the project...Like it's still in edit mode essentially and she said I have to click "finish project" before it will save but I don't see an option for this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please can someone assist me. I have to send it to my prof by tomorrow :S</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Because it wasn't mentioned, what was the VIDEO format you are/were working with?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker-file-types-faq&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't tried already, try converting the video to WMV before using it in Windows Movie Maker.<br />
WMV is Microsoft's video format, Windows Movie Maker should handle the WMV just fine. Finding a proper codec is optimal because you don't have to do any conversion before using video clips in Windows Movie Maker; saving time— but converting video before using
 it in Windows Movie Maker usually is a logical and stable option.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Freemake Video Converter is one of the most recommended video converters for assisting users converting their SOURCE videos to WMV. Freemake Video Converter is extremely easy to use, but there's some 'opt-out' software bundled with the installer that makes
 user nervous. I've created a post to illustrate the process of the download of the application, the installation step-by-step, explaining which options are optional. I have also provided some screenshots on just how easy it is to convert your video(s) to WMV.</p>

            <p>In the Windows Movie Maker world, the WLMP file is a project file; it's not a video file that can be played. The project file [text file] simply tells Windows Movie Maker were all the media resources are and what special effects are being used [when and
 where] in the video project. You can't convert this file to video.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You want to convert the SOURCE video you are working with to WMV. File you had before you imported it in to Windows Movie Maker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you convert, drop it in to Windows Movie Maker; re-edit and export.</p>

            I see what you mean, but even if I make a blank movie maker file with no videos it still only saves as a wlmp that can't be converted. So regardless if I convert the videos I used (Which I did on my webcam) the file as a whole will still be a wlmp...<br />

            <p>Windows Movie Maker has the ability to <strong>SAVE PROJECT</strong> and <strong>
SAVE MOVIE</strong>. </p>
<ul>
<li>Saving&nbsp;PROJECT saves the text file, the project file [.WLMP] allows you to save your progress, re-open a project, make changes/effects and export your video.
</li><li>Saving&nbsp;MOVIE, exports the current project you're working on as either a WMV or MP4 [your choice].
</li></ul>

            <p>Yes; and in the composition phase of the movie project, you have to import the source video (and music).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">My suggestion from previous was to convert your

 many hours I spent trying to get this thing to work. Finally!<br />

            <p>I'm Glad to help...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But noting that the direction we took was solely predicated on the point that you were working with a deadline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the future, I would think since you are working with Windows Movie Maker and technically it's supposed to work; I'd like to make the recommendation you load a codec pack to address your issue with source video being MP4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Movie Maker is a basic video editing package, but all the video formats it's supposed to support, the application doesn't support those standard video formats until you load the proper codecs. This isn't an end all be all solution, but it's important
 to mention when dealing with Windows Movie Maker; it doesn't support all the [listed] video formats right out of the gate. It's also important to note that installing system updates and other software, or reinstalling Microsoft Windows Essentials can derail
 Windows Movie Makers ability to handle certain video types; it's just the nature of the beast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation of the K-Lite Codec pack isn't complicated. Here's a link to the illustrated [screenshots] process of the installation for K-Lite, with the download link.</p>

<h2>            Laptop slow out of the box</h2>
                    <p>So I got a Lenovo ideapad 330-15IGM back in July, and ever since I started using it, it's been pretty slow. I've tried updating things including BIOS, I've scanned for viruses, I've tried decreasing visual effects, but it's still slow. Sometimes when I go
 to task manager, the disk usage is at 100. Sometimes disk usage goes down and CPU usage rises, and then it keeps switching back and forth.</p>

<h2>            Graphic Card issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I just upgraded to Windows 10. It is working fine but the major issue I am facing is that when I enable my graphic card and restart the windows it gets stuck on the black screen with a mouse cursor flickering.
</p>
<p>With all the help of forums and support, I tried to update the graphic card but after the restart it gives me an error 0x80246002. I even tried to download the graphic card driver again but no use. If someone can help...</p>

            <p>Open the strat menu and then the mail app. &nbsp;If you have logged into windows 10 with your hotmail account your emails will be shown there. &nbsp;I find the mail app works just fine (one minor issue but working on that). Or log into your mail account via the web

            I agree entirely, I hate windows 10, my printer stops working every time I log on to windows 10, I can't find anything. I want a laptop not a mobile phone. Dislike the layout hugely, where has my tools menu gone, I am changing my laptop shortly and I will
 insist that there is no Windows on the new one&nbsp;I want internet explorer 10&nbsp; to download but I can not find that either. When I search for it all I get is WINDOWS 10. I don't want it, take it away. Frankly I do not care what anyone else thinks or says about
 my comments I would like to make my own choices not have&nbsp;Windows 10 pushed on me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><strong>Rolling back to win 8 will not return your Hotmail.&nbsp; </strong>The Hotmail interface is gone long ago replaced by outlook.com.&nbsp; In fact rolling back may thwart any chance you have to recover your mail.</p>

            <p>Dear Microsoft engineer,</p>
<p>I would like my laptop back please. The upgrade to windows 10 has been an absolute disaster. What once was a pretty fast machine has now become unusable. Everything is slow and I mean everything. Even edge times out trying to connect to webpages, my gmail
 dies not render properly. Thanks for nothing, no wait, less than nothing. I am off to the apple store and suspect I will never be returning to windows unless you can provide a remedy such as reverting back to my unloved but at least usable windows 8.</p>

<h2>            Taskbar and Alt Tab Flicker</h2>
                    Hey there,<br />
<br />
I recently built a new PC with Windows 7 Ultimate 64 Bit.<br />
<br />
When I hover over my task bar, the little preview thumbnails just flicker a little. If I right click on a task bar icon then hover over the icons, the previews work as they should.<br />
<br />
Also when I alt tab, the alt tab window exhibits the same problem.<br />
<br />
I'm running two AT HD5850s in a CrossFireX configuration.

    <title>Windows Update in Windows 10 not showing avaliable driver updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ph0b0s123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update in Windows 10 not showing avaliable driver updates</h2>
                    <p>So pretty much as the title says. I was under the impression that Windows 10 would show all available hardware driver updates&nbsp;available when you get it to check for updates, or just install them automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On multiple machines, windows update says my system is up to date, but if you fire up the Microsoft tool to hide updates, it shows a load of driver updates are available. I can go into device manager and prompt the device to look for updates and update it
 that way, but it is pretty inconvenient to have to check in the hide update tool periodically and then manually do updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I though it might be to do with something I had installed, so on a laptop I have, I did a clean installed windows 10. All I have done is let it install all the updates it can, until is says my machine is update, otherwise I have change no settings from default.
 Still there are a load of driver updates that are not showing in windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here&nbsp;are the build version details of the clean install in my laptop:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6a7bb1d-f910-4e35-b734-6a16ddd7c3d9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6a7bb1d-f910-4e35-b734-6a16ddd7c3d9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the updates that windows update has found and installed, one is even a driver?!:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc50207f-7ae3-4ade-b5d4-10ca0c92b41f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc50207f-7ae3-4ade-b5d4-10ca0c92b41f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here shows that even when manually told to check, windows update says that are no updates available:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff1cd3ef-7562-4518-a43b-0b7224d5f499" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff1cd3ef-7562-4518-a43b-0b7224d5f499" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But in the hide update tool, here are all the devices on my system that have updates available. So it found and installed a intel gpu driver, but not the Nvidia driver?!:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b698bf6d-c7f4-42da-83b2-3934b5144001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b698bf6d-c7f4-42da-83b2-3934b5144001" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And here is the setting that I believe allows you to turn off getting driver updates via windows update if you like and that mine is enabled:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55b2a87c-3eb6-425c-b423-23b58f84a124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55b2a87c-3eb6-425c-b423-23b58f84a124" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said this is happening on multiple machines for mine, but is even more of a concern that this does not work even after a clean install. Is my understanding of how driver updates through windows 10 work wrong? Or did Microsoft change how this works in
 one of the recent updates to stop automatic driver installation because it was annoying people? Or is this part of Windows 10 broken?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>This seems to be a fairly basic thing that is not working. Updates are being pushed at people whether they like it or not. Is it too much to ask to get all the avaliable updates pushed? If some are left out does that not defeat the point of taking the option

<p>
</p><p>Agreed. As I'm progressing through a career in IT, I'm developing anxiety to an extent that surprises me when I look back at it, and Windows Update has been a major contributor to it. Why do two Microsoft update tools (the settings app's Windows Update page
 and the Show / Hide Updates tool) show two different results of available updates? Why does the latter not have a multi-select and install option? Why is Windows Update in Windows 10 so brutally worse than Windows Update in XP? Even Vista didn't suck this
 bad. As a somewhat industry leader, I'd hope Microsoft's future UX designs will factor in users' and administrators' mental health, and reduce the brain damage caused by repeatedly banging my head on my keyboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm troubleshooting a family member's computer issue, where Windows Update is replacing a working graphics driver with a broken driver, which is what led me to the Show / Hide Updates tool, but the driver isn't listed to hide. It's listed in update history
 as successfully installed, but not listed under updates that can be uninstalled. I've used the Rollback Driver button in the Device Manager (is that new? it's promising), which worked, surprisingly enough, it rolled back to the working version, but then Windows
 Update replaced it again. At this point, I added the regkey to exclude driver updates from Windows Quality Updates, and saved the working version of the driver installer on his computer so he can reinstall it when it gets replaced... neither are great solutions.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Taskbar Quick Launch will not hold settings... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edsacks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar Quick Launch will not hold settings...</h2>
                    Taskbar / Quick Launch will not hold settings on next boot. That means when I adjust the top margin of the taskbar and the right "gripper" margin, when I reboot, the settings are lost and default to what is already in stuckrects2. I have found some of
 the stuckrects2 settings, but I need more. Or, I'd like to know what registry setting locks-prevents write back of explorer/shell to the registry at shut down.. I know that the taskbar is held in RAM memory until I exit. This means that windows will not/cannot
 write back to stuckrects32. I rather would like to know which words/bits are involved in setting the right margin and what the codes are to specify the right margin position.I have the settings for the top of the taskbar (number of rows high in task bar).
 This has, as far as I can tell, NOTHING to do with hide/not hide/auto hide/lock etc. I know that there are numerous other registry keys that could be involved, but I have yet to find the key(s) or the dex/hex settings for key values. Anybody got a list of
 the values for each of the 40 stuctrects2 bytes (words)? Thanks<br />

            This problem is SOLVED.<br />
This settings reside in HK_current_user\software\microsoft\\windows\currentversion\explorer\streams\desktop\taskbarwinxp.<br />
<br />
As a test, I had exported the test account taskbarwinxp to a holding directory while in test account. When I rebooted into my regular account, and after I backed up (exported) taskbarwinxp, I substituted the test key for the regular one and rebooted. When the
 desktop was re-established, the test settings (which is what a wanted) were correct. I re-set them in the task bar and rebooted. However, the adjusted settings were ignored. So that experiment failed, except to point to something else.<br />
<br />
After pursuing a number of theories having to do with group policies, and save/no save settings, I searched on the internet for windows shutdown functions. This is because changes made to the taskbar are saved in memory and written to the registry only when
 windows shuts down. I found an article on how to speed up shutdown. I theorized that my windows might be shutting down too fast. So I wanted to slow it down.<br />
<br />
While following the instructions (below) I discovered that windows was set to save at shut down for between 20 microseconds and 1/10th of a second, which is really very fast. I made adjustments to save at&nbsp; one second (1000ms) still fast, but not instantaneous.
 and that did the job. The size of taskbarwinxp value reduced from 85kb to 6kb (when exported) and it accepts every&nbsp; change. That huge size is a clear sign that the value was massively corrupted, but it was the shutdown settings that caused the problem.<br />
<br />
Here is what I did:<br />
I changed the values in the following keys and subkeys and values&nbsp; to 1000 (dex)<br />
hk_c_u\control panel\desktop&nbsp;&nbsp; HungAppTimeout<br />
hk_c_u\control panel\desktop&nbsp;&nbsp; WaitToKillAppTimeout<br />
hk_l_m\system\CurrentControlSet\\Control&nbsp;&nbsp; WaitToKillServiceTimeout<br />
hk_users\default\control panel\desktop&nbsp;&nbsp; HungAppTimeout<br />
hk_users\default\control panel\desktop&nbsp;&nbsp; WaitToKillAppTimeout<br />
<br />
According to the article, settings may range up 5000ms.<br />

            Quite often when you uninstall a program, more often than not there are still "left overs" of the program which the programs uninstaller does not remove like registry entries etc. Check and make sure that the Stopzilla folder has been completely deleted
 from your PC. Then run "regedit" and do a search for Stopzilla until ALL traces have been removed from the registry. If there is any trace of Stopzilla on your PC Windows Defender will not turn on. Might be a good idea if you haven't to download the free version
 of CCleaner and run the registry cleaner to delete obsolete entries as well.

<h2>            nvlddmkm NVIDIA crashes, MULTIPLE REGISTRY ENTRIES for Nvidia</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Hi so I started having the famed nvlddmkm crashes of my GTX 275 , and then my 285 I upgraded to temporarily, &nbsp;AND FOUND THIS -&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started with a 260 and traded up 275 then threw in a 285, &nbsp;and I have multiple entries / keys in my REGISTRY for Nvidia video, &nbsp;in HKEY LOCAL MACHINE / &nbsp;SYSTEM / CURRENTCONTROLSET / CONTROL / VIDEO &nbsp; and then HERE, I can see an original driver, a three
 or four 275 drivers (and I"ve gone through two different 275's in my machine) AND NOW a Registry folder / entry for an NVidia 285, which I only ran for a few days.</p>
<p>So, me NEVER getting the nvldmmkm problem until having switched around my Nvidia cards, &nbsp;and finding multiple different entries in the registry, &nbsp;I think that I have the crashes due to the multiple registry entries, and want to completely restore my registry
 to original state, or for sure clear everything out except what I use.</p>
<p>I'm all backed up, and prepared to do a fresh install if necessary, I need to be sure what causes the graphics card crashes and see this as a legitimate problem / source. &nbsp;My system restore does not have anything older than like 2.5 weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my specs, thanks for reading... (i've written a lot in the EVGA forums, I don't know if it's necessary to list the following, &nbsp;and I"M REALLY proud of my first system build)</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
My suggestion was to manually make a Restore Point and then perform the other methods. That would hopefully<br />
allow you to get back to where you are if you made a mistake.<br />
<br />
Check with Nvidia as they can help clear any remaining issues.<br />

<p>Am Sonntag den 26.02.2012 waren wir mit anderen MItspielern in einer Xboxlive Party, einer unserer Mitspielern spielte mit seinen Sohn.</p>
<p>Es kam einen Person in die Party kurz darauf auch weitere Personen die sich als Clan bezeichnen.</p>
<p>Diese Person beleidigte sich mit seinen Clan gegenseitig sehr ausfallend.</p>
<p>Worauf mein Freund ihnen sagte sie sollen es sein lassen oder die Party verlassen da auch jüngere Mitspieler in der Party sich befinden.</p>
<p>Die Person die als erstes die Party betreten hatte sagte meinen Freund solche Vulgären Wörter bezüglich was seinen Mutter wäre und sein Sohn das er die Party verlassen hatte.</p>
<p>Er öffnete darauf eine Privatparty,als ich hinzu kam sagte er:" ich habe einen Nachricht bekommen von der oben genannten Person dort beleidigte die Person wieder seinen Mutter.</p>
<p>Am Montag den 27.02.2012 waren wir wieder Online und in einer Party die öffentlich war damit unsere Freunde beitreten konnten.</p>
<p>Dann betrat die genannte Person die Party wieder mit Wörter die ich leider hier nicht aufführen kann.</p>
<p>Ich habe die Person aus der Party gekickt und auf Eingeladene gestellt,darauf bekam ich einen Sprachnachricht von dieser Person.</p>
<p>Diese Nachricht kann ich wieder nicht direkt hier aufführen sie betrifft meinen Mutter was er mit ihr tut und er will mir ein Messer in den A... rammen.</p>
<p>Ich frage als 38 Jähriger Mann wie können solche personen in Xbox Live andere Mitspieler beleidigen und sogar 13 Jährige Kinder so einen Angst machen das sie nicht mehr Online gehen wollen weil sie allein Angst haben.</p>
<p>Ich bitte sie von Herzen sich dieser Sachen anzunehmen meinen Nachrichten könnten sie ja von meinen Account anhören um zu wissen von welchen umfang es sich handelt.</p>
<p>Ich habe mit Xbox Support schon Telefoniert und sie sagten mir ich soll keinen direkten GamerTag nennen und mich an sie wenden.</p>

<p>Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,</p>
<p>Vielen Dank für ihre schnelle Antwort ich gehe davon aus das die Xboxlive Verhaltensregeln nur ein Leitfaden ist.</p>
<p>Die genannte Person war ein Erwachsener es war kein Kind das uns so Beleidigt hatte.</p>
<p>Wenn auf Xboxlive Personen einfach sagen können das sie unsere Mutter F... und das zu mehreren Personen und das er auch andere dinge mit ihr tut und uns in den Partys verfolgen und es wiederholt per Sprachnachrichten an uns sendet kann ich nur sagen das
 ich entäuscht bin.</p>
<p>Das Xboxlive solche Personen nicht bestraft oder ermahnt werden ,oder meinen Sprachnachrichten abgehört werden damit man sieht wie hart diese Äusserungen waren.</p>
<p>Ich bekomme nur einen Beschreibung wie ich ihn Blockieren kann,das weiss ich bin seit jahren bei Xboxlive ich kenne alle funktionen,also gehe ich davon aus das solche Menschen geschützt werden b.z.w man zeigt wie man ihn Blockieren tut und damit ist es erledigt.</p>
<p>Zahlende Kunden sind gute Kunden !</p>
<p>Da meinen GoldMitgliedschaft diesen Monat verfällt habe ich&nbsp;diese auch&nbsp;&nbsp;nicht verlänger und werde nach Ablauf mit anderen Freunden einen andere Spielerplattform</p>
<p>beitreten so verlieren sie potenzielle Kunden&nbsp;und gewinnen einen Kunden der alle Verhaltenregeln auf Xboxlive bricht.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mit freundlichen Grüßen</p>

<p>Vielen Dank für ihre schnelle Antwort ich gehe davon aus das die Xboxlive Verhaltensregeln nur ein Leitfaden ist.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Ein Leitfaden, an den sich Spieler zu halten haben. Wenn Spieler die Verhaltensregeln missachten, werden diese Spieler nach einer berechtigten Beschwerde bestraft.</p>
<p>[quote user="ReimSandmann"]...</p>
<p>Wenn auf Xboxlive Personen einfach sagen können... kann ich nur sagen das ich entäuscht bin.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Können schon. Dürfen aber nicht. Daher kannst Du eine Beschwerde einreichen, und die Person wird bestraft werden.</p>

<p>Das Xboxlive solche Personen nicht bestraft oder ermahnt werden ,oder meinen Sprachnachrichten abgehört werden damit man sieht wie hart diese Äusserungen waren.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Diese Personen *werden* bestraft. Nach Deiner eingereichten Beschwerde können die Xbox Live Policy Enforcement Teammitglieder die Sprachnachrichten des Benutzers anhören.</p>
<p>Wenn eine Verletzung der Nutzungsregeln vorliegen, können je nach Schweregrad unterschiedliche Strafen verhängt werden. Das reicht von zeitlimitierten Ausschlüssen von Xbox Live über das Wegnehmen der Sprachfunktionalität für
 diesen User bis hin zu komplettem lebenslangen Ausschluss von Xbox Live.</p>
<p>Dazu muss aber eine Beschwerde vorliegen, und diese Beschwerde muss geprüft werden.</p>
<p>Daher solltest Du die Beschwerde einreichen, und in der Zeit der Untersuchung den Benutzer selber Blockieren, damit er für Dich (und die Kinder) nicht mehr hörbar ist. Wird dann festgestellt, dass der Benutzer die Verhaltensregeln
 mißachtet hat, wird er eben mit der entsprechenden Strafe belegt. </p>

    <title>Windows Hello and Fingerprint scanner not working on Lenovo Flex 5 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Hello and Fingerprint scanner not working on Lenovo Flex 5</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed today that my Fingerprint scanner was not working to log into my Lenovo Flex 5-1570. After logging in with my pin, I go to the fingerprint sign in curious if anything was different. When I got there, I saw that Windows Hello was "not available
 on this device", which is weird since it was available yesterday?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried deleting the fingerprint scanner driver using device manager, downloaded the driver from Lenovo, reinstalled the driver, and restarted the computer. No change. I found on an old Lenovo support forum to make sure that my BIOS and chipset drivers
 were up to date. Dowloaded the latest drivers from Lenovo, installed, and restarted. Again, no change. I called Lenovo support, who told me it was "a Microsoft problem". As far as I can tell it is my synaptics WBDI driver that displays error code 10 - device
 cannot be started (shown below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have an idea of how to fix this? Thanks!</p>
<p>

            Hi Bill.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try uninstalling the Synaptics driver in Device manager, restart PC to reinstall it.
<br />
<br />If that fails check again that you have the latest from the PC model's Support Downloads web page.  If so then try the one previous to it.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers by choosing to Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick, then try each prior driver working backwards.  
<br />
<br />If that fails then you can try to trace the hardware ID to find the driver directly from the manufacturer, shown how to do here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Here's what's working so far for Fixing Windows Hello issues after Fall Creators Update:
<br />
<br />Next Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />    Press Windows key + I to open Settings.
<br />    Click Accounts and select Sign-In options.
<br />    Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />    After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />    Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted , Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:
<br />
<br />    Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />    Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.
<br />    Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished.
<br />    Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />    Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />    The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers.
<br />
<br />  I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestions! I have tried to download a fresh copy from Lenovo, uninstall, restart, and reinstall. No luck there. I have also gone through to check the older versions, and they don't seem to be working either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the install guidelines from the Driver link that you posted in your response. It seems that I have the appropriate drivers based on the hardware ID and even downloading them from a different source didn't seem to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of curiosity, I also ran a system file check (SFC) via the Command prompt as described here: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93&nbsp;</p>
<p>The file checks didn't show any problems or corrections to be done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not really sure where to go from here about the driver. Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the Windows Hello, I have a feeling that it's the fingerprint driver issue that may be causing the failure for that function to load appropriately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Bill</p>

            Hi again, Bill. 
<br />
<br />Next try creating a new test Local Admin Account to sign into to test if Hello can be set up properly there.  Tutorials for setting up new account and Hello here:
<br /><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br /><a href="https://lifehacker.com/i-ve-got-windows-10-but-what-s-windows-hello-1820333056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://lifehacker.com/i-ve-got-windows-10-but-...</a>
<br />
<br />We see a lot of problems in WIndows 10 with Account corruption that I don't remember in Windows 7 during it's entire six years daily in forums.
<br />
<br />If it's not the account you can Log out and sign back into your account,  delete it in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.
<br />
<br />Then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Bill! could you solve your fingerprint reader issue? I am having the same problem for about three months, it was usually fixed by running the windows hardware trouble shooter, but that no longer helps. it has been about a month that my fingerprint
 reader is dead. code 10 as well. tried everything, from chipset update, firmware update</p>
<p>bios update, driver update, uninstall-reinstall, etc... nothing works.</p>

<p>Hi Ricardo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not found an "always works" solution to the issue. Everything that any of the Microsoft people have instructed me to do usually doesn't work. Nowadays I'm finding that I end up losing my fingerprint reader about 2 weeks before a Windows system update
 pops up to tell me "Hey! Install this new version and update the system!". Then usually after doing the system updates, and restarting, etc., my fingerprint reader works all of a sudden again (until the next time). Unfortunately, that came out as a long way
 to say I kinda have it fixed, but at the same time, I'm still at the mercy of the Windows Powers that Be with updates.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Are you able to install all other Windows updates without any issues?</span></p>
<p>Follow these methods.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> If you receive <span>Windows</span> Update error 8024200d, it can mean that an update did not finish downloading or installing. The System Update Readiness Tool for
<span>Windows</span> can correct some conditions that cause this error. <span>&nbsp;</span>After you run the Readiness Tool, try installing the update.
</p>
<p><span>You may download &amp; run the System Update Readiness Tool and check.<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Description of the System Update Readiness Tool for Windows Vista, for Windows Server 2008, for Windows 7, and for Windows Server 2008 R2</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> <span>&nbsp;</span>If that does not help, you may temporarily disable anti-virus software and then try installing the update.<br />
<b><span>Disable Anti-virus software</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software</a><br />
</span><span>Note: </span><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span> &nbsp;
<span><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 3:</strong>&nbsp; If the above methods do not help, you may place the comptuer in a Clean Boot state and then try to install the update.&nbsp; Follow these steps.</span>
<br />
<br />
<b>Step 1: <span>&nbsp;</span></b><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><span>Note: After troubleshooting, place the computer back to normal mode by following the same KB article.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: <span>&nbsp;</span></span></b><span>Now, try to install the update manually.<br />
</span><span>You can go to </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/download</span></a><span> and use the KB number of the update to download and install it.

<p>Good morning Criminal! Sorry about the delayed response, as well as these Zune shenanigans. Let's see if we can get this fixed for you. :D<br />
<br />
Alright, so Zune won't install fully, correct? We have several support articles listed here in our
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/browse?product=zune" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Zune: Top Issues</a> page.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The one I feel would help you out most would be the&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/zune/software/installation-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">You can’t update or install the Zune software on your PC, or you can’t update the Zune player software</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And to answer your question, mostly yes. The email you use for Xbox LIVE, which is called a Microsoft Account, is, or should be linked, to Xbox LIVE, Xbox Music Pass, and your Zune account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Checkout that article, and let us know if you have any questions. Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Bot framework emulator can&#39;t test anything</h2>
                    I started learning bot framework last week, and i decided to start off with the default bot project that returns your input and its number of character. But unfortunately, I couldn't test the bot application in bot emulator. It can't just send my input.
 It displays "couldn't send" whenever I forward an input.&nbsp;
<div>My endpoint url which is http://localhost:3979/api/messages/ is correctly written there.&nbsp;</div>
<div>What could be wrong? I'm just a starter in bot framework and bot building.</div>
