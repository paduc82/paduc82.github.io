<p>Hello Regina,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There are various reasons for blue screen errors which mostly are due to a&nbsp;</span><span><span>problem with an update for Windows or a bad driver, incompatible software, or hardware that
 you recently configured.</span></span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span>To isolate the issue, can you tell us if you have made any changes on your computer prior to the issue? Are you still able to boot to safe
 mode? Do you have the updated drivers installed on your computer? In the meantime, we suggest that you check this

<p>This topic is almost a month old, so if you are still having the issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>netio.sys is a core Windows system file so it is unlikely to be the root cause of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The description of the file is Network I/O Subsystem so I would look at your network drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you provide more information about your system maybe we can help you find the recommended network drivers and you can install them and see it that fixes it.&nbsp; If not, then we'll need to get some crash dump files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get started do this:</p>
<p>
What is your system make and model or is it something assembled from separately purchased components?<br />
<br />
If the system is a Dell what is the Service Tag Number?<br />
If the system is an HP what is the serial number?<br />
If the system is an Toshiba what is the serial number?<br />
<br />
Describe your antivirus/antimalware environment.<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.

    <title>Saved Movie &#39;Cuts Off&#39; Top of Video &#40;not black bars&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> apple box design studio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saved Movie &#39;Cuts Off&#39; Top of Video &#40;not black bars&#41;</h2>
                    <p><span>When I save my edited project to a movie file, no matter which save setting or aspect ratio, it cuts off the top of the video.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When recorded, the action was close to the top of the frame, so this issue means that on playing the 'movie' you cannot see all the action. It does not have the 'black bars' issue. The video looks and sounds fine when I play it in the project window,
 even when I expand it, but as soon as I save it as a movie it doesn't show the whole picture. Distressing since I was trusted with taping the event and creating a simple movie from it.
</span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font>It is almost like it is zoomed in and the&nbsp;full video picture can not be seen, losing some at the top.&nbsp;I recorded some people and their heads were near the top of the frame. Once I save it as a movie, regardless of the ratio setting
 I select (widescreen or standard), it always 'loses' the top of the video picture so I can see only the lower half of the people's heads and faces&nbsp;in the video. (In the frame on playback, I'd say it is about an inch of loss of the video using the video app
 to play it)- just enough to lose the crucial part of the&nbsp;what I recorded.</font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font>To clarify, playing it back in the project window, everything looks fine (other than being a bit grainy and a little jumpy) but I wasn't expecting miracles :) Just didn't expect to lose part of the original video.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font>Things I did:</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span>I added music, credits and used video-stabilizer (anti-shake and wobble correction - low).&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span>I've tried removing each of those elements and saving as a movie in a variety of formats, ratios etc. but it has not helped.</span></font></p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope I've explained this well enough, but please ask me questions if it doesn't make sense. I am running Windows 8 and Movie Maker from Windows Essentials 2012.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Any and all assistance would be appreciated.</span></p>

            <p>I was trying to reproduce your symptoms.&nbsp; I was getting interesting results with stabilization turned on.&nbsp; Certainly in that mode, the resulting video was zoomed in as it tried to show a relatively stable portion in the middle of the video.&nbsp; But what was
 weird was that even as I changed stabilization settings and then saved the movie again, it appears that I'm still getting the first settings.&nbsp; I'm wondering if something gets cached and even when you clear the stabilization setting, it is still using it somehow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you try a test with a different video that you haven't already used in the project.&nbsp; Try first to save the movie without stabilization turned on.&nbsp; Then turn on the maximum stabilization and save another copy.&nbsp; Finally save a third version after turning
 stabilization back to None or minimum.</p>

<h2>            Photo App - Sort by Date</h2>
                    Hello, I like the Photo App feature, but am disappointed that I cannot get it to display all photos by date.&nbsp; So instead of using the Photo App tile, I open Photo Gallery in the Desktop, and it displays photos by date.&nbsp; Is there a way to get Photo App
 to display by date?

<p>Unfortunately, we cannot sort photos on Photo app using date or any other sort feature. This is something by design.

            <p>Hot swap is available by default for a sata connected drive. It might depend on what sata controller you are using. You cannot disconnect the win drive, within win.</p>
<p>What exactly are you wanting to hot swap? Are you useing a disk caddy?</p>
<p>BTW MS does not produce drivers, they are supplied by your PC maker, or motherboard maker in the case of a generic desktop</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 has stopped recognizing my external hard drive</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba Canvio external hard drive. I've been using it for months, no problem. Then suddenly last week it stopped being recognized on boot. When I go into BIOS, I see it in the boot disk options but it isn't in disk management when Windows starts.
 The only way to get it there is to unplug the usb connector and plug it back in. Help.

 starting the PC....anyways ever since I installed this card, I lose my Network card operation when starting up...I found I have to up-plug the power to the computer before I turn on the system in order for the Network to work...or I suppose remove the USB3.0
 card and have no USB 3. ports.</p>
<p>In my case it's not Windows because it happens on all systems...so it's the computer and hardware...don't know how old your system is but do you think there may be a firm ware update for it?...Check the manufacturer website for a possible solution....if
 you was on an Insider build then I would have recommended a 'PC reset' and choose to 'Keep existing files'.</p>
<p>Did you try a scandisk{check error}tool from 'Disk cleanup' of the drive or <strong>
sf /scannow </strong>from Command prompt{open as Admin}.</p>

            <p>Hi one more question...did you actually 'uninstall the drivers' for each 'USB Root Hub' and 'Universal Host Controller'..
<strong>Do Not Update the Drivers</strong>... just restart the computer ..let them update them selves... that would be one way to reset them all.</p>

                    <p>I found and copied my snt file on my Win 7 machine. I have a new Win 10 machine with Anniversary Edition (ver 1607) and want to transfer my sticky notes&nbsp;to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old path doesn't exist. I made a new sticky note on new pc, closed the program, and searched the entire C: drive for *.snt. Cant find it anywhere. How do I import old sticky notes to new machine?</p>

            <p>Sticky Notes is now a modern app.. no more classic Win32 app. But you can try copying StikyNot.exe and the corresponding .mui file from your old installation (Windows.old) or from a Windows 1511 ISO.</p>

<p>Of course, depending on which JAVA you're referring to it's really not needed anymore. It's a security risk, in fact. I'd uninstall every instance, e.g. version of it. If you really need it in the future, unlikely, you'll know.</p>

<p>Thank you. Unfortunately some programs and web sites require Java. For example, see this:</p>
<p>
</p><p># There is insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue.<br />
# Native memory allocation (malloc) failed to allocate 32744 bytes for ChunkPool::allocate<br />
# Possible reasons:<br />
# &nbsp; The system is out of physical RAM or swap space<br />
# &nbsp; In 32 bit mode, the process size limit was hit<br />
# Possible solutions:<br />
# &nbsp; Reduce memory load on the system<br />
# &nbsp; Increase physical memory or swap space<br />
# &nbsp; Check if swap backing store is full<br />
# &nbsp; Use 64 bit Java on a 64 bit OS<br />
# &nbsp; Decrease Java heap size (-Xmx/-Xms)<br />
# &nbsp; Decrease number of Java threads<br />
#<br />
# &nbsp;Out of Memory Error</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is CrashPlan Code42, a highly regarded continuous backup to the cloud program. Evidently I have to cancel my subscription to that service and fine one that doesn't use Java.</p>

<p>That's true. There are still some websites and apps that require it. So do you use 64 bit JAVA? How much RAM do you have installed? It looks like that app uses quite a bit memory. I can't explain all those items you listed, but someone else may be able to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, and there's plenty other sites and security blogs that basically say the same thing. Importantly, if you do need to use it, keep it updated.</p>

<p>Yes I use Chrome 64 but Chrome stopped supporting Java, so I also have FireFox 64 (and of course Edge which came with Win10). So I do want to keep Java updated but when I try to do it manually or it tries to automatically update itself, I get the "You'll
 need a new app" popup. So even if I close Chrome and open Firefox, that still happens. Perhaps I have to change my default browser from Chrome to FF. I just updated the Code42 program and it has quit complaining about Java, so maybe my problem has gone away
 with that update.</p>

<p>Hummm... so where/when do you get this error message (during the upgrade)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most folks just go to http://www.java.com to get the latest-n-greatest version of the Java Runtime.&nbsp; The download and install is simple, painless, and rarely causes a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a note: Yeah, Java <em>in the browser</em> is probably not a good idea (very few browsers support a Java plug-in now)... but Java on the PC is perfectly OK</p>

<p>I knew that neither Chrome nor Firefox supported Java, so I had done as you suggested--gone to that Java web site and downloaded it and tried to install it in Windows 10--that resulted in the same failure as when trying to install the application which requires
 Java. So I went to the Code42 web site and saw a more recent version, downloaded and installed it without any problems.</p>

            P.S. I forgot to mention that although now I can install and run Code42, attempting to install the offline 32 and 64 bit versions of Java in Windows 10 still produces the failure I described in my original post.

<p>I think the Task View Icon is for seeing what apps you have open...the Task Manager is something else.</p>

<h2>            &#34;No more connections can be made...&#34; - Win 2003</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have a win 2003 R2 server from which the dump generated will be moved to couple of other remote servers. This, I have a batch file for which the dump moves to one machine and does not move to another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Source: 192.168.10.X</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dest 1: 192.168.10.Y</p>
<p>Dest 2: 192.168.10.Z</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, the dump moves from source to Dest 1 but to the Dest 2 while Dest 2 is a Thecus NAS box. When trying to access the remote dump folder in the source machine, I'm able to access the Dest 1 but while trying to access Dest 2, I receive the following
 error message,</p>
<p>
</p><p>"no more connections can be made to this remote computer at this time because there are already as many connections as the computer can accept"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Workaround performed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I tried to follow few of the articles, changing the dword value in "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Lanmanserver\Parameters"
 -&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">MaxMpxCt.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">* Checked the maximum connections in the Thecus NAS box &amp; it is set to maximum (8).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">* Log off inactive session in the source machine, but no luck.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Immediate inputs are appreciable. Thanks!</span></p>

<p>Hi MotoX80,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Are you using the task scheduler to execute the bat fire or are you running it interactively? - Yes. But, currently I'm executing the batch file interactively as the scheduler is not working as expected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Does the bat file do a "net use" command to create a drive letter or does it use the UNC path? (\\</span><span>192.168.10.Z\DestShareName) - No</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you use a drive letter, does the bat file do a "net use /delete" for the drive letter before it terminates? - No</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From a command prompt on&nbsp; Source run "netstat -aon". Look for connections to&nbsp;</span><span>192.168.10.Z. (Dest 2).&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;Take the Pid and run this command "tasklist |
 findstr *pid*".&nbsp; - Could not see any connection to 192.168.10.Z (Dest 2).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Following the is batch script that was in use,</span></p>
<p>
copy "\\192.168.10.X\G$\DB Daily Dump\DayEndDump.dmp" "\\192.168.10.Y\d$\Dump\10.X\"<br />

<p>Windows 2003 is so far out of support that you are putting your business at risk. Win2003 is not getting any security updates.&nbsp; You really need to upgrade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has this bat file been running successfully for some time or is this something new?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Dest1 run "net session" to see if Source is keeping sessions open to the other Windows server. If it is then you know that the problem is Source is not closing the session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the NAS box, do you have a way to display and close sessions?&nbsp; Can you close all of the orphan sessions. Then retest the bat file interactively and see if the problem reoccurs. If it does, the problem would appear to be with the NAS box. Reboot it and
 see if the problem goes away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Source is not closing the session, then the first thing I would look for is hung cmd.exe processes that were launched by the task scheduler. Download Process Explorer.&nbsp;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process tree is indented by parent/child. Find the task scheduler and see if there are cmd.exe's under it. The lower pane can show handles. Your bat file should be there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also look for processes that are not indented. That indicates that its parent process has terminated. Likely it is hung. Reboot Source and see if your problem goes away. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your script should also run faster on Source if you use the local drive letter and not the Source UNC path. IE:&nbsp;
<span>copy "G:\DB Daily Dump\DayEndDump.dmp" "\\192.168.10.Y\d$\Dump\10.X\"</span></p>

1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then
<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator
</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:
<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />

<p>Hi mencik,</p>
<p>Check if you can access help and support in the safe mode with networking.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Steps to boot to Safe mode with networking</span></strong><br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart your computer if it is powered on.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap the <strong>F8 key</strong> after your computer initially powers on.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you see the <strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong> menu you can stop tapping.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the <strong>up/down</strong> arrow keys to highlight your selection.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should see drivers loading, and then Please wait.<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should then be at the <strong>Welcome Screen</strong>.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.</p>
<p><strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode<br />
</a></p>
<p>If you are able to access help and support in the safe mode then try clean boot procedure to check which program is causing the error message.</p>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>
<p>Refer the below link to know more about clean boot procedure.<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong><br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong>Continue</strong>.<br />
On the <strong>General</strong> tab, click the <strong>Normal Startup option</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <strong>Restart</strong>.</p>
<p><br />
Hope this helps!<br />

<p>Yes that is the exact error message.</p>
<p>No I don't recall any install prior to it failing. To be honest with you, I'm not sure it ever worked on this machine, which came with a clean install of Vista Home Premium x64 when I bought it two years ago.</p>
<p>I tried creating a new profile and logging in under that profile. I get exactly the same error message.</p>

<p>No, that article does not help. When I attempt to download and install, I get an error message that those files do not apply to my system. This is despite the fact that I am running Windows Vista Home Premium 64-bit version as specified in the article.</p>
<p>Can anyone from Microspft define what files are needed for Help and Support to work under this OS? If so, I can then go check to see if any of them are missing. However, I have not been able to find any documentation on this anywhere. I have however found
 lots of threads of other people having the same problem with no solutions.</p>
<p>I would think that somebody in MS should be able to put together a list of all the critical files to make this work.</p>
<p>I would attempt OS repairs if I had a real Vista system disk, but since MS doesn't provide them when sold together with a PC as an OEM version, I don't have the luxury. I refuse to pay for another copy in order to be able to try that.</p>

<p><span><span><span>Hi,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Which
 folder did you try giving permissions to?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Does
 this happen only when you try to install Java or any other program aswell?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>What
 installation do you have on your computer as of now (as initially you said it was an upgrade and later you say it was a clean install of Windows 7)?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may try to run the exe file as Administrator and check if that helps you to install the application.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Browse
 to the location where the setup file is</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Right
 click on the setup file</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Select
 ‘Run as Administrator’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Now check if you are able to install it.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may also try to disable McAfee temporarily and check if that helps. To disable antivirus follow the link given below.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Disable antivirus software</span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against
 viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a
 network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 7 GGOK license - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandeepbodla_2707  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 7 GGOK license</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good day to you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running Windows 10 Home upgraded from Windows 7 Home Premium purchased via GGOK license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I change my motherboard (And other major components) and use this Windows 10 license on the upgraded computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will it be considered as a retail license or a OEM licence fixed to a particular machine.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated on this matter. As I purchased this Windows 7 license just a year ago, I am not interested in buying another license again this soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sandeep.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You make a significant hardware change to your computer, it requires activating Windows again, you will be notified. It will considered as an OEM&nbsp;license key itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.</p>

</p><p>If that is the case, I have one more question for you.<br />
</p>
<p>Is this the same for Windows 7 (GGOK) as well? Will I need to buy a new license even if i revert back to Windows 7 and upgrade my Motherboard etc?<br />

    <title>OEM Activation Limits&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harispc12  say:</h3>
<h2>            OEM Activation Limits&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently installed Vista ) before 2 days. Then I realised that I installed them from a modified disk that has problems with many things, but they activated successfully. The following day, I accidentaly reinstalled Vista&nbsp; again from that wrong disk (I
 got confused...sorry), and activated them.</p>
<p>Now, I 've found the correct disk, <em>checked it in a VM to make sure that it is correct</em> and I want to install it.</p>
<p>The problem is that I read in the internet that OEM Activation keys have a limit on activations.</p>
<p><em>So, </em>Will I be able to activate this copy, or I have reached that limit?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note 1: </em>Before doing anything, the PC was running Vista, that came preinstalledwith it
</p>
<p><em>Note 2: </em>The key is an OEM Toshiba Key</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for help ;)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Product&nbsp;Key has to belong to that machine, as you can&nbsp;not transfer OEM Licenses from one Compute to another.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>IF it is is an OEM Product Key that is on COA Sticker on&nbsp;the underside of that Toshiba Laptop that you have reinstalled Vista on, phone Activation may be required.</span></p>
<p>If it does require phone Activation, do not follow the <em>Auto Prompts</em>, but hold on for a real person to explain to as to what&nbsp;has been&nbsp;done for re-installation purposes<span>.</span></p>

<h2>            Five Nights Freddy&#39;s 4 Resolution&#47;Window Mode &#91;FNAF 4&#93;</h2>
                    <p>First off, I tried this problems on both Windows 8.1 and 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first problem was when I got Five Nights at Freddy's 4 from steam. When I entered the game, I was zoomed in on the screen; not seeing the entire game. I fix this by opening the game properties and checking the "Disable display scaling on high DPI settings".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2nd problem is that i cannot enter window mode. I know this is been done by "Alt + Enter". When I do this, the game enters a window, but the window has no&nbsp;traditional "window". I am unable to move, resize or fullscreen the window.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 family safety - can&#39;t add time</h2>
                    When my child runs out of time on a device, it says come back later or ask a parent for more time but the only button available is the one to switch users or turn off PC. There used to be a button where a parent could come along and enter their password
 and grant extra time in 15 minute increments, how can I do this now?

<h2>            Windows Live Mail 2012 Spell check other language</h2>
                    <p>After re-install of WLM 2012, I do not have access any longer to multiple language dictionaries; only 4 English dictionaries now shows under the "Spelling" tab from Options of Window Live Mail setting. I used to have many other spell check dictionaries before
 I did the re-install.&nbsp; Any idea what's missing? Looking for the French one in particular.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone that can shed some light, much appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            How can i do a factory reset without disk Gateway FX&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Gateway FX Model :FX4710-UB003A</p>
<p>OS: Windows Vista (TM)&nbsp;Home Premium (RECOVERED)</p>
<p>It is 64-bit</p>
<p>boot info says (C:\WINDOWS) : Current OS; Defult OS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;did reset this computer once in the past serial number gateway pulled up read OME</p>
<p>I&nbsp;do&nbsp;have a recovery partition on the computer called&nbsp;RECOVERY (D:)</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have reset bios settings to default just in case </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have tried F8 and ALT+F10 and the restore options&nbsp;in gateways recovery center
</p>
<p>it doesnt give recover/repair option in advanced boot up anymore but it did before</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gateway support wants 99.99 to chat on the phone to fix it which i cant afford at the moment and the SNID is worn off so it wont even let me order a recovery cd without it on gateway the auto detect thing on site for SNID doesnt work just pulls up OME which
 isnt the 11-22digit number they want </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any help would be great i will update this post as i try each thing suggested until it is fixed
</p>
<p>thank you</p>

<font><font><font color="#333333">perform a factory reset. </font></font></font></span></p>

<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>

            <p>You can evaluate the Professional, Premium, and Ultimate editions of Visual Studio for 30 days, starting when you install the product.

If you don't register a trial edition of Visual Studio
 within 30 days, the trial period expires 30 days after you install them.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You are running a 32bit operating system.</p>
<p>It should have between 2-4GBs of RAM which was installed&nbsp;by the computer&nbsp;manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You&nbsp;would be&nbsp;wasting your time installing a 64bit operating system, unless you upgrade the amount of RAM installed.</p>
<p>64bit operating systems require at least 4GBs of RAM to utilise any benefit you would gain from them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>
<p>
