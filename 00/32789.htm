    <title>March 2018&#58; Graphical glitches after installing latest Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            March 2018&#58; Graphical glitches after installing latest Windows 10 updates on my laptop &#40;problem with Intel HD graphics drivers&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop with Windows 10 and dual graphic cards (Intel HD Graphics 4600 and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 765M) which I had not used for a couple of months but I need right now. As I turned it on yesterday, Windows Update forced me to install several "security
 updates" which took several hours. During the downloading and installation time I was able to use the laptop normally and everything was fine. However, after the installation required restart I started to have numerous graphical glitches visible on the screen
 which make it impossible to use the laptop normally (see attached pictures). </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the Windows 10 updated have messed up something in the Intel HD Graphics drivers or function since the only way to get rid of the glitches is to go to "Device Manager" and disable the Intel HD Graphics 4600.&nbsp; I have tried installing the latest
 drivers from Intel Download Center (version 154037.4835 at the time of writing this message) and even tried with some previous versions to make sure it was nothing related to the latest driver version but nothing helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know what to do. Disabling the Intel HD Graphics 4600 at the Device Manager is only a temporary solution for me to be able to post this message and being able to see what is on the screen but I cannot use this computer normally like this. I have
 read about some old posts with a similar topic (back from 2015 or 2016) but none of the solutions provided there helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9cd3e69f-a764-4097-be88-55e6b618a09c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9cd3e69f-a764-4097-be88-55e6b618a09c?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ff1af40-9632-4188-825b-14f1077c267f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ff1af40-9632-4188-825b-14f1077c267f?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Hi Marc.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />What also is working is to go into the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, to Roll Back or Uninstall the problem drivers, one at a time, then restart the PC to reinstall each one.  
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />There are a lot of problems with WIndows Update now so some are turning them off using the Metered Connection discussed here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>.
<br />
<br /> There are good reports from users now who've had them shut off for awhile and only install the Version Upgrades twice a year from the Media Creation Tool which is the most stable method anyway, and includes all previous Updates rolled in. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick reply and your willingness to help, I really appreciate that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, none of the options that you described above were able to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone through all the updates that Windows 10 installed yesterday (which originated the problem) and was able to uninstall all of them but one (I have restarted the computer after uninstalling each and every of them). It seems to be the one that I
 can't uninstall that is creating the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When going through Device Manager and selecting the specific display adapter (Intel HD Graphics 4600) the option to "Roll back driver" is greyed out and cannot be selected. There is no option to uninstall the drivers for it either. As mentioned in my previous
 post I have tried installing older versions of the drivers for it but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">System restore would have worked if it wouldn't be that the only restoration point available seems to be after the installation of the Updates took place (at least partially), since recovering the computer to that restoration point
 does not solve the problem. However, <span>
A relevant piece of information that I could take from the restoration point is that it showed that the programs affected by the Windows Updates installation were all related to both my Intel HD 4600 and NVIDIA drivers.</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">It is the first time that I have problems with Windows 10 updates but I might be forced to stop the automatic downloading and installation by the means you described if updates are being released in such a bug-full state.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I have also written a message to the Intel Community support hoping from some additional helpful input.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I appreciate your help.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Thank you.</p>

            Marc, 
<br />
<br />If you want to remove the update via the Command Prompt in Advanced Startup Options (including from the booted media), DISM can remove packages from the image or from the installation (offline or online)
<br />
<br />From the System Recovery Command Prompt run the following command:
<br />
<br />dism /online /get-packages
<br />
<br />This will produce a list of installed updates and packages. They will look like this:
<br />
<br />Package Identity: Package_for_KB978262~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~6.1.1.0
<br />
<br />State: Installed
<br />
<br />Release Type: Security Update
<br />
<br />Install Time: 2/11/2018 1:01 PM
<br />
<br />Find the most recent one and then make a note of the package identity.
<br />
<br />Then run the following command:
<br />
<br />dism /online /remove-package /PackageName:Package_for_KB978262~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~6.1.1.0
<br />
<br />Note: Name of update is from previous step which may vary.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If not then without the System Restore point to fall back to it may be necessary to turn to this link to Clean Install which compiles the best install possible that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given:    <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Then monitor System Restore poinsta and save a System Image backup of your finished install so you can always go back to a working fresh configuration in 20 minutes if Windows becomes irreparable.

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the the command prompt that you mentioned and managed to execute dism.exe. However, the instruction dism/online/get-packages is listed as invalid, it gives me an error and says the instruction is not valid. Perhaps I am missing something here, I am
 not very good in command prompt instructions.</p>

            Marc -
<br />
<br />The thing with Command Prompt is that you must  type the command precisely with the exact spacing or it fails.  
<br />
<br />If it is typed correctly and won't work with Online then try Offline as from booted media that may be required.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try explain a bit better the error that I get and how do I get there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I access the command prompt from the advanced options in the recovery system the starting screen looks has this written:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"X:\Windows\System32&gt;"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to write the instruction that you gave me on top of that (I do not know how else to do it) which means it is like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"X:\Windows\System32&gt;dism/online/get-packages"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it gives me the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Error: 87<br />
<br />
Option offline/get-packages unknown.</p>
<p>For more information, run DISM.exe /? to see the help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The registry file of DISM is located at X:\Windows\Logs\DISM\dism.log"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing the instruction to the offline version so: "X:\Windows\System32&gt;dism/offline/get-packages" but it produces the same error.<br />
<br />
It is probably something simple that I am omitting, as I said I am not good with command prompt.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Left side tab, shift and the windows key have stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered this issue some days back when the usual alt+tab feature to switch between windows stopped working(life isn't the same since).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then eventually I figured out the shift and the windows is out too when win+d won't switch to the desktop and shift would not capitalize alphabets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is not info about this on the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually then I saw that the keys start working normally at times, but mostly for the past week they have been off.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9457e4bb-c79b-4369-86c2-e199fa594411?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9457e4bb-c79b-4369-86c2-e199fa594411?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The screenshots shows my windows version and I am also getting repeated pop ups about some&nbsp; major windows update happening in the back end with an windows icon in the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really need to fix this to get my life back on track. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            I had tech support remote in and do everything you stated with no success. He is stating that it is a manufacturer issue, but it doesn't make sense since both my phone and JBL speaker connected to windows 8.1. neither one can connect at all.... will there
 be an update for 10 to resolve this issue? This issue is pretty big for me since I use the laptop to watch movies, sound makes a big difference. This 10 is faster than 8.1 but without Bluetooth connection whats the point?

<strong><em>not</em></strong> the bluetooth tower speaker. &nbsp;They worked fine day before yesterday but then after an update yesterday, that's when they stopped working! &nbsp;I've even updated my Dell Inspirion 15 Bluetooth driver, that did not help either. &nbsp;I'm
 going to uninstall those updates.</p>

            Similar issue for me, except my error code is (0x409) 0x80070424. I'm extremely frustrated. I enjoy streaming my Xbox to my PC because I like my small monitor being close to me rather than a TV further away. I just streamed 2 days ago without any issues
 at all. Really at a loss of what to do.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to inform you that this issue might be occurring because of corruption in network drivers or if&nbsp;the firewall from the security software installed in the system sometimes blocks the network connection. Let’s diagnose and troubleshoot the
 issue by following below provided steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press “Windows key + X” and click Control Panel.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2.</strong> Tap or click Hardware and Sound, and then tap or click Device Manager.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to device manager.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on view and press on "show hidden devices".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 5:</strong> Go down to the list of devices and expand the node "Network Devices”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 6:</strong> Find an adapter with the name "Microsoft Hosted Network Virtual Adapter" and then right click on it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 7:</strong> Select Enable</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 8:</strong> This will enable the AdHoc created connection, it should appear in the network connections in Network and Sharing Center, if the AdHoc network connection is not appear then open elevated command prompt and apply this
 command " netsh wlan stop hostednetwork " without quotations.</span></span></p>
<p><span>(To open the command prompt type “cmd “ in search option of Start Window and click on it.)</span></p>
<p><span>Step 9. After this, the connection should appear.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer to the article given below and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/networking-and-connectivity/cant-connect-to-a-wireless-network?os=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/networking-and-connectivity/cant-connect-to-a-wireless-network?os=windows-10</span></span></a><span>

<h2>            Bluetooth issue&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, hope somebody can help me with a stupid problem I am having.. </p>
<p>I have an ASUS X553M Laptop, I think it has blue-tooth capability, but, I can not pair it with my TDK-A33 wireless speaker for some reason..
</p>
<p>I have tried to hold FN and press F2 at the same time, all that does is turn wireless off and airplane mode on, so that is no help..</p>
<p>I can not find ANY option anywhere to turn blut-tooth on or off..</p>
<p>I have tried to change some settings but nothing I've done so far helps..</p>
<p>Troubleshooter is unable to help or doesn't find the speaker..</p>
<p>Since upgrading from win 8.1 to win 10 a lot of stuff I had is gone or missing and many things no longer work or work correctly..</p>
<p>Wish I NEVER upgraded!..</p>
<p>Anyone out there know how to fix this issue?..</p>
<p>All pages I find for Windows and Blue-Tooth are all for windows 7 or 8 and none of those pages give ME helpful info for MY issue..</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your patience and help!..</p>
<p />

            <p>THANKS FOR NOTHING THERE KUMAR, EXCEPT FOR WASTING MY TIME!, NOW YOU MAY GO BACK TO WHITE CASTLE! LOL
</p>
<p>I WILL SAY THIS LOUDLY SO THAT MAYBE YOU WILL READ AND UNDERSTAND WHAT I TYPE!
</p>
<p>I ORIGINALLY STATED, AND WILL SAY AGAIN, THAT I HAVE ALREADY TRIED THE USELESS WINDOWS TROUBLESHOOTERS, THAT THEY WERE NO HELP, AS USUAL, THEY NEVER ARE! DUH!</p>
<p>I ALSO SAID THAT I HAVE NO OPTION ANYWHERE TO TURN BLUETOOTH ON OR OFF, pressing FN and F2 does nothing except turn my wireless OFF or back ON! DUH!</p>
<p>NOTHING IN DEVICE MANAGER LISTS ANYTHING FOR BLUETOOTH EITHER! </p>
<p>SO, IF THEY AREN'T LISTED, THAN THEIR DRIVERS CAN'T BE UPDATED! DUH! </p>
<p>There used to be things for Bluetooth listed in the device manager, but that was before the Win10 upgrade eff'ed my system up, but, now there is NOTHING listed for blue-tooth!</p>
<p>I have also tried to force legacy blue-tooth products to install, all that does is give error code 10!</p>
<p>I AM NOT SOME IDIOTIC NOOB FROM WEST BUBBLEFART, NEBRASKA, I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING AND I HAVE ALREADY TRIED EVERYTHING POSSIBLE!
</p>
<p>I'VE BEEN BUILDING AND PROGRAMMING LAPTOPS, TOWERS AND SERVERS SINCE THE MID 1980's, BACK WHEN IT WAS DOS SYSTEMS ON SPINACH GREEN SCREENS and you had to actually TYPE IN command strings!!, AND I HAVE BEEN USING AND MASTERING WINDOWS LIKE A BOSS SINCE version
 1 came out in 1990! </p>
<p>I HAVE PROBABLY LEARNED AND FORGOTTEN 2000 TIMES MORE ABOUT COMPUTERS THAN ANY OUTSOURCED MS TECH WITH SOME BOGUS DEGREE WILL EVER LEARN FROM HIDING BEHIND THOSE WORTHLESS CHEAT SHEETS, WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY TOTALLY USELESS OUT HERE IN THE REAL WORLD!
</p>
<p>I have yet to ever see one single person with this issue, or a similar issue get solved!,
</p>
<p>So how much are they really training their outsourced so called "techs" who obviously can't read nor understand ENGLISH?!</p>
<p>My problem lies with the Windows 10 upgrade which has done nothing but totally screw up my ASUS X553M Laptop and has removed and taken away half of what it used to be able to do, AND THAT IS JUST NOT RIGHT! MS puts crappy bug filled systems out that RUIN
 computers and laptops than gives us complete baloney and run arounds and FAQ nonsense!</p>
<p>ASUS is good for nothing either, they offer NO help!, they really, really suck just as bad as MS's BUG FILLED upgrades do!</p>
<p>So!, In the immortal words of South Parks Mr. Garrison, </p>
<p>"Can we get an answer from someone who's not a complete retard?"</p>

<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since the network name (SSID) and password have been changed, the credentials saved on the printer no longer match the updated network credentials.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The printer needs to be reconnected to the network. Ensure that you have the latest device (printer) drivers installed. To setup the printer on network, please follow the instructions given in the

<h2>            Logon failure&#58; user account restriction. Possible reasons are blank passwords not allowed, logon hour restrictions, or a policy</h2>
                    I am on an XP computer<br />
I want to map a network drive which is on a Vista computer<br />
The Vista computer doesn't have a login password on it and I don't want to add one (comes up with the error message in the title)<br />
When I add&nbsp;a&nbsp;login&nbsp;password however it works<br />
<br />
The Vista computer maps the XP network drive (which isn't&nbsp;password protected either) just fine...<br />
Is there a way to bypass this blank login&nbsp;password restriction?<br />
<br />
I now also have a windows 7 computer, it can only map the XP drive<br />
the vista computer can only map the XP drive<br />
both my vista and 7 computer require passwords to be mapped, is there a way around this?

    <title>Frequent BSOD on ASUS laptop caused by driver nwifi.sys - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Frequent BSOD on ASUS laptop caused by driver nwifi.sys</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the last months I've experienced frequently crashes/BSOD and I haven't found a solution yet. The crashes seem to appear randomly and not during one or two specific actions. The only thing that seems to repeat is that the crashes happen at home when
 I'm using the same wifi connection, but that might be also just because I use the laptop mostly at home and the crasher aren't daily. I am using Windows 10 on Asus Zenbook Pro ux501vw. I've tried to update different drivers which hasn't solved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a crash list by bluescreenview:</p>
<p>Bug check string: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</p>
<p>Bug check code:0x000000d1</p>
<p>Parameter 1: 00000000`00000018</p>
<p>Paratemer 2: 00000000`00000002</p>
<p>Parameter 3: 00000000`00000000</p>
<p>Parameter 4: fffff802`4681a5a6</p>
<p>Caused by driver: nwifi.sys</p>
<p>Caused by address: nwifi.sys+1a5a6</p>
<p>File description: NativeWiFi- Miniport Driver</p>
<p>Product name: Microsoft® Windows® -käyttöjärjestelmä</p>
<p>Company: Microsoft Corporation</p>
<p>File version: 10.0.17134.112 (WinBuild.160101.0800)</p>
<p>Processor: x64</p>
<p>Crash address: ntoskrnl.exe+198330</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this or possibly any other information help finding the cause of the problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>Petteri</p>

            Hi Pttri, from the listing you provided, you should look to downloading and installing the device drivers listed below from the support page for your device linked below for your device
<br />
<br />Realtek Wireless Lan Driver and Application
<br />
<br />Realtek BlueTooth driver

<p>Hi DaveM121,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed now <span>Realtek Wireless Lan Driver and Application so I'll see if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I was however unable to install the bluetooth driver because of the following error message: "<span>He</span></span><span><span>re are unauthorised bluetooth adapter in your system, please remove or disable the devices
 and click ok." This far I have actually thought the Intel BT drivers are the ones I need and have kept updating them.</span></span></p>

            Dave is correct. The crashes look to be caused by your network driver. If the crash happens again, let us know.

</p><p>Unfortunately today I had a crash too. So at least that driver update didn't solve the problem. Like said before though, I was unable to install the other driver suggested.</p>

            Same nwifi.sys error.
<br />As no drivers were named, 
<br />Let us try finding any misbehaving driver
<br />Enable Driver Verifier: 
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />(Must create a Restore point before)
<br />Upload the newer dumps when you get Driver_Verifier_detected_voilation. 
<br />
<br />Please note that the system might crash before you reach the desktop-if it does please let us know so that we can guide you to disable Verifier.

<p>Several months ago, some folks with Dell computers were having problems with the nwifi.sys driver being involved.&nbsp; It turned out the normal Wireless drivers were not using the driver but a performance suite which had been installed was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you think of any utilities loaded on your system which might be service such a purpose and not actually being part of the normal drivers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ASUS system I will check later to see if it is running the nwifi.sys driver.</p>

            <p>Hi Ankit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all of that, but it didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix it I tried making a heap of registry changes, which crashed my PC and could only boot to DOS.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn't keep a record of my changes.</p>
<p>Luckily I managed to recover it by running SFC/scannow.</p>
<p>No idea why that fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway my registry setting changes did manage to get rid of the UK setting.</p>
<p>But now it is set to USA (which I can live with).</p>

<h2>            Boot gets hung up on atipcie.sys</h2>
                    earlier today, my desktop was working perfect. i take good care of it because its my baby. when i arrived home, it was hibernating, as usual, but after waking it up, it had slowed to a crawl, a fraction of its normal speed with frequent lags. I was forced
 to perform a hard reboot and when it got to the windows logo, the animation froze, and that is as far as i have gotten since, no matter what i try. i can get into BIOS, but i cannot boot in safe mode or launch any diagnostics without it locking up about five
 to ten seconds into the boot process. when i launch in safe mode, the driver that it seems to get hung up on is atipcie.sys. i would assume that to be a video driver. i have tried booting after removing the video card and after manipulating the ram to every
 safe configuration. each time the same problem occurs, a lock up only seconds into booting. i am running windows 7 64 bit with an nvidia card (unsure of the model off-hand) and 12gb of ram, two 2gb sticks and two 4gb sticks. the

Thanks for the swift reply, and I apoligize for the lack of punctuation in my original post.&nbsp; I was posting off of my phone and it was being obnoxious.</p>
<p>I have been trying your suggestions, even the ones I have already tried, just to be thorough.</p>
<p>1) The only recent change is the latest Windows 7 update, and the computer booted at least once just fine after the update.</p>
<p>2) My computer is a custom-built tower.&nbsp; It uses a Quad Core Athlon on an MSI Motherboard. I can give more specifics if I need to, but I would need to find the paperwork with the exact models used.</p>
<p>3) There are no error messages. The Windows logo that animates while Windows 7 starts simply stops moving.&nbsp; If I load into any other mode, a similar thing happens.&nbsp; (In safe mode, it stops loading on the driver "atipcie.sys".&nbsp; In any mode that loads with
 a progress bar, like Startup Repair, the bar simply stops moving.)</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>Still froze on the Windows logo.</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>Still froze on the Windows logo.</p>
<p>Method 3:</p>
<p>Freezes while loading Startup Repair.</p>
<p>The remaining tips, I also cannot use because the computer will not boot from disc, either. It also freezes on the Windows logo. And I cannot get to anything other than BIOS.</p>
<p>I appreciate the help. If you can, get back to me when you get a chance.</p>

            <p>Hi Cyberpenguin 82,</p>
<p>When you say you can't boot from disc, what exactly happens when you try to?</p>
<p>It's possible that your having a hardware issue.&nbsp; I would suggest checking with your equipment manufacturer's sites for possible hardware diagnostic tools to check.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            ive had a couple of people looking at it today that simply stood there scratching their head, the same as i did. i feel like a motherboard issue whether a bios corruption or a physical issue with the hardware is the only thing i cant eliminate as a possibility.
 the motherboard still loads bios fine though, and i still just get one beep on every attempted boot. i moved around the sata cables to test if it was a bad sata port. but even that turned up no change and my experience working with motherboards directly, whether
 in bios or with the hardware itself, is very limited.

            I had the same issue and was extremely frustrating trying to resolve.&nbsp; After hours of trying to resolve this issue, I&nbsp;pulled the HD out of the computer.&nbsp; I inserted&nbsp;the HD in an external enclosure and ran a "chkdsk" from&nbsp;my daughters laptop.&nbsp; The chkdsk
 took 4 hours to complete.&nbsp; Surprising, no errors on the HD.&nbsp; Upon completion of the test, I also deleted all the partitions on the HD rendering it as a new HD as if it was purchased from a store.&nbsp; I then re-inserted the HD in my computer.&nbsp; I had read somewhere
 that this issue could be a&nbsp;RAM problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;With my computer having two 4 gb of RAM sticks, I switched one of them around as I was currently&nbsp;running a 32 bit Windows 7 and&nbsp;you can only use 4gb or RAM on a 32 bit system.&nbsp; Flashed up the computer with my Windows
 7 DVD and install a fresh Windows 7.&nbsp; Installed my drivers and voila, my system was up and running.&nbsp; No more hanging in "safe" or "regular" mode.&

            Here is a solution which worked for me.<br />
<br />
My computer crashed during a Windows Update and the fact that I made it reboot may have caused it problems.<br />
<br />
I also believe that the graphic card drivers from ATI were a factor since a friend of mine had similar problems and the computer had only started to work properly when he had uninstalled ATI and let Windows install the minimum drivers needed to work the graphics
 card.<br />
<br />
My own computer started to repeatedly crash both in normal and in Safe Mode and sometimes would not start Windows 7 at all. I was advised to move the memory card to another slot. This made the computer work properly for a short while before it started crashing
 again.<br />
<br />
In order to solve the problem I did the following:<br />
<br />
1. I opened the computer and moved the memory card to another slot. (Always remember to switch off the computer and disconnect it from the mains before opening it up!).<br />
<br />
2. I booted successfully into Safe Mode .<br />
<br />
3. I went into "C:\Program Files" and rename the ATI directories: "ATI" and "ATI manager" to "ATI.old" and "ATI manager.old".<br />
<br />
4. I then rebooted into normal Windows 7 and the computer ran nicely. I went into Windows Update and undid the last updates. Windows then performed another update and these were installed without any trouble.<br />
<br />
5. I renamed the ATI folders to their normal names and then used Program Uninstall in order to remove ATI from the PC.<br />
<br />
The computer has worked normally since.

            <p>Its been nearly 24hrs since my Dell Inspiron Zino went down due to a power failure (Blackout) in our neighbourhood.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read all the material and its been a great learning experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is, to my mind, the definitive answer to this ongoing issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only guess the MBR on the Hard Drive was corrupted. No matter what I tried with Windows 7 install disks etc, could I get the damn thing to fire up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Answer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Recovery Disk from NeoSmart.</p>
<p>https://neosmart.net/blog/2009/windows-7-system-repair-discs/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not an employee but just another john who was going to take my computer to be repaired if I could not do it.</p>
<p>$20usd later, and an hour or so reading the easy to read documents my Zino is back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't waste your time F...ing around with the bios and ram etc Try this solution it works.</p>

            <p>I just solved this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. turn off PC and unplug</p>
<p>2. remove graphics card</p>
<p>3. plug monitor into motherboard VGA socket</p>
<p>4. plug in/fire up - your PC should now boot to windows</p>
<p>5. run windows update</p>
<p>6. install anything you uninstalled prior to the problem</p>
<p>7. reset PC then shut down</p>
<p>8. plug graphics card back in</p>
<p>9. reboot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>should be fixed.</p>

<h2>            Ayuda modo cine Halo CEA</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 0, 1)">Hola a todos, quisiera saber si alguien más tiene problemas para cargar en incluso ver video de las partidas del Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary. Intento acceder a las partidas recientes y no hay archivos guardados
 ni tampoco veo en las opciones un modo de activar antes las grabaciones de clips (si es que hubiera de activarse antes de jugar) incluso descargue clips que se supone estaban disponibles en linea y no hay forma de acceder a ellos, por mas que los selecciono
 desde el juego (donde si aparecen) porque desde mi biblioteca de videos nomas no&nbsp;existen. Quiza estoy errado en un paso a seguir, o a lo mejor me falta software que deba descargar desde el Halo Reach (juego que no he jugado en esta consola que es nueva porque
 no lo tengo) ya que segun se este Halo CEA usa el gameplay live del&nbsp;Halo Reach. Si hay alguien que pueda responder mis dudas o que me explique como usar el modo cine casi paso a paso tipo "Theater mode for dummies" le agradeceria eternamente la ayuda, pues
 desde la salida de Halo 3 no habia entrado al live hasta que me compre la consola slim y el GoW 3. muchas garacias por tomarse la molestia de leerme y espero alguna respuesta. Saludos desde Merdida, Yucatan, Mexico.</span></p>

    <title>Xbox 360 not displaying image on TV via HDMI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brocsz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 not displaying image on TV via HDMI</h2>
                    
<p>Long story short, i've been using my new xbox for the past couple of weeks without any problems, until the day i decided to *** things up. i unplugged the hdmi cable while being paused in far cry 3, and then plugged the hdmi in my laptop to watch some tv
 shows. since then, the xbox will not display image or play any sound on that tv in particular. but if i use it on a diff tv, with the same hdmi cable it works perfectly. also, the hdmi ports from the tv work well since i have no problem streaming video from
 the laptop. i've tried almost everything, resetting &nbsp;the xbox and tv, changing all cables, manually changing display resolutions ( from diff tv, then trying to see if it will work on my *** tv) but nothing works so far. the number of posts with same issues
 remaining unsolved discourages me a little, but a i sincerely hope one of you guys know the easy solution that has to exist to this stupid *** problem. almost forgot to mention, &nbsp;if i use the scart cable it works, but let's be honest, who the *** wants to
 play splinter cell blacklist via a scart cable at a low resolution?</p>
<p>thanks, a big fan from romania. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi brocsz,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have you tried following the below setup to reset you xbox 360 display settings:</p>
<div>
Reset the console display settings
<div>
<p>If the display problem is still not resolved, reset the display settings of your console. Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove any discs from the disc tray. </li><li>Turn off the console. </li><li>Turn on the console.
<p><b>Note</b>&nbsp;If you are using an Xbox 360 Wireless Controller, turn on the console by using the Guide button on the controller. Make sure that you use the player 1 controller when you do this. The player 1 controller will have the upper-left light illuminated.</p>
</li><li>As the console starts, on the controller, press and hold Y while pulling the right trigger. The display settings are reset to the default settings, and then the console automatically restarts.
</li></ol>
<div>Hope this resolves the issue for you.</div>
<div>Regards</div>
<div>BoA</div>

            <p>Hey there Brocsz!<br /><br />I'm sorry to hear about the display issues. Let's see what we can do to get things sorted.<br /><br /><strong>First off, since this first started messing up when you unplugged the HDMI cable while the console was on, let's try doing that again to see if that yields better results. I suggest trying it like this:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hook everything up to your TV like it was.</li>
<li>Power your console on.</li>
<li>Wait ~60 seconds for the console to fully power on.</li>
<li>Unplug the HDMI cable and reverse the ends (take the end that's plugged into the TV and plug it into the console, take the end that's plugged into the console and plug it into the TV).</li>
<li>Wait ~60 seconds and see if any display comes on.</li>
<li>If it doesn't, try restarting the console and see if it has picture/sound then.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Let us know how that goes and we'll work with you from there! ^_^</p>

<p>Hey brocsz. Are there any other HDMI ports on the effected TV? I would also try flipping the HDMI cable around, and use the other end to plug into the console/TV. (If you haven't already). Also, do you have any other HDMI cables we can test out?

<p>I have the same problem as you and tried everything for my samsung tv. I think its from hot swapping the HDMI. It has to be an xbox problem cause other xboxs work fine on my tv with the same hdmi cable. I ended up just using the HD component cables (RGB).
 Not sure if it works for every TV but the xbox still lets me choose 1080p thru component although video is played at 1080i.</p>

<p>This has been an ongoing issue for some time, I have yet to see a definitive solution however I have never seen anyone try this.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Contact xbox support and ask them for the code for your console to reset it to the factory settings, I recall some time ago someone here on the forums having horrendous lag problems with a guitar hero game and this resolved that issue. I'm just wondering
 if a factory reset will fix this handshake issue.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If you do this and it resolves the issue then please post back. I would suggest that you copy your game saves etc to a USB device if you can before restoring the console to the factory settings although I do know from my own experience that no files got
 lost when I did this with my console a while ago.</p>

 a scanner "Epson V500 photo scanner" with OCR software. I happened to notice this software in my program files when I went to check the situation out. Any help would REALLY be appreciated. Thank You.&nbsp; (:

            <p>Could you provide your system specifications?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you upgrading from a previous version of Windows or doing a clean install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is usually caused by hardware or software that is incompatible with Windows 7. If you have this problem, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall all antivirus software, and then restart your computer. Don't forget to enable antivirus software after you install Windows.</p>
<p>If the installation fails again, there might be a hardware incompatibility problem. Go to the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor
</a>on the Microsoft website to see if your computer can run Windows 7.</p>
<p>If you have compatible hardware and your computer still stops responding, disable any unnecessary hardware. Remove universal serial bus (USB) devices; remove or disable network adapters, sound cards, and serial cards; and then restart the installation.</p>
<p>If the computer still stops responding during installation, contact your computer manufacturer or retailer.</p>
