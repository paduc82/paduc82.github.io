            Hi Remal_514 ,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, we cannot simply give the IP Address of the main Skype Network. However, I think the following will help you:-
<br />
<br />Enable Skype in Windows Firewall (W10)
<br />1. Search for 'Firewall' in the search bar by the Windows Start Button
<br />2. Select 'Windows Defender Firewall'
<br />3. Select 'Advanced Settings'
<br />4. Select 'Inbound Rules'
<br />5. Find the instances of Skype, right-click and select 'Enable Rule'.
<br />
<br />Note, you have to be the administrator to be able to do this.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.       
        </p>

    <title>Account Security in danger. Odd activities on outlook.com email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ddw_dave  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account Security in danger. Odd activities on outlook.com email account.</h2>
                    For months now, whenever I look at my recent activity there are incorrect passwords entered from all over the world. Serbia, Thailand, China, Netherlands, Japan, Portland, Los Angeles, Russia, Atlanta, you name it. They've all tried to get into my account.
 Fortunately they are almost all listed as "Incorrect password entered" but as of 2/9/16 one of the activities was "Alias added" by a Netherlands IP address. No confirmation of a successful login, just a change in alias. I cannot see a difference within my
 outlook.com but this worries me greatly. Also, today my netflix account was hacked. This account was connecting to my email. I've tried callign Microsoft support, only to direct me to this website again and again. I found no way to directly contact them in
 which I am in dire need. Thank you, I look forward to stopping any suspicious activity on my email account.

</p><p>I just noticed this today as well... Let me guess. The IP was something like this:
<span><span>104.45.25.9?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Same thing here. But in my case, I just checked today. It's saying that happened on 02/14 date and 19:51 o' clock.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now I am REALLY curious about this because I've checked this IP and the websites showed that this IP belongs to Microsoft Azure and the owner is Microsoft. Pretty weird, huh?</span></span></p>

<p>It has been said that the IP we saw on the activities is really Microsoft Azure related.
</p>
<p>That activity appearing was a mistake from Microsoft and the activity itself represents Microsoft servers maintenance. Microsoft still trying to fix that issue because it wasn't meant to appears like that to us users.</p>

<div>Hi Impjen0A,</div>
<div><br />
<div>When you say "<em>i type my account password it works only app passwords not working</em>", may I know whether you are trying to add your Office 365 email account to Outlook desktop client?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Make sure you typed your app password correctly. If you're sure you entered your password correctly, you can try to sign in again and create a new app password then choose copy password to clipboard. You won't need to memorize this password. Go to the
 app that you want to connect to your Office 365 account. When prompted to enter a password, paste the app password in the box to check your issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the troubleshooting steps doesn’t help, please contact your company/Office 365 admin so they can delete your existing app passwords, letting you create brand-new ones. For your reference:

<div><br />
<div>Moreover, please provide us with detailed version of Outlook and screenshot about the steps which you have tried for further analysis.</div>

<h2>            Connection failed.Connection unavailable on c7 Belle</h2>
                    
<p>Finally Nokia has updated social network software on Nokia Belle. I thought it would solve the problem,but still when i open default applications such as Facebook,Twitter, Check in, Social networks in upper right corner it shows message "Connection failed.
 Connection unavailable".On any other application there is connection. I would like to suggest Nokia to transfer to some other software,because they dont know how develop own. This is the message from unsatisfied customer,because my Nokia is not working correctly
 for about 1year,from release of Nokia Anna. Or maybe you have solution for my problem after 6 months?</p>

            I'm having this problem too for a while now. I have done a few hard resets and I've managed to get the 1.3.236 version working and connecting just so I can upload photos on facebook. I can now see another update (1.5.216) available but I'm still afraid
 to update because it might not connect. Another app which I was using and is now facing the same issue is AccuWeather. I will have to upgrade my contract soon and the Samsung Galaxy S3 looks better than the Nokia 808 Pureview from where I'm standing. I'm looking
 forward to video calls with Skype and a proper facebook app :)

<p>Hi all, I just posted the same on another forum, I've had the same problem with my N8 and just bought the 808 Pureview and the same thing happens. It seems to be a GPS related issue so what I did is went into</p>
<p><strong>Settings/application settings/positioning/positioning method from there uncheck Bluetooth GPS, Wi-Fi GPS and network based.</strong></p>
<p>It seems to haved worked for me, I had learned to ignore it but still it was annoying.</p>
<p>Hope it works for you</p>

    <title>Excel 2013 File Menu defaults to &#39;Info&#39; rather than - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fozzstar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2013 File Menu defaults to &#39;Info&#39; rather than &#39;Open&#39;</h2>
                    <p>In Word or PowerPoint, clicking the&nbsp;'File' menu displays the 'Open' page.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, in Excel, clicking the&nbsp;'File' menu displays the 'Info' page.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It therefore requires a second click to get to the 'Open' page.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Has anyone noticed this (sorry I could not see a solution on line) and is there a fix?
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

            Another one-click option is to put the File &gt; New and File &gt; Open commands into the Quick Access Toolbar. Then you don't need to worry about the backstage view at all.

            Try temporarily disabling third party browser extensions and see if it helps:<br />
<br />
IE &gt; Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced &gt; remove the checkmark in front of "Enable third party browser extensions" &gt; OK then restart IE.<br />
<br />
If that does not help you can&nbsp;re-enable third party browser extensions.<br />
<br />
If it does help, you would have to track down the third party browser extension causing the problem.

            <p>The faulting module appears to be the ntdll.dll which is a Windows system file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However it is possible another, possibly third party, file may actually be the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be useful to try to capture a user-mode dump of the iexplore.exe crash to get more information on the crash and to see what other files may be involved in the error.<br />
<br />
You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.<br />
<br />
If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file, then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file&nbsp;at the time iexplore.exe crashes&nbsp;should be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\iexplore.exe]<br />
"DumpFolder"=hex(2):43,00,3a,00,5c,00,43,00,72,00,61,00,73,00,68,00,44,00,75,\<br />
00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00</strong><br />
</em><br />
<br />
After Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe) crashes, can you then make the .dmp file&nbsp;available (provide link)&nbsp;via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?<br />
<br />
The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:<br />

<p>When did this problem start and did the start of the problem coincide with any software change especially with the highlighted files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, can you restart the computer in Safe Mode with Networking and see if the same error exists.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            No title in subject line for the attachment</h2>
                    
<p>I used to attach documents to email on previous versions of Outlook and it would display the filename in the subject line. On Outlook 2007 it leaves it blank for me to do now. Anyone have a solution on how it could be done automatically. It really helped
 me track documents. Appreciate any help.</p>

    <title>People and Groups option not available in Site Settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            People and Groups option not available in Site Settings</h2>
                    
<p>We've set up a group in SharePoint and configured one of our user's as the group owner (so that they can modify the group membership).&nbsp; In the site when I click on the settings cog and then
<em>Site Settings</em> (me as a global admin), I see the option for <em>People and Groups</em> under the
<em>Users and Permissions</em> section.&nbsp; However, my user (the group owner), doesn't see that option available to them when they click on the settings cog.&nbsp; I can give them the link (URL) to the group directly and it works, but that means we will need to do
 this for all of the SP groups that we set up like this.&nbsp; Do you have to be a site admin in order to see the
<em>People and Groups</em> option link on the <em>Site Settings</em> page?&nbsp; Is there a method that I can use to make that option available to them without making them a site admin (if that is the requirement)?</p>


<p>Thanks</p>

<p>hi stgdb,<br />
<br />
we don't have to be a site admin to see the <strong>people and groups</strong> option, we can assign the group owner(s) a customized permission level:<br />
1. go to <strong>site settings</strong> as a global admin, click <strong>site permissions</strong> under the users and permissions &gt;
<strong>permission levels</strong> &gt; <strong>add a permission level</strong>.</p>
<p>2. type a name, for example <em>siteowner</em>, scroll down to <strong>site permissions</strong> section, tick
<strong>manage permissions</strong> &gt; <strong>create</strong>.</p>
<p>3. back to the <strong>site permissions</strong> page, click<strong> show users</strong> &gt; select the users you want them to see the people and groups &gt;
<strong>edit user permissions</strong> &gt; select the permission level named <em>siteowner</em> &gt;
<strong>ok</strong>.</p>

<h2>            Nokia e71 connection to WLAN in the university.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,<br />
I tried to connect to the wireless internet in the university, but it failed. I know the connection user name, the password but I don't even get the opportunity to type it, no table pops-up, no asking to type user name/password - like in the PC.<br />
What should I do??? How can I make the internet work in my phone in the university?<br />
I tried free wireless elsewhere - it connected me auto, everything was ok...<br />
Please help.</p>

<p>As noted by metalfan above, it would be easiest if you check the required WLAN settings from your WLAN administrator. There are various authentication methods that you can configure in E71 and it can be hard to find out the right one by just testing.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could start by checking with Connectivity &gt; WLAN wizard the WLANs that your device detects. Select Options &gt; Details to check the security mode that is used with the WLAN. This tells whether it's an open network or if it requires WEP or WPA/WPA2 authentication.
 If it's WPA/WPA2, you should try to check with your WLAN administrator what EAP plugin settings need to be selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can create the WLAN access point by selecting Options &gt; Define access point in the WLAN wizard but you need to complete the configuration in the Settings &gt; Connection &gt; Access points menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your WLAN network requires username and password to be configured, it could be e.g. WPA/WPA2 with EAP-LEAP but there could be also some other alternatives. If EAP-LEAP is used, select in the "WLAN security settings" menu WPA/WPA2 = EAP and in "EAP plug-in
 settings" menu enable just the EAP-LEAP authentication and define the user name and password in the EAP-LEAP menu.</p>

            Hi Christopher,
<br />Office Pro Plus is sold in corporate licensing so for using in a company it is a company have to buy it/ If you have access for HUP program, it is for home use. 
<br />If you want to buy Office 2019 Pro personally it will not have downgrade rights and of course product key cannot be used for Office 2016.
<br />Seems the best way for you is to ask a responsible person in your organization,

<h2>            Can&#39;t find OneNote Spellcheck &#40;No review tab&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!<br />
</p>
<p>I recently got a new device and had to redownload Microsoft office. I seem to now have a different version of OneNote which does not have a review tab, therefore, I cannot perform spell check. I am able to right click on each word and check it individually,
 but cannot go through the Spell Check program. Please let me know if I am able to add spell check to this program somehow!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            I suspect you are running the "free" OneNote that is bundled with Windows 10 and downloadable from the Win10 store 
<br />
<br />In the Ribbon, do the tabs start with "File", that is Office OneNote and it should have the Review tab.  In the start menu the tile/icon has a purple book "cover" with a white "N". 
<br />
<br />Or does the ribbon start with the "Home" tab?   That is the free one.  In the Start menu the tile has a white book cover with a purpple "N"

            You are most likely running the free, tablet optimized OneNote app that comes with Windows 10. If you have Office installed, look in your Start menu or search for "OneNote 2016" instead of just "OneNote".

<p>
</p><p>What specific steps did you take to try to open your Pub file? Publisher 2016 should open Publisher 2003 files. There may be some formatting issues but it should open. Did you save the Pub file to your local hard drive?

<p>Sorry, there is no version of Publisher or Access that will run on a MAC. Never has been and I doubt there ever will be. It states this fact right on the page where you downloaded the MAC version of Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could run a PC version of Publisher via <span>Parallels or an alternative virtualization. I know very little about MACs...</span></p>
<p><span>I don't know of a DTP alternative for a MAC and I have not read of any of them that would open a PC version of a Publisher file.</span></p>
<p><span>You can do a Save As from your PC and convert the Pub file to a .doc file and open that in Word, but you will not get all the formatting of the Pub file. Of if your laptop still works then use it to run Publisher. I have friends with MACs
 that keep a PC for running software such as Publisher that is not available for MACs.</span><br />

<h2>            Lumia 950 Rebooting while making phone calls</h2>
                    <p>He there, does anybody has a solution to the constant rebooting of the phone when making phone calls. I am a big fan of Microsoft but this is really but really bad - I get the feeling its happening when Bluetooth is on but I need Bluetooth to run continuum
 with keyboard and mouse and of course when driving a car - so 30-50% of my work time... I would like somebody from Microsoft to say when do we get a fix or if e.g. the insider Preview build&nbsp;might be&nbsp;a fix once we can install it on the new lumias - have also
 a 925 and there everything works fine - only a little bit slower but in total more usable as with the lumia 950 i do have a ferrari with engine which stops every 10 minutes..</p>
<p>PLEASE DO SOMETHING WITH THIS STUPID AND REALLY PROBLEMATIC BUG!!! YOU ARE DRIVING INSIDERS AWAY FROM WIN 10 MOBILE AND THAT IS DANGEROUS, VERY DANGEROUS!!!</p>
<p>

            A test software on a flagship device. Bulshit. Had to drive 4 hours today - withou bluetooth not realy safe. Bluetoth s a basic functionality which this phone currently does not have and even the new build does notbhelp ot of this situation. I did not
 pay 500 EUR plus accessories to have a phone which i can use only half of&nbsp;a day.

            <p>Having the same issue with my 950. Constant reboots when accepting/making calls. Took suggestion to disable Bluetooth. So far so good. Just disappointed that this basic bug happened right out of the box.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS - Firstly&nbsp;acknowledge there is a problem and give us a sense when a fix will be made available. That would be a basic expectation I would have given we are your first early adopters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are my&nbsp;phone details is this helps.. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Version: 1511</p>
<p>OS build: 10.0.10586.0</p>

<p>Chip SOC: 8992</p>
<p>
</p><p>Final observation.. You need to have a smarter way in finding out about these problems rather then relying on a customer to go to a forum. Crash event data should have been sent in some sort of prompt like when we get an error on the desktop.&nbsp;Build the right
 telemetry listening system.&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience just isn't good enough.</p>

            Just got the new build 10586.36 which seems to have solved the problem. Will test it properly but made today several łonger calls with bluetooth on but nothing connected and it worked. Before it was regularly crashing. So hopefully this is a final fix!!!

            <p>Sorry to report but for my phone the issue remains. However is happen less frequent.&nbsp;Before the update it happened 90% of all phone calls. Now that I am on bld 10586.29 I have received 2 calls and made 3 today. It has rebooted twice but not within the first
 20secs. I would say about a minute into the call. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So looks like I will need to wait for the 10586.36 update to check if the issue is fully resolved.

<h2>            Your message wasn&#39;t sent because there&#39;s a daily message limit</h2>
                    <p>I have had a Hotmail account for well over 15 years. I send out a couple of hundred emails a day. Today, after sending maybe 10, I get a message "Your message wasn't sent because there's a daily message limit". I went to help and it said I should go to the
 add a phone area which I did and put in my cellphone number. Nothing changed. I cannot send email from my PC and this is a REAL PROBLEM since I write a blog for my community and they send me questions all the time. HELP!!!</p>

<p>Hi again rohn007</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I am not explaining myself very good but what I am trying to say is that yes I was wanting to update&nbsp;</p>
<p>The windows 10 but when I started to do so a message came up stating that Microsoft had updated its licence and I ineeded to &nbsp; have. The 2003 or 2007 Microsoft office installed on my laptop before installing</p>
<p>New updates but as I mentioned I did &nbsp;not press the tab to agree but they were downloaded any way&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;But. On checking &nbsp;found that I had &nbsp;Microsoft office 2007 already installed which I did &nbsp;not realise I had done so earlier as I forgot as I dont really use it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that this a better explanation and sorry for the confusion&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 indexing data lost when closing archive folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mainsoft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 indexing data lost when closing archive folder</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm using Oulook 2010. I have a big archive folder where I store old messages and I'm frequently&nbsp; looking for information in this archive. I have noticed that if I close the Archive folder in Outlook, all the indexing data is lost. The next time I open the
 archive.pst file to look for a message, indexing will re-start from scratch which takes ages. This makes the Search feature totally useless for the archive folder (which is not supposed to remain opened all the time, otherwise, it's no longer an archive).<br />
<br />
This doesn't make sense. An archive doesn't evolve very much (or at least not very quickly). So the indexing data remains valid for a longer time than for the other folders. So why does Outlook delete the indexing data for the archive when it is closed while
 it tooks hours to build it? Is there a fix for this bug (I can't find any other name for this odd behavior)?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

            <p>As pst-files are being indexed via Outlook, disconnecting it from Outlook will indeed remove it from the Search Index. To prevent this from happening, you could consider creating a separate "archive" mail profile instead.</p>

<p><br />
Thank you for your help in clearing up the "greyed out " Set As Default" box thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it turns out, I have stumbled upon the answer to my problem. What I neglected to mention was that I am currently using the 'Watermark' theme for my email messaging. This theme has it's own default font and size settings and this is automatically selected
 when specifying the theme. <strong><u>However, this can be changed by selecting the drop down box arrow and changing the setting from 'Use theme default font settings' to 'Always use my own font settings'.</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this resolves my problem, <em>thanks again for your help</em>. Mukherjee, please respond to this thread so that I may mark it as an answer for others who may have similar questions to mine.</p>

2. about “<em>when we connect to outlook 2013, we get a "this feature has been disabled by your administrator" (that's me, i didn't).”,</em> can you connect the sharepoint calendar to outlook?
<br />
3. for “but not create new ones in outlook”, do you run into any error message when creating new events in outlook? could you share with us more details or some screenshots?
<br />
4. could you share with us a screenshot about “the advanced properties show the calendar only has 'read' permissions”?</p>

<p>thanks shirley,</p>
<p>we have just created some site owners, and site members and added a calendar app intuitively.</p>
<p>please see screenshot of the list (calendar app) permissions:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=53f6bbde-c98f-4a9e-88f1-f6cf8854abe0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d53f6bbde-c98f-4a9e-88f1-f6cf8854abe0" /></a></p>
<p>yes i can connect sharepoint to outlook.</p>
<p>however we get these which is normal:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ef3e483f-d345-496d-bf67-0d54eb1de950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3def3e483f-d345-496d-bf67-0d54eb1de950" /></a></p>
<p>but then:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=3ed4f0d0-8c94-4ff1-8c92-38bb9510c172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d3ed4f0d0-8c94-4ff1-8c92-38bb9510c172" /></a></p>
<p>you can see the calendar does get added and even show appointments. right-click to add appointments, everything is greyed out.</p>
<p>and then:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=67e802a0-6541-4d3d-98d1-6b8fd89f958a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d67e802a0-6541-4d3d-98d1-6b8fd89f958a" /></a></p>
<p>with regards to the "this feature has been disabled by your administrator" we have
made registry changes&nbsp;but this hasn't fixed it.</p>
<p>while i await your response i will try and create another list on another site and connect with another device off the domain.</p>
<p>thanks for your input.</p>

<p>Oops. I have re-checked registry and found:</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\SignIn</p>
<p>Name: SignInOptions</p>
<p>Type: DWORD</p>
<p>Value: 3</p>
<p>This may have been set by Group policy to prevent use of personal one-drive accounts as a security measure prior to O365 deployment.</p>
<p>After changing this value manually and re-adding the calendar, Outlook has prompted me to sign in to Sharepoint and the proper permissions are in working!</p>

<p><span>Are you still having difficulties on your calls? When did the issue started and is it happening to a specific number? If you can call other mobile number without a problem, then possible the issue is on the
 person you’re calling with.</span></p>
