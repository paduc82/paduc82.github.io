<h2>            Windows 10 16299 x64 setup has failed to validate the product key</h2>
                    <p>I have a damaged windows 10 1709 install that needs repairing. using both the media creation tool, and an .ISO I downloaded from the Microsoft servers, I get an error during setup that says "setup has failed to validate the product key". Windows says it's
 already activated, as it should be. I have tried a number of steps to get around this error message, including using the change product key option and entering the Windows 7 Ultimate key that came with my PC. windows shows no errors and says windows is activated,
 but windows setup still says it cant validate my key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following things, which all reported back a success message</p>
<p>
</p><p>used change product key in settings, using my windows 7 Ultimate OEM key</p>
<p>
</p><p>slmgr /rilc</p>
<p>
</p><p>slmgr /dlv</p>
<p>
</p><p>slmgr /xpr (came back with message "Windows(R), Professional edition: The machine is permanently activated.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried these steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>turned off security software (AV/firewall) Eset Internet Security 11 and (anti-rootkit/antimalware) Malwarebytes 3 premium</p>
<p>
</p><p>uninstalled security software (see above)</p>
<p>
</p><p>left insider program (release preview track)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>re-joined insider program (release preview track)</p>
<p>
</p><p>restart computer (multiple times)</p>
<p>
</p><p>turned off fast startup</p>
<p>
</p><p>Licensingdiag.exe -report %userprofile%\desktop\report.txt -log %userprofile%\desktop\repfiles.cab (files available on request)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am about to give up on the media creation tool, as when ever the tool is run, it re-downloads
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ALL</span></strong> 4.XX Gb's of the windows setup files, even though the previous run of the tool already did so. I am limited to 600Kbps downloads speed on a really good day. having to re-download the same data
 over and over again, is not acceptable. if the files have been previously downloaded recently , the media creation tool should be able to recognize that, and not waste time by downloading the same stuff again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>how do I get past this error? I tried looking the issue up, but there were no real solutions that I could find.</p>

            Hi Cybot.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you downloaded the ISO or created the Bootable media from media Creation Tool then you shouldn't need to downoad it again.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Have you tried mounting the ISO by clicking on it, right click the Setup file to Run as Administrator?  
<br />
<br />I've not heard of it bothering with the Product Key but this may be something new and rare where it flags it wrongly.
<br />
<br />If the above doesn't work then try these steps for Overcoming Windows Upgrade hurdles: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Windows 10 Digital License
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

</p><p>Absolutely none of that cut and paste answer helps in the slightest. as I said, this is a setup failure message. the only option is to exit setup. windows it self says everything is activated properly, I do not know what key it is that windows 10 setup is
 looking at the it can't validate. setup is not asking me for a key either. so I assume it is something on the key server end of things at Micro$oft. either that, or there is a bug in the 16299 setup program. I already am aware of one bug in the setup program
 for 16299, so I don't doubt there are others as well. the file I downloaded is 'Win10_1709_English_x64.iso' which is the proper version for my system (WIndows 10 Professional x64). this error even occurs when using the media creator tool, so, unless that program
 is also downloading the wrong version, that is not the issue.</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the response, the other person who responded, was not helpful in the slightest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I typically do is mount the ISO using windows built-in virtual drive feature, and then run setup. I have not tried using the run as admin option yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not had any issues with upgrading or doing repair installs of windows until very recently. I have long since cleared out any bloatware Toshiba put on my system, keeping only Toshiba utilities and drivers, and some of the Toshiba apps. I can't do a
 clean install of win 7, because I don't have any other install other than a factory restore, so I was happy when the free upgrade to win 10 came out (finally I was able to do repair installs!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Toshiba put in some custom settings (mostly in the power settings) that would not get entered into the system if I did a clean install, also some of the utilities are not available on the Toshiba site for download. those settings got transferred over when
 I did the upgrade, so I have had very few non bug related issues. I know there are those that are vehemently against upgrading a windows OS to a new version, but in this case, for me, it is optimal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did manage to track down the setup files that the media creator downloaded, and ran the setup file as an admin, but windows setup ended with an error saying setup could not tell if I had enough disk space to continue. is 181 Gb of free disk space not enough?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to run the setup program from the ISO again, but the main point of the repair install. is to both get the OS repaired, and get the latest updates installed at the same time. using the ISO, even when I tell setup to download the latest files, I
 end up with 16299.15 not 16299.214 or later. I was hoping the media creator files would do what the iso version would not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>the media creator tool is probably re-downloading stuff again, because I am selecting the upgrade this pc option. I don't have any media available to create a install disc at the moment.&nbsp;</p>

            this is interesting..... after mounting the ISO windows came up with a message saying a restart was needed to finish configuring this device. and the device listed was the Microsoft virtual drive. I don't know if there was some sort of driver update that
 happened in the background, but I will restart (once again) and see if that helps.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>setup never even asks for a product key (which is normal), so i don't have any idea what the error is talking about. I did see another post elsewhere about this error back when w10 was first released, and some one had said the servers that dealt with license
 verification were temporarily offline. is it possible that there is a problem with the Microsoft servers or access to them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there any logs i should be looking at to try and track down this issue?</p>

<p>my last post seems to have disappeared..... so i will repeat some of it now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>out of frustration, and a little suspicion of what was the cause, I ended up running the following commands,</p>
<p>
</p><p>ipconfig /release</p>
<p>ipconfig /flushdns</p>
<p>ipconfig /renew</p>
<p>ipconfig /registerdns</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of setup now being able to retrieve the updates via dynamic updates, the error seems to have gone away.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't say everything is solved until windows setup is 100% finished and everything is running as it should be.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of my main concerns right now is I happened to see a post from the Microsoft dev team which said due to to user feedback windows apps that were uninstalled would not be reinstalled during setup. this feature was to be implemented in future builds. this
 was for a post about an insider build past 15063, but before build 16299. while this might be a desirable outcome for some people this is not what I want. I want windows to reinstall all my default store apps that have been uninstalled. I don't know if this
 feature has been implanted yet, but i suspect it has, as running setup recently has not solved my default store apps issues. If there is a way to get windows to reinstall the default store apps during setup please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also of concern is the fact that windows setup does not seem to be able to install the update that fixed the store apps issues caused by upgrading to 16299 (kb4058043)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>there is this log entry created in the setupact.log during the DU portion of setup, I am not sure how to interpret the the log, but it appears it's saying that update servers are giving one set of file info for the file, but the actual file info is different,
 so the update gets skipped. if this is the wrong interpretation please feel free to correct me.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>it also looks like windows setup thinks there is not enough disk space to extract the updates, is 170GB not enough disk space?</span></p>

    <title>how does sfc &#47;scannow work&#63; Can the windows resource - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> questions_  say:</h3>
<h2>            how does sfc &#47;scannow work&#63; Can the windows resource protection be a source of new corrupt files after it reports that it repaired corrupt files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is a brand new computer with windows 7 professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I used administrative command prompt and ran sfc /scannow and it reported that windows resource protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them. &nbsp;Details are included in the CBS.log windir\logs\CBS\CBS.log. &nbsp;For example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as it completed its report I ran it again and it reported that windows resource protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. &nbsp;Details are included in the CBS.log windir\logs\CBS\CBS.log. &nbsp;For example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How come the second sfc /scannow found corrupt files that were not found on the first sfc /scannow? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)Were the repairs done by the windows resource protection the source of the corrupt files on the second sfc /scannow?</p>
<p>2)Was the first sfc /scannow faulty where it missed the corruption?</p>
<p>3)If the windows resource protection produces corrupt files after it repairs the files what is an alternative step to fix the corrupt files?<br />

            <p>kb3068708 was in the update history and was deleted. &nbsp;kb3022345 was not in the search results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After uninstalling 708 I rebooted and checked sfc /scannow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is still correcting corrupt files the first time it is run and on the subsequent time it finds a corrupt file that it cannot fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer was first used on 9/20 and today is 9/23. &nbsp;Viewing the update history there are 5 failed updates all of which are important updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB3075226</p>
<p>KB3075226 (second listing for the same failed important update)</p>
<p>KB3069762</p>
<p>KB2965788</p>
<p>KB3020388</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's making these 4 &nbsp;important updates fail on this brand new computer with windows 7 professional? &nbsp;Are there ways to troubleshoot the failed updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the sfc \scannow i guess i'll have to live with it. &nbsp;Any other thoughts?</p>

            <p>Somehow I struggled with&nbsp;<strong><span>findstr /c:"[SR]" %windir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log &gt;"%userprofile%\Desktop\sfcdetails.txt"&nbsp;</span></strong>as I did not see the result on the desktop. &nbsp;Command prompt did not allow me to paste. &nbsp;The first or second time that
 I typed the link it could not find the path specified. &nbsp;Then when it seemed a correct path there was no response on the command prompt and when searching the desktop I did not find the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I used searcheverything software and found sfcdetails.txtlink 24 KB. &nbsp;When I clicked on it it opened a blank notepad. &nbsp;So I didn't understand whether something was done incorrectly or whether its hidden or whether it needed administrator rights to view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An alternative method that I used was to use notepad.</p>
<p>

            <p>Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This computer is HP zbook 17 G2</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has drives c, d, e, f</p>
<p>
</p><p>For each drive I ran chkdsk using administrative command prompt and then used the snipping tool to copy and paste to the desk top.&nbsp; The chkdsk reports are in the link below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the chkdsk c: /r I have not run yet and I wonder the approximate amount of time it may take to complete the task?&nbsp; And did you want me to run the /r only on c or also on each d, e, and f?&nbsp; if the chkdsk results are ok do you still want me to do the chkdsk
 /r?&nbsp; If so on which of the four drives?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the HP zbook 17 G1 with the failed nvidia video card HP had me move files via my router with windows easy transfer from the G1 to G2 computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Treesize I looked at briefly and have not yet made the time to learn or use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system info I planned to send to you and found that you have another way of getting the same information.&nbsp; I used start then entered run then entered msinfo32.&nbsp; The end result appears similar.&nbsp; If it is not the same then I'll go back and do what you
 have above.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The three links below have new information and some of the prior information.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There were problems at first moving the event viewer links from the desk top to the shared folder so you may see some extra snipping tool pictures of the 3 event viewer images on the desk top.&nbsp; The yellow folder has personal files.&nbsp; The other two I was eventually
 able to include in one of the shared folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any significant findings in the CBS.log?</p>

    <title>Wireless keyboard wont connect to new wireless receiver. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arbil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless keyboard wont connect to new wireless receiver.</h2>
                    Ok, my old mouse buttons stopped responding properly so I went and bought the wireless laser mouse 6000 v. 2.0.&nbsp; The one that comes with the little usb receiver that snaps into the bottom of it.&nbsp; Well I still have my wireless laser keyboard 6000 v. 2.0
 that the other mouse came with (I bought them as a bundle a while ago).&nbsp; The keyboard is connected with the old bigger receiver that has the long usb cable and the lights&nbsp;on it for f-lock, caps lock, etc...&nbsp; I cannot get it to sync up with the new little usb
 receiver that came with the mouse so I can do away with the bigger one with the cable and not have to have 2 different receivers plugged into my comp.&nbsp; I am asking if this is possilbe at all.&nbsp; Can I connect my keyboard to the newer smaller usb receiver that
 came with the mouse?&nbsp; Thanks in advance for helping.

            Hi Arbil,<br />
<br />
Probably not.&nbsp; If the receiver that came with the mouse isn't designed specifically to support your wireless keyboard then it's doubtful that they are compatible.&nbsp; The hardware manufacturer for each device could probably give you a more accurate answer.<br />

<h2>            Faulting module name&#58; MSVCR80.dll</h2>
                    <p>Hey , guys. Can somebody help me to fix this issue ? (Faulting module name: MSVCR80.dll) I looked on forum , but either solution didn't work or was explained so badly , that couldn't' follow it up. ( I am not a pro user) Reason I found this problem is that
 I tried to launch a new game and it gave me "C++ Runtime error". I tried to fix this issue first by reinstalling, uninstalling , installing all kind of staff with Microsoft Visual C++ and it still didn't help, tried to do same with all my drivers ( no worry,
 i didn't messed up anything in there so don't need to panic). &nbsp;Also I found some solutions on forum here&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/msvcr80dll-crashing-everything-on-most-machines/0098dd93-016f-49ee-b0a1-c8272bab2785?auth=1 , but
 "sfc /scannow" didn't detect any problems and second solution there like running this program&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed , I didn't understand , because I don't have problems
 with installing or unistalling programs , I tried second step tho , like running :</p>
<p>takeown &nbsp;/f &nbsp;MSVCR80.dll - this one was successful&nbsp;<br />
regsvr32 MSVCR80.dll - but this one gives me another 2 errors ( look on screen shots)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate any help and as possible easy language! :) Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

                    yeah so my computer only boots in safe mode. system restore does not help. cd drive on computer will not work and i cannot get microsoft's fix it software to run in safe mode (will not install powerpack or whatever). i do not have original restore cd's
 from manufacturer, and i have downloaded an iso vista boot disc but it will not work in a usb cd drive. any ideas?

<p><span>Contact your Computer Manufacturer&nbsp;and<span> ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop
 to restore it to Factory settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair computer option.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Old xbox360 achievements not showing on Xbox one Profile</h2>
                    <p>I recently realized that the achievements of some games that I played some time ago are not appearing in my current Xbox one profile.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how this can be solved? Did someone happen to him?</p>
<p>
</p><p>as an example, I played the "left 4 dead" in xbox 360 but today I do not see any achievement obtained in my profile</p>

<p>Hiya!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from the Xbox Forums Team here to assist with the issue, it looks like you're trying to get the achievements you earned on the 360 to reflect onto your account. When you sign into the 360 you were playing on please make sure that it is connected to
 the internet. Once connected the console should update the profile. I hope this information is helpful in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Gaming!</p>

<p><span><span>Hi dickiebird64,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try the below methods and check</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Open Control Panel then Speech Recognition Options.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. In the upper right of the Speech Recognition Option window click Advanced Speech Options.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Remove the checkmark next to, ‘Allow computer to review your documents’.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Click Apply.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above method does not work, go back to Speech Recognition Options and click Train Profile and see if you are able
 to Train. Failing that, click the new button and try creating a new User Profile with a new name. If that works, you will be able to delete your first profile.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also verify the regional language settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Open Regional and Language Options by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Clock, Language, and Region,
 and then clicking Regional and Language Options.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Select the appropriate language and region. Then reboot the computer and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here is an article that will give you more information about Regional Language settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            Hey there, James
<br />Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums
<br />
<br />When I purchase games, I use Steam. You can download games from Steam here:
<br /><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://store.steampowered.com/</a> 
<br />
<br />You can also use the built in Microsoft store app on Windows 10, which do have games that are for Xbox and Windows listed under the game section. To get to store, please press Start &gt; Store
<br />
<br />Hope this helps, 
<br />Regards, 
<br />
<br />--------------
<br />Legal: Just to let you know Steam is not apart of Microsoft. However it is an official site for PC Games. They have their own ToU and CoC which you will need to agree by. Anything you download on the site is at your own risk - however, it is safe (They don't have PuP and they do check the games developed and published)

            Hi James
<br />
<br />If you have the discs for those games, but no drive to insert those discs into, you need to go to another PC and create disk images (ISO files) of those disks
<br />
<br />Then in Windows 10, you can double click an ISO file and Windows will create a virtual drive, with that disk mounted on it, which fools the game into thinking the disk is indeed in your PC
<br />
<br />You can use free software like IMG Burn to create the Disk Images from those disks . . .

<p>- If your machine does not have a DVD\CD player and there is no option to install one you have to buy all games on line.</p>
<p>(you can buy an external DVD\CD player, but they are relatively expensive).</p>
<p>- If your machine has DVD\CD player you can use that to install games you buy from a game shop, and you can buy second hand games,</p>
<p>but only older games will activate </p>
<p>From around 2010 onward it can be difficult to find a game that allows for more than one activation. Greedy publishers have killed</p>
<p>off the second hand PC game market. I still pick up old disc based games from the local thrift shops now and then though.</p>

<p>hi can anybody help me with this error code, it regularly pops up when trying to update my laptop and cause the hard drive to make strange sounds for 15 minutes before resuming. At first i thought there was a hard disc error and have run chkdsk and defrag
 and found zero problems. Any help someone could provide me on this would be much appreciated.<br />

many thanks <br />

            Hi wtappan,<br />
<p><br />
Please take a look at this excerpt from the Windows Help and How-to and see if it applies to your situation:</p>
<p><b><i>“<u>Why can I play and add certain songs to the burn list, but can't burn them to a CD?
</u></i></b></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;If the song file is protected with media usage rights, those rights may allow for playback of the song on the computer but prohibit burning to a CD. If the Information button (blue circle with an “I” in
 it) appears next to the song in the burn list, click the button to see more information about the issue. For more information on media usage rights, see the DRM: frequently asked questions.<b>”</b></i></p>
<p><b><i>-Taken from <a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/51a88740-abda-4144-9176-cec79cca31e81033.mspx#E2G" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Help and How-to:
 Burn a CD or DVD in Windows Media Player: frequently asked questions</a></i></b></p>
<p>I would also like to suggest that you take a look at that link for other possibilities.</p>
<p>If you take a look at the above information and feel that it is not the issue then you may need to update the driver for your CD burner. What is the model of your CD burner, you can go to the manufactures
 website and try to find the latest driver for your model, then download and install it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing back from you so that we can further troubleshoot this matter with you if need be.</p>

<h2>            Screen sharing&#58; can only share the skype screen itself</h2>
                    <p>Hi all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having issues with the screen sharing function on Skype. When I click on it, the only thing it allows me to share is the Skype window itself, i.e. the person I'm talking to basically sees himself/herself the way I see them. It doesn't give me the option
 to switch to other windows (browser, presentation, document...), it doesn't even show other options. I'm using macOS High Sierra and Skype 8.13.0.2. Hope someone can help me out!<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

    <title>Date format for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terryfisher66  say:</h3>
<h2>            Date format for Windows 10</h2>
                    The Date Format for Windows 10 does not include d/m/y &nbsp;the nearest it has is dd/mmm/yy. &nbsp;This means that programs which rely on the Windows Operating System display an odd date. &nbsp;Sage displays 16/008/2015 which us not ideal. &nbsp;I would much prefer 16/8/2015
 or 16/08/2015. &nbsp;This was not the issue with either Windows 7 or 8. &nbsp;Any solutions?

            <p>Dear Vanessa,</p>
<p>I think that you have missed the point.&nbsp; Yes we can view the date as dd/mmm/yyyy.&nbsp; However what is required is to set the date format as dd/mm/yyyy an all numeric date format.</p>
<p>This option is not available.</p>

            Is it a Digital Camera? &nbsp;If not then you have to get the film developed. &nbsp;When you do there is an option to get a CD made at that time. &nbsp;Have the CD made and then transfer from the CD to the PC.
<div><br />
<div>If it is digital, refer to the owners manual. &nbsp;Some digital cameras have special software that must be run to transfer. &nbsp;Others you can just direct connect the Camera to the PC and transfer the pictures that way.</div>

    <title>Getting green screen video online. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leswilson_916  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting green screen video online.</h2>
                    <p>Why am I getting sound,&nbsp;and a green screen when I play video files in IE9, Windows 7 64bit ? I already unchecked the Adobe box over the video. When I uninstall IE9 and it reverts to IE8 the videos play fine. What's up with that? I've also uninstalled and
 reinstalled other programs by Adobe and Oracle. Makes no difference. I've noticed that most of the videos are on Yahoo. Youtube is okay and seems like everything else is okay. They only play when I revert back to IE8. This just started happening about a week
 ago. Up to that point everything was just fine.&nbsp; Can&nbsp;anyone help me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Profil auf mehreren Konsolen&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Profil auf mehreren Konsolen&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>mahlzeit,</p>

<p>ich hätte mal ne frage. ist es möglich das xbox profil auch auf 2 oder mehreren konsolen zu nutzen? bei der ps3 funktioniert das. zwar wurde dort die anzahl von 5 auf 2 runtergeschraubt, aber das ist ja auch ausreichend, da wir in unserer wg 2 ps3 haben.
 allerdings ist es nur möglich sich mit einer konsole online zu schalten, auf der anderen wird man dann direkt ausgeloggt, was aber nicht weiter von belang ist.</p>
<p>nun wüsste ich gerne ob dieses auch mit der xbox 360 funktioniert. kann ich meinen account auf einer 2. box einrichten und dort dann auch meine on demand spiele nutzen? oder sind diese konsolen gebunden?</p>

<p>mfg kingk</p>

<p>Klaro. Du kannst Deinen Account im Gegensatz zu PS3 sogar bei "unendlich" vielen Konsolen haben. Allerdings kann das Konto GLEICHZEITIG nur auf EINEM Konsolenmodell angemeldet sein.
</p>
<p>Will also heißen: Wenn Du drei Xbox 360 Konsolen hast, kannst Du auf allen Dreien Dein Konto haben, aber es kann nur auf EINER online verbunden sein.
</p>
<p>Hast Du eine Xbox 360 und eine Xbox One, kannst Du auf BEIDEN GLEICHZEITIG Online sein.
</p>
<p>Hast Du zwei Xbox 360 und zwei Xbox One, kannst Du auf JEWEILS EINER 360 und JE EINER ONE gleichzeitig online sein.
</p>
<p>Windows Phone und Windows 8 sind auch wieder Geräte, mit denen Du mit Deinem Xbox Konto online sein kannst, ohne dass Du bei Xbox 360 oder Xbox One "rausfliegst".</p>

<p>Du kannst dein Account auch auf jeder anderen Xbox360 benutzen.</p>
<p>Mit den Spielen bekommst du zwei Lizenzen/Schlüssel.</p>
<p>Der erste ist dafür da das alle das spiel auf deiner Box spielen können mit ihren Account.</p>
<p>Der zweite ist dafür das du auf jeder Box deine spiele spielen kannst.</p>

<h2>            Transferring Vbucks credit between Xbox accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a complete novice where Xbox is concerned and bought Vbucks via microsoft store to gift to a friend's son for his birthday. They are on my Xbox account (I didn't even realise I had one!) and I need to transfer them to him. Is there a way of doing this?
 I can't see any option either on the Xbox or on my Microsoft account and am losing the will to live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know you can't transfer vbucks from one account to another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try to get a refund as described below (source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7zj2e8/xbox_refunding_accidentally_bought_v_bucks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reddit post</a>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After refund you can try if you can buy vbucks with the "buy as gift" option.</p>
<p>Another option is to buy a xbox gift card (or code) and hand that over as gift.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Description from reddit post</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us</a></p>
</li><li>
<p>Click “billing”</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click “no thanks” for the virtual agent</p>
</li><li>
<p>When you are asked to pick a category, click “Payment and Purchases”, then “Check your Xbox purchase history”</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under “4. Contact method”, I clicked “chat with Xbox support”, but I’m sure that requesting a call could work too</p>
</li><li>
<p>When the chat opened, I told the guy what happened and that I only meant to buy the v bucks once, and he was able to refund the second purchase.</p>

<p>Hey bud!&nbsp;Thanks for the post. Unfortunately the only way to gift in game currency is to have the account that is being used to play fortnite actually purchase the Vbucks. You cannot transfer from account to account. Any and all support for in game currency
 is handled by Epic games in general. Here is a link for <a href="https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Epic Games support channel </a>if you have any questions.</p>

<p>Hello anushebanushe, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, there's no way for you to transfer game content like in game currency between accounts through Xbox or Microsoft.
</p>
<p>The only way for that to happen is through Epic. </p>
<p>If you want to maybe try to request a refund as well through our <a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/digital-goods-subscriptions-refund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Support page </a>entitled but if generally, in game consumables are ineligible. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

            I did the same mistake. My son asked me to buy Vbucks and I bought it with my account instead of his. If we cannot transfer the Vbucks, does that mean I am stuck with Vbucks I will never use? Is it possible for me to buy him stuffs for the game with those
 Vbucks stuck in my account?

<p>Hi Squanch Moose</p>

</p><p>If you suspect someone of cheating it is always recommended to report and block the player and the Enforcement Team will look into the situation. I also recommend not engaging them, as this may result in you yourself violating the Xbox Code of Conduct.</p>

            you should report it and if possible try to make a screenshot of the time when the cheat is used and much better would be able to record a clip of the moment you notice the use of the cheat.

            Hello, my is Bella.&nbsp; Besides reporting someone you suspect of cheating on Xbox&gt;&gt;&gt;you can report these claims to the game developers.&nbsp; Most games like Destiny, Overwatch, and Fortnite have a system in place to where you can report a player directly from
 the game.&nbsp; I recommend you ultilize those options.&nbsp; They look into these claims and if they see they are cheating/using exploits they will get banned.&nbsp;

<p>I also think that the OP doesn't realize that unless K&amp;M support is coded into the game, there isn't really an advantage.&nbsp; They just wanted to yell at someone.</p>
