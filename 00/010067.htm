            McAfee and other antivirus programs cannot be used on win 10. You must use the built in Defender. If you have any McAfee installed, uninstall it and use the cleaner utility from McAfee to make sure all bits left behind are removed. You don't start Win
 Defender manually. It is completely automatic. Check the Action Center to see if there is a problem.&nbsp;

<p>I had not updated to 9860 only the 9841&nbsp;&nbsp;but I got an alert from action centre to turn off newly downloaded AVG Free.&nbsp;&nbsp; Malwarbytes is still running, was not alerted to disable it.&nbsp; Is Defender going to stop malware?&nbsp; Do I need the extra software?</p>

</p><p>It really does not matter which version of win 10.&nbsp; McAfee is just not compatible with it yet.&nbsp; If you also have AVG you need to remove that as well (you can only use 1 active malware app).&nbsp; Defender does a good enough job at least until the release of win
 10 (the current version is a beta) when the malware developers will have working malware apps.</p>

            <p>The awkwardness here is caused by the fact that the devs didn't intend for 3rd party anti-virus/anti-malware programs to be installed....the Windows Defender program that they built into the system is really (in my opinion) quite good, and, although some
 3rd party party security programs will at least <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
seem</span> work in the Win 10 preview, some may cause problems because they have only been developed and tested for earlier Windows versions, not this one.</p>
<p>Eventually, all of those 3rd party security programs will be developed and tested to support Windows 10, but that's for then, not now.
</p>
<p>If you install one of them now, you'll need to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
uninstall</span> it each time you go to upgrade to a new build of the preview, and that can be an extra, unneeded hassle; then, when you reinstall it in the new build, it may appear to work, while, in fact, causing problems that you may believe to be bugs on
 the OS.</p>
<p>The Windows Defender program that's built into the preview is set so that is not easily turned off, other than by installing a 3rd party security program; and then, when the 3rd party program is uninstalled, it does not usually turn Windows Defender back
 on, which can be a problem if you decide not to reinstall the 3rd party progam in the new build.</p>
<p>In such a situation, you can turn win def back on by running "sc start WinDefend Enable" in the Command Prompt (run as Administrator). It will then continue to run, as the devs intended. In the system services, where you can normally select various settings,
 the devs have "manual" locked in, so that you can't change it, but Defender will continue, once have restarted it.&nbsp;

            I had similar problem as had Microsoft essentials installed before upgrade. you should go back to previous version delete the antivirus protection for both then re-install windows 10 then defender will work and is very effective. I also downloaded free
 version of Malwarebytes to be sure but each time I have run this the system has been clean so defender is doing the job it is supposed to do

<p>I have McAffee with windows 10 since July, ended up with an infection that was expensive to remove.&nbsp; I just got my computer back.&nbsp; The tech refused to discuss&nbsp; Windows Defender vs McAffee,&nbsp; He advised me to "run both".&nbsp; I would like uninstall McAfee and
 use WD, but&nbsp; can't afford to take it back in to the store.&nbsp; Is there any help on the net for those of us are not computer experts?&nbsp;

            <p>Microsoft Word is supposed to be able to open that format but you have to force it to do it and the version of Word that is in the RT is about 98% of the actual x86 based Word used on regular Windows computers and may not have the filter within it.</p>

<p>What you will have to do is convert the files over and you will need to do that with a regular computer.&nbsp; Microsoft has a converter that you can download from here:

<p>The WPS format was originally for Microsoft Word 2000 and later was used in Microsoft Works.&nbsp; Both are completely defunct now.&nbsp; A lot of people are still using Works since it came free with a lot of computers still in use today and can't blame anybody for
 still using it but those people need to "upgrade" because almost nobody can open that file format.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Download the converter to a regular computer and move those WPS files over to it.&nbsp; Convert them and then move them over to the RT.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>DO NOTE: that when convert those files to edit and send back, those people using Microsoft Works will not be able to open it!&nbsp; A regular "Pandora's Box" situation you have there.</p>

            Word comes with converters for Works document versions 6 to 9. Earlier Works versions require an older filter. You can get the older filter linked from the downloads page of my web site
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/downloads.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/downloads.htm</a> &nbsp; but I have no experience with the Surface and its operating system so I cannot confirm that it will be possible to install it in the same way as with (say) Windows 7.<br />

    <title>Changing the Default Spacing in Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephen r.prescott, esq.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing the Default Spacing in Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>Word 2010, as everyone knows comes with Calibri 11 point as the default.&nbsp; Changing the default was simple on 2003, decipherable on 2007, and inscrutable with 2010.&nbsp; The technican could not change mine at the office, then I figured out how to do&nbsp;it.&nbsp; At my
 house, the options were different, even though it was the same software license.</p>
<p>With extreme difficulty I managed to change the default margins, and finally the default type to Arial 12.&nbsp; However, I have never been able to change the default spacing from Normal to None in over a year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>This brings you back to what you said you didn't understand in the first place:<br />
<br />
If all else fails, you can fall back on the old techniques, directly edit NORMAL.DOT(M). Open NORMAL.DOT(M) for editing, make your changes and save the changes<br />
</p>
<p>1. Open Word.</p>
<p>2. Open the Normal.dotm template</p>
<p>3. Apply the "No Spacing" (as I think it is actually called) style</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Save the template.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Close and reopen Word.</p>

<h2>            Office Crashing on Save As</h2>
                    <p>After the latest update, Word, Excel, and Powerpoint all stop responding if I choose Save as. It does not happen if I only choose to save a previously saved item. When I close it, I get a notification that says this- The exception unknown software exception
 0xe0000002 word occurred in the application at location 0x0000000007491b782. I don't have any add-ins, I used the repair option, I emptied the; autosave folder, I uninstalled and reinstalled Office. I tried to use F12 instead and got the same result&nbsp;when I
 attempted to browse. I tried everything in safe mode for Windows and Office. Windows and Office are up to date and validated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Points of interest</p>
<p>
</p><p>*It doesn't appear to happen if I use OneDrive. </p>
<p>*When I put all the files in the documents folder into a subfolder the hangup ended, but when I try to browse any folder that has other files and documents in it the hangup reappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-upon further investigation</p>
<p>*Will not browse any folder with .jpg files or browse entire computer. It will browse a selected empty folder and save there or one with only document files.</p>

            Upon further investigation, I discovered that the Windows 10 installation had been damaged in some way with the 1803 update to where printing was not possible on this desktop no matter what printer you hooked up without getting that same error.&nbsp; I attempted
 disk checks as well as sfc and DISM repairs to no avail.&nbsp; I did an in-place upgrade on top of the existing Windows 10 installation and that resolved my issue.

            We need an actual screenshot of the email (including clickable links) to be sure but there are a couple of things you can check yourself.&nbsp; First legitimate emails have a green lock in the address bar, second when you mouse over any links they must clearly
 point to a ms site.&nbsp; Additionally if you are asked for personal information like DOB, passwords, etc it is a fake because Microsoft already has your info.<br />

If it turns out to be a scam you can report it here report_spam AT outlook.com

    <title>New PC&#58; migrating from Outlook 2010 POP3 to Outlook 2016 IMAP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dzaat  say:</h3>
<h2>            New PC&#58; migrating from Outlook 2010 POP3 to Outlook 2016 IMAP</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read through countless topics on here relating to migrating from POP3 to IMAP but I'm afraid it has only made me more confused than when I started ...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have built a new PC as my old one is pretty ancient and suffering with performance and reliability issues (a bit like me ...) On this old PC I am running Outlook 2010 (under Windows 7) and have approximately 25,000 e-mail messages in the Inbox (which is
 under the heading "personal folders"). I am only running ONE e-mail account and use POP3 to access the messages. My motivation to migrate to the IMAP accessing protocol is that I would like to synchronise my e-mails between all of my divices (PC, Tablet &amp;
 Phone).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new PC is running Outlook 2016 (under Windows 10) and I have not yet configured a new profile in Outlook so it is still a "clean" installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I want to end up with:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to set up an IMAP profile for this one e-mail address - this I can do without a problem.</p>
<p>What I would also like is to replicate my old Inbox folder structure (including all of the e-mails) separately from the IMAP inbox folder structure. What I want to avoid at all cost is that once I've added the old inbox e-mails it'll start synchronising
 ALL of them to the server! I just want the old e-mails to be accessable by me so that I can find information and contact details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I'm confused about:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) Outlook 2010 and 2016 maintain different folder structures (.pst vs .ost) - I think that these two can exist side-by-side without interfering with each other, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) Assuming that I can eventually set up Outlook 2016 in the way I outlined above, can I drag-n-drop/copy-n-paste e-mails I wish to keep from the IMAP inbox to the POP3 inbox structure? The mailbox size on the server is limited to 1 Gb by my ESP so it would
 be good to be able to move some messages to an "off-line" storage file (ie. the old POP3 inbox).</p>
<p>
</p><p>(3) How do I go about moving the old .pst file from Outlook 2010 on the old PC into Outlook 2016 on the new PC? Should I do this FIRST before setting up the IMAP profile or the other way around? I'm not sure if I understood correctly but it would appear
 that you can have one or multiple .pst files without them being associated with an active profile, right?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realise that what I'm asking has probably been discussed many times before but even after reading through heaps of discussions I still can't make head-or-tail of it. My apologies for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read through my query and thank you in advance for any and all feedback you can provide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,<br />
<br />
Dan</p>

            <p>On the old PC with Outlook *closed* copy all pst data files to a memory stick, and thence to \My Documents\Outlook Files\ on the new PC - generally your primary pst data file will be labeled outlook.pst</p>
<p>On the new PC configure MS Outlook using the mail account auto setup, where only the mail account and password is entered, the mail a/c should be 'discovered' after a short time, then finish the process</p>
<p>Allow the mail account to sync, after which in MS Outlook, File&gt;Open &amp; Export&gt;Open Outlook Data File&gt;Browse to and select the primary pst you copied, complete the process. Your Personal Folders &amp; their contents will appear in the Outlook Tree view pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be aware Calendar/People/Tasks in an IMAP account are stored in folders marked "This PC only" and will be lost if the mail account is reset

                    I have been using word and word online since mid 2017. I have always had the issue of being unable to copy and paste text between documents. My professors upload our assignments as Word documents and I do not have word 2016, so I use word online. I am
 able to view the document but not change anything. The issue I have is I will copy the assignment, wanting to paste it into a word online document or a google doc, but nothing happens. I use edge browser.&nbsp;

<p>Hi <strong>masmarissa</strong>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue that you’ve encountered with pasting a text into a Word Online document is most probably related to the browser. Regarding this concern, I’d like to ask the questions below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you confirm if the document is a <strong>shared file saved in OneDrive</strong>?</li><li>Does the file have <strong>permission </strong>to make changes?</li><li>Are you getting an <strong>error message</strong> when you’ve tried to paste texts into the document?</li><li>Does the issue also occur in <strong>other files </strong>or just with a <strong>
specific document</strong>?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I’d suggest that you try accessing the file using a <strong>different web browser</strong> for isolation purposes. This will help us determine if there are conflicts that have occurred and can be the cause of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I’ll be waiting for your response.</p>

<h3> joflow217  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel vba to open Access query that includes a user defined function</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Access database that includes multiple queries, one of which calls a user defined function.&nbsp; When I run my final query from Access, it runs all of the queries without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to run it from Excel vba, I get error 3085 - Undefined function 'SAL' in expression.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"SAL" is the name of my function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my code in Excel...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Public Sub GetFinalCensus()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim db As DAO.Database<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim EErecords As DAO.Recordset</p>
<p>&nbsp;Set db = OpenDatabase(RELIUS_USERS_ACCESSDATABASEFILEPATH &amp; RELIUS_USERS_ACCESSDATABASE)<br />
&nbsp;Set EErecords = db.OpenRecordset("qry_2b_renameHeaders")<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that before I added the UDF to my query in Access, everything ran fine from the Excel vba.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me to figure out how to fix this and let me know if there is additional information needed.&nbsp; Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>You need to have your contacts stored on the phones memory if this will work on this handset im not sure,but go to contacts select options and see what options are present if any.</p>
<p>you should look for add content/detail. etc.</p>

<p>you can do it and no need extra applicaion:</p>
<p>1. setup one new&nbsp;group in your phonebook. (menu-&gt;contacts-&gt;groups)</p>
<p>2. move the contact to this group</p>
<p>3. go to the group details to select one ringtone (groups-&gt;options-&gt;group details)</p>

<p>Hi Bud</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the keystroke combination of <strong>Control+A</strong> to select the entire document.</li><li>From the Review tab select the Language menu button and from it choose Set Proofing Language. A screen clip of it is below.</li><li>Make sure your preferred language is set properly</li><li>No matter how the checkbox of Do Not Check Spelling ... is set click on it until it is clearly a checkmark.</li><li>Now click OK to record your choice</li><li>Without changing anything and your entire resume still selected, reopen the Set Proof Language dialog</li><li>Clear the Do Not Check Spelling... checkbox</li><li>Click OK to record your choice</li></ol>
<p>This should clear out an problem paragraph marks that were holding onto an errant setting for not spelling and grammar checking.</p>

            <p>While it's simple matter to turn it off, either via the Review tab or by adding the track changes item to the status bar (Right click on the Status bar, you need to be a bit careful, because it is a toggle and if you double click, you will turn it back on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing that you could do would be create AutoOpen and AutoNew macros in your Normal.dotm template or in a template that you save in the Word Startup folder that contain the following code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With ActiveDocument<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If .TrackRevisions = True Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .TrackRevisions = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End With<br />

            In addition to Doug's suggestion, you have to initially make sure to "Accept" all changes to clear any outstanding changes that have been "accidentally" tracked.
<br />
<br />
You may also want to remove the &lt;CTL&gt;&lt;SHF&gt;&lt;E&gt; shortcut key combo to prevent accidentally turning track changes on that way.<br />

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just updated to the new build, and was keen to try out AutoSave, however, I'm getting "AutoSave is currently unavailable" despite the file being on OneDrive. Additionally, the tool tip is not giving any of the additional details that this page suggests it
 should do: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-AutoSave-6d6bd723-ebfd-4e40-b5f6-ae6e8088f7a5?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>I tried searching for outlook.exe it's not there, and I've uninstalled and reinstalled. I don't really know much other than that, but I'vel ooked at the other questions/answer on here, thinking I could figure it out on my own, but I'm stumped! It was working
 fine one day now it's not. </p>

            <p>No, don't use compatiblity mode. That should not be selected. Never. It's not needed. The usual cause of this error is because compatiblity mode is enabled.
</p>
<p>What type of email account do you use? </p>
<p>Try opening outlook with the /resetnavpane switch:</p>
<p>Close Outlook. At the Start search field on Vista or Windows7 Start menu or in the Start menu, Run command (Windows key + R), type</p>
<p>outlook.exe /resetnavpane </p>
<p>Then press Enter (or OK button) to restart Outlook.</p>
