<p>I downloaded all 3 of the DLC packs for Painkiller, and while The Clock Strikes Meat Night works ok (if a little broken - the Bridge level especially is buggier than

<p><span>I have deleted and re-downloaded both DLC packs but still no content other than the extra maps.</span></p>
<p>Any idea what's going on?<span><br />

            <p>Hey there Gasp!<br /><br />I'm sorry to hear about the issues with that DLC. Let's see what we can do to get things sorted.<br /><br /><strong>To start things off, here's a few questions to help us better understand the situation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Can you list out specifically what parts of the DLCs that you're unable to access?</li>
<li>Are you able to access any other multiplayer skins? Which ones?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Are you able to access the co-op survival mode?</li>
</ol>
<p><br />Let us know and we'll work with you from there! ^_^&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi. thanks for getting back to me quickly</p>
<p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1) I appear to be missing the option for Solo Survival - (I can play Survival through the multiplayer option, but I could do that anyway, before the DLC). plus the new multiplayer skins: SS Zombie and Leper from Full Metal Rocket are missing.
</p>
<p>From the Medieval Horror pack, I appear to be missing multiplayer Skin: White Demon and Multiplayer Skin: Assassin Greed.and the Environmental Weapon: Parcel Gun (unless this refers to the cannons in the map Inhumator). Also, I am not sure if the expansion
 of Survival Mode: Players can now progress through maps in a similar manner to the campaign coop mode (i.e. It's no longer limited to a specific spot in a map/chapter) only applies to a few maps or is for all of them.</p>
<p>2) I can access multiplayer skins from Daniel through to Devil Monk under the "Player Settings" option but none of the ones listed in any of the DLC content.</p>
<p>3) I can play survival mode online with others from the multiplayer menu. Basically, the only Survival option I have is from the Multiplayer menu which was there before the DLC.</p>
<p>All maps appear to be present and the only changes to the main menu are under Campaign for the new levels from the The Clock Strikes Meat Night pack.</p>
<p>Hope this helps shed some light on the situation.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>Hey there Dying,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you're having such issues with your DLC.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you've tried some troubleshooting steps, but I would recommend trying them in this exact order:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear your system cache</a>&nbsp;- 3 times
</li><li>Delete your Marketplace System Data<br />
&nbsp; </li></ul>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>On your console, go to&nbsp;<b>settings</b>, and then select&nbsp;<b>System</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Storage</b>, and then select your primary storage device. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>System Items</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Marketplace System Data</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Delete</b>.<br />
&nbsp; </li></ol>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Turn off your console </li><li>Turn on your console </li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download your profile</a>

<div><br />
<br />
I would also recommend making a post over in the <a href="http://forum.nordicgames.at/forumdisplay.php?891-Painkiller-Hell-amp-Damnation-English-Boards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Painkiller H &amp; D forums</a> as I have not been able to find any information on other people experiencing this same issue with their skins.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please keep us posted on how things go.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hey. I followed the above instructions, clearing the cache, deleting marketplace system data and re-downloading the DLC but it hasn't made a difference - still no Solo Survival or extra skins. Really strange. No idea what's going on. Will try and post on
 the Painkiller forum and see if anyone else is having issues. </p>

<p>Ok, as much as I love the game, the DLC is an absolute broken mess. Not only am I missing a lot of content that I have paid for (skins and game modes), but even the stuff I do have is bugged to the point of being unplayable, with enemies failing to spawn
 making it impossible to finish levels, and some serious collision detection issues.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone can help me get this sorted out (not that I don't appreciate the suggestions made so far), but I am far from satisfied with the quality of the product I have paid good money for.

            <p>Hey again Gasp!<br /><br />I can totally understand that this could be frustrating. At this point, it definitely looks like you should get in touch with <a href="http://www.thefarm51.com/index.php?module=contact&amp;menu=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The Farm 51</a>&nbsp;(click on "EN" in the top right hand corner for English) and inform them of the issues you're having with their DLC. This is something that falls on them to correct and fix.<br /><br />I realize that you might would rather just get a refund and not have to deal with this (which is totally understandable). If so, just use the <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a> page to set up a support call/chat with an agent and they can go over your refund options with you.<br /><br />I sincerely hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi Mister Cerb.</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back to me again. While I am a little frustrated, it's not the end of the world and I'm not really worried about a refund.</p>
<p>I'll get in touch with The Farm 51 and just take it from there.</p>

<p>Just had the following response from Nordic Games:</p>
<p>"Hello,</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is a mistake with the description because we had to take that out of the DLCs. The other content should work fine though. "</p>
<p>That explains it then. Not particularly good business practice but at least I'm not going mad.

<p>Hey Dying,<br />

That is really weird but I'm glad you were able to figure out what was happening.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this will help anyone else running into that issue as well.<br />

<h2>            Anton</h2>
                    <p>I have a desktop PC with XP installed on the C drive, &nbsp;but want to upgrade this PC to Windows 10. &nbsp; Today purchased the Windows 10 Home flashdrive. &nbsp; Some time ago I&nbsp;purchased a 500GB Sata HDD which was Formatted to NTFS format. &nbsp;I want to install Windows
 10 on this 500GB drive, and make it the boot drive, &nbsp;but keep XP on the current HDD because not all my software Apps will work on Windows 10.</p>
<p>How would I go about setting up a boot selection option on startup ie. XP or Win10. &nbsp;I noticed in the Win10 booklet it states to make the PC startup from the flashdisk for the installation to begin. If I disconnect the present C drive HDD and then boot the
 PC up with the Win10 USB flashdisk, &nbsp;will this work?</p>
<p>

            <p>I assume you have checked to make sure your hardware is supported in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should disconnect the hard drive with XP on it and connect the 500G hard drive. You need to set the bios to boot from USB (not all older motherboards do that). You may have been better with a DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some motherboards have a key to press during boot to select the boot device, others require you to enter the bios. Often DEL or F2 to enter the bios but I can't guess that.</p>

            <p>On my PC I can select the boot device. Similar to what you need to boot from the USB. That would allow you to select either the Win 10 drive or Win XP drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have that type of option. Have you installed Windows 10 on the 500G drive and does it work ok. If you have both drives connected and install Windows 10 on the 500G drive (you will need to be sure you select the correct drive during the install) Then
 Windows 10 may set up the option to select the OS during boot. But I have to be honest I'm not sure about that.</p>

    <title>OndDrive paused automatically - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charliews  say:</h3>
<h2>            OndDrive paused automatically</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 10 Home, OneDrive personal, and a laptop using WiFi for the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I constantly create documents and save them to my laptop's OneDrive - Document folder. And they will automatically be saved to my OneDrive cloud storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I don't like the way Windows 10 updates pushed to my laptop automatically, I set my WiFi as metered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my OneDrive got "paused" automatically. It is a pain to have to remember to re-sync OneDrive manually all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way, in my situation, to have OneDrive not to "pause" automatically?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>
<p />

            Hey Charlie,
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, there is no way to have OneDrive not pause automatically when your connection is metered. There is no mention of it in the OneDrive settings at all, or any group policy to change this. They had such an option in PC settings on Windows 8/8.1, but not anymore. I'd recommend you take this to Microsoft through their Feedback Hub, and send them this feedback. Good luck.

    <title>Computer Shutting Down After Disconnecting From Charger - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Computer Shutting Down After Disconnecting From Charger</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of my coworkers and I have recently encountered an issue with our laptops shutting down once they are removed from the charging, even though the battery is showing 100%. I am wondering if anyone else has had this issue, and if it could potentially
 be linked to any Windows update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Matt, <br />
<br />
Conflicts with the power plan settings is one of the possible reasons why your laptop is shutting down once the charger is removed. A power plan is a collection of hardware and system settings that manages how your computer uses power. Resetting the power plan
 to default sometimes resolve the issue. To reset power plan to defaults, kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows </strong><strong>key</strong>, and type <strong>command
</strong><strong>prompt</strong>, and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Copy and paste the command below into the command prompt, and press Enter.<br />
<br />
<strong>powercfg -restoredefaultschemes.</strong><br />
<br />
</li><li>When finished, you can close the command prompt.</li></ol>
<p><br />
Should you need further assistance, don't hesitate to get back to us.</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me to provide you with appropriate suggestions and recommendations, I would like to know what the F drive was. Was it a mapped drive, a USB storage device, an external hard drive, or a partition on the internal hard drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, please look into your <em>Recycle bin</em> and check if the deleted drive is there. If it's there, right-click it and click
<strong>Restore</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Vanessa it was an portable hard drive just for storing movies. It was the 1st time of using it. It did come up as reading it but the short cut was 'denied' and I deleted it by mistake. It came under the same thing as USB flash drives etc....</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>Regards&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for getting back, Dave. Have you tried plugging in your portable hard drive into another USB port on your laptop? Has it been recognized again? If you haven't tried this yet, then please do for us to know if Windows still recognizes it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your portable hard drive is not showing up on your computer, then please look into the
<em>Disk Management </em>and see if a removable disk is there. Just right-click the
<em>Windows key </em>and select <strong>Disk Management</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, what Windows operating system is your computer on? To check, please follow the steps provided on this link,
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Which Windows operating system am I running?</a>.</p>

            Alright, I removed all of the Symantec and replaced it with Avast. I don't have anything to backup my computer with at the time, but I have discovered a cause. Sometimes after picking up my laptop and placing it somewhere else it will freeze/bluescreen/restart.
 The first few times in the past month I thought were a coincidence. However, I was just messing around (turning it on its side and what not) if it would happen again, and it did. Same error. Another thing to note is that it was barely emitting heat at the
 time and started to burn to the touch on the vent during the restart. Could this be a faulty physical part?

</p><p>Edit- I have refreshed the system. It is going pretty slow, but is getting faster. Right now I am downloading windows updates and some of the major programs I had. It returned to its early 2013 state, so the updates will most likely fix the performance/speed

<h2>            Random Crashes with CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION Blue Screen Error &#40;Kernel Power ID 41 Task 63&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone! For a few days now I have been getting random crashes every 20-40 minutes with a blue screen error on my Windows 8.1 Desktop saying CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION I searched around a bit and eventually checked my Event Viewer and found Event
 ID 41 Task 63 error saying</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do? I haven't found any fix for this at all yet! After around 20-40 minutes of my computer being on (using it or not) Before this started happening I did have a few updates that required restarts on my computer. One being from AVG and another being
 my Roxio Game Capture HD PRO recording software for my capture card for my video game systems. I updated both but never restarted. The day this started I was changing my room around and I shut down my computer the proper way (not using power button) but it
 had applications still running and I clicked "Force Shut Down". I do remember my computer's light blinking around the power button before I unplugged it and rearranged my room. Maybe it was still updating or something. Next time I turned my computer back on,
 I got the CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION blue screen error after around 20 minutes of it just sitting idle. It's still happening after a few days every 20-40 minutes. No matter what I do! Even if I haven't even signed in and gone to my desktop yet!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea of what the error could be from? Any help would be appreciated! Here are some of the specs I remember off the top of my head:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Processor: Intel i5 3330 Quad core 3GHz</p>
<p>Graphics Card: EVGA Geforce GTX 750 2GB Ti</p>
<p>RAM: 8GB DDR3 RAM</p>
<p>Power Supply: Ultra 600W PSU</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's all I can remember but if all specs are needed then I'll post them when I get home. I already looked on here:&nbsp;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2028504/en-us#method3 and nothing has helped so far. I can't find any solution to this. My computer has been
 completely fine for the past 9 months I've had it and never had any issues up till after I changed my room around. Any help would be great! Thanks in advance!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Probably a hardware&nbsp;issue, be sure to check the memory very carefully (see methods below).<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power then reseat the cards, memory, and cables (on both ends when possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug.<br />

Be sure to check with the System Maker's Support (Motherboard Maker for custom<br />
systems), their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums (if any)<br />
about any known issues. Be sure to update the<strong> BIOS, low level chipset drivers,
<br />
and the other major on-board and separate device drivers</strong>. Those alone may
<br />
resolve some or all of these issues.<br />
<br />
Note&nbsp;using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run, and Settings<br />
as needed). <strong>Win Key + D</strong> calls the desktop and the using <strong>
Win Key</strong> toggles Desktop <br />
and Start Screen.<br />

=========================================================</p>
<p><br />
Does the system have RAID? If so that is also&nbsp;very suspect.<br />
<br />
This error is usually a driver&nbsp;issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though it could be others.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software issues&nbsp;can also cause the error. When you get to the driver section
 of the troubleshooter use my generic&nbsp;methods below and then return to the troubleshooter if needed.
<br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti- spyware/security programs.<br />

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : <br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView -&nbsp;set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names (and BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created
 the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version
 info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

    <title>Scam call&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom graham7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scam call&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I received a call today from a guy who claimed he was from Microsoft and I was being hacked and my info was being used fraudulently ( I usually ignore these type of calls but as he was stating I was being hacked I was curious as they usually state they need
 to control the computer where this guy didn't say that) So I reluctantly turned on my pc and followed his first steps(A fool?) which were:</p>
<p>HOLD START AND PRESS R,</p>
<p>TYPE EVENTRVWR</p>
<p>SELECT ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS</p>
<p>he then told me that the errors shown there were proof of my being hacked</p>
<p>I told him that before I went any further I had to make sure that he was legitimate and asked If I could get a contact number and possibly call him back he gave me a number (01618182363) and he insisted I used my mobile fo, I first typed the number into
 my browser and it showed that it was unknown so I told him&nbsp; that I will find the official number for his centre which he told me was in Reading(he also told me his name was Jason Morris and also gave me his ID number (which I'm not giving out in case this
 is all somehow legitimate) He called me a mother****er and I replied with a **** you (abit rude of me I know) and I dropped the call, he then called back and I told him I didn't believe this was legitimate and I will contact Microsoft.&nbsp;I know this is most
 likely a scam as I'm sure Microsoft do not cold call&nbsp;people but is there a chance this is legitimate?&nbsp;(in which case I really need to contact Microsoft but I thought I'd ask for advice).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a Scam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the advice we give about unsolicited phone calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>These so-called "Microsoft" Tech Companies either want to sell you worthless software, or gain Remote Access to your Computer to try and&nbsp;steal your Banking and Credit Card details and to also carry out an Indentity Theft on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are the only one who knows if you have given them Remote Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have given them Remote Access and if&nbsp;you do Internet Banking, contact your Bank, explain it to them and change Passwords.</p>
<p>If you use your Credit Card online, cancel it and get a new one issued to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the only way that you willl know that you are free of them is to save your Data and do a clean install of your Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Microsoft does not contact you, unless YOU have made prior arrangements with them to do so.</p>
<p>There is a section in the link I&nbsp;am supplying you&nbsp;about this at the end of it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read this Microsoft Information:</p>

<div>Since they *might* have installed a key logger, simply changing your passwords without first reinstalling Windows may not be good enough.</div>

            <p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for coming back and informing us that you're able to open Windows Live Mail using another user account in your PC. If you still want to resolve this issue using your own user account, then we request you to follow the additional troubleshooting steps
 below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Close Windows Live Mail and any other Windows Live&nbsp;programs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2. Click <strong>Start</strong> (then <strong>Run</strong> for Windows XP), paste the following path below and press Enter:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>%Localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Calendars</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3. Rename the folder of the account you use to sign in to Windows Live Mail to sync your calendar (ex. rename *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>4. Restart your computer for the&nbsp;changes to take effect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>5. Launch Windows Live&nbsp;Mail again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, it could be a contacts cache issue wherein Windows Live&nbsp;Mail can't pull cache. We request you to try the
</span><span>steps outlined in the articles below (depending on the version of your Windows Live Mail):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/messenger-people/how-to-clear-messenger-2009-contacts-cache-and/a82cdb10-a30d-4c60-86b3-8f81402ffde2">How to clear Messenger 2009 contacts cache and temporary files</a></span></p>

<p>Thank you for the information. It looks like the issue is isolated to your own account on the PC you're using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For us to continue with the investigation, we need to ask more information from you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><b><span>1. Windows Live Setup Logs: </span></b><span>Look for the Logs folder from the following path:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Windows XP</span></b><span>: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\WLSetup</span></p>
<p><b><span>Windows Vista and Window 7</span></b><span>: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\WLSetup</span></p>
<p><span>If you cannot find the ProgramData folder, it is because the folder is hidden.
</span></p>
<p><span>In the \WLSetup folder, look for the Logs folder. Zip/compress a copy of the folder (by right-click on the Logs folder name, select<b>send to</b> and
<b>compressed (zipped) folder</b> and attach it when you respond to Private Message.</span></p>

            Bob, you've been led a merry dance by a succession of forum moderators. I suspect that you haven't told us the whole story, because the error you're seeing indicates that the hard drive on which your store folder&nbsp;lives is a different one from the one it
 was originally located on, or that you have recently changed the storage manager that controls the drive.&nbsp;Is this the case?<br />
<br />
If so, then the problem you're facing has nothing to do with calendars specifically. It may affect any application on your computer&nbsp;that uses ESENT databases stored on the same drive. This includes Windows Search, Windows Update, Event Viewer and several others.
 Windows Live Mail reports it as a calendar error only&nbsp;because the calendar database is the first one that the program tries to load. The message database and possibly the contacts databases will be equally affected, but the program never gets as far as trying
 to load them.<br />
<br />
If you have indeed recently installed a new hard drive, most probably a bigger one than before that uses large sector sizes, please see this article for a description of the problem:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2510009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft support policy for 4K sector hard drives in Windows</a><br />
<br />
Your best bet is to visit the hardware manufacturer's website to search for possible solutions.<br />
<br />

<p>Was working on a csv file, adding &amp; editing, and saving, or so I thought.</p>
<p>When I open it up, none of my work is saved, in fact the original data sheet has disappeared too. I do not appear to have the option to restore previous versions when I right click on the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas please?</p>

<p>The 'type' of file doesn't matter here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verify (thru the list of recent files in Excel) that what you are opening is the right file. &nbsp;Maybe you did a save-as and saved it elsewhere last time on accident and didn't notice/forgot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, other than backups (that you setup and maintain) - looks like you will be rebuilding/redoing some work.</p>

<div>
<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command 3 times restarting the PC after each time to completely fix everything that it's able to.
<br />
<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth </span>
</strong></a>command to repair any component store corruption, restart the PC afterwards, and try the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command again.<br />
<br />
If still not, then try using <strong>OPTION ONE</strong> above to run the <strong>
sfc /scannow</strong> command at boot<br />
<br />
If still not, then you could do a <strong><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2293-refresh-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">refresh</span></a></strong> of Windows 8, or run a

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />
<br />
If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the <strong>OPTION THREE</strong> section&nbsp;to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.

            <p>Those are not anti-viruses but malware scanners.&nbsp; Malwarebtyes also offers Real Time Protection but it is slightly different than an anti-virus and so can be run alongside Defender if you find you get infected while using only Defender.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But do continue to use the standalone scanner for Malwarebytes and I would recommend updating to the slightly better
<a href="http://www.malwareremovalguides.info/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AdwCleaner</a> instead of SAS which (like Spybot)&nbsp; is dated now.</p>

<p>As well as the built-in Windows Defender being used as your Antivirus, the free Malwarebytes is good to use as it is an on-demand scanner, not real time scanner.</p>

            Could you try this first?
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed. 
<br />
<br />Try this additional tips to see if they work:

<br />
<br />If you still continue to experience problems...
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

            Renaming your software distribution folder could never make your computer inoperable. You must have renamed an important system folder.

            Hi,
<br />Use the Media creation tool.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.
