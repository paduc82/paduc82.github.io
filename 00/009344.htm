<h2>            Property value too large</h2>
                    <p>I am creating a database in Access 2010 based on a fairly long survey. There are a total of 167 fields and most of those have combo boxes with several text boxes as the data type. My plan is to create a form from this to look like the survey itself. This
 makes data entry easy for the temps at the agency who will be doing the actual data entry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to add combo boxes to just 12 more fields, but I am getting the error message, "Property value is too large" when I try to save my changes. I have tried compact and repair several times, I increased the maximum locks per file from 9500 to 15000,
 and I split the main table from the seven very small tables that many of the combo box values are pulling from into separate files and linked them together, but none of that has worked. I have read about normalization, but that doesn't seem to apply to my
 situation. I don't think I can compact anything down because once the data is in the file, it will be exported to SPSS where the analysis will be done, so each field has to be separate. Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You might want to consider normalizing your table structure so that every answer to every question creates it's own record. Questions are stored in a questions table with one record per question. There is a sample of how this can be implemented at

            <p>Thank you, I will look into that. There are several questions that will have multiple answers from each respondent. For example, one question asks respondents to rate 5 different factors 1-5, so that one question needs to have 5 responses (right now each
 is in its own field). Will normalizing the way you describe allow for that?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>A survey database requires a very specific structure and it is NOT one where each question is a field. That is a spreadsheet design not a database design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need the following tables at the least:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblQuestion</p>
<p>QuestionID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>Question</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblRespondent</p>
<p>RespondentID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>FirstName&nbsp;</p>
<p>LastName</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblResponse</p>
<p>ResponseID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>RespondentID (FK)</p>
<p>ResponseDate</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblAnswer</p>
<p>AnswerID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>QuestionID (FK)</p>
<p>Answer</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be other tables or other fields you need, but that is the basic structure.</p>

<h2>            MS Project Free Trial Not Recognizing Email Address</h2>
                    I recently started a new position and my work computer that will include the MS Project software hasn't arrived yet. I figured I would attempt to get some work done in the mean time by downloading the free trial on my personal computer. I went through
 the initial download and installation process using my outlook.com email address. I received a welcome email from MS relating to Project with a link to a setup guide. I am attempting to open Project and it is asking for my email and password to log into my
 Microsoft account. I enter the email I registered it to (at which I received my confirmation) and it is telling me that that address isn't associated with my office subscription. What is the issue here and how do I fix it so that I can complete my tasks?&nbsp;

<h2>            Outlook 2016 bug</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have just setup a new O365 tenancy for a customer, but can't get their MS Outlook to connect to their mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the main details:</p>
<p>O/S (on 3 different computers) Win 10 Pro 64bit</p>
<p>Office : 2016 with latest updates</p>
<p>O365 : Business Essentials - just using it for Exchange Online for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue : Cant add the Email address, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***' on any of the machines - they all fail with the 'something went wrong' (useless.....) message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Testing done so far:</p>
<p>Tried to setup the same account on my Win 7 with Office 2016 machine - failed</p>
<p>Tried uninstalling Office 2016 on one of the 3 PC's that will share this mailbox - success! (But not a solution - just using a 'trial' install)</p>
<p>Did the same on a 2nd of the 3 PC's - success again with Outlook 2013</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this brand new O365 mailbox can be installed/configured into Outlook 2013, but not Outlook 2016....... awesome</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did plenty of reading, and learnt about the EAS 'only' um,,,'feature'(?) of Outlook 2016 - great - way to make something better,,, Not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So tried all the wierd and wonderful work-arounds people have bee trying:</p>
<p>1) Tested the Autodiscover on the ECT website - tests as 'Correct' (Makes sense - that's how Outlook 2013 is getting the account setup after all.)</p>
<p>2) Tried adding the autodiscover IP to HOSTS file anyway - no change</p>
<p>3) Added the outlook.office365.com IP ping reply I got into the HOSTS file pointing to our 'domain.com' name to trick the other autodiscover path that Outlook apparently takes/tries - no change</p>
<p>4) Added the MapiHttpDisabled registry edit - no change</p>
<p>5) hit the 'Retry' button on the the 'Something went wrong' page repeatedly (Several people reckon 'it'll connect eventually') - no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously - how can Microsoft have their latest email software version not configurable to their latest hosted mail server - it defies belief?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Richard - I tried the System File Checker, and a new profile without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to try both 2013 and 2016 by installing and replacing the versions on the same machine. (2013 worked, 2016 didn't)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I had the Profile in 2013, I thought that re-installing 2016 would allow the Profile and it's conents to still be there in 2016 (That's what happened when I went 'back' to 2013) - no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find a 'solution' though!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the Autodiscover Test tool that comes with Outlook (CTRL and Right-Click the Outlook Icon down near your clock to pop-up the menu) - it seems that when you run the tool (Which tested fine by the way) - Windows/Office 'cache' the credentials etc. for
 the account you are testing. Once you do this (Run the Tool), simply go back to MS Outlook 2016 and try to add your O365 mailbox again - it worked for me on 3 different machines that previously wouldn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            How to kill an ongoing action &#40;moving message&#41; in Outlook 2011 &#63;</h2>
                    I have set up two accounts in Outlook 2011 (Outlook365 and Gmail) and I am using Gmail to archive my Outlook365 e-mails using the "Move Message" function. &nbsp;The message will disappear from the original folder and the uploading to Gmail appears to be happening
 in the background.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I erroneously moved an e-mail with an attachment that exceeds Gmail's size limitation (25MB). &nbsp; I am being bombarded with error messages because apparently Outlook 2011 does not stop trying to move the message to the Gmail folder.</div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>[ALERT] Message too large. http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?answer=8770</i></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can I kill the process in order to stop the continuous flow of error messages ?</div>

            ANSWER FOUND to this problem!!
<div>I spent several hours on phone with technician from Office for Mac 2011 (1-800-936-5700) to no avail. FINALLY, I was transferred to a Senior Technician who resolved this problem.</div>
<div>I hope this will be clear to follow...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Go to your "Sent items" folder &gt;click View (on very top menu bar) &gt; click Reading Pane - which gives you three options, &gt;click Hidden. &nbsp;This will give you all of your sent items in column form such as Subject/ To / Date Sent/Categories. &nbsp;In order to get
 to the "Size" column, I had to click on "View" (on very top menu bar), then click on Size so it would be shown on my screen. &nbsp;From there scroll through your emails to find any that are 25MB or greater, then "Delete" all of those.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Redo this process again for your "Deleted items" folder.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once you are finished, to return your Inbox to original setting, click View &gt; Reading Pane &gt; Right ( as in my case).</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is what the Sr. Technician did for me and instantly this ERROR message was gone after 6 months of this issue!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

            You can also try downloading the latest available video driver from Dells website for your model and install it in compatibility mode using the instructions in article I linked to.

    <title>Chart Line Width Formatting Changes from Excel 2010 to Excel 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris vecchio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chart Line Width Formatting Changes from Excel 2010 to Excel 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am writing to ask a question about changes to the line width formatting option in Excel from Excel 2010 to Excel 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Format Data Series dialog, clicking on the Width up or down arrow moves the width value up or down 0.25 pts. However, each 0.25 move does not change the visible width of the line. You need to play around with the thickness until you reach the point
 where the line gets visibly thicker or thinner. As an example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Excel 2010, changing the line thickness from 3.5 pt to 3.75 pt visibly increases the thickness of the line. Changing it from 3.25 to 3.5 shows no visible thickness change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Excel 2013, change the line thickness from 3.5 pt to 3.75 pt does not visibly increase the thickness of the line. In Excel 2013, changing the thickness from 3.25 to 3.75 gives a similar visible increase in thickness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This difference is causing issues with viewing charts created by colleagues using Excel 2010 and my colleagues viewing charts I created using Excel 2013.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I looked through the Excel options for both versions of Excel and didn't see any obvious changes that could cause this. I am guessing there is an underlying reason that I am missing because I am not familiar with how Excel chooses when lines become visibly
 thicker based on the Width parameter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help you can give would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Chris</p>

            <p>My suspicion is that the Windows 8 difference with 2013 is entirely due to the difference in TwixPerPixel between the systems on which we were running Windows 8 and those on which we were running Windows 7.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Experimenting with a 15 twipsPerPixel system in 2013, you can enter any line width you like in the box and the change in number of pixels occurs at 3.375pt, not at 3.5.&nbsp; I suspect there are 2 levels of rounding going on - the first to 0.25 pt. and then the
 inconsistent rounding from that value (3.5) to pixels.&nbsp; So, to force the thinner line for a 3.5pt line you would set the width to, say, 3.37 pt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will not give consistent numbers of pixels between systems with different TwixPerPixel settings though.&nbsp; The question then is whether you want a fixed number of pixels or a fixed width in points across those systems.&nbsp; If you want a fixed number N of
 pixels then set the width to N * TwipsPerPixel / 20 points.&nbsp; If you want a fixed width you're out of luck because only certain widths in points are possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get the TwipsPerPixel setting for your display you need to use a Windows API.<br />
This version is good for Excel 2010 and later:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Declare PtrSafe Function GetDC Lib "user32" (ByVal hWnd As LongPtr) As LongPtr</p>
&nbsp; (ByVal hdc As LongPtr, ByVal nIndex As Long) As Long<br />
Declare PtrSafe Function ReleaseDC Lib "user32" (ByVal hWnd As LongPtr, ByVal hdc As LongPtr) As Long<br />
Private Const HWND_DESKTOP As LongPtr = 0<br />
Private Const LOGPIXELSX As Long = 88<br />
Private Const LOGPIXELSY As Long = 90</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Function TwipsPerPixelX() As Single<br />
&nbsp; Dim lngDC As LongPtr<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; lngDC = GetDC(HWND_DESKTOP)<br />
&nbsp; TwipsPerPixelX = 1440 / GetDeviceCaps(lngDC, LOGPIXELSX)<br />
&nbsp; ReleaseDC HWND_DESKTOP, lngDC<br />
End Function</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">There is a similar function substituting X for Y, but I have not yet come across a system in which the TwipsPerPixel differ between the X and Y directions.&nbsp;

<h2>            Office 365 Blocked Senders Works Intermittently</h2>
                    <p>I have docwirenews.com in my Blocked Senders email list &amp; yet an email from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is in my inbox this morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the past few weeks other pieces of junk mail have likewise bypassed my filter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time a new piece of junk mail arrives, I open up my Blocked Senders &amp; add the top level domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Multiple times now, upon entering a domain, the list scrolls to the entry I just submitted, showing me that it is already in the list. The "save" button is disabled since no changes have been made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the domain was already in the Blocked Senders list, how is it in my inbox, rather than in my junk mail folder? I have no Safe Senders and Recipients set.</p>
<p>

            Dear David ,<br /><br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.<br /><br />I understand that this is frustrating to receive lots of spam and unwanted emails. It is even more frustrating to receive scams, spoofing and phishing emails. Scammers nowadays are using multiple methods to intimidate users.<br /><br />Nowadays some scammers have learned how to mask their emails addresses that you can see in the emails. However, in the message source you will find the real one (and the real domain) In order to view message source please check this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiving-email-from-blocked-senders-in-outlook-com-265923a0-b52c-4157-92c8-370385215da1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiv...</a><br /><br />Please note that Postmaster ( <a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/junkemail.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nore

<p>To bump this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I received a spam message from&nbsp;Atlas CREF &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to add vresp.com to my Blocked Senders list &amp; found that vresp.com was already in my Blocked Senders list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then viewed the source of the email &amp; discovered that this sender also uses the domain&nbsp;verticalresponse.com. I went to add&nbsp;verticalresponse.com to my Blocked Senders list &amp; lo, that domain is *also* in my Blocked Senders list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then scoured the rest of the message headers for any other domains ending in *.com &amp; found none.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, given that Blocked Senders expressly "move[s] email from these senders or domains to my Junk Email folder," how is this email in my inbox? Again, I have no domains listed in my Safe Senders and Recipients, so nothing should be overriding my Blocked Senders
 list. Do I need to include a wildcard to represent subdomains? Do I need to manually add every subdomain?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, can I escalate this bug somehow?</p>

<p>Bumping again:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I received a spam message from Standard Capital, Inc. &lt;Standard_Capital_Inc[at]mail.vresp.com&gt;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I reported on March 12, vresp.com is already in my Blocked Senders list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wondered if perhaps the domain matching only works for one sub domain. That is, if I block vresp.com, mail.vresp.com would be blocked, but would a.mail.vresp.com?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened the email source &amp; while there were no references to *.mail.vresp.com, there&nbsp;<em>were</em> references to b.cts.vresp.com and u.cts.vresp.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've added cts.vresp.com to my Blocked Senders list to test this theory. I'll update this ticket as I learn more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, does anyone know whether there might be some sort of limitation to wild-carded subdomain blocks? Is this a known thing (that in order to block the sub-subdomain, the subdomain must be provided)?</p>

            <p>Hello Christopher:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having with apps on your phone.&nbsp; When you have apps stuck in installing this can indicate a few things; issues with the connection, issues with the recent update that are preventing the install
 of the apps, settings issues on the phone, issues with your storage or issues with the availability of these specific applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to start by doing some things that will not require us to make many changes to the phone or it's settings.&nbsp; The&nbsp;first thing&nbsp;I would like you&nbsp;to do is&nbsp;perform another soft reset of the phone.&nbsp; You can do this by going to settings &gt; storage sense
 &gt; phone &gt; temporary files &gt; delete &gt; Internet Explorer settings &gt; delete history.&nbsp; Once this is done, press and hold the down volume button + the power button until the phone vibrates and reboots.&nbsp; After the phone reboots, go to settings &gt; language &gt; + &gt; check
 mark any language listed with XX MB's next to it.&nbsp; Once you confirm you want to download this you will see a "restart phone" button appear.&nbsp; Please tap this and allow the phone to reboot.&nbsp; You will then notice that the phone installs some updates.&nbsp; Let this
 complete and see if the apps will now download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue continues, I would next make sure any SD cards are removed from your phone.&nbsp; Please follow the safe removal steps discussed here,
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/phones-and-hardware/use-an-sd-card-to-add-space" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/phones-and-hardware/use-an-sd-card-to-add-space</a> .&nbsp; Once the card is removed, try to install the apps again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the apps still will not download or open, the next thing to try and do is make sure that all apps are stopped and cleared and then try and install them from the store.&nbsp; If any are currently active or pending, go to those apps, tap and hold them and cancel
 the download.&nbsp; Once you have done this for all apps, go to the store and search for one of the apps you have had issues with.&nbsp; Here you should have the option to download, it might say buy.&nbsp; Tap this and you should be informed that you already own it, you
 should be asked to buy it or the application will begin downloading.&nbsp; I would start one app at a time and let this go to completion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next things you might consider are related to your connection.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, go to your phone and tap settings &gt; WiFi &gt; tap and hold your network &gt; delete.&nbsp; Once you are done with that select manage &gt; + &gt; add your network details back to the phone.&nbsp; After it reconnects, please try completing the download.</li><li>Next, I would suggest you try connecting to another network and see if you have the same results with these apps getting stuck during install.</li></ul>
<p>I would like to stop here for the time being.&nbsp; Provide us some details regarding what you experienced when doing the steps above and we will move on from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>

<h2>            Unicode Alt&#43; C not always working</h2>
                    <p>To enter a Unicode character one types the code, marks the text, type Alt+c. This works fine most of the time but not always.
</p>
<p>What is the reason that prevents Alt+C from working?</p>

            <p>First point: In all versions of Word, Alt+C is not assigned to anything by default. If it works in your copy, it's a custom assignment that you or someone working on your computer made. The default assignment is Alt+X to the command ToggleCharacterCode.</p>

</p><p>Second point: If you have any version of Word, including those in Office 365, you can find out what version it is. Click File &gt; Account &gt; About Word and look at the top line of the resulting dialog box. In Office 365 versions, you'll see one of these:</p>

<p>FIrst point that is not true. I have not assigned anything, so it was by default. (Please see https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode#Verwendung_auf_Computersystemen if you don't believe my word)</p>
<p>Making your second point less reliable. There is no File &gt; Account in any of my versions of Word.</p>

            <p>If this is a German version of Word, then shortcut keys could well be different. If that's the case, you'd be better off asking your questions in the German Word forum. I don't have Word 2016, but here's

            <p>Ah right, my mistake. it is there only when a (empty) document is open in Word. Sorry for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw it is called Konto in the German version and I see Word 2016 16.0.7425.1015) 32-bit&nbsp;on my laptop, which gives a different meaning to Alt+x, onla Alt+c is working) and Word 2016 (16.0.7531.1003) 64-bit on my pc which knows all about Alt+X but does nothing
 when pressing Alt+c.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So this probably has to do with the exact version of Word 2016. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this is important to point out as for instance https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode#Microsoft_Office mentions both Alt+x and Alt+c.</p>
<p>The english Wikipedia page doesn't mention it at all.</p>

<p>The settings are probably depending on the 32 vs 64 bit of office, not the language. I yet have to come across a software product that has different short cuts for different languages, English, or better American&nbsp;English ruels the world, in that respect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I do not like the set up of the Student Attendance Record. However, I did see the Weekly Class Attandance Record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will lookk into this form a little more closely.&nbsp; As I do need to keep track of a weekly report for several students.&nbsp; I like the one page set up rather than the individual tabs.</p>

<h2>            Mac Outlook 2011 Will not recognize local folders &#40;Setting up Rules&#41;</h2>
                    I have folders for emails from specific users under the 'On My Computer' directory in my Outlook.
<div>These are imported from Outlook 2010 on a Windows PC.&nbsp;</div>
<div>My inbox is now flooded and when I select an email, create the rule&nbsp;</div>
<div>"From Is (person)</div>
<div>Move to Folder"</div>
<div>It asks you to select the folder and search for it. It doesn't matter what name I type in, none of them show up.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Help!?</div>

            It was actually the fact that Outlook defaults to attempting to setup rules directly on the Exchange Server and not on the Local Exchange account.
<div><br />
<div>Got it fixed, have to manually go into the rules page, selected the local Exchange account and then create the rules.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Extremely tedious when you have a lot of them and they will not import from a Windows Outlook correctly. It would be much better if you could right click and create the rule.</div>

                    <p>I have a Office 365 subscription and the only downloads I can find now when I log in is for Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately we still have a Exchange 2007 server at our office and Outlook 2016 doesn't work with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I download Outlook 2011 somewhere and use the rest of the Office 2016 suite? I've searched everywhere now.</p>

<p>Hi Marc,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you restored the user, it should wait for nearly four hours to make sure the OneDrive is provisioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If after more than four hours, the issue still occurs, I would like to confirm some information with you:</p>
<p>1. Please make sure you have assigned the license to the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the error message the user receives? Please provide the screenshots of it.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What will happen if the user signs in
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-US/business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">OneDrive for Business</span></a> directly?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the user can sign in OneDrive for Business directly, please ask the user to upload a file then open and edit it to see the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Did you delete the user and create a user with the same user name? Please confirm that whether the end of the user's URL has
<p>
</p><p>5. Please go to SharePoint admin center &gt; user profiles &gt; Manage User Permissions &gt; check the user whether in a group and whether check the "Create Personal Site (required for personal storage, newsfeed,
 and followed content)".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Samsung Smart Switch stopped syncing with Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I installed Outlook 2016 (under Windows 10) a couple weeks ago. &nbsp;I had been using Smart Switch to sync my Galaxy Note 5 with Outlook. &nbsp;Then, last week, Smart Switch gets stuck after "downloading folders from Outlook". &nbsp;I've tried creating a new profile in
 Outlook, running both applications in admin mode, and reinstalling Smart Switch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi. I have the same problem, been running my Galaxy 6 Edge without any problem for 8 months.</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 &gt; outlook 2016. I sync Calender and contacts with Smart Switch. 3 days ago it hanged, smart switch finds my phone fine, I can transfer files, backup data etc. It is when I start the sync with Outlook, it stops on 0 % and just hangs there.
 Tried the same as Aldona, new profile in Outlook, reinstall Smartswitch etc. Any Ideas?</p>

It also worked for me. I tried many times to install and de-install the latest version without ant change. This old version finally worked right away. Thank you for the tip :-)

    <title>How to make text wrap in fillable forms - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jade johnston  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to make text wrap in fillable forms</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have created a fillable form in which I would like the text to wrap and expand the tables in my form as needed. Are there settings in the Properties box of the Developer tab that will allow me to set this, or another way of doing this? I have tried checking
 Yes for Multi-Line in the properties, but that didn't do much.&nbsp; I also tried using the Table Properties box of the charts and setting the row height to "At Least" and that isn't working either.</p>
<p>The form that I am making will be restricted so the people who receive it will only be able to edit the fillable areas. Could this be why my attempts to make the text wrap aren't working once I get out of developer mode and protect the document? I have attached
 one of the charts below. I would like the height to be able to expand without changing the width of the table.</p>
<p>I appreciate your time and help, thank you!</p>

            Hi Jade,
<br />
<br />1. You should not be using the restriction for Filling in Forms with Content Controls.
<br />2. This is a function of the formatting of your table. If you have fixed-height rows, they will not expand.
<br />
<br />If you want, save a sample document with the problem on OneDrive or Dropbox and paste a link here. Remove any confidential or sensitive information first. I or someone else can take a look at it.
<br />
<br />This forum is a user-to-user support forum. I am a fellow user.

Otherwise it reports the response as not being helpful.

<h2>            Custom Menu Bar in Access 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a custom toolbar for an access database that as created way back using Access 2012. It has always remained visible at the top of the software screen in all subsequent versions of access...until 2016. Now, users have to click the Add-Ins button to
 see my menu bar...which is an integral part of the software. You can pin it, but doing so takes up 1" of wasted space at the top of the forms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to see the 'File', Home' Addins and Tell me what you want to do ribbon in my software. How do I get rid of that and only see my menu bar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help you can provide will be much appreciated.</p>

            <p>That is exactly what I was asking. I absolutely don't want their ribbon in any of my databases. At all. Literally it has no bearing what-so-ever on what is needed. I'm not at all certain why it has to be there and why I don't have a choice as to which menu
 (ribbon) appears in my database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's stuff like this that makes me want to move on from Access. I'm so tired of reinventing the wheel every time a new version comes out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Access for more years than I want to admit to create my databases and I have clients who use them for all of their needs. They are familiar and comfortable with my menu bars which provide specific and necessary functions. It's unfortunate
 that Microsoft has taken my useful menu bars and shoved them in the background, replacing them with what they 'assume' people need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, it is so frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to unload here, but I'm really done with it and will be looking for an alternative.</p>

            <p>Many people felt the same way when MSFT first introduced the ribbon in 2007. We had hundreds of questions on the forums that pretty much echoed what you wrote - I hate it, why did MSFT do this, how do I get rid of it, etc etc. Over time, most have come to
 prefer it over the older menu and toolbars. I was very much the same way when it came out - didn't like it, took up too much room, etc etc. I finally came around, and now any program that includes menubars and such looks ... old and out of date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can customize the Ribbons, if that would help. If you're interested, there are many links that show how to do that, among them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Customize-the-Ribbon-45e110b9-531c-46ed-ab3a-4e25bc9413de?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1</p>

<p>
</p><p>https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff861708(v=office.14).aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are also tools that can help with this (I use Ribbon Creator from Gunter). Here's a thread that lists most of them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-customize/what-is-the-best-ribbon-editor/2ee4c32c-9a3e-42ba-996f-8a8aa98e33c6</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, the .NET languages offer you complete control over this if you're looking for a new environment. You can use toolbars/menubars, or you can create a ribbon interface.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your comments Scott. I do apprecitate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point is, I really am not happy to be <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">forced</span></strong>&nbsp;unnecessarily into recreating the menu bar. Mine looks pretty much like those in many products. If that's out of date, oh well. That means so
 are a ton of successful products. My clients are oftentimes older individuals, or are those who just prefer the straight forward and simple approach. Nothing fancy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both Access 2007 and 2010 ribbons did not affect my menu bar and therefore upgrading was not an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am searching for a non MSFT alternative as we speak because I am far too discouraged to continue with them. If I have to reinvent the wheel, might as well go all the way!&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Connie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Ribbon came out there was quite the uproar, sadly MS did not budge at all.&nbsp; You have no choice but to convert your commandbars into Ribbons.&nbsp; Sadly, even a decade later, MS still has not provided a tool to create/edit them.&nbsp; Yes, you can use NotePad
 (or any other text editor), but this is far from optimal.&nbsp; If you do move ahead with the conversion I recommend
<a href="http://www.ribboncreator.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ribboncreator.de/en/</a> it will greatly simplify development and make it somewhat bearable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do keep in mind, commandbars have been deprecated for 4 editions now (almost 10 years), and you never know when MS might completely stop supporting them at all.&nbsp; This might present itself as the perfect opportunity to give your programs a facelift. (trying
 to be that glass half full guys for a second)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, as many others, have been faced with exactly your situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering other issues with&nbsp;Access, no development being done to bring Access into the year 2k, seriously improved products from competitors (while Access remains stagnant), people are looking at alternatives more seriously than ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck to you.</p>

<p>Hi, the only thing that does not to seem to change is “change” itself, some often say. I have changed a set of old menu/toolbars into the new ribbon style, it is so easy than i thought! Try these four steps:</p>
<p>Step 1- Create Macros that open the forms, reports or that execute queries or codes that will open or do what ever action you need to execute or accomplish. For instance, if you want the menu item to open a form in your database, create a macro with “OpenForm”with
 the name of the form that needs to be open.</p>
<p>Step 2- Right click somewhere on Access menu bar and select “Customize The Ribbon”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3- Click on “New Tab”, a new tab and new group should appear. Then change their names to the desired respective names (usually those from your old menu/toolbars)</p>
<p>Step 4- In “Choose Commands From”, select “Macros”; this is where the trick is. Point or select the macro you created in step 1. Repeat for reproducing each of your old menu items. I had a couple of dozen menu items, it took me less than 1hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Whichever one you want. I have no idea what the difference is, if any,&nbsp;between v5 and v6.</p>
<p>&lt;QP&gt;<br />
When a new version of the Bing Bar is available, a message appears on the Bing Bar that prompts you to update to the latest version. You can’t use the currently installed MSN Toolbar version until you’ve updated to the newest version.</p>
<p>The toolbar update alert will automatically update your Bing Bar to the latest version. On the toolbar, select Click here to download the required update. After the Bing Bar update has downloaded, Click Run. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the
 toolbar update.<br />
&lt;/QP&gt;<br />

    <title>Hacked and locked out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spilkers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hacked and locked out</h2>
                    <p>My email hacked. Fortunately Microsoft were able to restore my email, and I was up and running within hours.</p>
<p>However, I was very upset to see (the hackers?) someone else's email and phone number under 'security' when I tried to change it, and was told that I would have to wait 30 days as both the hacker and I are locked out for that period.</p>
<p>OK, fair enough, I accepted that.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, as the 30 days neared, I was locked out again, and had to reset my password.</p>
<p>Again, Microsoft quickly restored my account, and again, I was up and running within hours.</p>
<p>BUT I am now locked out for a further 30 days.</p>
<p>How long will this go on?</p>
<p>I find it distressing to see someone else's details; phone number, email, birhday, country etc under MY security.</p>
<p>I am desperate to regain full control of my account, and be able to turn on 2 step verification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any answers for me?</p>
<p>Or do I just have to start counting 30 days again?</p>

    <title>The words in Outlook.com is hard to read and I cannot seem to change - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            The words in Outlook.com is hard to read and I cannot seem to change the color pane.</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows XP with IE8.</p>
<p>I cannot change the look of outlook to make the words easier to read. I have followed the advice given by others. The difference between the messages that are read and unread have almost no color difference. In other words, the bold is not bold. Also I cannot
 get the options to work The color pane won't even change.</p>
<p>The font from the old hotmail and Facebook is easy to see... and it is even smaller. Just easier to read.&nbsp; Can I just make the font the same style as those?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Original title: does anyone else find the font hard to read?)</p>

            i only have a few things in my browser...and I need to keep those... The whole thing runs so slow. When I type, I have to wait for the line to appear. ANd I am a very poor typist and slow. It cannot keep up with me. If my daughter I was home, I fear what
 she would say as her fingers fly on the keyboard...

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for providing additional information about your concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The option to switch back to Hotmail is no longer available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have mentioned that it works faster using Mozilla Firefox, it is possible that this is only a browser related issue. Yes, Internet Explorer and Microsoft is related.&nbsp;However, please be informed that if
