<h2>            Lenovo W500 laptop keys A,D,F, K,L does not work</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a lenovo W500 laptop which worked perfectly with Windows XP. After upgrading it to windows 7 certain keyboard letters stopped working (A,D,F,K,L and some others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at the device manager for the keyboard and see that a standard driver is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me what could be wrong and whether you know a fix to this problem?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Problem with stretched screen from Windows 10 update -- desperate&#33;</h2>
                    <p>After my recent unwanted Windows 10 update, my screen is stretched and the font is blurry. This has affected my Scrivener writing program the most, but Scrivener software is NOT the issue.

<span>In the Device Manager box in Settings, under Display Adapters, the graphics reads ATI Radeon HD 4200. In the Basic Display Properties, the Adapter Type is listed as Microsoft Basic Display Driver,
 however. </span></p>
<p><span>I have spent several hours looking through various forums and nothing works. See below. With my limited skill in
 computer operating systems, I still took the time to update drivers, reset settings, download new drivers, etc. Absolutely Nothing Works. In my humble opinion, when Microsoft orchestrates these mass updates without getting the bugs out, it is nothing short
 of criminal. I know for a fact that thousands of other people are just as frustrated as I am. Please someone send me a useful link that doesn't require a degree in computer science to comprehend. I thank you immensely.</span></p>

            Hi Mothy.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Have you tried updating the Display driver from the PC or Display device's Support Downloads webpage?  Note this is not the Monitor driver but the Display adapter's driver.  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then try Uninstalling Driver in Device Manager (reached by right clicking Start button) by choosing Display adapter, then Driver tab, then Uninstall.  Restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />You can also Roll Back the driver in Device Manager on the Display device's Driver tab, or to try all previously installed drivers choose Update Driver, then Browse PC, then Let Me Pick.  Work backwards trying each driver until you find a good one.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>
<br />
<br />If this is Fall Creators Update Version 1709, which you can check at Settings&gt;System&gt;About, you can also roll it back at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery, then hide it using the same tool above until it matures.  
<br />
<br />If all else fails you can also try to System restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Mothy, your Display Driver will need rolling back . . . Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If the rollback option is greyed out please try the solution proposed by Ken C in his second reply on this thread . . . 
<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Option 1:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Make sure recommended settings are selected for Scale and Layout and Screen resolution.
<br />
<br />
<br />Another thing you can try:
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try performing a system restore before this problem occurred. 
<br />
<br />I recommend you uninstall the KB4048955, KB4048954 (Windows 10 1703)
<br />
<br />Microsoft issued an update for several versions of WIndows 10: KB4048954, KB4048955 that has caused issues with display drivers. If you know the make and model of your computer, you can try manually reinstalling the driver from the manufacturers website for your video driver.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />(This is the update you want to uninstall KB4048955)
<br />
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart then see if stability is restored. 
<br />
<br />The update might try to install again. So, try blocking it.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />If its the icons and toolbars, then Go back to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Click in the Scale and layout list box, try another scale such as 125 to see if that works or play around with custom scaling. 
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Perform a repair upgrade
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>

            Option 1.Try Rolling back if you have an option:
<br />See DaveM and Sumit Dhiman2 posts:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start-win_general/screen-stretched-and-resolution-options-dont-fix/20ce6b86-69ad-42d2-83ab-847df6ab9e5e#LastReply">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />Option 2. Remove AMD drivers completely and Install the legacy ones from the AMD site:
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of AMD using this: <a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMD-Clean-Uninstall-Utility.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/...</a> and reboot
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the legacy driver from here(You might have to do a bit of exercise to locate the driver:
<br /><a href="http://www.support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.
<br />Option 3: See if Windows itself has some history of the Older Driver:
<br />Solution by Ken-C here:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-10-set-display-resolution-to-1920x1080/8ad4adc6-7cc1-494e-b296-e6c4dd8caefa?messageId=913d5c97-7dd7-4780-b735-1026da383882">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />Please note all the steps need temporarily disabling of Windows update or driver updates so that newer driver doesn't install automatically.

<p>I tried many suggestions from posters, but finally ended up taking my computer to a professional. It was more complicated than I anticipated. He ended up reinstalling Windows, partly due to an update which didn't fully download. One reason he gave was that
 it appeared that someone had stolen my Windows registry. One side note: beware of quick fixes for problems like this with programs such as DriverEasy; I was told by my computer guy that these are Malware.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to all who posted answers to my question. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Word of Advice to those frustrated computer users out there: Sometimes it's best to let a professional take care of things rather than spend countless hours trying to fix the unfixable.

            Hi Muhammad.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers.  
<br />
<br />The CPU may fall below the minimum even with the latest chipset driver.  You'll have to try the latest and see.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows 8 Order Hasn&#39;t Arrived - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8 Order Hasn&#39;t Arrived</h2>
                    Hello, I ordered a copy of Windows 8 with a Backup DVD and got an email on 31st October saying that it has been shipped to me and should arrive within 5 to 7 working days. However, my order has yet to actually arrive, is there a way to get this problem
 sorted out without actually ringing up Microsoft Support.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

A copy and paste answer isn't really any help at all. The problem isn't about making an install disc, it's about the fact that I ordered something which hasn't arrived.<br />

            Finally found the solution. Basically if you go on the Microsoft store for your country during the day then a little down the page will be a phone line but above it will be a link that says live chat and you can just message them saying your order hasn't
 shipped and they can sort it all out for you instead of having to ring up a call centre.

<div><span>If the live chat option doesn't appear then it seems the only way to sort it out is to ring the call centre :(</span></div>

<br />
<br />
Welcome to our community. <br />
This is Leocadia, independent community expert, and I am glad to assist you today.
<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about this inconvenience. Now, we would like to help you promptly. <br />
Now, to fix that, could you please try the steps below? <br />
<br />
Go to the start menu and click onto settings. <br />
<br />
- Then click to System and go to display settings. <br />
<br />
- Click on the monitor that is frozen, and check the box where it says "Make this my main display"
<br />
<br />
- Once that's done your monitor should be back the way it should and take out the unclosed apps.
<br />
<br />
- Finally you simply go back to the monitor you want main display again, and problem is fixed.
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;this solution doesn't help, when I set up monitor as my main then on the notebook display appear this issue but form monitor disappear. When I look at the taskbar there are clocks and you can see that on the "freeze" one time doesn't change
 at all.</p>

            If you pressed the power button, chances are good that you corrupted the file system.<br />

Oops!&nbsp; No CD drive you said? <br />

In that case, I will leave it up to the Microsoft Support Engineer (or buy an external CD drive - now you know why you might need one someday).<br />

<h2>            Computer won&#39;t connect to wifi at certain places</h2>
                    <p>I am computer literate, and am not just confused. I have a lenovo y50, with windows 10. It connects to WiFi at home, church, McDonald's and other places fine. The one place it just refused to work is school. Everyone's Windows 7, 8, 8.1 devices work fine.
 My phone, and everyone else's works fine. BUT, my computer won't work. I can see the network(s), but when I try to connect, it says connection failed, no matter what. I talked to the tech support at the school and they couldn't help me. I booted into a live
 USB with Linux on one of the school computers and made a WiFi network. (their computer was connected via Ethernet)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would not connect to that network, and I configured that one to death. Open, secured with all different securities, nothing worked. What do I need to do to get my computer to connect?&nbsp;</p>

<p>You should able to do this now but you need the Digital T.V. Tuner for it to be able to work. If you have cable your provider should have an app that will essentially do the same thing (stream live t.v. and premium video to your mobile&nbsp;device).</p>

<p>Thanks LOL, I will check into the digital TV tuner. I assume they can only stream stuff from the TV tuner and not the cable feed because of some agreement they made with the providers.

<p>Maybe. I don't really know for sure. The channels that you will get from the digital T.V. tuner are free local channels. So there probably wouldn't be an issue if they were streamed. To stream cable channels you need to be&nbsp;logged in to your provider's app&nbsp;with
 your billing account and you also&nbsp;have to be on your home network to get all the channels that&nbsp;you are subscribed to. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I just bought the Digital TV tuner for the X1 in Australia and i am now able to Stream the TV to my ipad/iphone even whilst the xbox is playing a game or Bluray movie. Its quite impressive. Stream Quality still isnt as crisp as the Native TV signal on the
 tv which i hope will improve.</p>

Word loads without the menu bar up top, just a blank sheet.&nbsp; Whether I'm attempting to open an existing document or trying to create a new one.&nbsp; And it is unresponsive.<br />

IS THERE A SERVICE PACK DOWNLOAD AVAILABLE FOR THIS TO ALLOW COMPATIBILITY?<br />

    <title>Windows 10 boot stuck at logo and spinning dots circle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kshitij lawate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 boot stuck at logo and spinning dots circle</h2>
                    <p>I am using an Asus K53SM laptop. I had installed Windows 8, 8.1 and after that 10 on it. 1 week back I did a clean re-install of windows 10 on it using in-built options in Windows 10 settings app. The re-install completed successfully and the laptop worked
 fine since then without any issues. I was running most recent stable build, the 1511.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I tried to start my laptop and it is now stuck on boot. It shows Windows Logo and white dots spinning below it. The hard disk light turns on for 10 second on this screen, however after that there is no hard disk usage light ON and the white dots
 keeps on spinning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have a Windows 10 bootable disk, hence I tried with Windows 8. I went to troubleshooting menu and opt-in for Automatic Startup recovery. It failed, I believe because of Compatibility issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I went in for Command Prompt from the same options and did a chkdsk on C drive. It gave me some message related to 'reparse records'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the situation is whenever I start my laptop it is stuck on Booting screen and does not proceed. I can't get into Safe Mode as it is disabled by default (conclusion drawn from Google Search). Can anybody help me out here? Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

            I downloaded the windows 10 iso from microsoft website and tried to recover, however it didn't work out. Hence, finally I did a clean install and it seems to be working now.

<p>SJphone stopped working some months ago on 3x computers. Showing error: 'NAT/Firewall: Blocked'</p>
<p>Using Wireshark ISP says: "It shows that the traffic that is having the issues is internal to your network. Please try disabling any firewalls." They have all been disabled.</p>
<p>Tried X-Lite and get: Registration error: 503 - No route to host.</p>
<p>Could any MS Security Updates have caused the problem?</p>
<p>Any suggestions appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Windows is stuck in automatic repair loop, what do I do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My Asus G751 Laptop is stuck in the automatic repair loop, I’ve performed a start up repair that failed and gave me a log file that tells me that ACPI.sys is corrupt. After that I’ve done everything that is possible aside from recovery media, refresh PC,
 and reset PC and nothing worked, even fixboot and sfc scannow fails, heck I had system restore points on my PC before this happened and they just disappeared as if they were never there.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to do aside from taking it into Geek Squad or Staples to fix it without performing a clean wipe of my Laptop.</p>

            Have you tried booting into Safe Mode and removing the ACPI driver?
<br />
<br />Start PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, open Device Manager 
<br />Expand the Computer section
<br />Right click ACPI device and choose Uninstall
<br />Restart your PC

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

<br />    Type ~/Library/Application Support
<br />    Open the Skype folder
<br />    Look for shared.xml then drag it to the trash

<h2>            Was this call a scam&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, first time forum user here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I rang Microsoft tech support on 132058 to transfer my existing windows license over to a new build. On other forums and websites it seemed like a pretty simple process. When speaking to the supposed technician with a Indian/american accent, they were
 insisting that they needed to sell me a warranty cover for a year worth $120 and was the ONLY way to transfer my license? never heard of that before.... they also wanted my debit/credit card details, remote access to my computer and my full name and contact
 number? The only piece of information I gave them was my Key for windows. I hung up because it was getting to ridiculous for something so minor. I rang windows again on another number and they activated my OS again in a couple of minutes, no questions asked.
 So should I be worried that I gave my key away?? or is it just an incompetent employee?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Could Rockstar Games please bring Max Payne 3 to backward compatibility&#63;</h2>
                    Please bring Max Payne 3 to Xbox One backward compatibility. It's one on my favourite games of all time and I haven't played it in years. If it does come onto backward compatibility, I would buy it straight away!! 😀👍

<p>Hey Dc0dr,</p>
<p>There's currently a service alert for the Xbox Live Marketplace. Some content isn't working as it should (Apps and Games gone missing or creating error codes)</p>
<p>The problem started yesterday. Were you having the issue before then? If not there is a strong likelyhood that your problem is linked to the Service Alert.</p>
<p>The team are working on fixing the problem - Keep an eye on the Service Status
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../xbox-live-status</a></p>
<p>If, once the Service status is shown as fixed you still have the issue - please come back and let us know!</p>
        </p>

<p>None that the status page is indicating. They've had the issue for 12-18 hours now and are working on it!</p>
<p>They have to be losing money because people can't purchase content, so that must be quite an incentive to get it fixed! Not to mention the people it's affecting!</p>
<p>Best thing to do is keep checking the service page!</p>
