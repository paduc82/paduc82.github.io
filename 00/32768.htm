<div>Please tell us what "Can not email invoices" means. Exactly how are</div>
<div>you trying? What happens when you try? If you get an error message,</div>
<div>please quote it verbatim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Can you create the invoices? Are they files that you want to send as</div>
<div>e-mail attachments? If the invoice is in the form of a file, you</div>
<div>e-mail it as an attachment regardless of whether or not the file is</div>
<div>any good or not.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What e-mail program are you using?</div>

            Quicken did not become Windows 7 compatible until the 2010 version. You might want to upgrade to the latest version, 2011..

<div>Windows 7 RTM took place on July 22, 2009. I started running the</div>
<div>released version right around that date, and I ran the Release</div>
<div>Candidate before that.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I can't remember exactly when I upgraded from Quicken 2009 to Quicken</div>
<div>2010, but it had to be at least a few months after July 22 when it was</div>
<div>released. So I'm sure that I ran Quicken 2009 under Windows 7, and I</div>
<div>ran it without a problem.</div>

<div>The Intuit year version is always ahead of the actual year. Qickbooks 2010 was released in the latter part of 2009 and was accredited with being Windows 7 compatible.&nbsp;Quickbooks 2009 was released in the latter part of 2008 way before the release of Windows
 7, and while many of its features may well work, there are always one or two which will not.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Intuit have a history of the above. They always release a compatible product after the horse has bolted, presumably in a bid to avoid supporting the older version any longer than they have to support it. Their&nbsp;take is that one should upgrade to the latest
 version, which always looks suspiciously like the version that one is having to dump.. ;-)</div>

<div>You said "Quicken did not become Windows 7 compatible until the 2010</div>
<div>version [the 2010 *version*, not the 2010 year]. I pointed out that I</div>
<div>ran the 2009 *version* under Windows 7 without any problems at all.</div>
<div>And although I don't use all of Quicken's features, I use most of</div>
<div>them. If there were one or two features of Quicken 2009 that didn't</div>
<div>work under Windows 7, I didn't know of them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And I now see from the subject line that this thread was about</div>
<div>*Quickbooks*, even though your message that I replied to said</div>
<div>"Quicken." If you actually meant Quickbooks rather than Quicken, I</div>
<div>withdraw my comment; I have never used Quickbooks and know nothing</div>
<div>about what versions are compatible with Windows 7.</div>

<p>Hello Betty12345,</p>
<p>This is from QuickBooks support about compatibility of Quickbooks 2008 and 2009 with Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Only QuickBooks 2011 and 2010&nbsp;(Pro, Premier, and Enterprise Solutions) are designed to be compatible with Windows 7. You can still install and run QuickBooks 2008 and 2009 on Windows 7, but be aware that you may encounter problems we cannot resolve.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.quickbooks.intuit.com/support/pages/knowledgebasearticle/898435" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.quickbooks.intuit.com/support/pages/knowledgebasearticle/898435</a></p>
<p>I am not sure what you are using for e-mail, but look at this information from QuickBooks.<br />
QuickBooks is designed to send email messages with Microsoft Outlook or the built-in QuickBooks Email service. QuickBooks cannot send email messages with Windows Live Mail, which is the replacement for Microsoft Outlook Express in Windows 7.</p>
<p>You might want to post in the Intuit Community Forums listed here. <br />

<h3> leialouh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Latest Update &#34;Deactivated&#34; Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a question, and I'm really bothered by this! Last night my computer ran the Fall update (I haven't used it since about October/November), and it's deactivated Windows and stating that I need to go the "Settings" to activate it. In settings, I'm getting
 this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We can't activate Windows on this device because you don't have a valid digital license or product key. If you think you do have a valid license or key, select Troubleshoot below. Error code: 0xC004C003."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 when it was initially being rolled out years ago, and that was from Windows 7 (I never wanted the Windows 8 upgrade, as I used it in a shop and hated the functionality). As it was a free upgrade from W7 to W10, and so I'm VERY confused
 as to why it's suddenly just deactivated me and saying my key/ID is incorrect!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any information would be great as I do not and will not pay for Windows 10 seeing as I've been running Windows 10 for years!!! I cannot understand why I'm suddenly deactivated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a laptop, and I am worried about this being turned on, doing the update and also having Windows 10 deactivated. It seems stupid that Microsoft are deactivating Windows 10 after an update!</p>

<br />To better diagnose the issue,
<br />Right click Start&gt;Command Prompt-Admin and type in the following command:
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />If you have Powershell instead of Command Prompt Run these in order:
<br />cmd.exe
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />You will get a window, take a screenshot using snipping tool and paste it it next reply.

<h2>            How do I remove CompatTelRunner.exe &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I found this running on my computer a day or two ago. It uses a lot of resources, and I cannot uninstall it using the Control Panel.&nbsp;As far as I know, it has no constructive purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a search and found that disabling Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program is supposed to get rid of this, but it is already disabled on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get rid of GWX.exe, I had to find it, change the folder's permission settings so I could remove it, and then change the permission settings again to prevent reinstallation. How do I keep this garbage off my computer in the first place?</p>

    <title>Xbox One Controller Randomly Pausing&#47;Unpausing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One Controller Randomly Pausing&#47;Unpausing</h2>
                    
<p>I was playing CoD:Ghosts over the weekend and a couple different times it would either pause or unpause without me hitting the menu (start) button. While playing Forza 5 it hasn't done this yet. I don't think it's done this for any app or on the dashboard.
 Has anyone else had this problem?</p>

<p>This happens to me on all my games (Dead rising 3, ryse, battlefield 4, call of duty ghosts, forza 5 and assassins creed: 4 black flag). Sometimes they stay paused for 10 seconds, sometimes over a min. Never a set time limit, always random. Could be kinnect
 causing the issue from what i have read elsewhere. Xbox support told me to send my console back to them for this and the following reasons.</p>
<p>I have also had issues with them all crashing and going back to the dashboard resulting in me losing progress. I have also had problems with the challenges not sinking properly when syncing progress offline when signing back on line. Example, the dead rising
 challenge that ends in a day and a half for killing 5,000 zombies. I have killed 8,000+ but the challenge was left off at 11% when I was online last. I signed back in killed a couple more zombies and the challenge did not complete for my 8,000 kills, it just
 went to 12%. So anything offline is not counting toward challenges. My achievements seem to unlock though when I sign back on.</p>

<p>Hi Eshiki, i have been having the same problems. spoke with MS support ran through a few things but no solution. I figured the Kinect was hearing things and causing the game to resume. I have just removed the kinect sensor and so far no problems! think this
 maybe the reason my games have been going to home screen as well. made a quick video showing how easy it is to trick the sensor!

<p>Only noticed this so far in ghosts. Very annoying. Thought it was me, then thought it was the controller, maybe the kinnect, or maybe just the game. Maybe it's Gremlins ?</p>

<p>Ok, so I just saw the official list of commands and "Xbox Pause" and "Xbox Play" both work in game. I guess my Kinect is mistaking complete silence in the room for "Xbox Play"...</p>

<p>CoD Ghosts does it for me constantly. It will unpause when it is totally silent in the room and nothing is moving and it also does it when people are moving and talking in the room. It is VERY annoying. The Kinect seems better than the 360 version so far,
 it won't randomly stop and rewind Netflix like my 360 would do every time I tried watching anything. Still this is an issue that Microsoft NEEDS to resolve.
</p>
<p>I have AC IV as well and I haven't noticed the Xbox pausing or un-pausing with anywhere near the frequency that it does Ghosts.

<p>I've been having a similar problem. For me, whenever either of my controllers die it rewinds Netflix all the way to the beginning of the episode/movie. (I have a day one edition controller and a store bought extra.) &nbsp;It's especially annoying because it goes
 to the fastest rewind speed before the controller dies/shuts off and by the time I turn it back on the episode is completely restarted.

    <title>How can I unlink Facebook account from People App &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> katherineharvey  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I unlink Facebook account from People App &#63;</h2>
                    My dad's facebooko account has become linked to mine on his People App in windows 8. When I go to Manage Accounts, and Remove or Unlink accounts, it only unlinks or removes both accounts. I've deleted the cookies, removed accounts and then re-added my
 dad's but it still somehow remembers my log in and links both again automatically. This is the case for all features of the app including contacts and facebook updates. Any help appreciated! There was a previous post on this but the link with the answer is
 no longer active.

<p>I have an hp g6 notebook pc which had win 8.1 when I bought it, and it also had dolby advance audio v2. I have had no trouble with upgrades of win 10 until this last one, win 10 creator and then the dolby was gone.<br />
I tried the many fixes listed in these forums and what finally fixed it for me was installing the audio driver for win 8.1, the link is below. Maybe this will help.</p>

<h2>            Matchmaking not working suddenly on Halo 4 for Xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>I have not been able to play Halo 4 online &nbsp;on xbox 360 for over 2 weeks now. After matchmaking and choice of gametype has finished it just will not load the game. I can see others dropping out a lot more too so i know it isnt just me.</p>
<p>Xbox support got me to clear cache and delete and reinstall profile and I checked my (correct) open ports but this hasnt helped, still cannot load. They then asked me to talk to Bunjie and stated it wasn't their fault and had nothing to do with current update
 issues?!</p>
<p>Anyone got any ideas or having same problem?</p>
<p>i oblivion u</p>

<h2>            File &#38; Settings Transfer Wizard&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just checking out the "File &amp; Settings Transfer Wizard" that has been added as a feature in Windows XP . I selected the same Computer as the old &amp; new computer &amp; everything that this wizard tranfers , was moved back to the same Computer
 . When I was asked the location where the Backup files were , I selected "Documents &amp; settings" . After running the wizard twice - Once to move the files "FROM" &amp; once to move the files "TO" , upon checking my P.C. , I find that everything seems to be exactly
 where it was prior to my using this wizard .<br />
<br />
1. However , I want to make sure that no damage has been done . How can I ?<br />
<br />
2. Does this Wizard leave any "Leftover" files after it has done it's work ? If so , I may want to delete these as they would be unnecessarily occupying space on&nbsp; my&nbsp; p.c.&nbsp; How can I check where these Left-Over Files are &amp;get rid of them ?

            <p>Well to start the FTW,you must select the pc as "old" or "new".Old,sets the wizard</p>
<p>to collect the data,new,sets the wizard to abstract data &amp; put data in OS...To collect data,</p>
<p>set as old,chk the boxes you want it to collect,put data in a new folder that you created,once its</p>
<p>thru,put folder on a cd,or storage hd...Also,the wizard never seems to run properly except</p>

                    <p>Hey, I had an issue with the Microsoft Store not working correctly so I thought I would post what I did to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using my mobile to share a Wi-Fi connection to my PC and had downloads waiting to be done in the downloads page of the Microsoft Store (Game Pass games). I would receive the first error when loading pages and the second error when loading the 'downloads
 &amp; updates' page.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To fix the error</strong> I simply <strong>enabled Metered Connection</strong> in my network settings
<strong>then disabled it after</strong> and after that the Microsoft Store would properly load pages including downloading apps.</p>

                    I'm trying to copy files from my old laptop to my new one. For several files, I get a message asking me if I am sure that I want to copy this file without its properties. What does this mean? Where or how do I find a file's properties and copy them with
 the file?

            The properties are some extended data that describes the file, but in almost all cases it's completely fine to just ignore this prompt and continue anyway. &nbsp;The extra properties (metadata) are extended information about the file, but not actually part
 of the file. So skipping them won't lose anything.

            Yeah I have two of these in my System&gt;Notifications &amp; actions list. At first there was only one, but another showed up today (at least that's when I noticed) I can turn them off and I don't see a difference in anything, but I would still like to know what
 they are. Maybe one is the Xbox app notification(s) I've been missing lol.

<p>
</p><p>It seems to be accompanied by two other effects that have never happened before :-</p>

</p><p>1. If I leave the computer for some time I get a small pop-up box which tells me that Microsoft Windows is not responding. If I choose the option of 'Do you want to end this process?' then either nothing happens or it pops up another box containing exactly
 the same thing. By this time everything else on the screen has gone totally unresponsive. Once this occurs the only thing that works is the on/off switch.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I have suddenly started getting notified 'An app default was reset'. An app caused a problem with the default app setting for Mailto files, so it was reset to Mail. But it does this for mailto, jpg's and just about anything where I was using another app,
 like Adobe which it throws out and replaces with the Edge browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All these effects have only occurred in the last couple of weeks. My system is on the latest Windows 10 Pro. Dell i5 8GB RAM. 240GB SSD and I haven't had any Windows type problems for some considerable time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No new third party software has been installed and it was all working perfectly until these effects started. The effect started just before the Falls Update installed so it must be as a result of a patch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to say that it can only be due to a badly written Windows patch/update that rapidly needs resolvin</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update - 30th Oct - I now have a second computer with the same effects. This has only just run a load of updates. The 1709 update hung at 99% when the pop-up window with 'Microsoft Windows is not responding' jumped up. And yes, CTL-ALT-DEL does not work,
 you have to switch off to restart</p>

<p>I am getting the same message and I also have Windows 10. It started in the last few days after a Windows update. One side-effect of this update is a series of strange notifications similar to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft.Explorer.Notification{DBB9C</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another strange side effect is, if I reboot my computer, it takes forever for Windows Explorer to finally appear. During that time my screen remains black as if it were hanging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, I thought this might be due to malware, but every test for malware has turned up negative. I ran SFC and no problems surfaced, but the strange behavior and notification message would still appear.</p>

    <title>Disc read error prologue CoD Ghosts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neenips  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disc read error prologue CoD Ghosts</h2>
                    Have had soooo many problems with this game. This was a digital download bundled with the XBOne received on Christmas day. All other games are working fine. Ryse, Forza, Fifa and Dead Rising. CoD takes about 5 hours to install - this is the only digital
 download I have. I am on BT Infinity 2 and my download speed varies between 27-33mbs. I have opened all relative ports on the Homehub and have an "open" NAT. The game fully installs - 100% the opening intro starts gets halfway through and ends up in some sort
 of loop with the opening screen. I have had various error messages, imagefile3, imagefile7 and since I have opened my ports "disc read error prologue". I have power cycled my router, the XBOne and done a factory restore. I am currently on my 7th installation.
 Can anyone please help?? Is the console faulty i.e the HDD - can't understand why other games are working and this one isn't.

<p>Holding down the power button, resetting your profile, turning the xbox one off and unplugging it for 15 seconds. &nbsp;Just so everyone is clear if you get an error that looks like:</p>
<p>Error Disc read error '&lt;file_name&gt;' </p>
<p>** For those of you that would like to see the error in action: <a href="http://sdrv.ms/1iP9k4C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://sdrv.ms/1iP9k4C</a> </p>
<p>**Another note you can try to DVR the error on the Xbox one, but it kicks out the recording as being corrupt when the error occurs.</p>
<p>Sample errors received based on various downloads of the game (I stopped counting after my 20th download and am currently on my 3rd console as that has been the 'resolution' MS support has &nbsp;provided for me with the issue I have with digital content not playing
 properly)</p>
<p>Disc read error 'imagefile60' Exit</p>
<p>Disc read error 'imagefile62' Exit</p>
<p>Disc read error 'imagefile2' Exit</p>
<p>Disc read error 'mp_hashima'</p>
<p>And, your only option is to exit, then you only have one real option to try and fix it. &nbsp;Delete the game and then re-install it. &nbsp;Pray that the download that your next download of content for the CoD Ghosts game is not corrupt. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I find it funny that Microsoft uses apache servers to serve up the downloads for digital content on the Xbox one. &nbsp;I also believe the issue is with how they are caching the downloads while presenting the content. &nbsp;But, alas I cannot prove that as of yet.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, your only real option is to delete the game and reload it - OR, if you started getting this on an add-on map then just delete the add-on. &nbsp;I have found that for add-on map packs. &nbsp;If the add-on map pack keeps getting corrupted during your download
 then do the following: &nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Download the add-on</p>
<p>2) Immediately delete the add-on (as soon as it finishes installing)</p>
<p>3) Immediately re-download the add-on</p>
<p>&nbsp;You will also notice that the download completes faster than the first try. &nbsp;Unfortunately, this does not work for the full game download as it is 38 GB in size and cannot be fully cached on their end. &nbsp;So you get it as it comes - corrupt files and all.
 &nbsp;On the plus side, if you are playing the campaign and you reach a section that goes bad. &nbsp;Just delete the game and re-download. &nbsp;It will move the bad files around so that they are not always the same file that ends up being corrupted or missing in the install.
 &nbsp;Your other option, stick with the physical media for the games and then deal with multiple downloads of the add-ons as they come out.</p>
<p>Good luck and happy gaming</p>

<p>I am having the exact same problem. I've even had them send me a new console. No dice.</p>
<p>I &nbsp;just got off the phone with Xbox Support... for the 4th or 5th time now. I've lost count. They've refunded the entire game cost once already so I can do a clean factory reset, remove the license from my account and made me try again on a new console.
 This is probably my 8th download... again... lost count long ago.</p>
<p>I've even gone so far as to factory reset the 2nd Xbone, and used my husband's profile to re-download the game. He downloaded it digitally, on his console with NO PROBLEMS. Even using his profile, the game still messes up, which is mindboggling. You'd think
 this would have solved the issue, right?</p>
<p>My 'issue' (Read: Severely F*ing Frustration Circle of Redundant Troubleshooting) has not been resolved as far as the support guys can go, so it's been kicked "Upstairs" so that the codemonkeys and techies can see if they can deduce the problem. Might take
 them 5 days because this is apparently an "Unknown Problem". Thanks for making me wait 5 more days. I've already been trying to fix this problem for two weeks now.</p>
<p>PLEASE. let me know if there's anything tried, tested and true that can fix this issue. I'm losing my sanity and my consumer confidence. (I've tried what's been suggested on this particular thread to no avail.)</p>

<p>I have been having extended issues with ALL of the digital downloads for full versions of games on the Xbox One. &nbsp;If you want a long read &nbsp;-
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4271/t/1645924.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../1645924.aspx</a></p>
<p>I am currently on my third xbox one, and with my last message from support that they were going to send me to hardware support again (aka - to send me another xbox). &nbsp;Recently I came across a post in the forums here and decided to try it out - so far after
 performing the setting updates I have yet to experience an issue with Forza 5, Lego Marvel SuperHeroes and CoD Ghosts. &nbsp;I am going to be re-downloading BF4 (which typically breaks sometime during episode two or three - so easy enough to test). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the settings that (so far appear to have resolved my issue) I have set now on my xbox one after deleting the games and then re-downloading:</p>
<p>Settings &gt; Network</p>
<p>***Verify that your Network Type is 'Wired' (you can go back to wireless and try again if everything works to see if it is your wireless that could be dropping in the middle of the connection and causing the issue)</p>
<p>***Verify that your NAT Type is OPEN!!!!! &nbsp;If it is not, then you have some work ahead of you - place the xbox one in your dmz on your modem and/or turn port forwarding on for the required ports</p>
<p>Settings &gt; Network &gt; Detailed network statistics</p>
<p>***Verify that the test results do not result in any packet loss and that your MTU is 1384 or higher!
</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/network-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../network-settings</a></p>
<p>Now, change the following settings:</p>
<p>Settings&gt; Kinect</p>
<p>***I turned it off, everything about it - unplug it if you want (not sure if this actually helped or not, but it made me feel better)</p>
<p>Settings&gt;Preferences</p>
<p>**Show Skype notification: False</p>
<p>**Show messaging notifications: True</p>
<p>**Show party notifications: True</p>
<p>**Show all other notifications: True</p>
<p>**Allow Play to Streaming: FALSE</p>
<p>**Record gameplay with Game DVR: FALSE</p>
<p>**Preferred video provider: None</p>
<p>**SmartGlass Connections: From any SmartGlass device</p>
<p>Settings&gt;Power &amp; Startup</p>
<p>**Turn off after: DON'T TURN OFF AUTOMATICALLY</p>
<p>**Power mode: ENERGY-SAVING</p>
<p>Just for good luck, power off the xbox one by holding the pressing in on the power for 15 seconds (supposedly to clear the cache)</p>
<p>Once you power it back on, download the game again. &nbsp;Wait for the game to be fully installed before trying to play!</p>
<p>Just a reminder, you will now have to power the xbox one off in order to turn it off. &nbsp;So if you leave it on and run to the store, it will continue to run. &nbsp;It will also continue to run the entire time for the larger downloads for games. &nbsp;So, just turn your
 monitor/tv off and let it run and check ever now and again to see if the game has finished downloading.</p>
<p>Please respond and let the community know if this resolves the issue!</p>

<p>@Lewis Therrin, I am currently trying your last suggestions with the settings to see if it has any effect. I'm still using my hubby's profile to download the game onto my console, as his download went perfectly on his Xbone.
</p>
<p>*While going through various troubleshooting, much of which you went through in your super detailed log of attempts, I tried adding my profile to my husband's Xbone and playing the game... it worked fine. I was able to play. That leads me to believe it's
 not profile related, but at this point, I'm willing to try any little thing that will get my console going again.
</p>
<p>*And this is just one game! I can only imagine the agony with all your other game downloads.</p>
<p>*As of typing this, I'm at 16% download for COD... I'll update if these suggestions worked.</p>

<p>Got an email back from the Xbox Customer Care Advocacy Team. I'm still so dumbfounded by what was contained within the email...</p>
<p>The first troubleshooting tip it told me to do was to "Remove the hard drive"...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I'll let that sink in for a moment...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>It's a F*ING XBOX ONE! I CAN'T TAKE OUT THE HARD DRIVE! I'll void my warranty. It would be useless to do that... although, at the moment, the console is useless anyway.</p>
<p>Way to go Xbox Morons... You gave me troubleshooting for a F*ing XBOX 360!</p>
<p>I spoke with tech support again tonight. He told me to call Acitivision, which I told him I already did and they sent me back to Xbox... I feel horrible for the next Xbox representative I talk to...</p>
<p>Wait... No I don't.</p>
<p>Nice Cipher disappeared tonight.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What exactly happens when you try to open the files with .wlx extension?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The WLX file type is primarily associated with 'Live Mesh' by Microsoft Corporation. Live Mesh is a way of storing changing files on a Web service yet accessing those files from one or more computers with automatic updates to and from the local and remote
 computers. The .WLX file indicates synchronization is taking place but is not yet complete. Often you will see a double extension with the actual file's extension coming before the .WLX extension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to post the issue in the below forums and check if it helps:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/is/LiveMesh/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/is/LiveMesh/threads</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information is helpful.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business 2016 with Exchange 2010 - Integration</h2>
                    
<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>I'm having trouble finding any information on this, so if you can point me in the right direction or provide me with an answer, that would be great.</p>
<p>Most of our users are on Lync 2013, but now O365 offers Skype for Business 2016.&nbsp; On the first person I've installed this for, it appears there is some integration issue between it and Exchange 2010 or perhaps just Outlook 2010.&nbsp; The first thing I notice
 is that when drafting new emails, and selecting recipients, the status display no longer seems to work.&nbsp; You can not tell if the recipient is Online(green), Away(yellow) or Busy(red).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Are there steps I can take to remedy this or is this possibly a known compatibility issue?</p>

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>Please first make sure that the DNS records (two SRV records) for Lync federation and Lync client discovery all point to Skype for Business Online so that Microsoft Outlook Web App can determine where the user’s Lync server is located. You can send us the
 user’s email address via PM so that we can check the DNS records for you from our side.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please make sure user’s Sip address is same as SMTP address. Please run the Exchange PowerShell with
<strong>Get-Mailbox -Identity “user’s SMTP address” |fl</strong> <br />
And then send us the results via PM.<br />
I have sent you a private message for the information. Click the link below to access it.<br />

<p>hi scott,</p>
<p>thanks so much for the information. from the results, i don’t see <strong>sip address</strong> under
<strong>emailaddresses</strong> attribute. can you let us know if have assigned office 365 license (skype for business online license) for the user “becky”?</p>
<p>meanwhile, we have checked dns for the domain, the srv records are correctly set up. we would also like to collect
<strong>configuration information</strong> <strong>log</strong> on the skype for business client. to obtain the information, press and hold the
<strong>ctrl key</strong> while you right-click the communicator, skype for business icon in the notification area, and then click
<strong>configuration information</strong>. then copy the information and send it via pm.<br />

<p>and regarding “<strong>most of our users are on lync 2013, but now o365 offers skype for business 2016.&nbsp; on the first person i've installed this for</strong>,” we would like to know the detailed information about your deployment as we checked the tenant
 where you have deployed exchange 2010 based hybrid.<br />
1.&nbsp;do you have lync hybrid deployed in your organization? <br />
2.&nbsp;do you want to use office 365-skype for business online or on-premises lync server as your im server?<br />
3.&nbsp;do you want to integrate on-premises exchange 2010 with office 365-skype for business online or with on-premises lync server as i see your office 365 plan includes skype for business online license?</p>

            Hi <span>chiquititoo,<br />
<br />
<span>We would like you to do a clean uninstall of Wndows Live Mail. To do this, we'll first need to remove the registry keys associated with the previous Live Mail installation. Before you
 edit the registry, please make sure to back it up. It is highly recommended that you know how to restore the registry just in case a problem occurs.
<br />
<br />
For information about how to back up, restore, and modify the registry, please read this
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/256986" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>article</span></strong></a><span>.<br />
<br />
Then, please follow the steps below on how to do the <strong><span>clean removal</span></strong> process:
<br />
<br />
1. Open Registry Editor (Click the windows icon also known as the <strong><span>Start</span></strong> button, on the Start Search box, type
<strong><span>regedit</span></strong>, and then press ENTER to open a Registry Editor window)<br />
2. Click <strong><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>SOFTWARE</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>MICROSOFT</span></strong>.&nbsp;Right click
<strong><span>Windows Live Mail</span></strong> and then press
<strong><span>Delete</span></strong> to remove the registry key.
<br />
3. Click <strong><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>SOFTWARE</span></strong>, and click
<strong><span>MICROSOFT</span></strong>. Right click
<strong><span>Windows Live Mail</span></strong> and then press
<strong><span>Delete</span></strong> to delete the registry key.<br />
4. Exit Registry Editor and then restart the computer. <br />
<br />
Once done, you could download&nbsp;the latest Windows Live Mail&nbsp;</span><a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials-other-programs?T1=t2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>here</span></strong></a><span>.
 Kindly download Windows Live Essentials. Afterwards, please install it.&nbsp;After doing so, you'll have the&nbsp;option to&nbsp;download all the application&nbsp;available&nbsp;or you could only download Windows Live Mail by choosing it.<br />
<br />
After&nbsp;installing WLM, please follow the instructions in the article below on how to reconfigure your account:<br />
<br />
</span><a href="http://windowslivehelp.com/solution.aspx?solutionid=47ff78a2-56b4-4e72-a9bf-0024217aeac6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>How to configure a Windows
 Live Hotmail account in Windows Live Mail</span></strong><b><span><br />
<br />
</span></b></a><span>If you're using a non-Hotmail account, please follow the steps provided in this
</span><a href="http://windowslivehelp.com/solution.aspx?solutionid=2fed6e95-2d35-4030-a12c-9a399d5889c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>link</span></strong></a><span>.<br />

            Hi <span>chiquititoo,<br />
</span>[quote user=chiquititoo]your computer may be out of memory or your disk is full. [/quote]<br />
<ul>
<li>Do you still have available disk space for Windows Live Mail? Have you checked your Hard drive if it's working properly? Because you'll not get this error out of memory or disk is full if you still have available disk space or if your hard drive is being
 detected or working fine.</li></ul>
<p>Thanks!<br />

            Hi<br />
<br />
i have 475GB free of 575GB in my hard disk, my memory (ram) is 4GB (2.9GB usable ), and i don't have any problem with my hard disk.<br />
<br />
Am out of ideas, but i noticed that this started happening after windows did an update but i tried to restore my system to an old back up point but it fails to do so .<br />
<br />

    <title>Full Screen on secondary display&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brandonwainwright  say:</h3>
<h2>            Full Screen on secondary display&#63;</h2>
                    I am working with a laptop and a projector as a secondary screen for my classroom. Since the windows 10 upgrade, I cannot make a youtube video, or anything else go fullscreen on the projector. It pulls it down onto my laptop every time. I could do this
 on both windows 7 and 8 without much trouble. how do I do it on windows 10 without making the projector my primary display? (duplicating is also bad because of confidentiality stuff)

            0x80070661 is defined as ERROR_INSTALL_PLATFORM_UNSUPPORTED in winerror.h. Looks like the deliver man choked. Windows Update is supposed to give you updates that are applicable to your system. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Try cut the middle man. Download the offline installer of the service pack (search office 2007 SP3 on download.microsoft.com) and try again. If that&nbsp;failed&nbsp;too, you probably want to visit the Office install forum.</div>
