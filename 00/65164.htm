<h2>            Videos taken from Camera app randomly cutting off while recording</h2>
                    I've noticed this twice now, where I've tried to record a video (each going on for about 12 minutes). The recordings gave no indication that they stopped. The finished result of first video cut off after only 24 seconds, and the second one lasted 6 minutes
 and 24 seconds. Are there any ways of fixing this, or are there certain limitations to the camera app that restrict based on length of video?

<h2>            My Audio is Broken&#63;</h2>
                    Okay so basically, a couple of months back, around October 29th, 2018, I had updated my computer because of a mandatory update that kept reappearing every 50 minutes. When I had finally decided to update it, I had shut off my computer too so it'll update
 then shut down. The next day I opened up my computer, turned it on, and it was updated. The first thing I did was go onto Chrome to watch some anime, when a pop up on the side of my screen appeared telling me to delete the last update to free up some space,
 so I thought why not, and did just that. So I begin watching my anime when I notice that there was no volume. So I go to my home screen where Wallpaper Engine was running something in the background like always, and yet again, no audio. It was perfectly fine
 before the update. So I decided to restart my computer, but to no avail, there was still no audio being played. I searched up a solution, but came pretty empty handed, only being told about the new Spatial Sound feature. So I swi

            Hi  Sejway 
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience. 
<br />
<br />Can you download the latest Audio driver for your computer model from the following link then install it:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://download.msi.com/nb_drivers/ad/Audio%20driver_6.0.1.8158%20and%20Nahimic_2.3.20.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.msi.com/nb_drivers/ad/Audio%20d...</a>

<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />

<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />If its Windows 10 1809:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1809, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hi Sejway,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these steps and check after each step. If these don't work, let me know. I will provide further troubleshooting steps.
<br />
<br />1. Run Audio / Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; 
<br />A. Playing Audio &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />B. Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />2. Take actions related to Audio Driver 
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices &gt; Sound, Video &amp; game controllers &gt; Right Click on the entry below (if more than one, then you will have to repeat the steps for all) &gt; Properties &gt; Driver Tab &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Roll Back -  If Roll back driver is enabled, roll it back
<br />
<br />B. Update - Update driver
<br />
<br />C. Download and reinstall the driver from computer manufacturer's website - If you face issue, let me know your computer make and model?
<br />
<br />3. Check Speaker / headphone is not disabled and is set as default
<br />
<br />Type Sound in Windows Start Seach box &gt; Click Sound &gt; Under Playback tab, right click on an empty space and select, Show disconnected devices and Show disabled devices &gt; Select Speaker and click on Properties and make sure that it is is enabled &gt; You may also check if the Speaker that you are using is set as default.
<br />
<br />4. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter

<br />
<br />5. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<h2>            How to fix black borders in game after updating to windows 10</h2>
                    I've had this problem since I upgraded to windows 10. Every time I try to play a game at a lower resolution than my desktop resolution I get up getting black borders around it. I've tried updating my video drivers, I tried the scale to full screen fix,
 I even uninstalled and reinstalled my video drivers and nothing has worked. My laptop is too weak to handle my max screen size with games and i'm too poor to buy a new computer. can someone please help me out here? I would reinstall windows 10 with a fresh
 copy but I have programs for school I can't get rid of so if there's another way around this besides reinstalling a fresh copy that would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few applications which are no more compatible with Windows 10. You will have to contact application's manufacturer and see if the drivers latest updates are installed. If not now, we are sure new driver's updates will be released. Please be patient
 and wait for the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the time being you can explore the new and exciting features of Windows 10 and learn more about it:</p>

<p>Hello Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, issues with Windows Update occur when related services stop running, when there's a problem with the update cache, or when the required components are corrupted or in your case, missing. In these situations, you can reset
 the Windows Update on Windows 10 to resolve most problems. The steps on how to reset Windows Update components are found on this

<p>Hello Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, issues with Windows Update occur when related services stop running, when there's a problem with the update cache, or when the required components are corrupted or in your case, missing. In these situations, you can reset the Windows Update on Windows
 10 to resolve most problems. The steps on how to reset Windows Update components are found on this

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your assistance. However, this didn't work and I am still unable to install the new Windows10 updates. The troubleshooter reported that it solved some issues but it also said:</p>
<p>"Windows Update Components Must Be Repaired" with a red cross and 'Not Fixed'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else do you suggest? I really want to update Windows10. What else can you recommend please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Why does Windows 10 think I&#39;ve logged in as BUILT-IN ADMIN when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Windows 10 think I&#39;ve logged in as BUILT-IN ADMIN when I&#39;ve just logged in as myself who is the Admin and the only User&#63; Is there a Registry change that can fix this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've asked for help on this and it still won't let me open EDGE or do certain other Admin type things but I don't think it is blocking me from doing all Admin tasks. Yes, did stupidly mess with the BUILT-IN ADMIN things when someone had advised me to turn
 it on so that I wouldn't keep being denied to take some steps without acknowledging that I was the Admin which had been annoying me since I'd never had to do that on any other computer (Windows XP or before) and since I'm the only User account on this&nbsp;computer
 so obviously I'm also the Admin.<br />
But at about the same time as all of this was happening, I also stumbled upon this freeware called Winaero Tweaker &nbsp;<a href="http://www.intowindows.com/winaero-tweaker-all-in-one-tweaking-tool-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.intowindows.com/winaero-tweaker-all-in-one-tweaking-tool-for-windows</a>
 that gives a user lots of ways to tweak Windows and maybe that thing messed up my computer. I'd sure like to find out a way to fix it and I'm not getting any help over at my other Question
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-msedge/why-when-clicking-edge-icon-i-get-this-app-cant-be/e0994488-8de3-4270-9f69-f740de4a3d2d">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-msedge/why-when-clicking-edge-icon-i-get-this-app-cant-be/e0994488-8de3-4270-9f69-f740de4a3d2d</a>&nbsp;See other info and images in that Question.</p>
<p>I did use some feature down near the bottom at USER ACCOUNTS &gt; BUILT IN ADMINISTRATOR but turning it ON put some icon on my log-in screen that would allow anyone to log-in as some generic Admin just by clicking it after not even entering a password even
 though it showed my photo and User name down there. </p>
<p>So I quickly went in and turned that thing back OFF and restarted my&nbsp;PC and I felt good when that login icon was now gone. But it must have done something bad to my registry or something? I don't know anything about registries except to know that I shouldn't
 mess with them unless someone gives me very specific steps to take including exactly how to do whatever they say will do it.</p>
<p>So, help please since apparently this Winaero Tweaker must have messed up my registry and the computer thinks that I'm now the BUILT-IN ADMIN even when I log in as me and it shows my whole set of Programs and DOCs?</p>

<p>Let's not worry about how I got&nbsp;started on this mess with the Built In Admin except to say that it involved Winaero Tweaker: All-In-One Tweaking Tool For Windows freeware and an option far down in the column on the left to turn the Built In Admin ON or OFF.
 Apparently OFF doesn't work properly.</p>

<p>This company's site&nbsp;is one of the worst that I've ever seen as far as making it almost impossible to figure out where to get their freeware without accidentally installing some other **** that they surely get paid to spread around.</p>

            Sorry if I'm a dumbo and I hope that you see this one before Replying to the one of mine a few minutes ago. I figured out to just right click that thing that Cortana popped up at click RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR and then take your steps. I did both entries to
 turn it OFF with no and then to set the password. I guess I should log off and give this a try now since EDGE still pops that same box at me? I'll be back soon.

            I'm sorry to keep coming back and adding another Reply but I need to tell you that I just did a complete Clean Install start-over a few weeks ago of Windows from an installation file copy that I have saved on a USB flash drive, all my Programs from different
 sources and my DOCS &amp; PICs from my USB backup. I wiped my drive completely before installing Windows 10 with a factory&nbsp;file that I'd put onto a USB drive with help here in my SICK PC Question and this file was NOT an image of what I'd had or something like
 that. It was a true Microsoft new installation file that was dated in Nov 2015 after Microsoft had made some important changes to Windows 10.

            Is there a Registry change that can fix this? I'm getting desperate. This has been going on for weeks now and I'm not seeing any end to it. I really don't want to need to do a Clean Install of Windows just to fix it but if that's what it takes, then I
 guess that I'll have no other option and I'm not going to sit around waiting much longer.

            Hello, 
<br />Try reinstalling the Printer.
<br />Right-click Start and select Run.
<br />In the Run dialog box, type in control printers and press OK.
<br />Locate your printer in the Printers section, Right click it and select Remove device.
<br />Restart your PC.
<br />If you have a setup media of the Printer driver(This is usually a CD or Setup program supplied with the Printer), run the utility and let the Printer Install.
<br />If you do not have a setup media, try adding a printer manually using "add a printer" button in the menu bar. It should automatically detect and Install the Printer.
<br />After the Printer Installs, try printing a test page to see if it works as desired.
<br />Retry the task again.

            <p>Not finding gpedit on Windows 10 Enterprise by default. It is easier to use these steps...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) Search for and run the desktop app <strong>Local Security Policy</strong>.</p>
<p>2.) Under the <strong>Security Settings </strong>list, tap on the <strong>Network List Manager Policies
</strong>item.</p>
<p>3.) Under the <strong>Network Name </strong>column, find your local network. (It is probably called

<p>4.) Double-tap on the <strong>Network</strong>.</p>

<p>8.) Tap on the <strong>OK </strong>button.</p>
<p>9.) Close the <strong>Local Security Policy </strong>app.</p>

            <p>Why was this even changed, without the user's knowledge or permission, and why has the process been made so convoluted and complicated?&nbsp; This type of behaviour from Microsoft affects IT professionals like myself who need to work remotely.&nbsp; Suddenly I cannot
 remote desktop to my work machine because Microsoft have decided to modify *my* machine without my knowledge or permission.&nbsp; It makes both me and my company look incompetent in the eyes of our customers, so thanks a bunch for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of messing around with other people's property without invitation, why don't you instead try *NOT* doing that?</p>

            Here, here, I&nbsp;am an IT pro and am seeing this with client PCs all the time. I do not know why Windows 10 seems to continuously lose your private setting and set the network to public completely randomly.&nbsp; This is clearly an issue in Windows 10 that needs
 addressing and a much easier way to change the network location.&nbsp; Why can't you just have a link or button in network sharing centre that allows you to change it right there!??

                    <p>I am trying to share wifi connection between my laptop and desktop computer using an ethernet cable. I have wifi on my laptop but no way to connect to wifi on my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what i have tried doing</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the laptop running windows 10:</p>
<p>-In settings click the "network and internet" button</p>
<p>-Click "change adaptor options"&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Then I right clicked on the network, selected properties</p>
<p>-then under the "sharing" tab, i clicked "allow other network users to connect through this computers internet connection"</p>
<p>-Then I plugged in the Ethernet cord to the laptop and desktop computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>The desktop computer is running windows xp&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have to change any settings on the desktop? or is this even the correct way of doing it?</p>

<p><span><em>I have wifi on my laptop but no way to connect to wifi on my computer [desktop PC?].</em></span></p>
<p><span>-&gt; Your description sounds a little confusing. Would it be correct to say this?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Your router/access point runs a wireless network. Let's call it MyWLAN.</span></li><li><span>Your laptop connects wirelessly to MyWLAN.</span></li><li><span>You have a desktop PC. It lacks a wireless adapter.</span></li><li><span>You do not wish to use a CAT5 cable connect the desktop PC to your router.</span></li><li><span>Instead you wish to use a CAT5 cable to connect the desktop PC to your laptop, using it as a bridge to access the router.</span></li></ul>
<p>If this is correct then the answer is yes, it can be done. However, a more elegant way would consist of purchasing a $20 USB wireless network adapter for your desktop. It would let you connect to MyWLAN directly and without depending on the laptop.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Blue-Window Animation BUG&#34; in Tablet Mode &#40;Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Build 14393.xxx &#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'll try to explain how to reproduce this visual glitch as best as I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">EDIT: <a href="https://1drv.ms/v/s!AkuijOylYy9P_Ixaw1H_8YEELGhbtw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">VIDEO</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10 - Official/Production Channel (NO-Insider) - Build 14393.xxx</li><li>Tablet Mode: Enabled</li><li>Surface Pro 3 - i5/8GB RAM/256GB SSD - Default Settings and Clean Installed too (but it actually happens on&nbsp;<em>ANY device
</em>I tried so far)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open&nbsp;3 UWP apps and 1 Desktop app, for example: Edge (UWP), Groove Music (UWP), Mail (UWP), and File Explorer (Desktop);</li><li>Initially, everything open-animate-transition well without issues. So go back to Edge (UWP), and try navigating this Forum Community, log-in with your MS Account, and try to post in any of the Community Topic. Try surfing some heavy website too (News, other
 Forum Boards and so on);</li><li>Open Task View -&gt; and switch to another app, for example Groove Music (UWP). Transition/Animation will be smooth and correct&nbsp;too</li><li>Open Task View again -&gt; this time switch back to Edge (UWP), and you will now see a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">BLUE WINDOW ANIMATION/FLASH</span> filling the full screen animation until Edge last webpage is shown again, and resumed. The static Blue-Animation WON'T go away anymore, until Edge (or the app that has this bug) is manually
 killed from Task Manager, and opened again (until the bug reappears soon after).</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Possible Cause:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10&nbsp;Anniversary Update&nbsp;Tablet Mode&nbsp;now handles Task View transitions with "Preview Screenshots" of the last app used before it got suspended in favor of the active one for performance and memory optimization (in a similar way like Windows 10 Mobile
 always did since W10M TH2). Edge has some problem to save and show its "Preview Screenshot" when resuming after visiting some specific website (as Forum Boards + MS Account access?). It's a solid bug, still present even after Clean Install, so I highly doubt
 it's user-dependent. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Possible Fix: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A new 14393.xxx OS cumulative update from Microsoft side / A new feature updates, like Creators Update;</li><li>A new Firmware Update (especially Display-GPU side) for Surface Pro 3 from Microsoft side;</li><li>New generic GPU Drivers update.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>STATUS AS OF&nbsp;March 8th, 2017:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem still NOT fixed with latest, official,<strong> 14393.693 </strong>update.</p>
<p>

            <p>I upgraded my Surface Pro 3 i5/8GB RAM from official 14393.969 to -&gt; 15063.0 official x64 ISO (Italian)<br />
<br />
The upgrade was smooth, and the build seems to have no bug at all.<br />
<br />
My only gripe is that GPU/Graphic performance got much worse compared to previous AU build, especially in animations fps and transparencies rendering.<br />
And I think I'm not the only one, see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/62jud7/win_10_14393_au_15063_cu_upgrade_surface_pro_3/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Let's hope new drivers and ZDPs will fix it shortly, I don't want to clean install...

<h2>            How to make the hidden files and folders visible on the back up drive.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Cleaning up backup Drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, I am using Microsoft Windows 10 and Internet Explorer 11.</p>
<p>I use&nbsp;a program called "Copy to Synchroniser" to backup my hard drives.</p>
<p>I use the Microsoft Tool "Disk Clean-up" to clean all temporary internet files, Off line internet files, temporary files in general and Internet Explorer files to clean my Boot Drive = C:\<br />
My question is, on my back up drives, where will I find these files to delete them manually and make them visible as I have looked for the folder locations and they appear to be invisible to me even though they are not system files and folders on my master
 Boot Drive C:\</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that we are unaware how the copy to Synchroniser would back up the drive and
<br />
suggest you to contact the software manufacturer for more information.<br />

            <p>It is totally irrelevant how "copy to Synchroniser" works, suffice to say it copies all the latest files and folders from C:\ to the relevant back up drive.<br />
However it also copies all the temporary internet files, off line files etc. as well and this will over time make my backup huge with irrelevant files.</p>
<p>I want to know how to make the hidden files and folders visible on the back up drive and the location folder path to all the temporary files and folders Microsoft created on C:\ drive so I can clean them up on the back up drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience you're experiencing with Windows 10. Not to worry. Let me help you in fixing this issue quickly. Provide us few details regarding this issue for a better clarity:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the make and model of the Computer?</p>
<p>2. What is the error message/code that appears when this issue occurs?</p>
<p>3. Did you update the Network drivers after upgrading to Windows 10? If not, then I suggest that you do it through Device Manager.</p>
<p>4. Does the same thing happen with a Wireless connection?</p>
<p>
Let Windows try to help you fix the problem. In the search box on the taskbar, enter
<strong>Network troubleshooter</strong>, then select <strong>Identify and repair network problems</strong>.
</p><p>If that doesn't work and you're using a wired connection, make sure both ends of your Ethernet cable are securely plugged in to your PC and your router or modem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You may also visit the manufacturer's website to see if Windows 10 drivers are available or not. If available, you may download

            Hi Ken.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br /> 
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to restart PC three times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Startup Options here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>.  Try Last Known Good Configuration and then Safe Mode with Networking.
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, infection cleaned up and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>:    
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />

<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and keep us posted on how it goes.

            The Microsoft Surface uses its own unique interface for booting into the UEFI firmware interface.
<br />
<br />First, you need to access your BIOS / UEFI setup utility on your Surface.
<br />
<br />    Make sure your Surface or Surface Pro is fully powered down.
<br />    Press and hold the volume up button located on the left side of the device.
<br />    Press and hold the power button for five seconds located on the top of the device.
<br />    Release the power button after five seconds but continue to hold down on the volume button until you see BIOS UEFI.
<br />
<br />The Surface uses a combination of text-driven interface, touch and mouse input to modify boot settings. Navigate down to the option Configure Alternate System Boot Order using the down arrow key. Hit the Enter key, which will load a sub menu; use the up and down arrow to select the first boot device then hit Enter.
<br />
<br />Navigate down to the Exit setup menu, hit Enter, use the left or right arrow keys to select yes then hit Enter.

            Hi Ken,
<br />
<br />Start your Surface, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . .
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset

<p>Hello tdcarter72,</p>
<p>Thank you for using the Microsoft Answers Forum</p>
<p>Have you been able to play this movie correctly previous to this problem arising? If so, has anything changed in codecs installed or uninstalled in the days leading up to the problem arising? What format is the movie in? Was there anything different in the
 publishing of this movie than other ones you have tried? Also, you may want to check the disc itself and make sure that it is not damaged in anyway.</p>

            Judd,<br />
I have a similar problem. Movie Maker will not play the video in the preview monitor when I import an .AVI file from my computer. All I get is the sound.&nbsp; I had the same problem when trying to play the file with Windows Media Player. I searched online for the
 problem with that and found that I was able to download the Xvid Codec and now the video plays fine in Windows Media Player.&nbsp; Does this affect trying to use Movie Maker and allowing it to play in the preview monitor?<br />
Any ideas on how I can fix this would be greatly apprectiated.&nbsp; I want to be able to splice my videos that I've taken with my digital camera, add music and transitions, and such, etc, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Maria

            Mine has stopped working following 2 recent "important windows updates". The trouble is, I couldn't remember what the updates were. I've tried re-installing as well.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I was also half way through a project when i did the update. It was working fine and the preview screen worked before the update. Now it doesn't. I can hear audio. However, even if I publish the video the screen remains black. I've published previous videos
 that now don't work. It's very upsetting as I'm trying to do a video for a chirstmas present!!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

            This problem just started for me as well.&nbsp; I have not made any changes to the computer other than the regular windows updates.&nbsp; I've heard of others suggesting codec updates so I installed K-Lite Codec Pack but it didn't make a difference.&nbsp; I also tried
 uninstalling Movie Maker as well as all of Live Essentials and reinstalling with no difference.&nbsp; I don't have time for this - I installed Adobe Premiere Elements and it works like a champ.&nbsp; Done.<br />

            <p>I too&nbsp; have the same problem.&nbsp; When I bring a video clip (AVCHD video from my Canon HFM30 camera) into WMM&nbsp;it shows on the time line but will not play in the video box.&nbsp; It also happens with videos I had previously edited and saved a few months ago.&nbsp; In
 fact Movie Maker won't display any type of video file now where I had no problems in the past.&nbsp; It was working just fine not it's not.&nbsp; The vids open&nbsp;and play just fine in Windows Media Player, but not Movie maker.&nbsp;Please help me get this issue fixed.&nbsp;</p>

            I have this same problem. Anyone fixed it yet? Movie maker will show my images and videos in the preview on my 2007 computer. But on my 2012 computer it only shows them in the editing pain. But won't show in the preview.
<br />
<br />
Anyone come up with a solution? I called my fix it dad and he thought maybe the video driver needed an update after checking the codecs but it was already updated.
<br />
<br />
I wonder if it has to do with the internet explorer update. Ever since I updated it I can't view anything that plays a movie or uses flash. So I have to use firefox.
<br />
<br />
I am open to any ideas<br />
Thanks!<br />

<p>Taka sama informacja pokazuje się w grach, w które nikt nie gra online, także niekoniecznie musi to wskazywać na problemy techniczne. W Dead Rising 2 masz to samo? Wybierz "Ranked Match", tam jak nikt nie gra to gra powinna sama utworzyć pokój. Jeśli jest
 to samo, najpierw przetestuj połączenie (ustawienia -&gt; ustawienia systemu -&gt; ustawienia sieci -&gt; wybierz swoją sieć -&gt; testuj połączenie z usługą Xbox Live) i podaj wyniki.</p>

<p>patrząc na Twoje gry nie sądzę, aby nie było tam graczy - NBA 2k13, czy Kinect Sports 2 na pewno powinny kogoś spokojnie znaleźć, a i komunikat powinien być inny - zazwyczaj nie znajdując graczy tworzone jest lobby i oczekiwanie aż ktoś się połączy. z tego
 co napisałaś wnioskuję konfigurację sieci lub całego netu od dostawcy, napisz jeszcze jaki masz dokładnie internet. otworzenie portów może pomóc.</p>

<p>a to taki lokalny dostawca, czy jakaś większa firma? z tymi małymi są niestety problemy, oni "kroją" łącze i blokują jak mogą (sama szybkość gra tutaj mniejszą rolę), do neta to jest spoko, ale granie już często napotyka właśnie na problemy...</p>

<p>kroi w znaczeniu, że to oni dynamicznie dzielą łącze i dostarczają je do odbiorców, zakładając przy okazji ograniczenia, których celem jest utrudnienie zapchania sieci. znam to z autopsji, administrator sieci mówi - "patrz jakie masz zarąbiste łącze, 5 milionów
 mega, śmiga jak miło, wszystko powinno działać", no i jest, tyle że rozłożone na 100 odbiorców, a równocześnie na serwerze tyle blokad, że granie w sieci na konsoli staje się niemożliwe... konsola ma naprawdę spore wymagania w tej kwestii, zagadaj z nimi jak
 masz dobry kontakt, to ewidentnie po ich stronie jest. ten router to od nich?</p>

<p>no to opcjonalnie pozostaje jeszcze konfiguracja routera, ale tam na standardowych ustawieniach wszystko powinno być ok. nadal obstawiam, że to po stronie dostawcy jest, ale i pogrzebać w ustawieniach routera nie zaszkodzi.</p>

<p>Thank you, Andre I have a new Dell XPS 13 running Windows 10, and the advantage of having Windows 10's Cloud has me only only needing 128gb to create a system image. I will not be needing an external hard-drive for my personal use; I did not want to have
 the expense and bulk of having any more external device than needed.<br />

            <p>I totally understand, its easy to travel with also. Last year I had an external hard disk stolen at the airport. So, its easier to secure than a bulk external drive with power cables and such.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note, your system image must be less than or equal to the size of thumb drive. So your thumb drive must be 128 GBs or greater or the system image which is the backup of the PC must be 128 or less.

    <title>Will Trusteer Rapport on work on Microsoft Edge in Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> im ok at fixing stuff because i mess it up good  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will Trusteer Rapport on work on  Microsoft Edge in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    Trusteer Rapport automatically protects websites that belong to businesses that work with Trusteer to provide the highest level of security for&nbsp; customers. Trusteer Rapport also lets you manually apply Rapport's protection to all the other websites that
 you use in which you sign in and exchange sensitive information, such as personal financial information or sensitive data.
<p>When you connect to a protected website, Trusteer Rapport does three main things in the background to make it extremely difficult for criminals to target you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trusteer Rapport verifies that you are really connected to the genuine website as opposed to a fake website created by criminals. Surprisingly, it is not trivial to reach a genuine website when you type the website address into your
 web browser.</li><li>Once verification is complete, Trusteer Rapport locks down communication between your computer and the protected website. This prevents criminals from hijacking your online connection with the bank.</li><li>Trusteer Rapport protects your computer and internet connection by creating a tunnel for safe communication with your bank or enterprise, preventing criminals from using malware to steal your log-in data and tamper with financial transactions
 or information exchanges.</li></ul>
<p>My question is will the program work in Microsoft Edge or if not does the browser has similar built in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in Advance.</p>

            <p>The Rapport site (<span>http://www.trusteer.com/support/supported-platforms) indicates that they have a Windows 10 version but only for
</span><span>IBM Security Trusteer Rapport which, presumably, is not a version used by our banks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, if you are in Microsoft Edge you can click on the 'More Options' button (the three dots in the top right hand corner of the Window just below the close window X). In the menu there is an option to open the page you are currently viewing with
 Internet Explorer. If you have Rapport for this version of Explorer then it should provide the protection you previously experienced.</span></p>
<p><span>This has worked for me.</span></p>

<h2>            Can I render video to the TV from my Windows Vista PC&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: Renderer for Windows Vista</p>
<p>I recently purchased a DLNA compatible Tv (Sony Bravia KDL-46EX710). It supports Rendering. Can I render video to the TV from my Windows Vista PC. All network connection are made and the TV can access files on the PC. But the goal is to render to the TV.
 In other words have the PC control the images on the TV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

Hi op29,</p>
<p>In Windows Vista, you can use a media extender, but that would need to go through Windows Media Center and be controlled on the media extender, not the computer.<br />
<strong>See <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Set-up-a-Windows-Media-Center-Extender-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set up a Windows Media Center Extender device</a></strong></p>
<p>This is possible in Windows 7 if the TV is a Compatible Windows 7; you can use the “Play To” feature.<br />

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The moment I click on the link it say We are sorry but your operating system is not supported by Microsoft Fix it at this time. Why is it that this version of the windows 8.1 is so buggy which cant even upgrade the .net framework?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
You can send feedback for Windows 8.1 on this link: http://connect.microsoft.com/<br />

With regards to the second link that we've provided you need to follow all the steps and for the 4 you may just skip that steps only if this is your first attempt in resolving your Windows update issue.<br />
<br />
Let us know how&nbsp; it goes.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
You may completely disable system Windows Update and then, restart your computer. After that try installing .Net Framework 4 as a system administrator.<br />
