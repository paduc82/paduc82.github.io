</p><p>Hi, Yajivkumar. <br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.<br />

Have u checked if you are up to date with the latest firmware along with Lumia system app updates from the store?<br />
<br />
Please try do a soft reset. Here's the link: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d.<br />

    <title>Outlook Calendar to sync with iCloud Calendar&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> formburden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Calendar to sync with iCloud Calendar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So yes, I know you can sync your calendars together. But my question is a bit more in-depth. What I was wondering is if there is a way for the Microsoft Outlook Calendar to sync with an actual iCloud Calendar. Not where you can put Outlook Calendars on your
 iPhone or whatever devices by syncing your account on the iPhone. So an example why is when you actually go into the Outlook Calendar on the website, you do not see any iCloud Calendars there. You see that it is in the account but cannot click on it to see
 the iCloud ones. Same goes on iCloud.com. You only see the iCloud Calendars and NO Outlook ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to actually sync whatever you put in one calendar, it'll write the same info in the other? So you get both ways for this issue I'm having? I know it may seem dumb and all, but it just makes it more put-together so you have one system, instead
 of two systems having to conflict each other to get the result you want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Office Lens Does Not Work on iOS 12 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bsarules  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Lens Does Not Work on iOS 12</h2>
                    <p>This is more of a bug report than a question. I have been using Microsoft Office Lens on iPad for a while now. It worked beautifully on iOS 11, but has not worked since I upgraded to iOS 12. I realize that iOS 12 is still in beta, and things like this can
 occur. I do want to report this issue so that it can be fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I launch office lens on my iPad, running iOS 12 beta 4, 16a5327f, it will hang on the Office Lens logo and crash. I tried deleteing and reinstalling the app, and it will let me go through the first few screens, but it will hang upon trying to
 request access to the camera. I force close it and relaunch, and it just hangs. I have a screen recording of this behaviour that I can upload or send as neccessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office lens is a good app when it works, but I havent been able to use it in a while.</p>

The update did come out but still had to uninstall and reinstall. Probably coz the initial permissions were broken when i reinstalled on 2.14 in ios 12. But probably dont need to do that if you upgraded to ios 12 on version 2.16

            <p>Apple were <strong>ACTUALLY&nbsp;</strong>the <strong>FIRST </strong>phone company to include the 5GHz fequency in a phone model&nbsp;with iPhone5</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Dual- band Wifi</strong></span> phones is the feature you need to look for. Others have followed Apples lead (for once) and now include dual band&nbsp; Wifi&nbsp;in their models</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here was an extremely well wrtiten and&nbsp;short article by <strong>Pocketnow.com&nbsp;</strong>on dual band wifi and suitable for here</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">Wi-Fi first came out, there were two versions that you could choose from: 802.11a and 802.11b. From a consumer perspective, there wasn‚Äôt much difference between the two. Devices based on 802.11b were generally less<br />
expensive and more readily available than those based on 802.11a, so the b specification quickly became the consumer standard. 802.11b operates in the 2.4GHz spectrum. These days, it‚Äôs getting pretty crowded, and to help address the digital noise that comes
 with it, 5GHz WiFi is making a comeback.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)"><br />
<strong>802.11a (2.4GHz)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">802.11a was a standard in 1999 which promised to bring network connections to devices delivered over the air instead of through copper cables. It was built around the 5GHz spectrum, but failed to gain much traction in the market.
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">Being the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù Wi-Fi protocol, it faced a steep learning curve and deployment problems which delayed the deployment of 802.11a networks. Also, components that operate on 5GHz were generally more expensive and harder to
 come by than 2.4GHz components.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)"><br />
<strong>802.11b (2.4GHz)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">During this phase of 802.11a‚Äôs ‚Äúgrowing pains‚Äù, the 802.11b specification was being worked on. It offered basically the same features as 802.11a, but used less expensive and more readily available components.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">Due
 to these factors, 802.11b saw significant adoption amongst home and small-office users, whereas 802.11a only saw any level of ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù in enterprise network environments. Popularity of Wi-Fi began to grow, and the standards that backed it continued to improve.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)"><br />
<strong>802.11g (2.4GHz)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">By 2003 a new standard had been ratified, though many devices were using the 802.11g draft specification prior to the date that it was made ‚Äúofficial‚Äù. This version of the Wi-Fi standard brought many of the stability-features
 of 802.11a and the inexpensive componentry of 802.11b, improved upon them, and upped the speed to 54Mbps.
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">Consumers were thrilled, and this is still one of the more popular&nbsp; versions of Wi-Fi available today. Unfortunately, it still uses the 2.4GHz spectrum, which, as you might have suspected, is getting pretty crowded now that
 all these Wi-Fi devices are operating on the same <br />
frequencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)"><br />
</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">Bluetooth, Microwaves, &amp; Wireless Peripherals</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">Bluetooth used to be limited to headsets and other special-use equipment, but as its feature-set increased, devices using Bluetooth increased too ‚Äî and not just in number, but in the bandwidth they use and the amount of time they‚Äôre
 turned on! Bluetooth speakers and docks are a good example of this, though wearables are quickly becoming more commonplace as well.
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">Keyboards, mice, trackpads, and trackballs can use Bluetooth to connect, and even those that use their own proprietary wireless hardwareare typically still using 2.4GHz.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)"><br />
<strong>802.11n (2.4GHz or 5GHz)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">When 802.11n came around in 2009 it brought with it the ability to communicate up to 600Mbps. What‚Äôs more, 802.11n also included the ability to work in either the 2.4GHz or 5Ghz spectra. Like the other standards before it, 802.11n
 was backwards compatible with its predecessors. Unfortunately, since most devices already on the market were already using 2.4GHz, most 802.11n wireless access points stuck to 2.4GHz as the primary operating frequency, and some devices didn‚Äôt even
<br />
include the hardware to use 5Ghz at all. </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">Some let you pick between 2.4GHz and 5GHz operation (not both), but
<br />
since most people still had some 2.4GHz devices they kept their networks on 2.4GHz rather than making the switch across the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)"><br />
<strong>802.11ac (2.4 <em>and</em> 5GHz)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">802.11ac was ratified in January 2014, but devices based on the draft specification were available for months prior. This standard brings the maximum data rates up to 1Gbps (almost double that of 802.11n). In most 802.11ac wireless
 access points, <strong><em>both</em></strong> 2.4GHz and 5GHz hardware is included, though most segregate the traffic from each onto its own network.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)"><br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Advantages of 5GHz</span></strong></span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">Users can take advantage of the reduced noise available in the 5GHz spectrum. This will provide faster data rates, fewer disconnects, and a more enjoyable experience. (It may even help&nbsp; you run faster and jump higher, but
 that study is still pending.) </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">Bluetooth and other wireless peripherals aren‚Äôt going to bother you&nbsp; in the 5GHz spectrum so there‚Äôs less interference. Microwaves don‚Äôt operate up here (not even newer ones), so that source of noise is eliminated, too.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">There are many more reasons why 802.11ac is better than others, but&nbsp; this article is about switching to the 5GHz spectrum, rather than about 802.11ac specifically. With a compatible router or WAP, your 802.11n 0r 802.11ac
 smartphone or tablet will work much, much better. With a stronger the signal and faster the throughput, less power is required to get your signal above the noise floor, which should result in better battery life in addition to better network performance.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">Not all of your devices are going to have 5GHz compatibility built-in, those will still work every bit as well as they did before on 2.4GHz, but will work even better now that you‚Äôll be offloading traffic from that network
 and putting onto your 5GHz network.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">Lastly, there are some potential disadvantages. Given the same power, the higher the frequency, the shorter the distance a signal can travel. That means your signal may not travel as far as it would have on a&nbsp; 2.4GHz network.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">Since the signals may not travel as far, that means you may not have&nbsp; as much interference from neighbours as you would have on 2.4GHz. Neither will your neighbours (which could very well be a major advantage to both you and
 them). Another potential advantage is that 5GHz signals may be able to get into places that 2.4GHz couldn‚Äôt reach because of the size of their waveforms.
</span></em><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)">All in all, I‚Äôd highly recommend that you upgrade your router or WAP&nbsp; to 802.11ac and set up both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks, then move as much of your wireless traffic to the 5GHz side as possible. You‚Äôll have less&nbsp;
 noise, less interference, better speeds, a more stable connection, and&nbsp; possibly even better battery life. What more could you want?</span></em></p>

<p>Hi Danida,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well,&nbsp; I registered my Skype account a long(looong) time ago, with an email and phone number, that I haven't had for a long time now, so when I try to retrieve my password, it's a dead end.</p>
<p>It was always signing in automatically , until I clicked on some update. The same Skype account is active on my cell though, but I really need it back on my PC as well.</p>
<p>Lastly I have been redirected to an online verification, that the account is actually belongs to me, but even with all the details I provided i got a negative answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<p>Hi Mike, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Users with automatic sign in enabled tend to forget their passwords after using auto sign in for a long time. In the instance that they did forget the password, a reset will usually do the trick. Note that reset and security codes will be sent to the account's
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-and-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">associated security info</a></strong><strong>.
</strong>If the user does not have any access to the associated security info, then he/she would have to manually recover the account by answering and passing the
<strong><a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account recovery form</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your description above, it seems that you've already answered the verification form. I know it is frustrating to fill the form multiple times, but please be reminded that such form was established in the interest of data and account security, meaning
 the system will only grant&nbsp;access to the user would be <strong>able to pass the verification process</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you on this, let me give you tips on how to pass. The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out the form on a device that was used previously for a successful sign in. Also, it is much better if you can do this process from a network
 location <em>(i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network)</em> where a previous sign-in occurred. Be sure to use the information you had associated with the account
<strong>originally</strong>, even if there were recent changes. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Hint</strong>: <em>You just have to provide answers that you are 100% sure. As long as it matches the system records. you will be able to prove your ownership.
</em></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>sorry for late answer, but before I could check it with our admin, aprox 2-3 days ago OneDrive app was updated through google play and now I have version 5.20 and everything went back to "normal" automaticaly without any changes from my side.&nbsp; I left my
 app since the last reinstal you wanted and now, after update its all back</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So I suppose that there was something with version 5.19 ?<br />

                    <p>Hey. I have lumia 520. </p>
<p><br />
I had LINE messenger and it was working fine. I deleted it by mistake but when re-downloaded. It is not working anymore. I tried to register with my old account but it did not seem to work. Then i went for the other option to register as a new user. But of
 no use. When after entering my phone number i agree to terms and privacies it says *your network is unstable. Check your connection **. Though i am connected to internet and all of my other apps are working super fine with the wi-fi connection i am using.
 I also re-installed the app several time but it is still the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Anyone please suggest me what to do.</p>

if you have feedback, the best option is to leave this directly with Nokia and/or Microsoft, by clicking the Nokia Support link at the bottom of this page. And for Windows Phone 8 feedback, go to

    <title>Shared calendar with control over permissions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlie145  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shared calendar with control over permissions</h2>
                    <p>We've just migrated a client to Office365 from on-premise Exchange and are having issues with the shared calendars they use (booking the board room, staff holidays etc). They are currently set up as shared mailboxes but this only seems to give 'full access'
 or 'send as' permissions which translates to 'complete control' and 'view busy/free but no details' with regards to the calendar. We need to have more granular control over permissions (reviewer, contributor etc. as well as read level) but want to avoid having
 to purchase a license for a simple shared calendar. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the best way to do this? I found some PS commands but they all state they can't find the mailbox when running Add-MailboxFolderPermission which I assume is because the mailbox doesn't have a license.

            <p>Hi Charlie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all users in your organization are hosted in Exchange Online, you may try the following method:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating a Public Folder Mailbox in Exchange Admin Center if you don‚Äôt have one.</li></ol>
<p>Note: We need to create a public folder mailboxes first before creating a public folder.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4055026-0efc-4141-9b24-fce80df97df4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4055026-0efc-4141-9b24-fce80df97df4" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f90a805d-8170-4bf4-9a1b-1852dfeddf21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f90a805d-8170-4bf4-9a1b-1852dfeddf21" /></a></p>
<p>You now have to assign appropriate permissions to this root folder. We recommend that you allow Administrators to be an Owner of this folder and keep the rest as default. This will mean that normal users cannot create new public folders, it will have to
 be done by an administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly, click Manage under Folder Permissions</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f19bcbb0-6a65-4e3b-b50a-978d12bda981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f19bcbb0-6a65-4e3b-b50a-978d12bda981" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.Creating the Shared Calendar Public Folder in Outlook client </p>
<p>Now your public folder environment is correctly configured and you can start creating the Calendar folder using Microsoft Outlook.</p>
<p>Open the Outlook and navigate to the folders list.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc9b5c91-681c-4ccc-81ca-d74258cb9d59" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc9b5c91-681c-4ccc-81ca-d74258cb9d59" /></a></p>
<p>You should see the Public Folders section. If you do not see the public folders section check that you have assigned the correct permissions above. If you have only just created the public folder mailbox and root public folder it may take a few hours for
 the public folders to appear here.</p>
<p>Expand out your Public Folders and All Public Folders until you see the root public folder you create earlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9412c108-cec6-4808-bc51-458cfab101c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9412c108-cec6-4808-bc51-458cfab101c2" /></a></p>
<p>Right Click on this root public folder and click New Folder to create a Shared Calendar folder as pictured.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/556751c5-f43b-4d72-85f6-2a89b03b88c6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/556751c5-f43b-4d72-85f6-2a89b03b88c6" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right Click on the newly created folder and click Properties. You can now set permissions as to who will have access to view and modify the contacts.</p>
<p><strong>Anonymous</strong> refers to users outside your company. We recommend setting these permissions to None.<br />
<strong>Default</strong> refers to authenticated users within your company. We recommend setting these permissions to Author, which will allow them to create new calendar entries and edit their own.</p>
<p>The different permissions are as follows:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Owner </td>
<td>Create, read, modify, and delete all&nbsp;items&nbsp;and files, and create subfolders. As the folder owner, you can change the permission levels others have for the folder. (Does not apply to delegates.)
</td>

    <title>Auto-recharge Suspended and Problem with your Payment emails arrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> judith n goldberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto-recharge Suspended and Problem with your Payment emails arrive every 12 hours&#33;</h2>
                    <p>All was well enough until had to change credit card for automatic top up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, credit card company sent a Fraud Warning. Okay, cleared that up and trial billing went through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the twice daily emails started coming and coming and coming and coming. What monthly limit? Don't have a subscription. What payment? My balance isn't low enough for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarted Auto-recharge. Took out credit card and put it in again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Made a manual payment. Went through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Signed out of apps on iPhone and iPad. Signed in and showed new balance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning, after receiving another set of emails, turned off Auto-recharge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Twelve hours later, received the same 2 emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Emails look authentic. Not using links. Programming problems? Spam? Having trouble connecting to online chat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions besides marking these emails as spam?</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the topics fit so just picked two. Did have some trouble signing in online recently. It wasn't me.</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;Judith N Goldberg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried to check if you have any other active Skype account?</p>
<p>To check if there are other Skype accounts that might be associated with your email address:</p>
<p>1. Access this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a></p>
<p>2. Type your email address and click Continue.</p>
<p>3. You will be routed to&nbsp;<strong>Recover details</strong> page, where you can see the accounts associated with your email address.</p>
<p>If there's more than one result, try to access the accounts and check if there are active subscriptions and cancel them.</p>
<p>If there's none, try other email addresses you might've used to create a Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also check the email notifications if there's a Skype name mentioned. And check that account then cancel any active recurring payment:</p>

<h2>            Cannot change voicemail greeting</h2>
                    <p>I'm running the Skype desktop client for Windows 10 and there appears to be no way to change my voicemail greeting! Under Tools-&gt; Options Calls, Voicemail, there's a link to change voicemail and call settings on Skype.com but I can't find any option on skype.com
 to change the greeting, which has reverted to the default since I moved from OSX to Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a paid Skype user. This is a horrific app and a horrific UX on the web site. Where the **** do I change my voicemail greeting?</p>

            As a Skype user of more than ten years, I've been recommending Skype to people every chance I get. I subscribe and have a number and recently enjoyed recording outgoing greetings, and another feature that was extremely useful "Skype call Testing Service"
 is now gone as well. I was planning on upgrading Skype business for an additional $5 a month, (although I don't need office on-line), but if I can't control outgoing messages for my business, telling people who I am, then Skype is now worthless to me. If you
 tell me that I won't be able to record voicemail greetings, or use testing service to assess connection sound and video quality for calls and conferences, then I will be cancelling my subscription to Skype and moving to another service such as Vonage, and
 I will be telling everyone to bail on Skype as well. When Microsoft acquired Skype, everyone predicted this would happen eventually; I didn't expect Microsoft to take such a great VOIP product and make it nearly useless, so soon, although

    <title>Outlook Desktop limits emails to 100 email recipients per day - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tbtf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Desktop limits emails to 100 email recipients per day &#40;&#63; SOLVED&#41;</h2>
                    <p><strong>(See the "UPDATE" bolded section near the end of this post for how I have navigated the Outlook restrictions on the number of emails that can be sent per day)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>=====================================</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft Office Consumer Support declined to answer the following&nbsp;questions, and suggested I post them elsewhere.&nbsp; The problem is
</span><span>when I send an outlook.com email via my Outlook Professional 2016 outlook.com (via Microsoft Exchange - not some other server) with 4 colleagues copied on each email, then I am limited to no more than 20 emails per day.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If I send an email copied to 25 colleagues, then I am limited to 4 emails per day.<span>&nbsp; This
</span>helps account for days I am repeatedly shut off from sending emails by 9:30 AM.<span>&nbsp; My account is well over 30 days, and I have repeatedly "validated" my account, as suggested by Microsoft.&nbsp; While Microsoft Office Consumer Support would not answer
 the questions below, he did state that Outlook.com is not intended to be used to send emails to more than 100 recipients per day.&nbsp; Questions:</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Prior to switching my email address to outlook.com, I had only one other email address for&nbsp;decades, spanning&nbsp;my entire lifetime.&nbsp; It was after research I chose outlook.com.&nbsp; Afterwards,
 it took countless hours for at least 5 weeks to notify others of my new email account.&nbsp; So when time is factored, choosing outlook.com for my email was not a free endeavor.&nbsp; Had I known the restrictions Microsoft places on its outlook email services (as stated&nbsp;in
 the Office Consumer Support&nbsp;email), then I could have made a more informed choice.&nbsp; It is not feasible for me to now change my email address to a third email address.&nbsp;
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Although I did much research beforehand in deciding to choose outlook.com, it is clear I did not do enough research.&nbsp; In retrospect, where could I have&nbsp;found the link wherein Microsoft transparently discloses
 how its outlook.com free email service is not intended to send over 100 emails per day via the Outlook Professional 2016 software app via Microsoft Exchange, even if the account is over 30 days, and even with validation?</span></span></strong>
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. Microsoft Office Consumer Support stated that if even if my Outlook email is not the work domain of my workplace, if I correspond with colleagues on my Outlook email, then this is by definition work-related
 activity, and thus not the intended use of the free Outlook.com account.&nbsp; Many professionals such as myself have their work colleagues and personal life tightly interwoven.&nbsp;
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>In retrospect, where could I have found a link wherein Microsoft transparently discloses how its outlook.com free email service is not intended to be used by professionals who frequently correspond with
 colleagues.&nbsp; For that matter, where could I have found a link where Microsoft transparently discloses how its outlook.com free email service is intended for personal use, and not intended to be used for business purposes.</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3. In his email,&nbsp;Microsoft Office Consumer Support stated that no official Microsoft personnel has ever stated Outlook.com users are entitled to send 300 emails per day, once their account is 30 days or
 longer, validated, and as long as they do not violate any rules of conduct.&nbsp; However, that is exactly the gist of what I was told in a Chat with a Microsoft support person.&nbsp; Also, Microsoft routinely sends its customers to the Microsoft Community for help,
 with multiple Microsoft Community pages confirming the 300 sent emails per day limit.&nbsp; One&nbsp;example:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_winother/300-emails-per-day-daily-send-limit-for-verified/2d796ab3-4a8b-4c28-9f47-eead1ee05369"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_winother/300-emails-per-day-daily-send-limit-for-verified/2d796ab3-4a8b-4c28-9f47-eead1ee05369</span></a>.&nbsp;
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Why does Microsoft send its customers to the Microsoft Community for ‚Äúanswers‚Äù, if the support provided is inaccurate or misleading?
</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">4. The Microsoft Consumer Support person stated that sending over 100 emails per day via Outlook.com is too much for the free Outlook.com account.&nbsp; On a call with a Microsoft salesperson, I was told that
 a paid 365 account would allow me to send up to 500 emails per day.&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Why does Microsoft limit the number of emails sent from the Outlook Professional 2016 software app to as low as 100 emails per day for
 the Outlook.com free account, but allow sending up to 500 emails per day via the 365 Outlook paid account?</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">5. According to an official Microsoft support page on this topic, it is stated 4 times with links as to how to ‚Äúincrease your message limit‚Äù with Outlook.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Outlook-com-won-t-let-me-send-an-email-62de1f9b-6552-4239-8578-078d292bb31a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Outlook-com-won-t-let-me-send-an-email-62de1f9b-6552-4239-8578-078d292bb31a</span></a>&nbsp;
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Why does this Microsoft website not disclose that the free Outlook.com account is not intended for sending over 100 emails per day via the desktop Outlook software app, and not more transparent in providing
 a realistic range of the limit of the number of emails that can be sent per day via the desktop Outlook software app?</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">6. My current email address is the email address for which I want to increase the limit of emails I can send to the 300 limit.&nbsp; Since this experience started, and after a lengthy search, I find other Microsoft
 customers have reported the same problem, wherein they are limited to around 100 sent emails per day via the desktop Outlook software app, with perhaps more sent emails allowed by logging in to Outlook.com, and using the much less user friendly and much inferior
 online email Outlook platform.&nbsp; In his email, the Microsoft Consumer Support person stated the Office 365 account has nothing to do with the Outlook.com email account.&nbsp;
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Why does Microsoft not allow for a paid plan that encompasses Outlook.com emails, such as the one I already have?
</span></span></strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since this experience, I find the above questions reflect the sentiment of other Microsoft customers.&nbsp; They reflect real issues, affecting real Microsoft customers.&nbsp; At least for me, t</span><span>he purpose of these questions are not to complain,
 or get something for nothing.&nbsp;</span><span><span>I am willing to pay for expansion of my current Outlook.com free email service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, had Microsoft been more forthcoming and transparent about the limitations of the Outlook.com free account, then perhaps
 I would have started with a paid Microsoft 365 email account.&nbsp; But without knowing the limitations of the Outlook.com free account, I spent countless hours switching to an outlook.com email address (setting up the account, notifying others of my new email
 address, etc.).&nbsp; It is not feasible to switch to something else&nbsp;now.&nbsp; This&nbsp;brings me back to the last question above.&nbsp;
</span></span><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Why does Microsoft not allow for a paid plan that encompasses Outlook.com emails, such as the one I already have?&nbsp;</span></strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Thanks in advance
 for any help you can provide.</span></span></p>

            Thank you so much for taking the time to reply. &nbsp;I looked through the Terms and Conditions you suggested, and could not find where outlook.com users are limited to sending 100 emails via the desktop Outlook software app, with perhaps the ability to send
 more emails when signing into Outlook.com. &nbsp;Also, it was the Microsoft Office Support person who stated outlook.com was "not intended" to send emails to over 100 recipients per day. &nbsp;Finally, it is not my desire to merge my personal outlook.com email with
 my business email address. &nbsp;I want to keep them separate. I want to keep my personal outlook.com email personal. &nbsp;Having said all this, I will purchase the Ad-Free Outlook service, just as you recommended. &nbsp;You are the expert. At this point, I will gladly
 purchase a paid Microsoft outlook account for services its sponsored webpages suggested were included in the free outlook account (see the link in the original post above). &nbsp;But I believe it fair to point out

            <p>Thank you. &nbsp;It appears a difference of opinion exists among Microsoft experts whether the Ad-free outlook account increases the number of emails that can be sent from outlook.com. &nbsp;Also, at the recommendation given above, I tried the link to sign-up for
 this Ad-free outlook service. &nbsp;While the link to the description of the service went fine, I repeatedly received an error message at the stage where I sign-in to actually purchase it. &nbsp;Ultimately, I was able to purchase the Ad-free outlook service. &nbsp;But due
 to the lack of disclosure as to whether this will help or not, it is a shot in the dark; time will tell if it helps. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is my understanding from Microsoft Support that switching to an Office 365 account has "nothing to do with your outlook.com account." &nbsp;Thus, the Microsoft Office Support person suggests that paying for an Office 365 will not increase the spending limit
 respective to my outlook.com email address. &nbsp;As per my questions in the original post, it seems true that an Office 365 account may increase the email sending limit to 500 emails per day (as per a phone call to Microsoft). &nbsp;However, that requires a change
 of my email address to something other than *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. &nbsp;As per my original post: &nbsp;<em>"</em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>I am willing to pay for expansion of my current Outlook.com free email service. &nbsp; Had Microsoft been
 more forthcoming and transparent about the limitations of the Outlook.com free account, then perhaps I would have started with a paid Microsoft 365 email account.&nbsp; But without knowing the limitations of the Outlook.com free account, I spent countless hours
 switching to an outlook.com email address (setting up the account, notifying others of my new email address, etc.).&nbsp; It is not feasible to switch to something else&nbsp;now."</em>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; So in addition to the lack of clarity on the most basic aspects of Microsoft
 Outlook email services, for which even Microsoft experts seem to be unclear, it also begs the question I stated before, which is: &nbsp;<strong><span>Why does Microsoft not allow for a (clear and unambiguous) paid plan that encompasses Outlook.com email addresses,
 such as the one I already have?</span></strong></p>

            <p><strong>Hi Jaqui. &nbsp;Thank you for taking the time and interest. &nbsp;No, I have not received answers to my questions, that are described more in detail above, and which include:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><strong>(1) Where could I have&nbsp;found the link wherein Microsoft transparently discloses (what the Microsoft Support staff emailed me) that its outlook.com free email service not intended to send over 100 emails per day via the Outlook Professional
 2016 software app via Microsoft Exchange, even if the account is over 30 days, and even with validation?</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span><strong><span><span>(2) &nbsp;Where could I have found a link wherein Microsoft transparently discloses how its outlook.com free email service is not intended to be used by professionals who frequently correspond with colleagues (as was emailed
 to me by the Microsoft Support staff).&nbsp; For that matter, where could I have found a link where Microsoft transparently discloses how its outlook.com free email service is intended for personal use, and not intended to be used for business purposes.</span></span></strong></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span><strong><span><span>(3) &nbsp;The Microsoft Support person stated the repeated statements by Microsoft Community expert personnel were all incorrect in claiming outlook.com allows for sending up to 300 email recipients per day, once the account
 is over 30 days old, and once validated. &nbsp;</span></span></strong></span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Why does Microsoft send its customers to the Microsoft Community for ‚Äúanswers‚Äù, if the support provided is inaccurate or misleading?</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span><strong><span><span>(4) Why does Microsoft limit the number of emails sent from the Outlook Professional 2016 software app to as low as 100 emails per day for the Outlook.com free account, but allow sending up to 500 emails per day via
 the 365 Outlook paid account?</span></span></strong></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span><strong><span><span><strong><span><span>(5) Why does this Microsoft website not disclose that the free Outlook.com account is not intended for sending over 100 emails per day via the desktop Outlook software app, and not more transparent
 in providing a realistic range of the limit of the number of emails that can be sent per day via the desktop Outlook software app?</span></span></strong></span></span></strong></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span><strong><span><span><strong><span><span><strong><span>(6) Why does Microsoft not allow for a (clear and unambiguous) paid plan that encompasses Outlook.com email addresses, such as the one I already have?</span></strong></span></span></strong></span></span></strong></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span><strong><span><span><strong><span><span><strong><span><strong><span><span><strong><span><span><strong><span><span><strong><span>(7) &nbsp;Does purchasing the Ad-free Outlook plan really increase the number of emails than can be sent via the
 desktop Outlook software app to 300 email recipients per day, instead of 100 email recipients per day? &nbsp;As you can see from the discussion above, Microsoft Community experts have opposite opinions on this. &nbsp; At the recommendation above, I purchased the Ad-free
 Outlook plan, and have not had my email shut down since. &nbsp;However, I don't know if I have sent emails to more than 100 email recipients in a single day since the purchase. &nbsp;It appears that one of the reasons I sent so many emails when I first switched to outlook.com
 is because I was sending email notices I had changed my email address to outlook.com. &nbsp;I am sending less of those emails now. &nbsp;But that is not to say that I may not need to send more than 100 emails in a day at some point in the future. &nbsp;So again, I have a
 simple question. &nbsp;Does purchasing the Ad-free outlook plan increase the number of emails recipients I can send emails per day? &nbsp;If so, then now that I purchased the Ad-free plan, what is the new limit of how many email recipients I can send per day?</span></strong></span></span></strong></span></span></strong></span></span></strong></span></strong></span></span></strong></span></span></strong></span></span></strong></p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As per the first sentence of my post, I already contacted Microsoft Support: &nbsp;"Microsoft Office Consumer Support declined to answer the following&nbsp;questions, and suggested I post them elsewhere." &nbsp;It was
 only because the Microsoft Support person would not answer these questions, and recommended I post them elsewhere, that I posted the questions here. &nbsp;For clarity, I have used Microsoft operating systems since the DOS days. &nbsp;For decades, I have repeatedly purchased
 Microsoft Operating systems for my personal laptops, as well as for the periodic purchase of Microsoft Operating systems on desktops for an entire building full of employees. &nbsp;I even purchased Microsoft Vista for goodness sake. &nbsp;I am anxiously awaiting a possible
 Microsoft Surface Phone. &nbsp;So the issue here is not a lack of appreciation of Microsoft, its innovations, and/or its products/services. &nbsp;The issue is a lack of transparency in clearly describing Microsoft outlook.com services. &nbsp;In retrospect, the questions
 above are not new. &nbsp;They are similar to questions asked by many Microsoft Community users for years. &nbsp;I cannot find anyone who has received a definitive answer. &nbsp;As I previously posted: &nbsp;"</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I challenge
 anyone to contact Microsoft Office Support or sales, and get (in writing) a clear and unambiguous answer to the questions I posed above. In my case, the Microsoft Office Support person refused to answer these questions, and directed me to post them elsewhere.
 &nbsp;Why the secrets?"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[UPDATE: &nbsp;Although difficult to claim with certainty, it appears Microsoft uses an Outlook Email Restriction Algorithm (MOERA) to determine the number of emails Microsoft allows its Outlook customers to send. &nbsp;(1) While it may be incorrect, it appears
 from experience that if emails are sent before 6 - 7 AM ET (which are normal work hours for many of us in small business), the number of email recipients allowed to be sent from the Outlook Desktop application for the rest of the day is dramatically reduced.
 &nbsp;Microsoft headquarters is located in Redmond WA, which is Pacific time. &nbsp;So perhaps the Microsoft Outlook programmers set the algorithm to discourage emails sent to be sent at 3 - 4 AM PT. &nbsp;(2) &nbsp;While the phone verification is often advised to increase sending
 limit to close to 100 recipients per day during the first 30 days of Outlook use, after 30 days, experience suggests some additional Outlook emails can be sent up to 100 email recipients per day if the online Outlook account is opened at the same time the
 &nbsp;Outlook desktop application is being used. &nbsp;(3) &nbsp;As best I can tell, purchasing the ad-free service did nothing to increase the number of emails I can send per day. &nbsp;(4) &nbsp;I find I can potentially extend the functionality of my Outlook desktop app if I use
 the online Outlook account for emails having larger numbers of recipients listed in "reply all." I therefore "save" my limited and valuable Outlook desktop app emails (both send and reply) to individuals (i.e. one person). (5) &nbsp;Despite having an Outlook email
 account for several months, I still am sometimes cut-off at less than 50 email recipients per day. &nbsp;One possible explanation is sometimes I receive emails that are also sent to multiple other email addresses, especially regarding meeting notifications. &nbsp;If
 I forward such an email to one person, I find that while it is forwarded to only one person, the subject line suggests the possibility the Microsoft Outlook Email Restriction Algorithm (MOERA) "thinks" I am responding to everyone in the original email. &nbsp;So
 even if the email is forwarded to only one person, it is possible the MOERA "thinks" the email is being sent to many recipients - dramatically reducing the actual number of emails that can be sent for the day. &nbsp;Based on this theory, I am no longer using the
 Forwarding" function with respect to emails about email meeting notifications that were sent to multiple recipients. &nbsp;Instead, if I want to send a meeting notification to someone else, I am now using the "Reply" function (instead of Forward function). &nbsp;With
 this approach, the subject line no longer has Subject/Location/When/From. &nbsp;I then replace the automatic reply email address from the sender, with the email address of the person I originally wanted to forward the message. &nbsp;I have no idea if this will help.
 &nbsp;But I plan to give it a go. &nbsp;Hope all of this helps the many others who have expressed the same challenges facing me.]</strong></p>

    <title>windows 10 creators update fast ring - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chayansraj  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 creators update fast ring</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Currently my build number is <strong>15063.138</strong>. I updated my PC through slow ring settings. Now I want to shift it to fast ring and I already did it also to receive build number
<strong>16179</strong>. I changed the ring a week ago but no new preview update appeared, so I reset the insider program by opting out and again choosing fast ring but nothing is happening. I am only getting windows defender definition updates. What is wrong
 in the process? Is it buggy?&nbsp;</p>

<p>They have said that it can normally take up to 24 hours after switching Rings before a new build is offered. It has seemed faster lately, so there could be something wrong, but we have no way to know for sure. All we can do is run the Windows Update Troubleshooter
 and if the results are good, leave our computer online and waiting for many hours or overnight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With early Insider builds, like where we are at now in the build cycle, I like to keep Insider separate from my daily use. I install it to a separate partition on my hard disk and can boot to it any time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I usually use Hyper-V to "fetch" me the new Insider Fast Ring builds. That way, if a build is not immediately offered, I can just leave the Hyper-V VM running in the background while I continue using my public build PC (running version 1703 / build
 15063). Users have created scripts to convert the files produced by Windows Update into an ISO for the current Fast Ring build. So I let the VM upgrade and then make an ISO for the Fast Ring build to install elsewhere.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Warranty Repair</h2>
                    I've tried several times to get information (an address) as to how I should send in my Xbox One for a warranty repair. &nbsp;It's still under warranty. &nbsp;I've done everything I can to arrange to send it to the Microsoft repair facility for ether a repair or
 a replacement. &nbsp;However, I keep getting this message when following the online process: &nbsp;"<span style="color: rgba(169, 68, 66, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Customer
 Email and Phone doesnot exist</span>." &nbsp;I can assure you that my email and phone actually
<strong>DO</strong> exist as I use them frequently (daily). &nbsp;That said, I still need to send my console in for repair. &nbsp;It's still under warranty until June. &nbsp;Since I can't arrange for shipment via Microsoft's online process how can I go about getting this
 problem resolved?</span>

            Thanks - I have finally resolved the issue. I did the on-line chat for support and services and the person I talked to entered all the info for me and sent in my service ticket.

    <title>Cortana on Band 2 can&#8217;t reach your Phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bleak morn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana on Band 2 can&#8217;t reach your Phone</h2>
                    <p>Anyone else having issues where Cortana stops responding to voice commands from your Band 2?<br />
<br />
Details here: https://40north.wordpress.com/2016/02/25/cortana-on-band-2-cant-reach-your-phone/</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a device reset, everything works fine - then after about 6 hours or so I get:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Sorry, I couldn't reach your phone..."<br />
<br />
...or:</p>
<p>"Make sure Bluetooth is on and your phone is close by"<br />
<br />
I've contacted chat support twice on the matter and the only answer they have is to do a device reset whenever this happens (daily based on my experiences - and that of a friend having the same issue) or to get a Band 2 replacement.<br />
<br />
Maybe if we can find a few more people experiencing this issue we can figure out a quicker work-around than a device reset and re-installing the Microsoft Health app on my phone.<br />
<br />
Maybe the issue isn't the Band 2 - maybe the phone isn't responding to requests properly - which would be odd since all other data from the Band 2 is syncing just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: Stopped the Microsoft store last night. They said that based on internal posts this has been a known issue with Band 2 when used with Windows 10 Mobile since November. No ETA on a fix. üò©</p>

I'm on a Lumia 950 XL.&nbsp; I've noticed the problem on both the stock version and the Insider Fast Ring versions of Windows 10 Mobile.<br />
<br />
I haven't tested SMS replies much (I avoid SMS and use Skype or Telegram instead), but when I was demoing it to a co-worker, it failed.</p>

            Ditto on all counts. Same hardware 950 xl and band 2. Very frustrating and seemingly unsolvable except for a reset :(

            @Bleak morn, just got a software update for the band2 and it now is able to connect about 80% of the time without resetting. That said it still takes quite a while for it to think about the question compared to on the phone. Still though... Progress :)
 did you get the same results?

            I've seen this also when I have another bluetooth headset connected. When I disconnect that headset, it's more likely to work. Doesn't mean it always does.

<p>I have a few other devices <em>Paired</em>, but no others have been <em>Connected</em> when I've experience the issues.&nbsp; The main thing I connect with is Ford Sync and I haven't really tried issuing Cortana voice commands via the Band 2 in the car.</p>

    <title>Email salutation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> warren john  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email salutation</h2>
                    <p>My mailbox server has recently changed to an Outlook based (.live) platform and I have&nbsp;opened an additional business email using the same account as my personal name. Everything is fine if I use their website but I prefer to use MS Outlook as a work base&nbsp;and&nbsp;operate
 both my private and business (additional) email addresses through Outlook proper.</p>
<p>When sending from the business email address Outlook is "picking up" my personal salutation as a prefix to the actual email so that it appears to anyone receiving business mail from me that it is personal email in their inbox (and not from my business)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, currently I have FROM:&nbsp;&nbsp;"removed PII"&nbsp;&nbsp;where my clients appear to have an incoming email from "removed PII" (the remainder of the address either dropping off or being deleted).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would love to know how I fix this this so that my clients see in their inbox (from) "removed PII" so that they can identify me correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have searched through Outlook to the best of my ability and have not been able to find a fix that works. The contact card is all AOK (no "removed PII" anywhere). Would appreciate any thoughts/ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Ralph,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. I am sorry that I cannot find the "private" tab that you mentioned.........</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have managed to attach a snip of my open outlook that shows more precisely what my problem is. I hope it all makes sense to you and that you may have some ideas to resolve the issue I have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had to rename my Microsoft Account to a @.live.com.au address as part of this process (more complications for little old novice/me, lol) so hope that my old avatar (the very fitting "woriwarren") is now showing as opposed to the "warren john" I originally
 used.&nbsp; Woriwarren was not able to be used when I made the initial enquiry but now that I have changed my "prime" account name to&nbsp;the @live.com.au platform it has reinstated itself and appears to have over-ridden the "warren john" I used first up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again, thanks for your help.................hope this is OK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Ralph,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry that I cannot find any response/link to this question as I think that my account has now been moved to the original "woriwarren" amd I can no longer get back to this question./sign in on it apart from this saved bookmark. Still having trouble
 trying to find the "private" tab you mentioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am going to have a try at reposting the question (perhaps in a more easily understood manner now that I have the screenshot that you suggested) under my original woriwarren account and see how that goes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for you help anyway</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            windows 10 mobile latest build 14361 vs 14356</h2>
                    <p>hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am using lumia 640 DS, after so many fiddling, so many comments in community, and so many resets and recovery tool, i have updated my phone with the build 14356, after few days updating this build my phone is very nice and very smooth except few bugs,
 the battery issue has been resolved and still slight improvement required, grooves player is good no stuck in the middle, some apps are not responding after installing(don't bother)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>now my question is shall update with the latest build 14361, i feel if update with this build, again there will any issues in the phone, because i don't want any more fiddling and researching on my phone, if any problem arises after installing 14361, so
 i can retain with build 14356 as this build is very nice, except with minor battery issues, edge browser grey issue, and slight heat issue, otherwise i am happy with the build 14356.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the insider for the build 14356 for a problem free update</p>

<p>&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It still starts with Initializing, then switches to Getting things ready.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp; Could be the speed of your processing that you don't catch it.</p>
<p>Wasn't it "Preparing Installation" after "Initializing"?</p>

    <title>Cleanup Duplicate contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charles foxtrot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cleanup Duplicate contacts</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail-people/how-to-delete-duplicate-contacts-in-windows-live/ed940eb4-8ef8-4c4c-91d9-875b389c0455">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail-people/how-to-delete-duplicate-contacts-in-windows-live/ed940eb4-8ef8-4c4c-91d9-875b389c0455</a> but it doesn't really fix my problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a bunch of duplicate contacts that are "cleaned up", but many of them show phone numbers, etc. that are ten years out of date.&nbsp; Because they're "cleaned up", they're really bunches of duplicate outlook.com contacts that are merged under one entry.&nbsp;
 However they're still duplicated, they aren't one contact they are many contacts, just all associated with one person.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife (and many other people that I've known for a long time) has 12 or so duplicate outlook.com contacts under her entry in livemail people (the problem carries over to my Windows 8.1 phone).&nbsp; Which one of these is the one that has the old work telephone
 number that she had when I first met her? I have no idea.&nbsp; I have to manually look through every one of them and delete it, sometimes several times.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to clean up my contacts.&nbsp; The problem with that is that it doesn't really merge the multiple contacts into one contact.&nbsp; It just links a bunch of duplicate contacts under one merged "master" contact.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for my wife I'll have a phone number that she hasn't had in 8 years listed under the 10th Outlook contact that's under her merged contact and her old school email listed under the 8th Outlook contact that's under her merged contact.&nbsp; I do have some information
 that came over from Google, etc., but the bad duplicates are all in Outlook.&nbsp; That's the account that has 10 or so subcontacts under a bunch of the merged contacts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the merged contact there's no way to tell which sub-contact is the one that has the old obsolete phone numbers and email addresses, you can't delete the subcontacts, and you can't delete the phone number from the merged contact.&nbsp; You have to go
 to each subcontact and delete it there.&nbsp; It's very tedious because you have to open all ten or so subcontacts&nbsp;to clean it up.&nbsp; I didn't see any way to configure an existing live.com email address under

<h2>            Embed a Calendar in our Website</h2>
                    <p>I have searched and searched for an answer to this and older posts say it is not possible but I'm hoping this flaw in Office 365 has been corrected.</p>
<p>We have a website with a couple public calendars. We currently use Google calendars and they are easily displayed on the web site using an embed code.</p>
<p>We switched to Office 365 for our Domain based email and the calendar software seems to be have a lot of functionality but I can not find how I can embed a read only version of our calendar in our web site.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>hi lesosborne,</p>
<p>based on your description, do you mean publish your office 365 calendar and embed it in external website?</p>
<p>if yes, we can use powershell to publish the calendar of the mailbox to a html link directly. please note that only admin of office 365 can use powershell.<br />
here are the detailed steps to do it:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">connect to exchange online using remote powershell</a></i></b><br />
2. run the following two commands in powershell:<br />
<strong>a. set-mailboxcalendarfolder *** Email address is removed for privacy ***:\calendar -publishenabled $true -detaillevel fulldetails</strong><br />
<strong>b. get-mailboxcalendarfolder *** Email address is removed for privacy ***:\calendar |fl</strong><br />
then copy the html link from the second command. please replace *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with the address you want to publish the calendar from.<br />
here is a screenshot for your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b2bcf9b-ec0b-43da-a9f6-9b978bf8d0db" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b2bcf9b-ec0b-43da-a9f6-9b978bf8d0db" /></a></p>
<p>then please try copying the html url in web browser to see whether the calendar can be displayed properly.</p>
<p>please feel free to post back if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>regards,<br />

            <p>It's entirely ridiculous that this process is so labored when Google has made it so simple. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I'm guessing that there is absolutely no way to have a group of calendars in overlay view embedded, where a user of a website could choose to turn on &amp; off the calendar overlays that they need to see. &nbsp;THAT is what I need to be able to do. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'd like to be doing it in Office 365, as that is what my university uses and supports but, thus far, I can only do it with Google Calendars.&nbsp;</p>

            Google starts with the question "how can we make this work better?"&nbsp; and then develops. Msft develops then tells you "this is how it works".&nbsp;

<p>Is there a way to format the embedded page? Setting default view of Day/Week/Month, or things like what's the first day of the week. I put one in and it starts at 12AM in the Week view. Not very handy to hide single events in a day that happen in the afternoon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the left and right frames, can they be set to collapse or expand (the left is the mini month and the right is the list of events)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found I can put categories that show up in different colors inside Outlook, but when it posts to a page, it all becomes the same color. Thing goes back to the other user who wants to be able to show overlays of multiple calendars. Categories kind of works...except
 in the embedded html.</p>

            You can embed just the calendar view web part of a calendar list (or of any list) on any page if that helps.

            Probably the easiest method is to import the form using External Data -&gt; Access and follow the wizard. Keep in mind your form is only a screen with some controls and possibly some code. If you want to import tables and/or queries, you will need to select them for importing.

            A form isn't just a single object. A form has a Recordsource, it may have subforms with different Recordsources. The code behind the form may reference other forms as well. It may also reference user defined functions in a global module. 
<br />
<br />So importing the form may not make it fully functional. You need to review the form and find out what all the object dependencies are. Fortunately Access provides a tool for that. On the Database Tools ribbon there is an icon for Object Dependencies. If you use that it should give you most of the dependencies you need to import to the other database.
