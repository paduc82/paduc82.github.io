                    I have asked a question on the Skype forum. Now one of my contacts is asking me the same&nbsp; question. Can I find&nbsp; record of my previous asked questions and answers,&nbsp; even dating previously&nbsp; to Microsoft running skype?

<h2>            Windows asks for password after putting the tablet to sleep</h2>
                    <p>If I set the sign-in options "require sign-in" to 'never' in Accounts, the setting is ignored and the tablet prompts ALWAYS to enter the pin or the password to log in.&nbsp; This misbehavior started with 10240 and was NOT the case in all the previous builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that this misbehavior happens only when I manually put the tablet to sleep.&nbsp; If the screen turns off automatically by timeout, then it does not prompt me to log in.</p>

            No this does not help.&nbsp; Besides, what if I want to sync passwords.&nbsp; Then I would always need to enter the password to turn the screen on?&nbsp; It does not make sense to me. &nbsp; Again, this problem was introduced in 10240.&nbsp; And please do not change the message

    <title>Combo box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamdelaney1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Combo box</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 questions in reference to combo boxes:</p>
<p>1. I have 3 tables that I will be using combo boxes in my main table they only store information such as States in one table and branch of service in another and era served in the third. My main table&nbsp; has three fields one for each of the above tables set
 for combo box referring to the above tables. Do I have to have a relationship set with my main table (Members)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is there a way to view options in a combo box but only show 1 field in the selection. I have a table named States it has a field for the name of each state and a field with the abbreviation. In my main form named Members I would if possible to see the
 full state name and the abbreviation but when a state is selected only the abbreviation is displayed in the main table. Is this possible? My state table has an auto number field, name field, then abbreviation field.</p>

            For question 1 - When you add to lookup field to a table based on another table - it automatically creates a relationship.
<br />
<br />For question 2 - Yes ,it is possible to change the fields shown in a combo box on a form by changing the column count and also the column widths to hide fields from displaying in the combo box.

            Most professional developers do NOT recommend using lookup fields on the table level. They cause more problems then they are worth. The main problem is that they hide what is really being stored. See this discussion about it <a href="http://access.mvps.org/access/lookupfields.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://access.mvps.org/access/lookupfields.htm</a>.
<br />
<br />Relationships are defined  by usage. If you have a foreign key that links to another table to pull info from that table, then a relationships exists whether it is formalized or not. A formalized relationship is created using the Relationships Window. You formalize a relationship by enforcing Referential Integrity. But you can also enforce RI by the design of your database. and using code.
<br />
<br />If you use the Combobox wizard to create your combo on your form, it will, by default, hide the key column (the abbreviation) and show the user the description column (the full names). A combobox displays the first non-zero width column in the RosSource of your combo. So if you have a Rowsource like:
<br />
<br />SELECT Abbreviation, StateName FROM tblStatus ORDER by StateName;
<br />
<br />You would then set the Column count to 2 and the Columns widths to 0";1" (or whatever unit of measure and length you need. By the way, you don't really need the autonumber field as the abbreviation field would work as a primary key in this case. In other cases the AutoNumber is better.

<h3> paulinmd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shared home e-mail account, multiple logins, share contacts list on the same PC</h2>
                    <p>My wife and I have a shared e-mail account (not an outlook.com account).&nbsp; I recently bought a new PC (old one died), and had to install Office fresh.&nbsp; We previously had Office 2007 on the older computer, the shared account was set up in Outlook as POP3,
 and the contacts were shared by default.&nbsp; I set up Outlook on both our PC accounts (local accounts, not the MS Outlook.com cloud accounts) to view the shared email account, using IMAP, but this doesn't seem to allow us to share anything else in Outlook.&nbsp; It
 doesn't share the Contacts, for example, which would require us to set up many of the same contacts manually, especially contact groups we both use.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure, we could each do this manually, but that seems rather ridiculous.&nbsp; I mean, weren't computers supposed to make sharing data easier???</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a bunch of PST folders on another drive (F:) that we are each able to see, but the contacts lists or each of us are maintained separately.&nbsp; I am guessing these are stored in the .ost files, which Outlook by default puts in the c:\users\%username%\appdata\local\microsoft\outlook
 folder.&nbsp; Since the .ost files in both our outlook folders are the same name, have all the same PST folders attached, and are pointing to the same IMAP account, I thought I could set up a symbolic link in each of our outlook folders to point to one .ost file
 on the F: drive, but it only worked for one of us.&nbsp; I copied one of them (from my outlook folder) to the F: drive, and renamed both with a .bak extension, then created the symbolic links to both point to the .ost file on the F: drive.&nbsp; This only worked for
 me, not for my wife.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to share the contacts list, other than manually duplicating it?</p>

<p>You would need to set the mail account up as a pop mail account, and to do so you need to use the manual setup, and you would need the pop data file to be on an internal location you both have access to.</p>

<p>Palcouk, I was obviously not quite clear on this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not talking about sharing the contacts list in the verizon.net online account.&nbsp; We don't use that list at all.&nbsp; We are setting up the contacts list in locally installed Outlook 2016 on a shared PC.&nbsp; We're using IMAP so we can check e-mail if we're away
 from home and look at something we've already seen before.&nbsp; Can't do that if it's set up as POP3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook is set up currently on a PC with two internal hard drives.&nbsp; I install all programs on the C: drive, and all data is on the F: drive (with the exception of data stored by programs in locations I can't change).&nbsp; So all private folders we've created
 are now on the F: drive, and Outlook is connected to that for those folders.&nbsp; I never put that data on USB drives (unless I'm backing it up), and I don't point Outlook to USB drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a home computer network.&nbsp; I don't have a server to dedicate to Exchange, or any other server software.&nbsp; If I did, I wouldn't have this question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Outlook 2007, the contacts list seemed to be shared between multiple users on the same PC, individual logins to the PC, but a shared e-mail account.&nbsp; That is what I'm hoping to do here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We used to have Outlook set up to work with this e-mail account as POP3.&nbsp; If POP3 would allow us to leave messages on the server without retrieving duplicate copies every time we opened Outlook, I'd do that, as it would solve all the problems I'm having.&nbsp;
 But whenever I have POP3 leave messages on the server, it will do exactly what I just described - it pulls down a copy of every message on the server, even if it already has done so.&nbsp; If someone could tell me how to stop that, I'd set it back up as POP3 and
 move on.</p>

            If you want to share Everything, Contacts, Calendars, to-dos, emails, folders, and their structure, a simple fix would be to get a free Outlook.com account and share it.&nbsp; Outlook.com offers Exchange Server support, so everything would be shared and available
 on all devices, computers, smartphones, tablets, any devices you happen to have.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 How to remove multiple attachments at once&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This was a very simple but very useful feature in older outlook versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just cant figure out how to select multiple attachments on an email and simply remove them all at once instead of having to right-click on every single one and delete it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So am I doing something wrong or did Microsoft forget to add a button???&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, your example shows a few negative values marked as "IN".</p>
<p>To mark each value automatically, youcan use this formula:</p>
<p>=CHOOSE(SIGN(A5)+2,"Out","","In")</p>
<p>
</p><p>SIGN returns -1 for negative values, 0 for zero and 1 for positive values. As CHOOSE needs a index starting from 1, we have to add 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

                    Can you maybe post your experiences with using the band in Canada? I've Downloaded the Health app to my Lumina already - everything is in metric and seems to be working fine. But I'd like to hear from owners in Canada who are more savvy than I am.

            That's great, I've been looking at other products... but damn... I'm either a huge Microsoft fanboy and don't know it or they just keep getting stuff right. I think I'm just going to order it from the Microsoft US store and ship it to Canada.

            I know that the device is not waterproof, so no swimming with it. I sweat a lot when I'm running, not so much my arms - but sometimes water gets places. I run with my Plantronics Legend headset and it get's totally soaked in sweat - I'm guess that the
 band is actually better protected that it, so I should be good?

            After a sweaty workout (which these days in Montreal is simply walking home, ugh humidity), I take it off and wipe down the Band, but otherwise you're good. No swimming or showering with it. Use those times to charge the Band if you can.

            That's great to know. Thanks for everyone's input. I'm definitely going to purchase one - as soon as I schedule a trip over the border. Looks like I can't order one online and have it shipped up. I think it's cheaper driving down from Ottawa and finding
 a BestBuy or Microsoft Store front.

<h2>            Automatically Forward to Distribution List</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>This really shouldn't be this hard but I wanted to be able to set up the following on our Office 365 tenant:</p>
<p>- Forward all incoming mail from a set external email address to a distribution group</p>
<p>- Allow a regular user to edit the membership of this distribution group in their Outlook Address Book to include external and internal contacts so that the management of the distribution list is not an IT Admin function.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell my options are to administer the list as an admin and add every contact to the GAL when the user needs one added or removed. Seems a waste of IT resources to have to do this and not allow the user to administer that single Distribution
 List.</p>
<p>The user can't just set up an outlook rule to forward as it doesn't allow the adding of a distribution list (simply adds the individual members of the list) meaning that every time a new member was added or deleted the rule would have to be edited. Not very
 intuitive.</p>
<p>I can set up a shared mailbox to forward to the distribution list as a workaround but the user still can't add external contacts to the list.</p>
<p>Is this simply not possible or am I missing something?</p>
<p>NOTE - we have a single Office 365 Tenant with no hybrid or on premises exchange. Users use a mixture of Outlook 2013 and 2016 on Windows 7 for the most part.</p>

<p>hi john,</p>
<p>thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>firstly, may i confirm that if the ‚Äúuser created distribution list‚Äù you mentioned above was created as the screenshot shows below?</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=60c20a8b-e2ba-481c-abd6-be59a53088c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d60c20a8b-e2ba-481c-abd6-be59a53088c4" /></a></p>
<p>if it‚Äôs the scenario, i‚Äôd like to explain that it‚Äôs not feasible to create inbox rules with the contact groups. however, if i misunderstood the situation, please feel free to correct me.</p>
<p>meanwhile, the user created distribution lists mouran mentioned above is created in
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">owa options page</a>(<strong>note:</strong> end users can just manage the distribution lists created by themselves). so please refer to the steps below to create the user created distribution lists and then try the
 inbox rule again to see if there is any improvement:</p>
<p>1. use the end user account to log into <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
owa options page</a>.<br />
2. navigate to <strong>groups</strong>, click the plus icon under <strong>distribution groups i own</strong>.</p>

<p><br />
3. in the pop-up window, type with the corresponding information and add members for the dg.<br />
4. <strong>save</strong>.<br />
5. refer to the steps mouran mentioned above to create the inbox rule again.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>With which website are you facing the issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>Open Internet Explorer (IE) in no add-ons mode and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;To start Internet Explorer without add-ons:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the
<b>Start</b> button, and select <b>All Programs</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<b>Accessories</b>, and select <b>System Tools.</b></span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<b>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If disabling all add-ons solves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all
 add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will allow you to figure out which add-on is causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;See the section ‚ÄúDisable add-ons in Internet Explorer 8" in the following article for further
 instructions:</span></p>

 Internet Explorer slow? 5 things to try</span></a></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>I would suggest you to perform a full system scan
just to be safe. </p>
<p>Here is a link that will give you information on how to perform a full system scan:</p>

<p>Dear Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The problem is solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you posted the&nbsp;Office 365 subscriber prerequisite I checked and found the subscription was renewed by our group administrator the moment I encountered the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further the next day error "the authentication session has expired" appeared when trying to sign out/sign in from Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching the online communities, I came across the following advises:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Click the WIFI icon - Click Network Preferences - Click Advance - Click DNS - Add 8.8.8.8 - Click OK - Reboot your Mac - This will only refresh the network connection and will back to normal after reboot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I assume item 1 was not the cause of the problem.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Click Finder - click applications - search/open Keychain Access app - delete the Microsoft&nbsp;application password. There were several of these files and I deleted all of them (com.microsoft.office.default.access.group.query.new). I then signed in to Excel
 and the problem was solved. I could synchronise the stock data files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume the Office 365 subscriber renewal affected the Microsoft&nbsp;application password file in the Keychain Access app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know in case you require further information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>PJ</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Word and Fillable Forms</h2>
                    I need to turn a document into a fillable form. I know how to add in the form field, but it alters the formatting and layout&nbsp;when text is added to the field. Is there a way to prevent the formatting of the form from being altered when the field is used?

            Your sample already is in table format. You would want to split some cells so that the response is in a cell separate from the question.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, it appears that you may be using legacy form fields.
<br />In that case, you can use the formfield properties to limit the length of the response.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e6e03e3-7bf3-4d55-909d-0e7796b04535?upload=true" />

    <title>Including missing data in an excel ranking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chuckles14  say:</h3>
<h2>            Including missing data in an excel ranking</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently trying to rank certain investments in order to predict the best possible option to choose. However, some data for some categories is missing, which is causing a #VALUE! error in the overall ranking summation. I want to be able to create a
 whole number rank for this missing data, but do not want to skew it by inputting a 0 or other number in the space that is missing data. Essentially, I want the it to be naturally ranked even though there is data missing. Is there any way to do this, or would
 I need some sort of numerical data inputted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a picture and description of the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each category in Columns D to J are individually ranked in the corresponding columns L to P. Column Q uses a simple SUM equation to create a numerical total of columns L-P. "Rank" gives an overall ranking based on those totaled rank numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Formulas for each of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Ranked in descending order:</span></p>
<p>Column L= RANK.AVG(D4,D$4:D$21)</p>
<p>Column N= RANK.AVG(H4,H$4:H$21)</p>
<p>Column O= RANK.AVG(I4,I$4:I$21)</p>
<p>Column P= RANK.AVG(J4,J$4:J$21)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Ranked in ascending order:</span></p>
<p>Column M= RANK.AVG(F4,F$4:F$21,1)</p>
<p>Column R= RANK(Q4,Q$4:Q$21,1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if there is a formulaic solution for this problem- I'm currently stumped. I'm assuming I might need to somehow find data to insert into the missing cells (See: Last 3 inputs in Column D), but if there IS a solution to work around that, I would
 appreciate the help. Thanks!</p>

<br />
Maybe,<br />
Start your Morningstar ratings in C4 and enter this formula in D4 and fill down...<br />
&nbsp; =IF(NOT(ISNUMBER(C4)),IFERROR(AVERAGE($C$2:C3),"check data"),C4)<br />
<br />
C2 and C3 should be blank.</p>
<p>C4 should have a rating entered.<br />

            <p>I just got "FALSE" responses for all numerical data and "0" for the missing data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The unfortunate part is that I can not just input data to fill the empty spaces: These numbers are true data pulled from a database, and are essential in the overall&nbsp;ranking. I need to somehow numerically rank everything with this data missing, so I initially
 ruled out an IF statement. </p>

            Hi John, Supermo does not have a working uninstaller . . .
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager,
<br />
<br />On the processes Tab, find Supermo
<br />
<br />Right click that and choose 'Open File Location'
<br />
<br />Stop that process in Task Manager
<br />
<br />In Windows File Explorer, delete Supermo.exe and any other associated files
<br />
<br />
<br />Then you need to search for any Supermo Startup process and delete it:
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />With that utility, you can right click and delete any startup item in Windows 
<br />
<br />Just be careful not to delete any required process . . .

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/9f962a91-f281-43f1-8c95-e0db99439617" title="WoodyCarter">
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>I have forgotten my skype phone number.&nbsp; How do I retrieve it??&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>If you are referring to Skype Number, you can check it on your
<strong><a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/main-page?page=onlineNumber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account dashboard</a></strong>. Refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sign in to this <strong><a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>.</strong></li><li>On the <strong>Manage Features</strong>, click <strong>Skype Number.</strong></li><li>Then your Skype Number will show.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that, if the number is already expired, <span>Skype will reserve the Skype Number on user's account for 90 days. This means no one else but this user can purchase this particular number during this period. Given that, you can reactivate the
 number during the given time frame. </span>To reactivate your Skype Number, refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa12164/how-do-i-cancel-my-skype-number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Feel free to post back if you have questions and clarifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>How to disable the font changing when switching language. or any - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to disable the font changing when switching language. or any workaround.</h2>
                    <p>I work on document with Thai and English language. And this just very annoying to manually change style for each part of document.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The "font changing by the input language" override the setup style I'm choosing from Design Ribbon. Result in some small font in header or some big font in paragraph.
</li><li>The auto detecting is a problem for me too. Sometimes it recognize some English text in a paragraph as Thai and some as English. Result in some big font and small font of the same language in a paragraph.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Things that I think maybe solve the problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to totally disable the font changing by input language, or maybe detect all my typing to English language.</li><li>How to style different language effectively so I can select the same font style for every heading, paragraph.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Things that I have been try. but no luck.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change all MS office and Windows 10 UI to English, save and restart the PC.</li><li>Remove Thai language proofing, save and restart the PC.</li><li>Unchecked "Detect language automatically" and see result compare to checked.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to use&nbsp;Cordia New for all language and same font style selected by Design Ribbon but it's trying to change font every time I change the input Language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using MS Word,&nbsp;Office 365 on My PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I do not believe that the Design Tab is the correct place to be invoking the use of Styles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the following page of the late Shauna Kelly's website:</p>

<p>Since you are using the Design tab on the ribbon, I guess you are switching themes or style sets or picking a theme font?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is often more convenient to modify the styles directly, as Charles suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, note that unchecking "Detect language automatically" will only help with
<strong>future</strong> documents. Existing ones must be dealt with one by one, and the easiest fix is to select all the text and (re-)apply the desired language.</p>

<h2>            Error code &#34;Status&#58; 5.5.0&#34;  email delivery failed. Need help. Please&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i, too, <em><strong>sometime</strong></em>, have the same problem sending emails to a particular web-based Outlook
<em>email account address&nbsp;</em>of a friend. So, in order to eliminate all possible causes and prevent you to propose already-answered solutions (i found out on this forum and tried it to no avail), I'm providing below here all available info i have for you
 to help me, and any other people in my situation<strong>:</strong><br />
<strong>1-</strong> Above-described account/ inbox &nbsp;of my friend is already activated. In fact it's been activated years ago, as this is not a new account. Therefore, please do not propose weather it's activated<br />
<strong>2-</strong> I encounter this issue of sending emails to this particular address only sometime, as most of the time my emails are successfully delivered, without being returned, or failed and bounced back at me.<br />
<strong>3-</strong> This email address in question is web-based, and it's the <em>
<strong>only </strong></em>address i have problem with.<br />
In other words, i do not (and never had) such an issue with any other email addresses, web-based,
<em>or</em> not (hotmail/outlook/msn, yahoo, gmail, rogers, bell/sympatico, and more) stored in my contact list.<br />
<strong>4 - </strong>And <em><strong>the most important item,</strong></em> following this sentence, below, here is the exact copy of the error code i had received from email my email service provider (which happens to be Hotmail.com) after my above-described
 email delivery attempt was failed<strong>:&nbsp;</strong><br />
<strong>Reporting-MTA: dns;SNT004-MC3F42.hotmail.com</strong><br />
<strong>Received-From-MTA: dns;DUB004-OMC3S12.hotmail.com</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>6- </strong>Thank you all for reading this, and for any solutions or proposals which may had already not been provided or discussed on this forum which i had explored tohougruly (in order to find an answer) before i had posted my question that you're
 reading right now.</p>

<p>Hi Ms. Andria Maria Mendez;<br />
Before i can respond to your instructions, I would like to know as to what do you exactly mean by your above-quoted statement<strong>?!??</strong><br />
Yes, indeed, what do you really mean by&nbsp;<strong>"</strong><strong><em>it is possible that the recipient doesn't have any mailbox</em></strong><strong>"</strong><strong>
</strong>??<br />
Do you mean maybe my friend <strong>(</strong>the recipient<strong>)</strong> does not have an email (or invalid) account address<strong>???&nbsp;</strong><br />
Is this what you mean<strong>??</strong><br />
If yes, then, how do you think<strong>&nbsp;(</strong>as i have clearly stated in my initial post<strong>)</strong> most of the time i manage to send this recipient email correspondences successfully without any problems since many years<strong>????</strong><br />
Thank you for taking your time to reply, but unless <strong>(</strong>or until<strong>)</strong> you can clarify your statement, i really think it would be waste of time for both you and i to correspond on this issue any further<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, i hope and look forward to receiving a response from some other tech support staff&nbsp;who might be able to assist me better, after they attentively read my aforementioned post for help.</p>
