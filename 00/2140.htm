<h2>            Multiple email address issues - Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Anyone else have email issues with Outlook as described below when running multiple accounts through Outlook?</p>
<p>Outlook with the same accounts worked fine on Windows 8 but since the upgrade to 10 I keep getting the issues below. Its driving me nuts and making it really hard to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Symptom 1 – in replying to, or forwarding, an e. mail received in the secondary, IMAP, account, when “send” is requested, using the secondary account as the “from” account, an error message, “Could not complete the operation because the service
 provider does not support it.” is displayed in a Message Box, and the email is not sent.&nbsp; This problem appears to be consistent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Symptom 2 – whereas attempting to send a new e. mail from the secondary, IMAP, account sometimes works, sometimes it also produces the “Could not complete the operation because the service provider does not support it.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Symptom 3 – once the “Could not complete the operation because the service provider does not support it.” error has been encountered, attempts to save the email cause display of “This item is no longer valid because it has been closed.” in a Message
 Box, and the e. mail cannot be saved.</p>

 to video recording mode, i again tried to restore factory settins in the above method, it does not work now. Is there any program to restore the OS

            A Hard Reset does bring it back to factory settings.&nbsp; After you performed the Hard Reset and before you add anything, is it still in video recording mode?

            I do not know if it goes back to video because the hard reset does not happen it hangs in between. i have tried two modes of hard reset (a) from the Settings/Clear Storage ..... method and (b) pressing the ON/OFF button and The soft reset button together
 on my O2 XDA Mini S. Please tell me if there is any other method

<p>So are you saying that when you use the Clear Storage that it does not Hard Reset?&nbsp; (Meaning that it removes EVERYTHING that you installed on the device)</p>

<p>This page might show you an alternative method to Hard Reset:</p>

<p>Settings for the <strong>Gridlines</strong> can be accessed in either of 2 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the <strong>Layout</strong> tab click the <strong>Align</strong> tool &amp; select
<strong>Grid Settings</strong>, <em>or</em></li><li>Go to <strong>Word&gt; Preferences - Edit</strong> then click the <strong>Grid</strong> button in the
<strong>Editing Options</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>However, the Gridlines have no effect on the flow of text. Text flow is controlled by formatting features such as Line Spacing. The grid [technically, the
<em>Drawing Grid</em> influences only the positioning of <em>objects</em> (Shapes, Images, Text Boxes, etc.) inserted into a document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the settings is <em><strong>Snap to grid in Print Layout View</strong></em>. If that box is checked the grid is in effect regardless of whether the gridlines
<em>are</em> or <em>are not</em> displayed. In either case, though, the setting applies only to objects as mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you provide a more detailed description of what the problem seems to be? A screen shot may be helpful as well. Also, from
<strong>Word&gt; About Microsoft Word</strong> please determine the <strong>Version</strong> &amp; type of
<strong>License</strong> for your Office software &amp; include that in your reply.</p>

<p>Word's assumption is that if you are displaying gridlines, it's because you want to snap to them. You turn off the snap by hiding the gridlines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's pretty easy to draw a grid, perhaps in a text box so it's positionable and can appear behind text. Add it to AutoText so you can insert it in any document and have a non-snapping grid system for visual reference on any page. Please post if you need
 help to do this.<br />

<h2>            How to Require Skype to Ask for Password</h2>
                    <p>Simple issue but I can't figure out how to resolve it. Skype does not ask for my log-in credentials when I open the program, it just logs me in automatically. How do get Skype to ask me for my account and password each time?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>In the new Skype 8.19 version, there's no option to automatically sign in. However, it's possible that you were not signed out when you updated the Skype version which is why your account was automatically signed in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you can simply sign out from the new Skype, the next time you launch it, you will be asked to provide your username and password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To sign out in the new Skype:</p>

<li>Click your profile picture.</li><li>Select Sign out.</li></ol>

<p>Are you using Internet Exploerer 8 to EDiT web sites (as opposed to browsing or entering data or interacting with them)?&nbsp; I didn't think IE8 had that capability (I don't know how to do it unless I'm on a web site designed for editing web pages and the actual
 editing software is on the site as opposed to in the program)&nbsp;- I thought you needed something like Frontpage or Expressions (and, or course, special access to the site) to actually edit the pages (except for sites designed specifically for that purpose -
 and then I would suggest that the problem is most likely with the site rather than IE8 given what you posted and would contact the site host technical support group to see if they can assist).</p>
<p>The primary program of Internet Explorer is iexplore.exe.&nbsp; I have never heard of explorer exec or explore exec (either in Internet Explorer or Windows Explorer - though I am familiar with the exec command which I think is something else) - and I researched
 them on Bing and Google before submitting this post and could find nothing of relevance (though a few posts suggested it was a typo that meant to say explorer.exe instead which is part of or actually is Windows Explorer and so re-installing Internet Explorer
 would have no effect whatsoever).</p>
<p>I don't think uninstalling and reinstalling IE8 will solve this problem (though it is possible and I suppose it can't hurt except for the time and effort involved).&nbsp; I suspect there is some other problem going on here but we do not have enough information
 about what you are doing or trying to do to come up with anything definitive.&nbsp; Some additional details on exactly what you are doing with what programs and on what sites might help.</p>
<p>Like I said, uninstalling and re-installing can't hurt but I honestly don't think it will solve this problem (but I could be wrong - especially if you have add-ons that are interfering somehow).&nbsp; If you provide more details perhaps we can assist - at this
 point, I'm not entirely sure what you are doing with what programs on what sites that are generating the messages.&nbsp; Please also include the EXACT word-for-word text of any related error messages.&nbsp; When did this problem start and did you make and additions
 or removals of any software, hardware, add-ons, drivers, or updates since just before it started (or changes to any of your security settings)?</p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp; Please answer all my questions in your reply because the more we know, the better our chances of being able to assist or offer suggestions.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            Sorry if I confused you. I use Front Page to edit my site. I have spent many hours with my web Host trying to figure out what the problem is. They even moved my entire site to a new server. I only have problems when I try to edit my site. This is something
 recent.At this point I am able to access my web pages through Front Page but when I try to upload new pictures or try to save an edited page I get the error message that Internet Explore can not display web page.When I try to upload new pictures through the
 server on my web site it looks like it is going to upload the pictures but then the page goes blank.I have used my browser to try and get in through a link on my home page but even that doesn't work. My web host is able to view my site from their end. It is
 iexplorer.exe that is missing.This first showed up when I tried to access my Java.I have switched to Firefox but it is still notvletting me edit and save my web page changes.The only thing I can remember doing around the time this start

            <p>@John</p>
<p>I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but given what Microsoft advises about Preview versions of software (below), I'm going to suggest the answer to your question is "no".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<u><font color="#4617b4">Is Windows&nbsp;8.1&nbsp;Preview ready for everyone to try?</font></u></p>
<p>We strongly recommend that only experienced PC users download <span>
Windows&nbsp;8.1&nbsp;Preview</span> or <span>Windows&nbsp;RT&nbsp;8.1&nbsp;Preview</span>. Before you download the preview, you should weigh the pros and cons of installing
<strong>software that's still in development</strong>. If you install the preview release, you'll get to try out the many new features, but you might also encounter errors that you wouldn't encounter using a released version of
<span>Windows</span>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><span>You should consider downloading the preview
<strong>only</strong> if all of the following apply to you: </span></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You like to use the latest software and enjoy experimenting with new technology.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You're comfortable backing up a PC, formatting a hard drive, and installing an operating system from scratch.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You feel comfortable troubleshooting PC problems yourself.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You don't mind updating software frequently.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You have or can create installation or recovery media and have the knowledge to restore your previous operating system after you're done testing
<span>Windows&nbsp;8.1&nbsp;Preview</span>. </p>
</li></ul>

<div>
Warning
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you're running <span><span>Windows&nbsp;RT</span></span> you won't be able to restore
<span><span>Windows&nbsp;RT</span></span> after you install
<span>Windows&nbsp;RT&nbsp;8.1&nbsp;Preview</span>. You'll be able to upgrade to the final version of
<span>Windows RT&nbsp;8.1</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If installation of <span>Windows&nbsp;RT&nbsp;8.1&nbsp;Preview</span> fails on your PC, you may need to contact your PC manufacturer.</p>
</li></ul>
<div><span><span><font color="#4617b4">Are there risks to installing Windows&nbsp;8.1&nbsp;Preview?</font></span></span></div>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong>Yes.</strong> <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1&nbsp;Preview</span> and
<span>Windows&nbsp;RT&nbsp;8.1&nbsp;Preview</span> are stable and have been thoroughly tested,
<strong>but aren't the finished product</strong>. Your PC could crash and you could lose important files. You should back up your data and you shouldn't test the preview on your primary home or business PC. You might also encounter problems like:
</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Software that doesn’t install or work correctly</strong>, including antivirus or security programs.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Printers, video cards, or other hardware that doesn’t work.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p>Difficulty accessing corporate or home networks.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Damage to some of your files.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>You should carefully balance the risks and rewards of trying out the preview before you install it."

    <title>Problem with justifying text in cells using conditional formatting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joekrupiak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with justifying text in cells using conditional formatting after upgrading from excel 2007 to excel 2010</h2>
                    We have some spreadsheets here in Excel 2007 that use conditional formatting.&nbsp; Everything was ok until I upgraded the Excel to 2010.<br />
Now on certain cells that use conditional formatting the text in the cell is at the bottom left of the cell and the text alignment buttons appear active but<br />
do not work.<br />
<br />
If I play with enough buttons I can actually center the text but it goes back to bottom left if I scroll the page down and then back up.<br />
<br />
Also it appears centered in the print preview and prints as centered.<br />
<br />
I have tried changing the work sheet views and some others but I can't fix it.<br />
<br />
Also if I set up conditional formatting from scratch in the worksheet it works ok too.<br />
<br />
There seems to be something that did not quite make the conversion from 2007 to 2010.<br />
<br />
It is not a trivial issue as this is an accounting/risk management company that uses conditional formatting in most of it's workbooks.&nbsp; It would be quite a bit
<br />
of work to recreate the conditional formatting.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
-Joe<br />

    <title>Duplicating old locked record without saving duplicated records to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> euancarrick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicating old locked record without saving duplicated records to allow editing.</h2>
                    <p>I have created a form in Access 2003 and I locked each subform and field on enter to these subforms / text boxes through VBA code. The reason for this was to stop users altering old records and only allowing new records to be updated.</p>
<p>Hower I want to&nbsp;allow the form to creat new revisions of old records and enable them to be updated.</p>
<p>I want to&nbsp;increase the Rev field by 1 and duplicate the record including the text box fields, combo boxes and subforms. But after the duplication I want this duplicated record to go to a new record without saving it so keeping it a new record so it can be
 edited.</p>
<p>In summary, I want to duplicate a form record containing field and subforms&nbsp;increase a revision field by&nbsp;1,&nbsp;send it to a new record without saving it so it can be edited due to previous locking settings. After running the duplication code I want the copied
 record to go directly to a new record where the information can be seen and edited.</p>

            As you refer to subforms within the parent form this presupposes that there are rows in a number of related tables.&nbsp; You cannot therefore duplicate the data without saving it as referential integrity requires that the row in the referenced table (that
 underlying the parent form) be saved before a row can be inserted into any of the referencing tables (those underlying the subforms).<br />
<br />
I'd suggest that you adopt the following strategy:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Firstly ensure that referential integrity and cascade deletes are enforced in the relationships between the parent form's underlying table and its referencing tables, i.e. those underlying the subforms.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Create a duplicate of your parent form, and remove the code which locks the controls.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; In the parent form's module, e.g. in the Click event procedure of a button do as follows:<br />
<br />
3.1 Grab the value of the form's current record's primary key to a variable.<br />
<br />
3.2 Execute an SQL statement which inserts a new row into the parent form's underlying table, using the data from the current record but incrementing the value of the Rev column by 1.<br />
<br />
3.3 Execute SQL statements to insert rows into each of the referenced tables.&nbsp; For each insert from a SELECT statement which selects the columns from the relevant referenced table where the relevant foreign key column matches the value of the variable holding
 the primary key value of the current row in the referenced table, but again increasing the value of the Rev column by 1 if this is the key.<br />
<br />
3.4 Open the new form created in 2 above, setting the WhereCondition argument of the OpenForm method to an expression which filters the form to the new row inserted in 3.2 above, and setting its window mode to acDialog to open the form in dialogue mode, which
 will force the user to close it before returning to the calling form, and will cause the calling code execution to pause in the meantime.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; In the Close event of the new form include code which pops up a message box in which the user is asked to confirm whether to save the new record and its related records.&nbsp; If the user answers Yes then the rows are automatically saved, but if the primary
 key of the new row in the referenced table is not the Rev column, but something else, e.g. an autonumber, you'll need to pass the value of this back to the calling form, e.g. by assigning it to a hidden text box control in the original form, so that it can
 be used in 5.2 below to navigate to the new record.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, the user answers No, execute an SQL statement which deletes the newly inserted row from the referenced table.&nbsp; As cascade deletes have been enforced in the relationships the matching
 rows from the related tables will also be deleted.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp; Back in the original form, the calling code should then, following the line which opened the new form in dialogue mode (code execution has been paused here, remember), do as follows:<br />
<br />
5.1 Requery the parent form to include the new record in its underlying recordset.<br />
<br />
5.2 Navigate to the new record in the usual way by finding the record in the form's RecordsetClone, and, if found (i.e. if the user elected to save the new record in 4 above), synchronizing the Bookmark of the form with that of its RecordsetClone.<br />

<p>Hi Misha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Davies is using&nbsp;Scatter charts rather than line graph. This is why he is able to see the&nbsp;Horizontal Error Bar. According to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-change-or-remove-error-bars-in-a-chart-e6d12c87-8533-4cd6-a3f5-864049a145f0#OfficeVersion=macOS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>, we can only show error bars for x and y values in scatter and bubble charts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using&nbsp;scatter and bubble charts, but failed to add the horizontal bars, we kindly suggest you post a new thread in our forum for us to provide better support for you and let other community members see the information clearly. We will focus on
 your situation there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Mahdi,</p>
<p>In theory Project can handle up to 400,000 tasks but in practice loading that number of tasks into a single Project will probably not be very manageable. I suggest you take at look at your program and see if you can break the plan into more manageable pieces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One approach is to break the plan into multiple single plans. They can be combined as necessary when needed. Another option is to limit the detail in your plan to the near term (e.g. next 6 months) and leave the future effort as planning packages to be expanded
 when necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also want to consider Project Online or Project Server. Those versions were designed to handle large projects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>Than you John for the response.</p>
<p>this is a great idea to break it into sub projects and more manageable pieces. My concern is, when it comes to updating stage, how I can do variance analysis and schedule delay impact analysis?</p>
<p>Is that possible to link sub projects or link several MSP files to have the whole program's tasks while performing What-if and delay analysis?</p>

            <p>You can certainly do that to get to the&nbsp;destination of having only a single set of folders. Seems like that decision should be made based on which mail account type better suits your other needs and on whwther your mail service provider supports both protocols.
</p>
<p>If you do decide to change mail account type, I'd create a new Outlook profile for it.

<p>Thank you your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to go through the troubleshooting and recommended steps. All steps are not required, however, we should probe for a possible resolution without a hard reset. Here are some steps available to you (not exhaustive).
</p>
<p>Check for the exact error code and/or message. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Microsoft Account in Settings,&nbsp;&nbsp; Email + Accounts, does it displays Attention required?
</p>
<p>If yes, Soft reset the phone. </p>
<p>Reset the Date and Time. </p>
<p>See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2784236" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2784236</a> for more info.
</p>
<p>Is it occurring through 3G and/or Wi-Fi? </p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the customer sign in on a computer? </p>
<p>Sign in <a href="https://account.live.com/editprof.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/editprof.aspx</a> check the Personal info are correct click save.
</p>
<p>If no, </p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change the password it must be no longer than 16 characters long. </p>
<p>If your password contains a space or special characters, try changing your password so that it uses only letters and numbers. If you update your password, you need to update it on the phone.
</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you created your Microsoft account recently, you may not have completed the registration process and may still have to verify your account.
</p>
<p><a href="https://account.live.com/verifysi.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/verifysi.aspx</a>
</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you turned on two-step verification for your Microsoft account, you will have to perform an extra step to sign in on Windows Phone. Windows Phone can't prompt you to enter a security code when you try to sign in. Therefore, you'll have to
 create a unique app password to use when signing into Windows Phone with a Microsoft account that has two-step verification turned on.
</p>
<p>To create a unique app password for your Microsoft account, go here: </p>
<p><a href="https://account.live.com/Proofs/AppPassword" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/Proofs/AppPassword</a>
</p>
<p>If you setup two-step verification, update the phone with the unique password.
</p>
<p>For more information, see the following Microsoft account help and how-to article:
</p>
<p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=298952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=298952</a>
</p>
<p>Alternatively, switch off temporarily the option. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart the phone. </p>
<p>Check if it works. </p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it's displaying the same error,&nbsp;you can </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>a) Contact account support to see if they have a resolution for this error. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>b) Do a hard reset (make sure to back up personal data) to resolve the issue as a last resort resolution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards, <br />

try menu, tools and then wireless wizard.<br />
or if u have active standby icons, (the icons on the main screen) select WLAN scanning. this should search for all wireless networks around.<br />
you do not need to install anything

            Hey Guys,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the good advise but unfortunately there is no WLAN wizard to be found.<br />
<br />
I've meanwhile found out that there a mobiles around with the WLAN function suppressed. I've got my phone from China, maybe that's why. What I don't know yet is if it's done on software or hardware level. Any suggestion how to find out?

            Well you cannot deny that possibility, but you can download the WLAN wizard from the Nokia website. i do not have the link but a simple search should get you to it...<br />
<br />
If it is a genuine one try updating the firmware you will get the latest firmware plus the WLAN wizard that you want!!<br />
<br />
<br />
hope this helps.

            Pepenok, you should compare the spec of your phone very closely with the spec of an N95 which is available from any Nokia website.

    <title>E51 - Charging Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> g7swz  say:</h3>
<h2>            E51 - Charging Problem</h2>
                    I am having problems charging my E51 in the car.<br />
<br />
When I plug the charger in I get a message saying "Not Charging".<br />
<br />
The car charger is one that I have had for some time and it works fine with my 6310i. It is not a Nokia branded car charger.<br />
<br />
To use it with the E51 I bought from Nokia and adaptor which converts to the 2mm plug (CA-44).<br />
<br />
Has anyone had a similar experience - if so how does one get the car charger to work with the E51?<br />
<br />

<p>i had a similar problemsome months back. i took out the battery and cleaned the poles and also the phone's with a gentle solvent like rubbing alcohol. worked fine after that, keeps the charge usually two to three days.</p>
<p>note well, i listen to music via my stereo bluetooth headset everyday. so i find the e51 has some good battery life.</p>

            Here we go again.<br />
<br />
If you video is 3GP format, first convert the video to AVI. Use Super or other video encoders to encode into xVid or Divx AVI.<br />
<br />
Then use Windows Movie Maker to get the video there and then use the options there to rotate the video and save it in rotated version.<br />
<br />
You can also convert the video to MPEG-2 (using Super) then use this converted video and re-encode it to whatever you want, just use the DirectShow button in Super encoder and then select the option to rotate the video there.<br />
<br />
I've used both methods and it works.<br />
<br />
If the video is MP4. Download and install a little program called MP4CamtoAvi (just google it) run the program (follow the instructions there) and convert it to AVI.<br />
<br />
Once it's in AVI format use Windows Movie Maker or Super as mentioned above.<br />
<br />
I strongly recommend you get the DivX codec from <a href="http://www.divx.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.divx.com</a> so that it's installed in your PC and divx codec is Directshow. IF your Windows Media Player can play AVI files then you don't need to do this as it's already installed.

    <title>How do I set mirror margins for a landscape document which is bound on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tim.wilson.online  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I set mirror margins for a landscape document which is bound on the long edge&#63;</h2>
                    How do I set mirror margins for a landscape document which is bound on the long edge? i.e. slightly taller margin at the top of the recto page and the bottom of the verso page.<br />
<br />
The document I have in mind is designed to be printed duplex, hole-punched at the top of the recto page, and used landscape in a binder.<br />
<br />
I am a long-time Word user, but this one has got me stumped!! I would not have thought it would be a difficult setting to implement.<br />
<br />

            <p>On the Margins tab of the Page Setup dialog, set the Gutter position to Top and define the amount by which you want to displace the text from the top of the page. If you set the gutter to about 10mm, the preview will show you a spiral binding along the top
 of the page.</p>

            Hi Doug,<br />
<br />
Thanks for responding so quickly. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately this doesn't quite solve my problem. Perhaps I didn't explain what I was trying to do clearly enough.<br />
<br />
The gutter offset needs to be applied at the top of the recto pages and the bottom of the verso pages.<br />
<br />
Your suggested fix applies the gutter offset to the top of all pages - not quite what I was after.<br />
<br />
It seems that Word assumes mirror margins will only ever be applied to left/right margins - i.e. documents with binding at the side of the page rather than the top.<br />
<br />
Any other thoughts on how I could tackle this?<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim<br />
