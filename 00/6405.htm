<h2>            Microsoft Edge on mobile</h2>
                    I have recently added a new update on my Lumia, now I'm unable to open the Microsoft Edge browser. Everything was working fine on my phone until I added the anniversary update. Now I can not use it at all. I try to open it an it closes straight away. everything
 else is working fine except this. Plus Cortana is connected to Microsoft Edge as is my YouTube app. Can anyone help or suggest anything. It would be deeply grateful.

            I had the same problem. In addition the settings app would not open. The only solution I found was to do a hard reset and a restore from backup.

            Yes that's what I have&nbsp;had to do. Now my phone is working ok again now.&nbsp; Microsoft Edge is now working fine, luckily I had it all backed up. But the update should not have done that to my phone in the first place. Microsoft say the update will make my
 phone work better but it had the opposite effect.

            Not on my mobile. I did a hard reset and that sorted everything out it was a pain an time consuming but it fixed the problem. Thanks anyway.

                    <p>New Outlook Mobile is badly broken &amp; took away ability to turn OFF Signatures &amp; Conversation display.</p>
<p>Our Nokia Lumia 950 phones needs help, you IT people at Microsoft.</p>
<p>It has those Setting sliders but they don't stay&nbsp;if you set them to OFF.</p>
<p>And to clarify which Outlook Mobile Update I'm referring to, it's the one that I got today that changed the bold first line for each email display in the Inbox of all emails sent to myself from saying NOTE TO SELF to now it just says ME</p>

<p>So I am not seeing that Jeff. Mine was updated on Oct 4 and this is what I see. I created an email to send to my self, then when it comes you can see what I get (middle pic). The pic on the right is the version on my device.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As an aside, when I set up my email accounts a long time back I did have it show my name. If it was left blank I do believe it would say "Me"</p>

<p>I feel like you are really missing the point of my "cry for help" question, Jack. Stating it as nice as I can, it should be obvious that I only brought up that NOTE TO MYSELF vs how&nbsp;today it suddenly started saying ME on all of my emails to myself was to
 specify to anyone who is a Microsoft IT guy which update had caused the 2 specific problems that I'd mentioned.</p>
<p>Luckily, they did release an update to fix the Conversation issue at 7:05 am PST that woke me up when my phone beeped asking for a Restart.
</p>
<p>I was OK being awakened once I figured out they'd fixed that Conversations mode thing in the Inbox. I HATE that. Conversations only belong in texting and in social media.</p>
<p>They haven't fixed the Signatures issue that I also mentioned here &amp; told the Feedback Hub staff.</p>
<p>What type phone do you use and if it is Windows phone, is it suddenly now adding&nbsp;this Signature automatically "Sent from my Windows 10 phone"?</p>

<p>OMG, I solved the Signatures deal. I'd just been sliding the Settings APP down to close it. I realized that I should try the &lt;- arrow after changing it to SIGNATURE &gt; OFF. 🙂

<p>No problem. Sorry if I acted bad. I've been frustrated setting up another 950. I thought I knew it so well but I keep doing the wrong things, I guess.
</p>
<p>I've also always&nbsp;used signatures on emails but today's generation now treats emails like texts or social media Replies, They don't start with a Hi or Hello and they don't end it telling the person who they are or thanking them in any way.<br />
That bothers me but since most of my emails these days are to myself and I might even keep Re-sending the same email to myself again and again with an update on it, I got tire of erasing the signatures along with all of that

<p>junk, so I don't want it set to automatically add a Signature. I'll decide when and where, which isn't too often anymore. It's much less frequently than my wanting a Signature. ;-)</p>

<p>Jack, what's happened to this site the past few days? I simply haven't been able to post a new Question at all, either using my Windows 10 Nokia Lumia 950 or my Windows 10 desktop computer and Internet Explorer 11.<br />
When I click Submit, it just greys out that button and on my phone I see a swirl icon. But I've let it sit the swirling forever (an hour) and I've also let my PC sit the greyed out and it never completes the upload.<br />
Am I blocked somehow by Microsoft?<br />
I just wrote this same stuff in a SITE FEEDBACK but I really need personal help on this.</p>

            Not sure Jeff. I have had some issues as well but I can still post. Are you using Edge or IE when on your PC? See if using the one you do not use works. I use Edge but when I had issues I tried IE and it worked. I'm back to Edge now.

<p>I use IE by choice on my computer and I'm forced to use EDGE on the phone. Since neither will let me Ask but both will let me Reply, that tells me that there's something wrong with the site. Hopefully they know and will fix it.</p>
<p>1. Have you seen any new Questions being posted by other people? If you have, that's scary. That means that the site is working for some people somehow.</p>
<p>2. How about if you just try Asking your own Question? It could be about anything and in any Category and you could click Edit then Delete right away if it did upload after you Submit it. Heck, you could even write in your Question or the Details that you're
 just doing this to test Asking a Question since you've been told by another User that they can't Submit any new Questions.</p>

                    <p>There are still Metro interfaces hidden throughout the entire desktop mode, mixed with "regular" Win7-interfaces. No consistency whatsoever. The Networks dialog in the notification area is Metro while the clock-, volume-, battery-, action center-dialogs
 is Win7 style. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the concept of "Continuum" is introduced in windows 10, it is time to have two sets of UI.

            <p>A *<em>universal</em>* touch vs mouse toggle mode is sorely needed. Modes that can be activated by the user and/or triggered automatically when a keyboard is detached&nbsp;or folded back on hybrids. This mixed up strategy is awful.</p>

            Nice. I think a lot of people have the same idea: universal and flexible touch vs mouse modes. I like my idea about the keyboard/hand toggle button on the taskbar. ;)

</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for the query and we are here to assist you on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The latest SharePoint app on Android OS is 3.0.0. Please make sure you have updated your SharePoint to the lastest version. From my test, click the button on a SharePoint site in the below screenshot, we can see the structured naviagation.</p>

<p>Hi Laughing Legacy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to us. Yes, I tested with a team site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Could you please first go to Play Store to make sure you have updated your SharePoint app to the latest version and then check the result?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the issue still occurs, for testing purpose, could you please contact site admin and share with us the reproduce steps about how the admin created the site? And what is your current SharePoint app version and Android OS version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Tina</p>

<p>I have checked the play store and there are no updates and the about in the app says 3.0.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the site admin and designer and the main site is what we used to call a Publishing Site rather than a team site. Sharepoint App version is 3.0.0 and I have a Samsung S8 with Android 8. I have also tested on a Sony XA1 and the same result.</p>

<p>Hi Alex,<br />
</p>
<p>The URL you provided via PM seems to be the URL for the SharePoint root site collection home page:</p>
<p>https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sitepages/home.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>As your screenshot contains a button to delete the site, this should not be the correct site URL. Can you please re-check and provide us with the correct URL via PM?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, please let us know the following information:</p>
<p>1. What changes (Settings, customizations, etc) have you done to the particular site, other than enabling the Publishing feature?</p>
<p>2. Try creating a new subsite with the Publishing template and enable the Publishing features to see if you can reproduce the issue. We tested on our end and could not reproduce.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just to narrow down that the issue is not related to the features/template but rather a site specific issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sheen</p>

<p>No all gone quite on the Microsoft front - I have submitted all the data they requested for test but no reply yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I know is the Iphone app and android app react differently when viewing the navigation menu - so you think it would be easy to test.</p>

    <title>How to create reports on Access Web Apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ao10  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to create reports on Access Web Apps</h2>
                    I created an Access Web App and everything was going great until I discovered that I can't generate reports from the App. What good is my data if I can't represent it the way I want. I need to be able to generate a printable report on my data right from
 the App. Not all users that will use the App have Microsoft Access so the current option to create a local copy of the database connected the tables online is not an option for this application. Please include report generation for Access Web App.

            <p>Even if they don't have Access, they can install the free runtime version which would enable them to produce the reports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never understood why MS didn't offer any form of reporting either.&nbsp; What good is data if you can work with it and produce reports!&nbsp; Several years in and still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd urge you to add your feature suggestion to the access.uservoice.com in the hopes that MS adds it.&nbsp; Check and see if it has already been suggested and if so, add your votes to the idea, otherwise add your suggestion as a new one.</p>

            <p>Daniel,</p>
<p>unfortunately the run time version only helps if the people have a Windows computer. Apple computers can't run this. AWA is very enticing for such users, but without reports it won't work.</p>

            <p>You never mentioned MACs.&nbsp; There are workarounds, not ideal though, see: <a href="http://www.devhut.net/2016/09/06/run-ms-officeaccess-on-a-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Run MS Office/Access on a MAC</a>.&nbsp; CorssOver could be interesting if it can really do what they advertise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, MS seems to have abandoned Access web efforts, again!&nbsp; They come out with something and then ditch it, don't add new features and leave it to die a slow and painful death.&nbsp; We haven't seen any forward movement in quite some time now,&nbsp; It is sad.&nbsp;
 I thought they had finally woken up and listened to their users and seen the light when they first introduced Web Apps, but nothing much since the initial launch.&nbsp; It could truly have taken the market had they continued development and added features (reporting
 being a critical one), but it appears this was not to be, again!&nbsp; As it is now, Web Apps are simply toys and one has to turn to alternatives to develop true Web Application (not Access Web Apps).&nbsp; So much potential, simply wasted, again.&nbsp; Did I mention the
 again part.&nbsp; The never ending again with MS, they never learn, they never listen to their users and history repeats, again!</p>

<p>Daniel, do you know any particular "alternative" to Access Web Apps that can integrate with Office 365? I have spent hours developing a AWA for the museum my sister runs, and I hate to see all that effort be for nothing. I looked at Power Apps as a solution,
 but it seems woefully inadequate, not to mention requiring me to basically start over from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have to start over, I want to do it with a solution that is user-friendly, stable, and not going to have the rug pulled out from under it six months down the road, as has happened with AWA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions or advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Geoff</p>

                    I'm new to both Mac and Mac office 2011. When I copy and past anything on the notebook template, the words don't fit the page. This only happens when I copy and paste. Why is this? What, if anything, can I do to change this?&nbsp;

                    Formaly I use a Nokia asha 202 v20.36 RM-834. The social app in my phone crashed. Later I downloaded another software v20.28 RM-834 of 22-03-12 via the nokia suite, the social app crashed again. I have searched for the update Over The Air (O.T.A.) but
 could not find it, please is the software update available for my phone? If not when will it be available and how can I restore the social app?

            hi mate,<br />
<br />
the best way to check for the latest version of firmware for your phone is to check via Nokia Suite on your PC itself. if there are any updates, please update to the latest version offered. if it is telling you that you have the latest versiojn installed, then
 you can try re-installing the current firmware via the relevant option in Nokia Suite.<br />
<br />
failing that, and if you are still having issues with the Social app, then you will need to take your phone to your local nokia care for them to inspect:

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've always enjoyed inserting graphics (both animated and non-animated) into my emails as well as photos. I've used them as headers, signatures, I even found a Web site, whose URL&nbsp;alludes me now, where you could actually copy and paste picture backgrounds
 into Outlook.com and other email clients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, I can't find that option now in the latest version of outlook.com. I believe it was in the "Insert" dropdown menu . . . it said something about using Interline instead of attachment. You could select either one. I sorely miss being able to insert
 graphics, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know if Outlook.com will be bringing that feature back soon? or was it replaced by the Insert option to "Share from SkyDrive."?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
<div>I meant to tell you that I couldn't use the first two options for the following reasons:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. My desktop is, presently, unavailable to use so I have no other computer handy.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. &nbsp;I do not have another outlook.com account . . . just the one.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It seemed to me that your third option was the quickest and easiest to use.</div>

            <p>Hello RAP,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm glad to know that you're able to utilize the Pictures inline feature of Outlook.com by using Google Chrome browser. I have reviewed your query and I've determined that your concern is isolated to the browser itself. Since you are using Windows XP computer
 and Internet Explorer 8, there might be instances that some parts of Outlook <font>
might not display properly. If you're unable to update your computer's Operating System and Internet Explorer browser, you may use other browser as a workaround.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you have other questions or any other concerns, please reply to this thread and we will be happy to further assist you.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your input Ken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since there are so many variables in the computing world, I know that this question won't be entirely answered but since you offered to answer any other questions that I had, here goes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What types of programs could conceivably interfere with the uploading to outlook.com of screen captures, photos, other graphics, etc?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a lot of programs on my computer. They seem to be of related types, though,, such as notes programs and&nbsp;screen capture programs - nothing special. I'm just always on the lookout for something new or different that might increase my productivity or
 ease of use. Those programs seem rather innocuous but is it possible that they could interfere with my inline picture insertion option not showing?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just remembered an event that happens before the dropdown insert menu pops up. Just before the dropdown menu finishes loading a percent sign appears briefly just below the first option. Then it disappears and only two options are shown.</p>

            Hello again, Ken, and ZigZag Team,
<div><br />
<div>I have an update.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm not using Google Chrome anymore because I've found a browser that incorporates all 3 engines that are used, separately, by the major browsers. So I have the best of all worlds. &nbsp;:)</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you like to insert inline pictures in &nbsp;your emails too, and need a workaround, just Bing the following words and the link will appear somewhere near the top or center on the first page:</div>
<div><br />
<div>3 engine Web browser</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Happy Computing!&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            After the 8&#47;11&#47;2015 updates, am I the only one that is having this notification area problem&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is anyone else getting this error? After the 8/11/15 updates, and after a few reboots due to my own maintenance, and after looking at the notification icon it is white, as if I have messages (which I know I do in mail), but now when I click the notification
 icon, absolutely nothing happens. If I right click on it, it gives me two options, open action center and turn on quiet hours. That is it. Clicking on open action center results in exactly and absolutely,&nbsp;nothing. I don't know if the other option works or
 not because it is something that I, both, don't use and could care less if it did not work.</p>

<h2>            Persistent error on Excel startup</h2>
                    <p>Every time I start Excel, I get the error message shown in the attached window capture, which says</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Excel saved changes to the file before the</strong><br />
<strong>application quit unexpectedly.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Do you want to open the last saved version of<br />
this file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The setting is Excel version&nbsp;Version 16.13.1 (180523) [for Macintosh] running under MacOS&nbsp;10.13.5 (17F77).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is more than cosmetic. Specifically, if I click the "Cancel' option, my default startup spreadsheet fails to open, whereas if I click the "Open" option, I have to wade through several more errors messages pertaining to various files not being
 found.</p>

We have a solution: it did the trick to put the file</p>

MicrosoftRegistrationDB.reg</p>
<p>
located in the folder</p>
<p>
/Users/[username]/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office</p>

into the trash. That file contained the name of one of the files that appeared in the error messages I got after clicking the "Open" option I mentioned in my original post.</p>

I should report that I was already using the latest versions of Excel (and the other programs in the MS Office suite) and MacOS, booting into Safe Mode did not help, but running Excel from a newly created user account did.</p>

            Thanks for the reply. I am using OneNote 2016 on windows 10. The issue just occurred when I tried recording for the first time. I also tried safe mode and office repair. Neither worked, and office repair reported no issues. I am using a Dell XPS 13T laptop
 if that helps.

    <title>Saving an Internet Explorer 8 shortcut to desktop with no toolbars, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mackdaddymp21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saving an Internet Explorer 8 shortcut to desktop with no toolbars, address bars, shortcuts, etc.</h2>
                    I monitor a CC camera over Internet Explorer 8 and would like to save a shortcut to this site on my desktop. The trick is I would like the shortcut to open up just the website with no toolbars, shortcuts, add-ons, address, bar etc.(Kind of like Full Screen
 mode except I would have this screen minimized on the corner of my monitor so I can still work on other things while monitoring the CC feed. Also, when I open up the normal Internet Explorer I<strong>WANT</strong> the address bar, toolbars, add-ons, etc to
 appear like normal. Please help!

<p><span><span>Hey MackdaddyMP21,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Another option would be to create a shortcut to Internet Explorer and add –k to the Target: address so that Internet Explorer opens in kiosk mode. You can also specify
 the website that this shortcut should open in the Target: field:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right
 click a shortcut to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Internet Explorer</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Copy</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Paste</strong>
 on your desktop</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right
 click the pasted<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Internet Explorer</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Properties</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>In
 the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Target:</strong> field, add <span>
&nbsp;</span><strong>–k “insert website address here”</strong> after the file location of iexplore.exe<br />
For example: <span>&nbsp;</span><strong>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" -k “http://bing.com”</strong> (My address lists Program Files (x86) because I’m using a 64-bit version of Windows and want to open the 32-bit Internet
 Explorer. If you have a 32-bit operating system yours will just say Program Files instead of Program Files (x86))</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>OK</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Open the shortcut and you will have a full screen of the webpage you selected. To exit the kiosk view, press Alt + F4 on your keyboard.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope that helps.</span></span></p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue could occur due to corrupted system files or third-party applications conflict. We suggest you to uninstall any third-party antivirus

<p>I did a search using the internet for that error, most info points to a problem with 3rd party virus programs, if you have such programs installed
<strong>remove</strong> them using the tools from the makers of such programs.</p>
<p>This info has been posted many times on this forum that Preview builds have issues with 3rd party programs sometimes.</p>

<p>I've been having this problem with the last 3 builds of windows preview and have never used 3rd party virus programs because, well I'm not r-tard'd, invasions of privacy and potentially problems that may arise on top of what is already going on/ cyber tsa/rape
 me of any sense of privacy-in exchange for """"security"""" not really my bag, baby.</p>
<p>Having said that, I have tried all suggested fixes each time and nothing seems to work, it was just randomly successful for build 17110.rs4 and now wont update again.&nbsp; I really wish someone gets to the bottom of this because its getting really annoying.</p>
<p>might just abandon MS altogether when Ubuntu 18.04LTS drops if this issue cant be resolved.</p>

</p><p>Hi Daniel</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should upgrade to the latest build, 14342 first.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We apologize for delay in responding back to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometime some of the drivers might not work with our hardware configuration. As you have stated earlier that Intel drivers are working properly, we suggest you to remove the AMD driver and use Intel driver.</p>
<p>

<p>Your response suggests you don't understand the problem.&nbsp; There is no such thing as an Intel driver for an AMD Radeon graphics card!&nbsp; So it seems that a&nbsp;Microsoft Support Engineer is telling me to make a temporary work-around (the motherboard graphics port
 instead of the Radeon graphics card)&nbsp;into a permanent solution.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, this graphics card was working with Build 14316 and because it does not work with succeeding builds, I should discard it!</p>

            <p>You are trying out preview builds. It could be that AMD don't keep up with Insider builds. Did they tell you they were not providing any more drivers for Windows 10 or it is a problem for the preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you continue with the onboard Intel for now and see if anything changes on the next preview. Also report is via the Feedback app that is part of the process for being an Insider &amp; testing preview builds.</p>

<h2>            RE&#58; Need Help Recovering Outlook 2007 PST Files. </h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hello. I have a question to ask you. I have tried diligently the last 24 hours trying to&nbsp;re-build all my e-mails that I accidently reformatted&nbsp;over a few days ago. I had installed
 Windows 7 Pro recently and didn't get to the point of the backup data process as of yet. However, due to the need to get my e-mail I did setup my e-mail accounts with Outlook 2007.&nbsp;Well,&nbsp;a few days ago, I accidently ruined the System Reserved partition and
 unable to recover (not boot into&nbsp;Windows 7) and I knew there would have to be a new re-install. I had several docs on the desktop I was able to copy over to a temporary Windows 7 installation on another hard drive I setup,&nbsp;and then I formatted it thinking
 I was done ready to try a new Windows 7 install, not realizing that I forgot to grab the Outlook 2007 pst files that were in C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook. So&nbsp;now I knew I may now have issues&nbsp;after reformatting the hard drive. I knew
 know I would have to wait from re-installing Windows 7 because if I re-install it, I could damage those very files I needed. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, I used a thirds part free and very good program called PhotoRec. After a few hours of running the program, I was able to recover 14 pst files from the reformatted hard drive
 and saved them to my desktop and eventually to a DVD R disc. Now, I am in luck! The pst files showed&nbsp;between the ranges of 60,777 KB to 265 KB in size.&nbsp;There was only one past file that was 3,765,897 KB that&nbsp;was huge that I already had&nbsp;made a copy some time
 ago so I didn't need that one. So the first thing I would try is to try to get them imported in Outlook 2007 to see what would happen. Well, I get the error message in the importing process that 'errors have been detected' in the first pst file (41,681 KB)
 I am attempting (picked) to import.&nbsp;It tells me&nbsp;to use the inbox repair tool. Okay. I go ahead and use that&nbsp;on this same pst file. I get a message from this inbox repair tool follow the scan, “Errors were found in this file. To repair these errors, click&nbsp;"Repair".&nbsp;(Now,
 mind you, I did make a backup of these original 14 pst files ALREADY.) I do allow inbox repair tool to make a backup (bak) file as well. FYI,&nbsp;if I click on "Details",&nbsp;it says this for this particular pst file:</span></p>
<p><span>The following errors were found in this file:</span></p>
<p><span>Items needing repair: 0</span></p>
<p><span>Items not found: 13</span></p>
<p><span>Items without a folder: 0</span></p>
<p><span>Items without a folder will be placed in a folder called Lost &amp; Found.</span></p>
<p><span>So I go ahead and do a "Repair".</span></p>
<p><span>I get&nbsp;a message stating, "Repair Complete". Now, I have read thru Microsoft that&nbsp;following this step, I am to get a&nbsp;some sort of indication in Outlook that there&nbsp;these messages
 awaiting there. This is nothing of the sort. So I&nbsp;go ahead and manually import them into Outlook instead. When I get to the point&nbsp;of "Import Personal Folders", it shows what I have. It says, "Deleted Items (1)" &amp; "Inbox (9)". Geese, a lot of KB (42,177)&nbsp;for
 just a few messages!&nbsp;(Note: After using Inbox Repair&nbsp;Tool the KB increased for this one pst file from 41,681 to 42,177.) I import them to my Personal Folders". but nothing happens in Outlook. Hmmm... that was strange! So the inbox repair tool really did work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now with&nbsp;the&nbsp;other pst files I found. &nbsp;For example: Using a pst file with the size of 60,777 KB (which here I have 2 of them recovered by the way with different file names generated
 by PhotoRec), I try to import manually into Outlook. This time during the importing process I get a message that states basically that it is not a personal files folder. Okay, I say to myself that it must be either an Archived Folder file I had or a Microsoft
 Office Outlook Connector file that I had stored on that Windows 7 I ruined. Okay, I have not setup Archived Folders file yet with this other temporary Outlook 2007 I am using now, but it doesn’t matter if I have or I have not because during the import process,
 I am not even to the step of asking what folder I want to put this pst file in yet. I go ahead and try the inbox repair tool on it. The message I receive that states that the inbox repair tool does not recognize this pst file. …and “No information can be recovered.”
</span></p>
<p><span>Yet with another pst file with the size of 33,497 KB I try manually with importing into Outlook it says that errors have been detected and I should use the inbox repair tool. Okay,
 using the inbox repair tool, I get a message indicating the inbox repair tool does not recognize this pst file. …and “No information can be recovered.”</span></p>
<p><span>I may get a few more different case scenarios, but for the most part of all the 14 pst files, none can be imported back into Outlook. I then realize that there are expensive 3rd
 party programs out there. I have researched and found a few. Of the ones that told me and showed me on a viewer of the actual message, there were only a small number of recovered messages out of the large KB sizes I have recovered. So, even with the expensive
 costs associated with being these expensive&nbsp;third party programs, they are not recovering all the e-mails I am sure are still in those pst files. Even expensive, it is not worth my time to retrieve just a few messages from these pst files.</span></p>
<p><span>So, do you know any means that I can spend some time to try to get these pst files back??? I cannot believe just a simple “quick format” over the system hard drive that stored these
 pst data files could have damaged them so badly? If there is a technical&nbsp;process that is involved to try to retrieve pst files that explains recovery in detail, please forward it to me. If you know a manual process, please forward it to me as well. I would
 like to learn and be able to get these messages in my pst files back. The reason why I am not giving up is that the data size of each pst file is obviously there in each one of them, so the messages exist.</span></p>
<p><span>Please reply.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you</span>&nbsp;</p>

            A quick format rewrites all the pointers on the disk's allocation table to indicate all the space in empty.&nbsp; Any write to that disk can grab an empty pointer and scribble on the sectors indicated.&nbsp; Just because the header of a file indicates that there
 is still data in that file doesn't mean the data means anything, since all the other pointers to the sectors that file was using have been rewritten and point to what is considered unused space.&nbsp; Without some fairly low-level tools, I don't think you stand
 much of a chance to recover your data.

    <title>Help with excel files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redirdniw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help with excel files</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to an AT&amp;T Tilt.<br />
<br />
What I have isn't really a problem but is more of a nuisance...I have an Excel workbook that I use to log my travel for work.&nbsp; It has seven worksheets - one for each day of the week where I enter my milages, destinations, various expenses, etc.&nbsp; I've been using
 this template since I first got my Jornade in 1992.&nbsp; I have another workbook on my desktop PC that links to the travel log to record everything for reporting to my boss each week.&nbsp; I use Office 07 for this.<br />
<br />
When I load up the book on the Tilt, it always defaults to the first worksheet (Sunday) at a viewing zoom of 100%.&nbsp; I have to select the proper day and then change the zoom to 75% (which is my personal preference for working).&nbsp; On the older PPC's (Jornada and
 then my Ipaq), the file would always load up to the last worksheet I had edited, and the only time the zoom changed was if I'd been working on the file on my desktop.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
<br />

            I don't use mobile excel that often Bill but to the best of my knowledge, it will always open to that default ... unfortunately.&nbsp; I just can't see any means of changing that default and I do not believe there is any "hack" available.

<p>Of course you probably already know this but if it is of any value to make sure you open a particular shhet on the next viewing, you could change the order of sheets prior to closing by going to Menu/Format/Modify Sheets</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That way, when you open it the next day, the correct sheet will appear.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zooming is an issue ... you will just have to adjust it everytime.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t access my old account&#33;</h2>
                    &nbsp;I have an email that I used to use (first one I ever created, at age 12), and have since created a new one. I ended up needing to get back into that old account because of needing to know my password to get into Xbox Live, as well as wanting to find an
 old email that I was hoping would give me information about my Scene membership (movies). I have tried to recover my account, but the automated system says my information is not sufficient enough. Unfortunately I don't remember any more due to not using it/signing
 in for years. Not to mention that Outlook has no email for support. So all that, added with me just not remembering my password, is keeping me out of my account. Is there a way to get back in or is it pretty much impossible at this point?

            I attempted to go to your first link, and I went to the first link on the list, typed in my information, the problem, etc, got an email back saying I got a response but when I clicked the link in the email, it brought me to a page that said "[my email]
 is not allowed to view this incident." I was under the impression they'd respond via email. Since I can't "view the incident" how am I supposed to fix my issue?

            Yes, I know; I'm not stupid. However, I was hoping someone here would be able to help with my problem or has experienced the same issue, instead of telling me multiple times to do the same thing over and over expecting a different result.. Thanks for your
 initial reply, but I will be seeking help elsewhere.

    <title>How can I copy a formula and have it update the relative - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neil humphries  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I copy a formula and have it update the relative addresses&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a range (about 80 rows by 60 columns and counting) in a worksheet. Most of the cells contain a variation of the formula: &nbsp;=SUMIFS(P$16:P$740,$J$16:$J$740,$J745). Some cells contain only text.</p>
<p>If I drag the formula across the columns or down the rows, the formula adjusts the relative references so that the cell to the right contains =SUMIFS(Q$16:Q$740,$J$16:$J$740,$J745), and the cell below contains: =SUMIFS(P$16:P$740,$J$16:$J$740,$J746).</p>
<p>How do I achieve the same effect with vba? If I use the following code, the formula is copied unchanged and every cell ends up with the identical formula.</p>
<p>Sub CopyFormula()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim MyRange As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim MyCell As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheets("Staffing").Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Range("P745").Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set MyRange = ActiveSheet.Range("p745:bq823")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each MyCell In MyRange<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Left(MyCell.Formula, 1) = "=" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MyCell.Formula = Range("p745").Formula<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
