    <title>How to delete a blank page in Word 2011&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to delete a blank page in Word 2011&#63;</h2>
                    Ok guys... Am I totally stupid or just not Mac-savvy enough?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've been using word processors for decades... Now on my hackintosh (so you know I do not have a real Apple keyboard...) I do have Pages from Apple, as well as Office 2011 for Mac.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been desperately trying to delete an empty (last) page in a document so it won't add to the document either in printing or saving in PDF.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Been trying the ''view as thumbnail'' both in Word and in Pages. Of course, I'm asking for MS-WORD here. &nbsp;I just can't get rid of that damn page!! &nbsp;This is ridiculous.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>End of my previous page is a table (which does not ease the process...).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have the ''windows'' reflexes of course...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Rob</div>
                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>My solution have been the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Create a new Word document and slightly increase top/bottom margins...</p>
<p>2) Copy the damn document and paste it to the new document ! ...</p>
<p>3) scrap the old document with its damn blank page.</p>
<p>4) Be happy with the new document .. No more last (blank) page!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, with a 1 page document, that was an easy one (although I spent an hour to try to figure another way... I was as stupid as the bug itself...)&nbsp; - If you do have a 300 pages documents, might be less ''friendly'' to do (as you can't really do ''select
 all'' because you will grab your blank page!)</p>
<p>No way, indeed, you can ever delete that page any other way. This is the most stupid bug I have ever seen in a word processor... Never corrected from version to another.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for&nbsp;your assistance,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Certain emails through O365 sending duplicates, but only to some DL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kyleatwork  say:</h3>
<h2>            Certain emails through O365 sending duplicates, but only to some DL members</h2>
                    <p>We have a distribution group that's been working for a while but recently certain emails going to it are being sent multiple times, but only to certain members of said distro group. I ran a message trace and the events are as follows, which seems to confirm
 the duplicate sending as there are two <strong>Expand DL</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Drop</strong>&nbsp;events (see below).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/78cfa374-97a5-4c33-8f03-3b2e775a5e5d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/78cfa374-97a5-4c33-8f03-3b2e775a5e5d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen this before and know how to fix it? There are no nested distribution groups in place (at least in this example) to explain why only a subset of the DL members are getting these duplicates. It also seems odd that the second wave of the same
 email is being sent almost 5 hours later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Hi KyleAtWork,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know what app you‚Äôre using to send email? If you‚Äôre using Outlook desktop app, to verify whether this issue is caused by the third party add-ins, I suggest you try to open Outlook in safe mode and check if the issue persists. To do this, press Windows
 key + R to open the Run command, type outlook /safe and press Enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can also try using <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fix-outlook-and-office-365-issues-with-support-and-recovery-assistant-for-office-365-12cd632c-d672-4782-b0ce-beb82b511525" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the Support and Recovery Assistant (SaRa)</a> which can help you automatically diagnose and fix a range of Outlook problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I‚Äôd like to collect some detailed information as below for further investigation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Does this issue occur every time when you send email to the DL?</li><li>Only fixed DL members will receive duplicate emails?</li></ol>

<p>Hey Huni,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far this issue has been noticed by recipients of automated alerts in our system. So these are servers sending out email alerts for various reasons. We use a hybrid on-prem/cloud setup with Exchange Active Sync on Office 365 using our on-prem smtp servers
 to manage mail flow between O365 and internal/external users/clients. The issue doesn't seem to occur when users are sending emails from their Outlook desktop or mobile clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At times these emails aren't even reaching all the members of the distribution group, and others as initially described they come out as duplicates (but again, only for certain users). The issue seems to be affecting certain users specifically but it's unclear
 at this time whether it's consistently these users or if there's more of a variance.</p>

<p><span>Hi KyleAtWork,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Greetings. This is Alan Wu from Office 365 forum support. I am here to follow up on this thread.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Via going through the whole post, I have found that this issue only persists with the email alerts sending from your server but it works fine while the users send from the Outlook desktop or mobile
 client as you described. If so, for my understanding, the email alerts are generated automatically once it is triggered (something like that, right?). Anyway, if the email was sent twice, there should be 2 different message IDs for each of the message. So,
 I'd like to collect 2 screenshots about the duplicated emails' messages IDs received by the member. For protecting your privacy, you can provide the screenshots in the
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/new">
Private Message (PM)</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Moreover, please also upload a screenshot about your message trace result in the PM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for "these emails aren't even reaching all the members of the distribution group", I'd like to know whether there is any NDR bounced back. If there is no NDR, it implies the email should be sent successfully; if there is the NDR, please also provide it
 in the PM so that we can help analyze it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>As the message comes from the alert email, there might be some other factors causing this which is hard to detect. You can consider to have another DG to give it a shot. Actually, your Office 365 service
 is good as you confirmed that this issue won't occur while sending from the desktop client.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Installing a second copy of Office 2010 on an additional computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chipmaloney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing a second copy of Office 2010 on an additional computer &#40;Home &#38; Student version&#41; when I downloaded it online&#63;</h2>
                    My wife and I bought Office 2010&nbsp;Home and Student version several years ago to run on our only computer. The license says it can be run on up to 3 computers in the same physical&nbsp;household. We have bought a second computer for me so I now want to install
 Office 2010 on that new computer. We downloaded the software when we bought it. How do I get it installed on this second computer and where do I find the License number? We never had any physical installation media. Thanks in advance for your help!

<h2>            Customizing Student Tabs - Once a notebook is created</h2>
                    
<p>In the OneNote Class Notebook creator, I believe, I was able to customize the tabs for my students. However, when I add new students to an existing Class Notebook, the option to customize is not evident and the tabs default to the preset tabs. I work with
 younger students, and it would be difficult to supervise them all making the changes to their own notebooks. Is there a way for me to make those changes in a way that would apply to all students subsequently added to a class notebook?</p>

<p>hi laurie,</p>
<p>if you mean you want to customize the tabs for the students in the notebook. for example, the default tabs which you created by using onenote class notebook creator are as screenshot a and then you added two sections for some students when using the notebook
 as screenshot b<br />
a.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=8ebbc919-c964-48f6-b865-c54a3badf16a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d8ebbc919-c964-48f6-b865-c54a3badf16a" /></a><br />
b.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b032e56e-6905-404a-b00e-58fa4f11e566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db032e56e-6905-404a-b00e-58fa4f11e566" /></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
it is not feasible to apply the changes to other students in one way. once you create the notebook with onenote class notebook creator, new students will only get the default taps. other changes during later using of the notebook will not apply to the new students.
 as a workaround you may need to make the changes for every new student.<br />
i‚Äôd like to confirm whether you have already set up the tabs you need successfully by clicking
<strong>add more</strong> in screenshot a and just have the problem that the new students can only get the 4 default tabs without the ones you added. for details, screenshots are highly appreciated, and you can upload them by clicking
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> at the bottom and then clicking the icon of <strong>
insert media</strong></p>
<p>for any updates, please post back when you have time.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />

<h2>            Sharepoint Enterprise Wiki - Structural Navigation</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am creating an enterprise wiki in sharepoint online and I am having issues editing the site navigation. I can access the Site Navigation Settings and change settings. But when I try to save the navigation settings I am prompted with an error that I do
 not have access and I am a global administrator (error message screenshot below). Ultimately, I would like to make my wiki under Structural Navigation, so I can edit the links in the left panel of the wiki. Please advise.</p>

<p>'History' by definition gives you the history of the current version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So.................nope!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could always create your own history using the highly technical&nbsp;functions like copy and paste, into 'Notepad' and save this as your own personal file.&nbsp; You could update to this file as many times as you want - even including things like time spent creating
 each inclusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be interesting to include things like the weather etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's your computer and you can create all sorts of meaningful notes for yourself - that's partly what notepad is for - text.</p>

<p>The browser address bar maintains history from update to update.&nbsp; However, there is an address bar that can be added to the task bar by right clicking the task bar, choosing toolbars and clicking the address bar to add it.&nbsp; This toolbar will allow one to
 open web sites, search for files or programs, etc. from the task bar without having to open a browser to search or using the search feature.&nbsp; It maintains a history of places visited.&nbsp; I can click the arrow to the right of the address bar, choose my bank that
 I have visited before and open the web site without ever first opening a browser or having to type my bank's address in a search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The history seems to be maintained in the registry, not in a history file.&nbsp; Whenever a new Windows release comes down the pike this history is wiped out, eliminating my stored bank web site until I enter it again.&nbsp; It's history&nbsp; is returned to a blank status.&nbsp;
 I wish that Microsoft would not delete this history upon every release of a new Windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this clarifies what I am talking about.</p>

<h3> jan ku‰çera  say:</h3>
<h2>            Choose Outlook account to synchronize from</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>how do I select which Outlook account will be synchronized with the Windows Mobile?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(recently an exchange account was added to Outlook and the phone stopped syncing contacts&nbsp;with the old account)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            If you are sync contacts and appointments from an Exchange Server, you won't be able to sync to another account.&nbsp; This is a limitation of windows mobile that it can only sync to one account which has been overcome in Windows Phone 7<br />

            I don't want to sync to the Exchange account. One account to sync is enough, but how to choose which one?

<h2>            Office 365 Outlook event errors 1000 and 1026</h2>
                    <p><span>Just upgrade from Outlook 15 to Outlook 16 in Office 365. The OS is Windows 7. When Outlook runs everything seems to be working but in the Event Viewer I noticed two error events that continuously trigger about twice per second second.

<p>
</p><p><span><span>All files that that the errors refer to are in the correct place. Version are all current. Computer is clean of any viruses and malware etc. Didn‚Äôt have this problem previously. When the program is not running the errors stop. I did a repair,
 made sure all previous versions of Outlook were removed including all the registry stuff etc. In Safe mode the problem still occurs as well as with all the add-ins removed.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In the Windows Task Manager under the Processes tab the errors that also appear are "WerFault.exe *32" and "SearchProtocolHost.exe *32". The program still works so I don't get it.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Having some difficulty trying to figure this out.</span></span></p>

                    <p>My company has an extensive Sharepoint intranet. But when I try to connect I get "unsupported authentication scheme".</p>
<p>Our intranet is protected by ISA server 2006. We also use SSL with a public certificate.&nbsp;Weird to notice that our IOS5 devices have no problem connecting.</p>
<p>Is there a special rule to set on the ISA server to solve this?</p>

                    <p>This build (and previous builds), seem to have issues with power drain from the batter when asleep (40% in 14 Hours).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having run a Sleepstudy (Powercfg /sleepstudy), it appears that the audio service (Timer) seems to be to blame.</p>

Pie Yie</a>. We understand the situation. However, we are unable to guarantee what causes the issue. For now, you may still try visiting a Care Point near your place as suggested by 93tid. The repair cost will depend on the technician's assessment. Also, be
 reminded that files on the phone will be deleted during the repair process. We'll appreciate letting us know the outcome.

<p>Anyone been having problems with Call Notify since updating to PR1.2?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it's installed on my device and the icon appears in the 'Settings' -&gt; 'Extras' I can't access any of the settings in the settings menu, i.e I tap an item, it flashes green but doesn't take me to the settings page. Once I uninstall Call Notify everything
 works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Quick Access Folder View Default</h2>
                    <p>I changed the grouping and sort options and somehow overwrote how Windows natively displays files and folders in Quick Access.</p>
<p>Is there a way to revert to the original view? For now I'll resort to a registry edit if this will resolve this issue, but it should be something that can be accomodated with the native UI.</p>

            Explain what you mean by Quick Access Folder. That is <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Customize-the-Quick-Access-Toolbar-6c616455-653c-451c-93f7-96082e98de4d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
an Office Feature</a>&nbsp;in older versions.&nbsp;There is no Quick Access folder in Windows 10, just the option to Pin to Taskbar or Pin to Start. Right click on any program to pin it. You can rearrange the icons on the Taskbar by dragging. Older versions of Windows
 had a Quick Launch toolbar but that has been replaced by Pinning the programs to the Taskbar.

            <p>You are about fifth person aside from me, that have had this issue today. I thought it was something I had done while closing a program, but now I suspect i am innocent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to reboot or restart and see if it works. I did twice and Outlook came back but then the same message came on again. word, Excel and PP did not open. I had intended to do a Repair of Office after dinner, but came back after a Reboot and it all has been
 working fine.&nbsp; Worse comes to worse, you can reinstall Office but then you also have to update. Yuck!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since problem seems to have occurred to many people, I suspect there is an answer coming from MS or a fix is on the way, if it has not already been issued.
</p>
<p>

            <p>I rebooted many times but nothing worked. &nbsp;I then tried two things that I in reality should have tried one at a time. &nbsp;I restarted Windows 10 in safe mode, but Outlook and Word still refused to open. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I then shut down computer and did something that worked on an old Compaq in the Windows 98 days. &nbsp;I pulled the battery from my Panasonic lap top, plugged in the power supply and re-started this morning. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook opened with no problem. &nbsp;I would say to any reader, first try starting Windows 10 in safe mode, not easy to do and see what happens. &nbsp;Second step would be to shut down remove battery and restart with power supply only. &nbsp;If Office will still not work,
 then start in Safe Mode, shut down, pull battery, re-plug power supply and restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank god I had an IPAD that allowed me to research problem while working on this.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I had a similar problem this morning. No Word, Outlook, or Excel. Tried running repair, rebooting, etc. But no joy. Then I discovered that while the rest of the Suite was down, OneNote 2013 still opened. Went to File&gt;Account&gt;Office Updates and ran the updates.</p>
<p>It took about 10 minutes to update, but when it finished everything was working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if repair does not help, see if you can find a way into the updates.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>I never use OneNote and do not even have a shortcut for it. Interesting solution. In my case, for reasons still unknown, once I rebooted a third time, they all came back as if nothing had ever occurred except that when I double-clicked this morning on Outlook
 as I was rebooting (I decided to fully shut down last night), I got a few odd messages including trying to open Outlook while another version was open, and the need to open Outlook in Safe mode, but I ignored them and waited a bit to ensure everything was
 fully booted up. No problem thereafter with either word or Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to look into the update option. I tried looking on MS site to see if there had been updates but did not find much recently for Office 2013. Have you?</p>

</p><p>Given my own experience and that of a few others, you may have gone the extreme route. I wonder if it might have worked without the power supply changeover.&nbsp; Something odd here especially since at least a dozen people had this issue yesterday and posted
 on MS community (we do not know how many others there might be) all with same issue and message popping up.&nbsp; Would be nice if someone from MS came in and provided an explanation as well as a fix.</p>

            <p>I never use One Note either, but I tried finding a way to update Outlook with no luck. &nbsp;Updating Windows 10 took over an hour which I find strange since it does update automatically. &nbsp;As preventative maintenance, I will do an update on my Office suite.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This solution is one that Compaq told me 19 years ago as I mentioned. &nbsp;Apparently the battery is not a pure battery but has the power management system built into it. &nbsp;I presume that most laptop's use this architecture. Pulling the battery, with the power
 cord disconnected of-course enables an extension to the boot mode. &nbsp;With the power cord disconnected, once removed from the computer and the computer restarted without the battery clears the compute of its history and apparently any other corruptions. &nbsp; All
 I can say is that after 4 wasted hours yesterday, and one very stiff neck, this morning it worked.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This is to all of the above on this thread. The answer appears to be Norton Internet Security and not MS Windows or Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read the following link and then scroll through it past all that had the same issue last night and eventually you get a Norton "apology". If you have Live update you might want to update again to make sure the fix is uploaded. Actually the fix appears to
 be a retreat to earlier version of definitions or other items they downloaded yesterday that caused the issue. I suspect that times varied for folks because of when you might have set up for any updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would now appear that all the other methods that everyone employed made little difference until you altered, disconnected or updated once again your Norton.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to all and, hopefully, we do not have to relive this issue</p>

<h2>            Build 10162- Error 0x8007002</h2>
                    <p>Hi- wanted to share my install experience in case it'll help others. &nbsp;Tried to clean install Build 10162 three times. &nbsp;The first time the install got to the "Getting files ready for installation" step and stopped @ 73%. &nbsp;I download the iso again for the
 second try.&nbsp;The second time it got to the same step and stopped @ 86%. I got the same error again. &nbsp;The third time I attempted the install, I re-installed from the same drive without downloading the iso in an attempt to gather additional details to post as
 a technical question and it worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the&nbsp;Windows 7 USB DVD Download Tool on Windows XP SP3 to place the files on my usb drive. &nbsp;The usb drive used to install is a PNY 128GB USB 3.0 Thumb Drive.</p>

    <title>why does font size changes while typing in Mac Word 2004 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> susanmccloskey  say:</h3>
<h2>            why does font size changes while typing in Mac Word 2004</h2>
                    She opens Word, starts from a blank document, typing along like I am now using size 12 and then&nbsp;it automatically switches to a smaller size. When this happens, she has to&nbsp;highlight all the text and change the size in Format. This does not happen all the
 time, nor in other programs, like TextEdit.

            Can you verify if the problem is document specific?<br />
If not check if it affects only word, and other applications work fine.<br />
If it affects only word, you could reset the preferences to see if that helps:<br />

            Hi Susan:
<div><br />
<div>Not enough detail to answer. &nbsp;If you suddenly typed a URL, Word will apply the Hyperlink style, and if that has been mis-configured with a fot size, the font will change.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you applied an AutoText as an AutoCorrect, and the AutoText was specified as "Formatted", then it will come in with the style that it was stored with.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you typed off the end of a paragraph and created a new paragraph, the new paragraph will be formatted with the "Style for following paragraph" which may be different.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sorry: We'd love to help, but we can't read your screen from here: you need to give us the details.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers</div>
