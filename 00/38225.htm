<h2>            My surface RT keeps going back to start screen</h2>
                    I will be looking at something on the internet and all of a sudden it is gone and the start screen is showing. I have to start my google search again. My hand is no where near the screen or the windows button. Why does this happen?

            <p>I actually thought this problem was fixed as it hasn't happened to me since shortly after the post above. I also hadn't heard of it happening in anything other than metro IE until now.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Have you made sure all updates are installed? You could also try a refresh (keep data), install updates and see if it still happens and then a complete reset to factory as a last resort.</p>

    <title>I want to go back to 7, but how&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            I want to go back to 7, but how&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've had enough of 10 and it's non-functional, disappearing apps and want to go back to 7 to regain my PC's usability. I don't have a disc as my PC came loaded with 7 Home Premium when I bought it and I had to remove 7 to get 10 to work at all so I can't
 just change back. Is there some way of getting 7 again or do I have to buy it.? I have baulked at the idea of buying back my lost DVD Player and think the current issues with the Photo app are a prelude to having to buy a fix for that too so if I have to buy
 7 I'm more inclined to dump my PC in the trash and get something that uses another OS (you know what I mean!),</p>
<p>This is it for me, I'm a the point of no return with Microsoft products. I don't know what they thought they were playing at but 10 is a load of, no question.</p>
<p>If there's a way I can go back I'll give it a go but if not, goodbye Microsoft !</p>

            If your PC came preloaded with Windows 7 it will have a means of being reset to its as-supplied ('factory') state.&nbsp; The way you do this depends on the manufacturer.&nbsp; You must back-up all your files first as everything will be lost.

            As I said, I had to remove 7 in order to get 10 to work so it's not there anymore. I have very few important files so that's not a problem. I was just wondering if I had to buy 7 all over again as seems likely. If so, I'm just not going to do it!

            <p>You had to remove the working copy of Windows 7 but you did not have to remove the recovery partition where the information required to reset your computer to its factory state is stored.&nbsp; Maybe you did it anyway?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In which case, there should be a COA sticker with your Windows 7 product key on it on the computer somewhere.&nbsp; Borrow a Windows 7 installation disk and enter that product key when asked.&nbsp; Make sure you install the version of Windows 7 (Home/Pro/other) that
 is on the label.&nbsp; You'll then, probably,&nbsp;have to go to your manufacturer's web site and download and install the hardware drivers</p>

            <p>Thanks for your suggestions&nbsp;Cass and Alan&nbsp;but there seems to be no trace of the original OS. I get an option to reset which would remove all the apps from my PC - don't fancy that as then I'm still&nbsp;stuck with 10 and having to find all my apps again on the
 internet. There's a Windows 7 sticker but no product key that I can find anywhere. I did a system files clean-up after which all the fancy Windows 10 gizmos like the animated tiles&nbsp;started to work and Edge loaded more quickly but it seems to have erased all
 trace of 7 from my PC. Even IE seems to be gone - useless as it was (crash prone!)</p>
<p>The 'restart now' setting doesn't mention 7 so I don't know what that will do, are you sure about that Cass? I don't want to make things worse (if that's possible!).</p>
<p>I just can't face waiting for Microsoft to iron out all the bugs with 10 which make it so unusable (apps not working or turning off randomly) and so I guess my PC is just ruined!</p>
<p>I don't have the knowhow or the facilities to fix it myself so that's that I guess.</p>
<p>Guess I'll give the 'restart now' thing a try and if it doesn't work I'll just have to go shopping (no more Microsoft for me in that case!).</p>

            <p>OK Cass, I tried your solution but the previous build&nbsp; (Windows 7, presumably) isn't available, meaning I suppose that it's just gone, and&nbsp;though I found&nbsp;the product key&nbsp; it seems Alan's solution isn't going to do it for me either as I really don't know
 anyone I could borrow a Windows 7 disc from. You know what, I'm just sick of the mess Microsoft made with their 'upgrade'. They should have worked harder on it before shoving it at us.</p>

<p>If you visit <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/918b0f5d-512d-4a1d-96fe-67c551239123/can-i-upgrade-32-bit-win-7-to-64-bit-with-oem-product-key?forum=w7itproinstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this web page</a>&nbsp;and scroll down a little way you can see what&nbsp;a typical&nbsp;product key sticker looks like.&nbsp; In the example the numbers and letter of the key have all been replaced by the letter X.&nbsp; If you have a laptop computer the key is usually on the underside
 but very occasionally it is inside the battery compartment and you have to remove the battery to find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But before we worry about that, right click the Start button and select Computer Management from the list.&nbsp; Then click Disk Management in the left column.&nbsp; That will show you all the partitions on all the hard drives.&nbsp; Your Windows (C:) partition should
 be listed there but see if you&nbsp;can find&nbsp;another partition on the same hard drive called Recovery (or similar).&nbsp; It&nbsp;will usually be between 10GB and 20GB in size and will not usually have a drive letter (so you will not know it is there unless you follow this
 procedure).&nbsp; If you do have a 'recovery' partition like the one I describe then you probably still can reset your computer back to its as-supplied state.&nbsp; Tell me the name of your computer manufacturer and I can look-up the instructions on how to start the
 process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>I found the product key, not that I think it's going to be of much use as I don't know anyone who might have a Windows 7 disc handy!</p>
<p>I found the Recovery partition and it has 14.69 GB of data in it. My PC is an HP Pavilion G6. If I don't get my PC functioning as it should I am going to replace it next week when I've got a couple of days off work as this is making me feel ill. Needless
 to say, I won't be considering anything with a Microsoft OS! Microsoft shouldn't have pushed 10 onto the public if it wasn't sorted. I have come to DESPISE Microsoft over this past 6 weeks of hell, what a crass bunch of arrogant opportunists they are, foisting
 what amounts to half-baked ransom-ware on us, presumably because they already had the TV ad campaign booked!</p>
<p>If you think you can help Alan, I'll give it a try if I can but I'm almost past caring now as I don't really believe that 7 will work properly anymore if I DO get it back. I'd almost rather just start from scratch with something 'untainted' by MS.</p>

            <p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>Thanks for the info. I'll give it a go when I've USB'd all my personal files, there isn't much and I'd be doing it anyway so I could transfer them to a new Pc if need be. As Edge won't let me download anything I'd have to use Chrome&nbsp; or Firefox to try nielpizz's
 method, but that seems like I'd have to be buying function back when it's MS's fault I'm in this position. I'll check it out but I've come to regard any such suggestion with suspicion! One things for certain, I'm NOT going to spend money on a 4 year old PC
 that's been ruined by the people who're supposed to enable it to work!</p>
<p>Hardware and all was fine 'til MS **** with it so hopefully it still will be, I guess I'll find out! Regardless of the outcome, I'm decided upon replacing my PC with a non MS device. I don't trust MS anymore but if I can get my PC working again I can move
 on in a more orderly fashion.</p>

            Thanks for the reply.  Unfortunately, replacing the unit every 21 days does not seem like a viable solution.  I replaced my original one (which I had for years without using the mic) and bout 20 days later replaced it with the one I bought in the beginning of December.  On December 24, the mic on that one stopped working.  On December 24, I replaced that one with another of the same model, and on January 11 that one stopped working.  I replaced it with a Logitech.  I won't use LifeChat again and I am telling everyone I encounter not to use it.  I work for a very large company and I work from home, so the quality of the headset and mic are extremely important.  I can't just replace it at a moment's notice.  I conclude that the headset is OK but the mic is ****.

=====================================<br />
You are correct...the templates auto-crop the photos to fit<br />
the&nbsp;selected photo size. Aside from preparing the images<br />
in advance to the same aspect ratio as the templates there <br />
is no way to prevent the auto-cropping.<br />
<br />
The freeware Picasa has some nice printing options...it may<br />
be worth a try. To prevent cropping...use the 'Shrink to fit' <br />
option.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Freeze and clock_watchdog_timeout error</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I first bought my pc, I tried installing windows 8. Just after the installation, the pc would freeze or give me blue screen (can't remember the error). I installed Windows 7 and everything was good .Today, I installed windows 10 (clean install, not
 upgrade). I started having the same problem. The system won't even reach the page to set up my (new) user settings. It freezes right after the first loading screen. Sometimes it freezes after I configure (or skip) wifi connection. Sometimes it gives me blue
 screen with clock_watchdog_timeout error. Since I cant install any drivers, what can I do? (I cant even use restore settings because I haven't configured an administrator) If I reinstall windows 7 and they work, can I just upgrade so it will keep the drivers?
 Can it be a hardware problem, since windows 7 work? </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret any inconvenience this has caused. We'll be glad to help you fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A question, what is the make and model of your computer and from where did you download Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem might occur due to any hardware issues. The CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error means that your processor is having trouble with cooperation from its cores and threads. Threads are tasks taken by cores, and some cores can take many threads simultaneously.
 The problem here is that a thread is waiting for a proper response from another thread ‚Äî or a core is waiting for a response from another core ‚Äî and those responses aren‚Äôt coming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, you get this BSoD error. While this is a processor problem, this can be caused by two things: a driver error, which is very likely if you‚Äôre using Windows 10, or the OS itself isn‚Äôt playing nice with the processor.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer is currently running on Windows 7, I would suggest you to install all the drivers and&nbsp;then upgrade your PC to Windows 10 using media creation tool. Refer the below article to download media creation tool and see the section
<strong>upgrade to Windows 10 using the tool.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> To perform the above process, make sure that&nbsp;Windows 7 copy is genuine and it is activated already. To verify right-click
<strong>This PC</strong> and select <strong>Properties</strong>. Your Windows activation status is listed at the bottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the below article by Andre Da Costa and follow the steps mentioned in the section
<strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade, </strong>to ensure a smooth migration to Windows 10.</p>

            <p>You need software for authoring a video DVD. I thought the Sony Multi-Function DVD Recorder came with Nero software for doing just that? Have you double-checked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, you can look for other DVD authoring software like DVD Flick or DVD Styler. However, do check what source files the software accepts. If it doesn't accept H.264/MP4 files, you can also save from Movie Maker in Windows Media Video/WMV format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember that a DVD is a standard-definition format with a maximum resolution of 480p (NTSC). So if you are expecting your HD video to get transferred unchanged, that is not the case. It will be down-rezzed to the lower resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do believe the Sony Multi-Function DVD can be treated as an external DVD burner. Check the manual for the types of DVD discs it recommends.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve this issue follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You have to convert your Microsoft Account to a Local Account and then convert it back to a Microsoft Office. Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Open <strong>Settings</strong>, and click/tap on the <strong>Accounts</strong> icon.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In <strong>Your account</strong>, click/tap on the <strong>Sign in with a local account instead</strong> link on the right side at the top.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type in the <strong>current password</strong> of your Microsoft account, and click/tap on
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type in a <strong>user name</strong>, password, and password hint you want for your local account, and click/tap on
<strong>Next</strong></span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Click/tap on Sign out and finish</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To switch from local account to a Microsoft account, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Open&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>, and click/tap on the <strong>Accounts</strong> icon.<br />
In <strong>Your account</strong>, click/tap on the <strong>Sign in with a Microsoft account instead</strong> link on the right side at the top.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type in the <strong>current password</strong> of your Local account (if shown), and click/tap on
<strong>Next</strong>. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type in an <strong>email ID</strong>, password, and password hint you want for your Microsoft account, and click/tap on
<strong>Next</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click/tap on Sign out and finish</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now restart Windows 10 and try logging in to your User Account and check if this still shows your email address or has cleared it from the screen. If it is still shown then you
 may navigate back to <strong>Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in Options &gt; Privacy</strong> and make sure to turn it off the option ‚ÄòShow account details (e.g. email address) on sign-in screen‚Äô.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Thank you.</span>

<p><span>Hi Jmido,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the exact error message you receive?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I see that you have a very good hardware configuration setup on your computer, it might not be an issue with the hardware requirements.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I verified the information in Microsoft compatibility center if GTA IV is compatible with Windows 7, I found that its compatible with
 both the operating system.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Access the link below to find the information about compatibility.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=GTA IV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=GTA%20IV</a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>However, you may try to install the game in
</span><span>compatibility mode following the steps below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open the Program Compatibility Wizard by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Programs, and then clicking
 ‚ÄòUse an older program with this version of Windows‚Äô.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Follow the instructions in the wizard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the wizard, browse to the program's setup
 file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something similar. The wizard is not designed to work on programs that have an .msi file name extension.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To change compatibility settings manually for a program, right-click the icon for the program, click Properties, and then click the
 Compatibility tab. Select Windows XP SP2 and select the option to run as administrator. Click on Apply and Ok. Try to install the program again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below to know more about how to make older programs run in this version of Windows:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are still facing the same issue after following the above steps I would suggest you to contact the game manufacturer
 support and check if they have any updates on this issue and a fix for it. </span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Also check if the game is downloaded fine on your computer and check if all the patches for the game&nbsp;is available
 in the downloaded folder. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the status.</span></p>

            <p>Check the "import" function. You import files/songs into itunes. <br />
And don't auto sync, otherwise, iTunes will replace all iPhone existing songs. <br />
I've suffered loss of all my iPhone music files. It's so upsetting.</p>
<p>*Removed* <br />
Hope it can do you a favor.</p>

                    Hello! &nbsp;I need to enable a feature called virtualization on my computer. &nbsp;I have used the Intel Processor Identification Key to determine that Intel Virtualization Technology is supported on my computer. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the default setting is for virtualization
 to be disabled (I have used Speccy to confirm that mine is currently disabled). &nbsp;In older versions of windows you could enter the BIOS to change this setting and enable virtualization. &nbsp;Can anybody please help me? &nbsp;

<h3> webofdeception  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disc read error on downloaded game&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased Bully Scholarship edition since it was dirt cheap and I really enjoy the game. I got to the Dean's office for the first time and the game froze with the error "disc read error: please close tray or clean disc." I rebooted my system and
 tried the game again, this time it didn't make it through the opening cinematic before getting the same error! Ummm, I'm no rocket scientist, but when a game is downloaded, you don't have/need a disc! I have cleared out its data and re-downloaded it to get
 the same result over and over. Any ideas?</p>

</p><p>I used to use Skype on an iPad with an old skype account linked to a gmail address. &nbsp;I can no longer log in with that acount (since it is not a Microsoft account), but I would like to recuperate all contacts and conversations fro that account. &nbsp;Is that possible?
 &nbsp;Can I (or Microsoft) link my former account to my new one? &nbsp;I have some information in there that I cannot retrieve anywhere else.</p>

<h2>            No visual upon Xbox startup</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a problem with my&nbsp;<span>Xbox One X</span>; whenever I start it the screen goes black and shows no visuals, however in one instance there was sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first start up that failed only occured after I changed a&nbsp;<span>setting</span>. After the setting was changed the Xbox seemed to stop responding to the remote, as the screen seemed frozen, however I could hear the Xbox making sound
 in response to the controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking it was frozen I tried to restart it. Do you think this is a HDMI problem? Or should I directly contact customer support about a software issue/how to reset the console?</p>

<p>Hey Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here on the Xbox forums. Sounds like there may have been video settings changed on the xbox, causing this issue to occur. I recommend trying to reset the display settings to default :
</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>If there's a disc in the Xbox One console, eject it. </li><li>On the console, press and hold the&nbsp;<strong>Xbox</strong>&nbsp;button &nbsp;for five seconds to turn off the console.
</li><li>Press and hold the&nbsp;<strong>Xbox</strong> button &nbsp;and the <strong>Eject</strong>&nbsp;button until you hear a beep to turn on the console. You will hear&nbsp;one beep right away and a second beep 10 seconds later. The power light will flash on before the second beep.
 DO NOT LET GO until the second beep occurs.
<p><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;This will boot your console in low resolution mode (640 √ó 480). To reset this setting, go to
<strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings</strong> in the guide, select <strong>
Display &amp; sounds</strong>,<strong> Video options</strong>, and then <strong>TV Resolution</strong>.
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results!</p>

    <title>Windows 7 crashes when i watch BBC iplayer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> papadon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 crashes when i watch BBC iplayer</h2>
                    I've recently built a PC &amp; have installed windows 7 home premium (64-bit).<br />
I am having the following&nbsp;problem occur:<br />
While watching BBC iplayer in full screen it will freeze on a particular frame and start making a buzzing noise through my speakers. I then have to reset the machine. This only seems to happen on iplayer &amp; not when watching dvd's.<br />
In case it helps, the spec for my machine is:<br />
intel core2 quad Q6600 (with Arctic Cooling heatsink &amp; Fan)<br />
4 gig RAM<br />
ATI Radeon HD 4670 video card.<br />
<br />
I've check &amp; it seems that my video card is fine with 64-bit os.<br />
Also thought the&nbsp;CPU is overheating but it's always below 40 deg C.<br />
I am considering wiping the hard drive and starting again with the 32-bit version&nbsp;but i really don't want to do that unless no other choice.<br />
<br />
Any ideas/suggestions anyone?<br />
<br />
Also, I've got a cheap wireless Logitech Keyboard and Mouse and have found that when the screen goes into power saving mode, the screen will come back on when i move the mouse but then the pointer doesn't respond and neither does the keyboard. Again, i end
 up reseting.<br />
<br />
This is really bugging me as the machine seems absolutely fine with everything else. I really enjoyed building &amp; choosing the parts for it and am now getting it in the neck from the Mrs (you should have just bought a pc!). I'd love to resolve all this to get
 her off my back ;-)<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            Hi<br />
<br />
Make sure u use the 32-Bit Version of IE as there is no 64-Bit Version of Flash Player available yet.

            <p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused, I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, do let us know if you made any changes to the system prior to the issue. Also, do you receive the error while performing a specific task?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see that you have used "workgroup" as the name of the computer. This could be the reason why you are receiving the error message. Normally, changing the name of the computer fixes the issue. I would suggest you to try assigning a different name by
 following the steps below and check again:</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R to open the run command.</p>
<p>2. Type control and press enter to open control panel.</p>
<p>3. Type system in the control panel search box and open it.</p>
<p>4. On the right hand side of the Window, click "change setting".</p>
<p>5. In the computer description box, assign a different name and save the changes.</p>
<p>6. Restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result.</p>

            <p>The "Computer Description" wasn't workgroup. I had changed that into BensBigBertha. I did change the name in the "Workgroup" box to "BigBertha." So we will see if that helps.</p>

<h2>            Headphones not showing up as separate playback device, bad quality audio</h2>
                    My fairly new headphones will not show up as a playback device when I plug them in, and when I do plug them in, there is absolutely no bass in the audio. My default playback device (Realtek high definition audio) was somehow uninstalled and ever since
 fixing that, I've been having this problem. The headphones work beautifully with every other device I own, so they're not the problem. I've scoured the internet and tried so many different things and nothing has worked, including making sure hidden/disabled
 devices is checked on and doing various things to the default playback device. I've had this problem before and was able to fix it but I don't remember how.&nbsp;

Update: I fixed the problem. In System Configuration, I went to the Services tab and found that "Realtek Audio Service" was disabled. I ticked the box and my headphones now show up as a separate device AND the audio is perfectly fine now.&nbsp;
