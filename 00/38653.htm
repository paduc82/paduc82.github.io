    <title>Child request to extend screen time not received. Child locked out of - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Child request to extend screen time not received. Child locked out of computer.</h2>
                    <p>I recently included my other child in our Microsoft Family and now my other child, which was first in the family, can't log in. The computer screen says "time is up". When asks for more screen time the notice says that a request was sent but I don't receive
 a request even after numerous attempts.</p>
<p>I've also:</p>
<p>1. Removed child from the family. Then removed the other as well. Add child as a user outside of the family.&nbsp;Windows does not seem to recognize that the child has been removed as it still says "times up" and asks that a request be sent.</p>
<p>2. Re-add child (only the one child) but still I'm not able to receive a screen time extension.</p>
<p>3. Disabled screen time limits. Still not working as it should. Still receive notice to request an extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? It seems that the accounts changes don't sync with the computer. Not entirely sure that adding the other child caused the issue but it started to not work once or just a little after this happened.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>Could you clarify? Is this a known issue? If so is there a proceedure to correct it?</p>
<p>To follow up:</p>
<p>My child is now not part of my MS Family and is now a local or other user on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when trying to log in the notice still says time is up and to request more time. I never receive the requests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when I press cnrt alt delete I can sign my kid out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also the admin on the computer and I can access it just fine. Win10 also tells me that my kid is signed in when I try to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other child,which has not experienced these problems, is also not part of the Family anymore and is treated like a local or other account on another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrating that my first child is now effectively locked out of the computer. A book report is due in a week.</p>

            It seems we have solved the issue. From what we can determine my kid created too long of a password (28 chars long). Once the password was shortened the account worked again. Then when my kid made a new longer password it stopped working. We again shortened
 the password and it seems to work. My kid can send time extension requests and I get them and the approvals take effect.<br />

            <p>This main issue of my child being locked out of the computer was solved.</p>
<p>However, it appears that screen time and parental controls won't apply to him but they do apply to my other child.</p>
<p>It did work before. It appears that this started to&nbsp;malfunction about the time I added my second child to our Family.</p>
<p>Second child's parental controls to limit screen time&nbsp;are positive function and I'm able to receive screen time extension requests and execute them.</p>
<p>First child parental controls don't work and he does not need to request screen time extensions despite that I have screen time limits clearly activated in his profile along with blocked websites.</p>
<p>It would be great if this issue could be solved. It helps me keep my kids and myself cognisant of the amount of screen time they receive.</p>

            I am having the exact same issues that you are having. My son was playing a game full screen and when his time was running up he requested more time. I never received the e-mails and he was locked out. I did go into the screen time settings, under the
 microsoft website, and give him more time but it isn't working. Even though he has unlimited time for this day and 24 hour access I cannot log in under his account. It says that he needs to request more time or wait until the next day. However when we select
 the more time button I do not receive an email. This has happened before and the only way I could fix it was to delete his entire account from the computer, deleting all of his files, and adding him back. I really do not want to do that again.&nbsp;

<h2>            Why is my Skype and Microsoft account seperate&#63;</h2>
                    my skype account is apparently not connected to any email when trying to sign in on here, but still sends emails to my email when i change the password or something. This microsoft account is also set up on that email, but i cant add an email to my skype
 when logging in on here because this email is already taken by this account. How do i combine the two accounts? I want to add this email to my skype account, which according to the app it already is, but i cant because when logging in on microsft itself it
 asks for an email to be added and i cant use this one due to it being used for this account.

<p><span>Hello emily2345,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, it is not possible to merge your Skype and your Microsoft account.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you receive the error "Microsoft account already exists. Enter another email or phone, or get a new Outlook email." You will see this message if the email or phone
 number you are trying to add is already tied to another Microsoft account. You will need to use an alternate phone number, an alternate email or create a new one.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can however, add an alias. To do so, please refer to this FAQ:

<h2>            Microsoft Mahjong Crash</h2>
                    <p>Since An Intel Video update, Mahjong crashes after the automatic Xbox sign in. The following steps have been tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>uninstalling and reinstalling Mahjong. (Interestingly the usual 0 to 218 MB&nbsp;download changes suddenly to bigger numbers, most recently 0.9 to 1.9 GB !!).</li><li>using wsrestore.exe</li></ul>
<p>These do not change the behaviour of Mahjong. Other Microsoft apps eg Solitaire Collection run fine.</p>

    <title>Missing files on Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Missing files on Windows 7</h2>
                    I've had windows 7 for a couple of weeks now on a brand new computer. I'm impressed with it but I'm having a problem. Twice now, I've powered up my computer to find that my saved game files were missing and my wife was missing documents that she had been
 working on. The games were still installed, but when I went to play them (Comand and Conquer 3 and Resident Evil 5) I had to put the purchase code in again and my saved games were gone in both programs. Windows Live did not remember my profile the way it had
 many times prior to this. The gadgets I had&nbsp;installed on the desktop were gone, internet history, favorites, everything gone.&nbsp;It seems like an update is running and removing files or restoring it to an earlier time. I haven't caught it doing this, and no one
 in my home has done it on purpose. I believe it's happening when the system boots up.&nbsp;I'm not a computer guru and I don't have a clue what's causing the problem. It's very frustrating to know I have to go kill all those zombies again!!<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what might be causing this? Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
The only programs I've installed are Office 03, Norton Internet Security 2010, Command and Conquer 3, Resident Evil 5, and XBOX 360 Accessories tool (to run my XBOX 360 Controller). I've had no other problems or any other issues to be suspicious of. Norton
 runs a scan and it comes out clean.

<p>Perhaps BigSarge87's fix was automagical?</p>
<p>&lt;QP&gt;<br />
...My wife called me from home this morning and said when she logged in, everything was back to normal. Now it almost looks like some kind of user account issue. I'll check it out when I go home for lunch. There is only one account (the default one) and one
 password that has been set up, so I don't see how we could have been logged in as the wrong user.</p>
<p>My plan of action now will just be to log out and log back in the next time it happens to see if that fixes it.<br />
&lt;/QP&gt;<br />

<p>Searching for files using Windows Explorer (in Windows 7 Home Premium) does not find files that are there.</p>
<p>I type part of a filename into the Search field, with no additional search filters, and it only shows a few of the matching files.</p>
<p>Can anyone please explain how to solve this?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t join or start parties on Xbox Beta</h2>
                    <p>I have tried reinstalling the app. Opening up the audio settings displays a sad face and a volume slider (which I cannot change) and a enable push to talk checkbox (which I can not enable)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right clicking on a friends profile and clicking "Join Xbox One party" does nothing and keeps the context menu open however clicking start voice chat closes the context menu but still does nothing.&nbsp; Opening the player card by clicking on a friends profile
 picture and clicking start voice chat acts the same as in the context menu.</p>

<p>I can confirm what Sunnyfield said. &nbsp;My Storm Island tab was greyed out after purchasing and downloading. &nbsp;But once you win 3 championships, and my 3rd was Nice, it immediately opened the intro to Storm Island and put an icon on the map. &nbsp;I raced at Storm
 Island shortly after.</p>

<p>The guy has cheated you and done something illegal. Go back to him and get him to fix it. And let him know that if he doesn't, you'll report him to the police.</p>

            <p>If the keycode sticker is still on the bottom of the laptop here is what you need to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Download the .iso file for Home Premium (you did not say if you had the 32 or 64Bit version so I've included both download links.</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium x64 (64-bit) English: <a href="http://msft-dnl.digitalrivercontent.net/msvista/pub/X15-65733/X15-65733.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://msft-dnl.digitalrivercontent.net/msvista/pub/X15-65733/X15-65733.iso</a></p>

http://msft-dnl.digitalrivercontent.net/msvista/pub/X15-65732/X15-65732.iso</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Use the .iso file to create a Windows 7 Home Premium installation DVD.</p>
<p>After downloading the .iso file use ImgBurn or Gear ISO to create a bootable DVD.</p>
<p>ImgBurn - In addtion to supporting the creation of Cds/DVDs from .ISO files, <br />
it supports a wide range of other image file formats, and it's free. <br />
(BIN, CUE, DI, DVD, GI, IMG, MDS, NRG, PDI and ISO)<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>Download and install Gear ISO burn (Free): <br />
<a href="http://www.gearsoftware.com/GEAR-ISO-Burn.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gearsoftware.com/GEAR-ISO-Burn.php</a></p>
<p>Note: Always use the slowest burn speed (4x or 2x) if offered a choice.</p>

</p><p>I must have hit a wrong button at some point (as I usually do), and now I can't get the camera to come up. When I do I get told that it needs my permission. Can someone please explain what this means, as well as how to get my camera back?</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player -resume video playback</h2>
                    <p>I am running Media Player in Windows 8.1. I would like for media player to be able to resume a video at the place I left off after I close the file. Is there any way to do this? I've tried the MyMediaBookmarks plugin and Media Player Plus plugins and they
 don't seem to work, and it's not happening by default.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Windows Media player if you close a file and reopen, the file will start from beginning. We do not have option to resume the file in Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may use your favorite search engine and check if you can find ant third-party application to use this option.
</span></p>

<h2>            No sound playback in my HP pavilion, Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello Family,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no sound in my HP Pavilion, though the sound icon on tray indicates everything is okay.</p>
<p>Tried removing and installing drivers back, but still same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All signs of trouble started whenever i was playing music and the volume gain would just reduce itself to zero. Eventually, i could not get the speakers to output any sound, though i am still able to adjust the gain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly advise on possible problems and solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you family.</p>

<p>The Network Troubleshooter is somewhat useful.&nbsp; I typed in the site I am trying to get to (http://oneyearawayfromwork.net/) and it says this:</p>
<p>The remote computer isn’t responding to connections on port 80, possibly due to firewall or security policy settings, or because it might be temporarily unavailable. Windows couldn’t find any problems with the firewall on your computer.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, why can other computers connect just fine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the other site (https://www.smarterasp.net/) it says:</p>
<p>The remote computer isn’t responding to connections on port 443, possibly due to firewall or security policy settings, or because it might be temporarily unavailable. Windows couldn’t find any problems with the firewall on your computer.

<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.

<br />Unfortunately, Skype does not store your video calls locally or on the cloud so there is no way to do this. However, you can record your calls which will allow you to do so, and more on this can be found out here:-

<h2>            Windows 10 November Upgrade 1501 - Black screen after Login</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded Windows 10 Pro to the November Upgrade 1501.&nbsp;&nbsp; After login the screen will go completely black.&nbsp; The desktop is no longer shown, however apps such as Task Manager will still appear if running at the "blackening".&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the sick feeling
 I've just traded the Critical Error: Start Menu and Cortana for another equally aggravating issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there acknowledgement from MS about this issue?</p>
<p>I thought we had a stable release on this round but apparently not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond</p>
<p>

    <title>Administrator Account Added via XBox App -- Need to unlink unwanted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slarimer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Administrator Account Added via XBox App -- Need to unlink unwanted account</h2>
                    <p>A family member has been using the same laptop for an extended time with LOTS of files, pictures, etc. However, it had no Microsoft account or login attached to the administrator account, therefore, could go to the desktop without a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was bored and popped open the XBox App on Windows 10 and logged in with my account. Now this account has become linked as the administrator of the entire computer, including name and password. Obviously, this is not ideal and I need this to be removed/changed
 immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the track of creating a local account and promoting it to administrator to switch over, but obviously, this account does not have any of the files or personalization of the original. Under no circumstances would it be okay for me to delete
 what is now "my account" as it would wipe all of his data from the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for a way to unlink a Microsoft email and account from the administrator of the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. I'll continue to scour Google for help in the meantime.</p>

    <title>XP Mode&#58; FoxPro for Windows 2.6 application &#40;16 bit&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dbeitz  say:</h3>
<h2>            XP Mode&#58; FoxPro for Windows 2.6 application &#40;16 bit&#41; can&#39;t find network folders</h2>
                    
<p>I have several in-house applications developed and compiled using FoxPro for Windows 2.6 (FPW 2.6).&nbsp; They are 16 bit applications, and thus will not run natively in 64 bit Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; I was hoping XP Mode might be the solution, but so far it
 isn't.&nbsp; The applications do not get installed on computer, they live in a network folder.&nbsp; Users access the apps via shortcuts on their desktop.&nbsp; Picking one of these apps as an example, on a typical Windows XP machine in my organization, the path to the application
 would be I:\INFO\INFO.EXE</p>
<p>When I run the application in XP Mode, it will open, but as soon as it tries to open database files (DBF format) that live in a subfolder of the app (I:\INFO\DBF), it says it can't find the data files.&nbsp; The application relies on the system path (SET PATH
 TO \INFO;\INFO\DBF) to find these files.&nbsp; Apparently the path isn't working correctly in XP Mode.</p>
<p>I've checked the settings of the XP Mode virtual.&nbsp; Originally the network card was set to NAT, and based on various online resources I changed it to the actual hardware NIC.&nbsp; This had no affect, the app still can't find it's data folder no matter which network
 card setting is used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried turning Integration Features off, but then I can't get to my network drives at all from XP Mode.</p>
<p>Compatibility Modes don't help, because they only work with installed apps, they aren't available for applications run from a network resource.</p>
<p>My only guess at the source of the issue comes from looking at the shortcut that's created on the XP Mode desktop.&nbsp; The target is "\\tsclient\I\INFO\INFO.EXE".&nbsp; As previously stated, a normal XP machine would show the target as "I:\INFO\INFO.EXE".&nbsp; I'm guessing
 that the fact that "\\tsclient\" is on the front of the target and that the colon is missing ("I\INFO" instead of I:\INFO) may be affecting the 16 bit app.&nbsp; It looks like XP Mode's access to network drives is being handled through the Integration Features,
 which is interfering with the path.&nbsp; If I create a new shortcut by hand and type in I:\INFO\INFO.EXE as the target, it tells me the target cannot be found.&nbsp; In order for it to find the file, the tsclient prefix must be there, and the colon must be omitted.</p>
<p>Any insight into resolving this issue and getting these 16 bit apps running in XP Mode would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Dale</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>You have to use the NIC direct setting (Not NAT) and relate to the XP Mode as a separate computer. I.e., configure it with the users, permissions, etc., as you would do on a network that is comprised of a standalone Windows 7 and XP Pro computer.</p>
<p>In general.</p>
<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network has <strong>three</strong> types of Sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup Network</strong> = Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Work Network</strong> = Basically similar to the previous methods of sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing</strong> = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a Network with the same name while each computer has its own unique name.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted
 Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq.html#trusted<br />
</a><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd
 party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>

<strong>When finished with the setting of the system it is advisable to Reboot all the hardware including the Router and all computers involved.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you have Permission and Security issues, check the <strong>following</strong> settings.</strong></p>
<p>Point to the a Folder that meant to&nbsp; to be share. Right click and choose properties.</p>
<p>In the properties</p>

<p><strong>In both the Security panel, and the Permission panel you have to highlight each User/Group and examine that the Permission Controls are checked correctly.</strong></p>
<p>When everything is OK, Reboot the Network (Router, and computer).</p>
<p><strong>* Note</strong> . The Groups and Users shown in the screen-shoot are just an example. Your list will look the way your system is configured.</p>
<p><strong>**Note</strong> . You have to establish specific users. <strong>Everyone</strong> means all of the users that already have an account and been established as users. It does not mean<strong> Everyone</strong> that feel that they would like to login.</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p><strong>***Note.</strong> Some of the processes described above are done Not for Windows sake but to compensate for different Routers and the way their firmware works and stores the info about the computers that are Networked.</p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />Anything popping up or calling your phone claiming to have found errors or problems with your computer is always a scam. Microsoft will never do this kind of thing, and will never send you unsolicited communication asking you to download anything or log into anything.
<br />
<br />Please don't download anything or provide any personal information or payment. You'll need to scan your computer with the following:

<br />
<br />After doing so, the popups should be gone. Please let me know if you need further assistance! Thanks!

            Hi Elsie.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Not only would I ignore the scam message, but I'd also uninstall any McAfee you have onboard.  No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends Avast, AVG. Norton or McAfee, but we do solve problems by having them uninstalled.
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners.

<p>You need to purchase DVD authoring software. Note: The video DVD standard was created in the late 1990s and doesn't support HD video. You will be "down-rezzing" the video to a maximum of 720 x 480p (NTSC).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft used to provide a program called Windows DVD Maker in Windows 7, but they stopped including it in later versions of Windows, considering it a "legacy" format, much like Apple did when they stopped shipping iDVD with their iLife suite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a Blu-ray player or a modern game console? If so, you should be able to burn the .mp4 file onto a disk and have it play as a data DVD. And it will be in HD format.</p>

<p>If you have Windows DVD Maker on Windows 7, then why not use that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's nothing else available from Microsoft; I don't have any recommendations but I'm sure you can find reviews of various DVD authoring utilities. Remember the result is limited in its resolution because of the limitations of the video DVD format.</p>

<p>Windows DVD Maker won't be present in Windows 10. So if you have it, and want to continue using it, stick with Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why Windows 10 Is not allowing me to upgrade my drivers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since i downloaded Windows 10 i had many proplems trying to play video games... and of course.. the most commen fix is to upgrade your graphics card... however here is a list of things that i don't really understand why it's happeing..</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Windows 10 downgraded my OpenGL from 2 to 1 (1 is an older verison of OpenGL and all games needs at less OpenGL 2.0 to run and of course to make the windows intrface run smooth with no lag)</p>
<p>-While Upgrading my graphics card it always says 'already updated'</p>
<p>-Windows 10 keeps replacing blocking me from updating my drivers by trying to use 'have disk' command from the updates list on the update driver window (It used to work for me when i had my win8.1 and 7 when i had the same proplem of 'already updated' but
 now win10 is blocking me from updating/downgrading my drivers)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to update/force update my drivers or at less upgrading my OpenGL again?</p>

<p>i did try to use compatibility mode but it always says "This computer does not meet the minimum requirements" or "This Operating system isn't supported" (Just like when i try to use the .exe setup files without using compatibility mode</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to installing drivers from the Device manager , it always tell me that i have already installed the latest driver (and i have already tried over 4 different updates for my driver.. new and old.. and it still says the same thing(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Lenovo Thinkpad (i don't know whats the module number of my laptop)</p>
<p>And my graphics driver is Mobile Intel 4 series express chipset family (Yes.. i know it's abit old but it used to run for me on Windows 7 and 8.1 smoothly with OpenGL 2.0 and no lag on alot of games)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my driver is too old for win10 then why didn't the Get Windows 10 window tell me that i need a better laptop? (When upgrading your windows from &nbsp;7/8 to 10 it always checks if you have a good laptop that can run win10 , if you have an old driver or not
 enough space or ram it tells you that you need a better laptop and of course it doesn't allow you to upgrade to windows 10)&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not.. then is there another way to update my drivers (or at less getting back OpenGL 2.0 instead of 1.0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>and yes.. if you are going to suggest these options then i have already tried them :</p>
<p>-I did try using Intel's app to update my drivers and it didn't find any drivers.. (which is extremely wired..)</p>
<p>-I did try using other apps that updates drivers and all of them say that i already have the latest drivers..</p>
<p>-I did try uninstalling my drivers and reinstalling it&nbsp;</p>
<p>-I did try using old drivers to install (like i said before..)</p>
<p>-And of course.. i did try windows updates and it told me that there is no new updates..</p>

            <p>same here i had 2.1 OpenGL then when i came back to windows installed windows 10. i couldn't upgrade to 2.1 OpenGL even tho my small gpu was on the list it would not upgrade say 1.1 is up to date. Now i'm have to dual boot into Linux to use 2.1 OpenGL again
 for my 3D Graphic Designs. I wish we could just install the drivers ourselves.</p>
