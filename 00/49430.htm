<h2>            Windows not activated after reset</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning, I reset my Windows 10 PC, but after the reset it was no longer activated. I've already contacted the Help Desk via the "Contact Support" app, but the solutions offered didn't work and advanced tech support wasn't available because they were
 all busy, so I thought I'd post it here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll start off with giving a brief history of my PC, so you understand everything well.</p>
<ul>
<li>I bought my desktop with 32-bit Windows 7 Home Premium on it. I still have that product key.</li><li>A few years after I bought my PC, someone helped me to upgrade it to 64-bit Windows 8.1 Pro. A new product key was used for that, but&nbsp;I can't find that one anymore.</li><li>Last January, I enrolled in the Windows 10 Pro&nbsp;Technical Preview. Last spring, I've reset my PC a number of times, but I've had no activation issues back then.</li><li>This morning, I reset my PC (which is on build 10547) again, but then all of a sudden Windows couldn't activate. It gave error code 0x8004FC12.</li></ul>
<p>Because I couldn't find much info on that error code online, I contacted support. They gave a number of solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, they offered me a product key which I could try. That one didn't work though and I got a different error code (which I don't remember).</li><li>As I said, they were very busy and the waiting times were long, so I searched for that different error code and found a post on these forums with a few cmd commands. As it worked for the one who posted the question, I ran those commands as well. All they
 did was deleting the Win8.1 Pro product key entirely from my machine. The product key which the support guy gave me still&nbsp;didn't work.</li><li>The support guy said I should try to contact them later, when hopefully the advanced support people would be available.</li><li>A few hours later, I contacted them again and I got somebody else on chat. He said I could download the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool and use the Windows 7 Home Premium product key to get Windows 10 Home on my PC (with which I'm fine - I don't necessarily
 need the Pro version). I tried that, but the tool wouldn't accept my product key.</li></ul>
<p>After that, I tried to download a Windows 7 ISO from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> (to install Win7 and then upgrade to Win10 manually) but that site wouldn't accept my product key, saying that it belonged to software that was installed by the manufacturer of my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do? To recap: I've got a Windows 7 Home Premium 32-bit key and I don't mind going to Windows 10 Home instead of Windows 10 Pro. I can't seem to find a way to do that, though. All help is appreciated.</p>

            <p>I suspected that the upgrader would not be able to find the digital entitlement data in the firmware. &nbsp;It will make no difference whether you use media. &nbsp;Something corrupted the digital entitlement data. &nbsp;Your copy of Windows 10 doesn't use a product key.
 &nbsp;It uses the new activation technology, digital entitlement. &nbsp;The only product keys that work are retail and special program keys. &nbsp;The Get Windows 10 upgrades are a general program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Genuine Windows page is looking for a product key to see if you are using a blocked key. &nbsp;It also checks for known activation hacks. &nbsp;It may not be able to check digital entitlements yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the Windows 7 Media Creation Tool is simply the Microsoft Store tool and is set to only create media for retail product keys. &nbsp;The reason is that the Microsoft Store assumed customers with OEM product keys needed to contact the OEM for
 recovery media to restore the computer to factory condition. &nbsp;Of course there are other scenarios where a user might need Windows 7 media. &nbsp;The MC Tool for 8.1 corrected this mistake by making downloads available to anyone who wants one. &nbsp;The Windows 10 MC
 Tool continues the broader view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the product key you have is from the sticker affixed to the computer then it should work with Windows 7 Home Premium installatin media. &nbsp;The trick is to find one. &nbsp;Call your local computer shops to see if they can make a copy of one for you. &nbsp;Then you
 can recover to Windows 7 Home Premium and upgrade again to Windows 10 Home. &nbsp;The shop needs to have a RETAIL dvd of Windows 10 Home, although if all else fails you can try whatever copy of Windows 7 Home Premium they can make for you. &nbsp;Copies of OEM dvds may
 or may not work. &nbsp;It varies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you recover to Windows 7 HP you do not need to do any updates, not even Service Pack 1. &nbsp;You can use the Windows 10 MC Tool and upgrade to 10. &nbsp;The business about updates only applies if you want to use the Get Windows 10 icon on the taskbar because
 that requires a particular update before the icon will appear.</p>

<h2>            WHY DOES THE DELL 2335DN Printer NOT PRINT ON BOTH SIDES IN WINDOWS 8</h2>
                    I have a Dell multifunction laser printer (2335dn) that always printed on both sides of the paper until I switched to Windows 8. Now it just prints on one side. Has anyone found a solution to this problem?

            <p>There are Windows 8 Drivers for Dell 2335dn Multifunctional Laser Printer here:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume you have installed these, also check in the settings for your printer in Windows 8 that Duplexing is on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. if you need more help with this printer, you are best to make a new post on the Dell Community Forums/Printers Forum:</p>

    <title>Message on Screen after creating bootable WIn 10 USB flash drive using - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sportsfan_881  say:</h3>
<h2>            Message on Screen after creating bootable WIn 10 USB flash drive using Media Creation Tool&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I created a Windows 10 bootable USB flash drive using the instructions on this site. After the download finshed, it verified and then created the Windows 10 installation media. The next screen was Your USB Flash Drive is Ready so I clicked on the Finish tab.
 A screen then showed briefly saying something along the lines of Cleaning Up Files...This may take several minutes. After five seconds the screen disappeared. Are you supposed to remove the USB flash drive as soon as that screen has disappeared or are you
 supposed to wait several minutes to see if another screen comes up to say the Clean up of files process has finished? I wasn't sure what to do? Has everybody else seen this Cleaning Up files screen?<br />
Thanks

            No, you don't have to remove it, what its cleaning up are temporary files stored on the drive. The install files for Windows 10 are stored temporarily on the local disk when prepping the USB media.<br />

<p>Hi Andre, Sorry I worded my question poorly. What I meant to say was..Is it safe to remove the USB flash drive immediately as soon as you've had the message saying your USB flash drive is Ready and you've clicked on Finish? (I always use Safely Remove Hardware
 for my flash drives)</p>
<p>Or are you supposed to wait the several minutes that the message says the Clean up files procedure might take. That message screen only remained visible for about five seconds and then it disappeared ( Because the screen had disappeared I wondered if the
 clean up was finished). Also, Are you supposed to get a message to inform you when the file clean up process has finished?..because I didn't get any message.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>the "safely remove hardware" will tell you if the drive is still in use. it is safe to remove while the clean up is occurring.</p>
<p>the clean up takes very little time and is cleaning temporary files from your HDD, I have not seen a message on completion.</p>

            <p>You don't really need to uninstall your old printer, but if you want to do so, first go to Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features and uninstall any software related to the old printer.&nbsp; Then click the Start Orb, go to Devices and Printers, right-click on
 the icon for your old printer, and select "Remove device."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your new printer should have come with installation instructions.&nbsp; If you don't understand those instructions, please provide the specific printer model you purchased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Briefly, if you are going to connect the printer to the computer using a USB cable, make sure that your computer is connected to the Internet, then connect the printer to the computer, and turn on the printer.&nbsp; Windows should detect your printer and automatically
 install it.&nbsp; If Windows asks for permission to look in Windows Update for a printer driver, allow that to happen (that's why you need to be connected to the Internet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process described in the preceding paragraph does not, of course, install all of the
<del>junk</del> software that HP bundles with its printers.&nbsp; If you feel the need for such software, then follow the installation instructions that come with your printer.&nbsp; Generally, this requires that you first insert a CD into your computer and then follow
 on-screen instructions until requested to connect your printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are going to connect the printer using wifi, then it is far simpler and easier to use the CD accompanying your printer to do the installation than to install the printer manually.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Devices and Printers - right click on the one you want to remove and&nbsp;select Remove Device. For software Control Panel -&nbsp;Programs and Features - look for any HP printer related software that might be installed.<br />

    <title>BT Homehub 4 Open NAT Solution&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dee dah dave  say:</h3>
<h2>            BT Homehub 4 Open NAT Solution&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>This guide is for the Homehub 4 but should help with other routers too.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Okay I'm going to presume you know your way around your router settings a little bit and get straight to the point. I suggest having your xbox switched on and logging into your router with a PC or other device. First we want to make sure a few settings are
 in place.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Go to advanced settings &gt; home network &gt; devices. Your xbox should be one of the listed connections, click on it. Down at the bottom it will say "Always use this IP Address". Make sure no is selected and click apply.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Go to advanced settings &gt;Firewall &gt; UPnP. Make sure both "UPnP" and "Extended UPnP Security" are set to yes and click apply.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Go to advanced settings &gt; Firewall &gt; DMZ. Make sure "DMZ Enable" is set to no and click apply.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Go to advanced settings &gt; Firewall &gt; Port Forwarding. Click on "Add new game or Application". In the top box call it "My Xbox Live Manual Port Forward".</p>
<p>Copy and existing game/application choose no.</p>
<p>Now you want to add the following protocols and ports. Do each of the following clicking add after each . The translate to boxes can be left blank -</p>
<p>- Protocol UDP Port Range 88 - 88</p>
<p>- Protocol UDP Port Range 3074 - 3074</p>
<p>- Protocol TCP Port Range 3074 - 3074</p>
<p>- Protocol UDP Port Range 53 - 53</p>
<p>- Protocol TCP Port Range 53 - 53</p>
<p>- Protocol TCP Port Range 80 - 80</p>
<p>- Protocol UDP Port Range 500 - 500</p>
<p>- Protocol UDP Port Range 3544 - 3544</p>
<p>- Protocol UDP Port Range 4500 - 4500</p>
<p>Click apply. Click "back to Port Forwarding". In the "Game or Application" dropbox select your newly created "My Xbox Live Manual Port Forward". In the "Device" dropbox select your xbox. Click add. Click apply.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Go to Advanced Settings &gt; System &gt; Restart. Click "Restart My BT Home Hub". Wait a few minutes for the router to properly start back up. You can now close the window and exit out of your router settings.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Go back to your Xbox. Go to Settings &gt; Network &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Alternate MAC Address &gt; Clear &gt; Restart</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Your Xbox will do a full shutdown and restart which will take a minute or two. When back on go to Settings &gt; Network &gt; Test Multiplayer Connection, all should be good.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>You should now have an open NAT.</p>

<p>No problem glad I could help.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>To be clear though nobody should have to mess around like this these days with modern routers. UPnP should take care of things automatically.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I suspect there are problems with the network hardware inside the Xbox having issues talking to certain routers. Also there may be teething problems with the new Xbox Live at Microsoft's end. Hopefully these problems should go away as updates and such are
 applied.</p>

<p>You can add ports on home hub 5. Go to port forwarding, then manage games and apps, then add game or app. Then use ports as described above</p>

<p>Thanks kendo88, I presumed that would be the case. I don't have the Home Hub 5 but I'm sure the settings available on it are more or less identical to the HH4. Mobb Wales please don't spread misinformation on help forums, when people are having issues it
 just confuses matters even further. Peace.</p>

<p>Yes, Captain Ninty, I have tiles. I got around that problem using the sign in on internet explorer. I have Moderate NAT still though and also my Netflix often disconnects for no reason. Works perfectly on my 360. Very confusing.</p>

<p>Moi aussi, mais en hollandais.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Me too, but for the Dutch language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The change from Wordament to MUWG was somewhat abrupt. Lots of Dutch friends. Microsoft Wordament supported 10's of languages. And out of the blue Microsoft decided to stick with a meager 5. After 3 years nothing has changed. Weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>...yes, yes, Microsoft, I've already gone to the community to comment on this matter, but I think it is important to mention it here as I think the lack of language support is a relevant problem to adress which unfortuantely after more than 3 years, still
 is not adressed. That's odd come from one game to another with such a contrast in language support, Whilst MUWG is the follow-up to wordament. The change is, let's say, profound, to say the least. Things have been quiet with gameplay with friends ever since,
 simply due a lack of language support.</p>

<h2>            PST Outlook file backup fails</h2>
                    <p>I never had this problem before. Now I bought a SURFACE i5 LAPTOP with WINDOWS 10 PRO and my backup software (NETBAK Replicator) can't backup the PST file. The cause, NETBAK says, is "file is open by another app/software".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Volume Shadow Copy service is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem makes me close Outlook everyday, otherwise no backup. The strangest thing is that this was never an issue before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody please help me?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance,</p>

            Hello Manuel,<br />
<br />
Using a 3rd party software may sometimes cause errors due to compatibility issues. We suggest that you try backing up your PST files using the steps provided on this article:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/287070/how-to-manage--pst-files-in-microsoft-outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to manage .pst files in Microsoft Outlook</a></strong> and refer to the section
<strong>How to make a backup copy of a .pst file</strong>.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you will need further assistance.

<p>Hello John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, many thanks for trying to help me. Unfortunately you didn't because I didn't find any info about allowing the PST file copy when OUTLOOK is running.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This wasn't a problem until two or three weeks ago. I can't tell if this problem arose after I upgraded from OFFICE2013 to 2016. Like I told I bought a SURFACE LAPTOP and OFFICE2016. I would say that even with 2016 I was able to backup with OUTLOOK running
 but I can't confirm that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any change in OS or OFFICE that can cause this? The backup software wasn't modified for months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could help me further on this annoying problem (it makes me backing up many times as I tend to forget if I did it or not... :-( ) it would be very good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Manuel</p>

<h2>            The display flashes black on and off before welcome screen and will not load further - Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've been having this problem for two days now working pretty much solidly trying to fix it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem is after booting (which goes fine) and after the 'Loading Windows' splash screen, the welcome screen is just about to load but then the screen starts going on and off. After generally 2 flashes the screen goes completely black, however the
 monitor is still on. Then the monitor cycles being on and off showing a black image with the mouse pointer in the middle&nbsp;indefinitely.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did install a graphics card driver before this happened and have since rolled it back but this has changed nothing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The things which I have done to check are working/change have been:</div>
<div>Screen is operational</div>
<div>Graphics card + drivers should be working</div>
<div>Checked working status of disks and memory; all fine</div>
<div>Did system restore to&nbsp;earliest&nbsp;point possible, nothing changed. System said that there was no difference made after completing.</div>
<div>System repair stated nothing is damaged</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>System stats:</div>
<div>Windows 7 Service Pack 1 32-Bit</div>
<div>Intel Core 2 1.86GHz</div>
<div>4GB RAM</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any advice which I haven't done yet is welcome.</div>
                </div>

            No that didn't help, though after I posted the question I thought the drivers might have something to do with it, so went into msconfig.exe and turned off all non-system drivers and that did the trick.

<h3> garydevaan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t install windows 10 mobile on my Lumina Icon 929</h2>
                    <p>I've been doing this for 2 days, I installed the upgrade advisor and waited patiently until it told me that the Windows 10 upgrade was available for my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I check for updates, the upgrade downloads, and prepares for installation, but after the gears turn for about 2/3 of the bar, about 15 min, it reboots. But when the phone comes back I get the error Can't update phone... (0x80070070) and I still have
 Lumina Denim as an OS, and it immediately starts downloading the upgrade again without my doing anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said it has been in this loop for 2 days and I'm not sure how to get out of it. I would like to run Windows 10 on this phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to be clear my phone is a Verizon&nbsp;Lumina Icon 929 single sim. I also have 12GB of free space.</p>

<strong>hard reset</strong> and reinstalling apps and syncing data. Now I get a new error 0x80070002. I now have 23.5 GB of free space.

            So I have now tried to reset the phone (hard reset) without updating anything else. The only app I download is upgrade advisor and now it says there is no upgrade available to windows 10. You guys must still be working on it. Please post when it is available
 again.

            <p>I wound up taking my Nokia Icon to the windows store where they reinstalled the latest windows 8.1 ( I thought I had that) and with that the windows 10 update worked using the upgrade advisor app and update in the settings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other thing I have to say about this process is that the support forum must be understaffed or they don't know what to do since I basically figured this out by myself with no usable help from this forum.</p>

<p>Oh man. I HAVE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM! With other games of course. Unfortunately, I have some bad news- the most likely case is that it's not Microsoft messing up, but instead your console. This happened to me when Gears of War 3 came out, it wouldn't ever
 play on my console and I had bought it limited edition brand spanking new. It played on my brother's fancy new box (mine was over 3 years old and saw 2 naval deployments overseas) and I thought it was some new-fangled labeling and disc writing done by Microsoft
 to force me to buy a new console.</p>
<p>I waited until Mass Effect 3 came out (months later). When that game didn't play, I flipped out and almost broke my console. Instead, I took it to one of my local console repair shops. What I found out was that my disc drive was on the way out. One replacement
 drive later, I could play everything. I even got rid of the horribly audible disc reading sound that made me feel my Xbox was devouring my games.
</p>
<p>Run your copy of Halo 4 on a friend's console. If it works, take/send your box in for repairs, it might need it.

<p>Dude, I'm pretty sure it's not our console. That's basically saying that the hundreds of people who also have the halo 4 disc unreadable issue has a messed up xbox. If the that one game isn't working and the others are, then it's the game itself. But yeah,
 they should atleast say that they're still working on the problem so we wouldn't be left scratching out heads wondering if they're even aware of the issue.</p>

<p>If the game starts with the hard drive removed, then power off the console, remove the hard drive, reinsert the hard drive and after try the game again.</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Removing any other memory units or USB flash drives<br />
&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If removing one of these resolves the issue, then power down the console and try again with the drive reattached. If the game doesn’t work only with the device in question attached, it will have to be replaced (or if it’s a USB, reformatted).<br />

<p>Let us know if those steps help out the disc read issue with Halo 4.</p>

<p>I have that problem now along with a list full of console probs....ever since I got 3 red rings of death and got it fixed it hasn't been able to play a single halo game..it would load but not start the game even though all 20 games I bought in 2 years still
 work...oh end of this years marks my 3rd year of having 360 generation 1. &nbsp;I pretty much gave up on finding answers to my current prob cause there's no solution....and buying another console is out of the question since it'd be pointless. &nbsp;My PS3 is older
 and it's still running like its new. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Installing the game into your HDD is the best way to combat this.</p>
<p><strong>How to install games to your Hard drive:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Insert the game disc into your console. </li><li>Press the <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>X</strong></span> button to bring up the Game Details.
</li><li>Select Install. </li></ul>
<div>Please note that you must have 7,3GB of space to install Halo 4 to your Hard Drive, as well as 8GB of data for Halo Infinity Multiplayer and Spartan Ops (Found on Disc 2)</div>
<div>I hope this helped!</div>

<p>Dear Mr. Parks,</p>
<p>I've been having similar problems with my Halo 4 game disk. When I first purchased it, the game loaded to the main screen just fine. In fact, it even played the Prologue. However, that's when the problems began. Once the Prologue completed I was bumped back
 to the main menu instead of loading the first level. I then tried to select the first level from the campaign menu and start from there. It begun to load the level and then failed, giving me an in-game error message stating that it had failed to load the content.
 At this point I tried to play the multi-player portion of the game. I installed disk 2 with no issues. I was then able to load into matchmaking and start a match. At this point the game audio was absent. I still had audio from the Xbox (which was evident by
 hitting the center button and bringing up the Xbox menu while in game) but no game audio. I then decided to attempt installing game disk 1. It would not even get beyond 0% installed before giving me an error message telling me that the disk was unreadable
 and that I should attempt cleaning it. The disk was brand new and had no dust or scratches whatsoever. At this point I returned the disk for a replacement at my local BestBuy. Once home I put in the new disk and found that I was having the same problem as
 with the first. </p>
<p>I've tried your above advice to the letter and have had absolutely no success. Even after having cleared the system cache and even with the hard drive removed it still will not load the game past the Prologue. I will try exchanging the game once more today
 but I'm all out of ideas and options. Every other game I own works just fine on my console and I was playing Mass Effect 3 for hours last night with no issues. Please tell me what I can do to remedy this situation.</p>

<p>Hey there Smoothy007,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that my steps didn't help you out. Were you also able to try those discs in a different Xbox 360, like a friend's maybe? There can sometimes be an issue with the discs themselves.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried a <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
download of your profile to your console</a>? That helped me with a Halo 4 issue I had when I got it, but my issue was after I was in the game, but it might help you out.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you could also share with us the files you see in Settings&gt;System&gt;Storage&gt;hard drive&gt;Games and Apps&gt;Halo 4, there might be something there that we can delete, and re-download that may help.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know, and we'll continue to help you out.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hey Mister Parks,</p>
<p>Sadly, I recently moved to a new city so I don't have any friends with Xboxs to try using my disk in.
</p>
<p>Tonight is the first time I've been online this week and when I first launched Halo 4 it installed a 30MB game update. Sadly, that did not fix the errors I am having.</p>
<p>I re-downloaded my profile as you recommended however that didn't change anything. I'm still unable to load the first level of the campaign and get the same error message when attempting to do so. I also am still unable to install the first disk and get
 the same error message as before. </p>
<p>At this point I only have two Halo 4 game files. They are "Halo 4 Data: Saved Game" and "Halo 4 Title Update."
</p>
<p>Let me know what else I can try. I really appreciate that you've taken the time to respond to me on this issue. Thanks.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            18 Failed Installations &#40;so far&#41;</h2>
                    <p>To start:</p>
<p>My laptop is a Dell Latitude D810. running Windows 7, 32 bit. (ancient, like me)</p>
<p>Purchased on Amazon (refurbished - maybe XP when manufactured)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reserved my copy of Windows 10 when prompted, and downloaded all the pre-updates required.</p>
<p>Windows update has&nbsp;tried to install&nbsp;&nbsp;(Windows 10)- 18 times in 5 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows upgrade icon on the Taskbar states:</p>
<p>ATI MOBILITY RADEON X600 display not compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK - I get it !!</p>
<p>No display upgrade is available - as far as I can tell on Google search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I (safely) STOP future Windows update failed installtions ???</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>pc-dummy911</p>

 get rid of this thing. I have more important things to do other than trying to rid myself of this Narrator "tool". I shouldn't have to work with my speakers off and an orange box around the text on my screen!!!!</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For your requirement, you want to arrange the desktop icons. I suggest that you take the following steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.Vevify that you uncheck Auto Arrange item. The steps are as follow.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1)Right click the desktop.</span></p>
<p><span>2)Click View.</span></p>
<p><span>3)Uncheck Auto Arrange.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Arrange the desktop icons as you prefer, then restart the computer, and see if the icons go back to the default location.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.The reason why you can't arrange icons can be related to Thumbnails view option. To work arroun this issue, change the current view on the View menu, arrange
 the icons, and then change back to the Thumbnails view option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If neither of above works, please continue the step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3.I would like to propose a solution on Registry. Please following the steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1)Arrange your desktop icons as you like.</span></p>
<p><span>2)Press 'WIN + R'.</span></p>
<p><span>3)Type: regedit, then press 'ENTER'.</span></p>
<p><span>4)Locate to the Auto Arrange item: [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Bags\1\Desktop]</span></p>
<p><span>5)Export the item as 'backup.reg'.</span></p>
<p><span>6)Find 'FFlags' in the right panel.</span></p>
<p><span>7)Double click the 'FFlags', and set the value to 00000220.</span></p>
<p><span>8)Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>9)See if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, please respond back and let me know.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

 any checks that might be in there.</span></p>

    <title>Blue Screen and Apple Bonjour - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mlassiter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen and Apple Bonjour</h2>
                    I have Win7 Home Premium. I purchased an IPAD2 and, to get WiFi support in my house, I decided to also replace my modem with a modem/router (Linksys X2000).&nbsp; In connecting the IPAD2, the ITunes updated itself.&nbsp; Ever since then (3 days ago), wheny I re-boot
 in the morning, I get a BSOD.&nbsp; The Event Viewer shows the "Event ID 41" (the BSOD) and just before that happens I see many, many errors of "Bonjour Service" which is, of course, part of the Apple ITunes support.&nbsp; I am guessing that it is due to the execution
 of the program mDNSResponder.exe in "Bonjour".&nbsp; Is this a known problem?&nbsp; And, if I simply delete this program, will that solve my problem?&nbsp; Or should I delete the whole "Bonjour" program?<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Yes the program mDNSResponder.exe has been responsible for system crashes on particular computers due to compatibility issues and conflicts with security programs.</div>
<div>Please follow the links mentioned below to help troubleshoot the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Boot in to safe mode with networking and check if the issue repeats itself.</div>
<div><strong>Note: </strong>Safe mode with networking will not connect to internet wirelessly, in a wireless connection is used.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Start your computer in safe mode.</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Check if the issue is caused by third party software conflicts.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>by performing clean boot any all third party program running in the background will be disabled include 'Bonjour' and you can identify&nbsp;the cause of the issue.

<div><strong>Note: </strong>Please follow step 7 from the article mentioned above to start the computer in normal start up once you complete all the necessary troubleshooting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3</strong></div>

            Thanks for the tips.&nbsp; In prior years I have used "Booting in Safe mode" and "msconfig.exe" to find the cause of a BSOD on a different PC with Win7.&nbsp; It will take me some to use these tools to diagnose the current problem. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
In the meantime, can you answer a question for me?&nbsp; What is the logical difference in "Booting in Safe mode" and using msconfig.exe to disable everything in the tabs "Services" and "Startup".&nbsp; I know that "Booting in Safe mode" certainly appears different on
 the screen but the logic seems to be the same.<br />

            <p>Some third party drivers can not be disabled using&nbsp; "msconfig.exe" but&nbsp; are disabled when&nbsp; "Booting in Safe mode"</p>
<p>One thing, It may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.<br />

            I compressed the C: drive, got a little over 4 Gb total free after that, and then restarted the update. &nbsp;I'm waiting for the agonizingly slow download to finish and see what happens. &nbsp;I think I can squeeze the required space out of the machine by removing
 one more large application.

            <p>I wasn't sure why you said to disconnect all SD cards and flash drives. &nbsp;I'm still not sure what that would have to do with anything. One thing, though, I wish I had disconnected my SD card. The Windows 10 November upgrade totally destroyed all the data
 on it. &nbsp;My few documents, a few pictures and an attempt to download a &nbsp;movie from Microsoft Store. After the "successful" upgrade, I had to totally reformat the SD card in order to use it.</p>
<p>On another topic: The upgrade also lost all of my Edge browser settings such as favorites bar, favorites and start up page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On yet another topic: The upgrade destroyed my Facebook app, and now when I start it; it stays for a moment or two and then disappears. I have to get to Facebook via the browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure what else was obliterated in this upgrade. &nbsp;Every two months we have to do this? &nbsp;I guess MS is finally truly insane.</p>

</p><blockquote>I got a message that the November update failed on my HP Pavilion X2 that I bought last year from Microsoft. The failure was because the update requires 4.67 Gb of disk space on drive C: &nbsp;Of course, it only has a 32 GB drive,
 and if I remove ALL of the programs and ALL of my AppData folders, I could barely get the required 4.69 Gb that the update requires. &nbsp;I did the disk cleanup and only recovered 433 Mb. I did a system cleanup and recovered about 200 Mb. &nbsp;Basically, I recovered
 nothing close to what is required for the update. When I got the error message, it appeared to give me a choice of using the D: drive which has 22.5 Gb of free space. (It said I only needed 10 Gb.) So, I checked that box and then got a message saying that
 I needed 4.67 Gb on &nbsp;drive C: and that the 10 Gb on drive D: only was for recovering in case the update didn't work. So, the question is: &nbsp;Do I have a bricked Pavilion X2? &nbsp;It appears to me that there is no possibility for me to do any more updates/upgrades
 with that PC. &nbsp;If indeed it is a bricked PC, is my best bet to go with Linux and forget Microsoft altogether. I have four more PCs that are supposed to go to Windows 10. &nbsp;One of them has a Hauppauge TV card in it and requires Media Center, which Microsoft
 dropped altogether. &nbsp;I cannot possibly upgrade that from 8.1 to 10, because Windows 10 does not have Media Center or any replacement for it. Back to the question for this posting: &nbsp;1) What am I supposed to do about the November Update given that I only have
 2.09 Gb free space on Drive C: &nbsp;2) Would Microsoft advise me to convert to Linux and forget Windows 10 altogether? (I'm quite familiar with Ubuntu and can switch in a flash--well maybe a couple of hours. &nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 8 Laptop won&#39;t restart, keeps on circling.</h2>
                    When I restart my computer, it never does. It justs keeps circling forever. Only way to stop is to manually hold down power button. It is a fairly new laptop. Started a day or two ago when the Windows Update wouldn't finish (Was a blank screen with the
 circle on the side) so I had to manually power it off. I reopened it after and it finished&nbsp;configuring&nbsp;the updates. Could anyone help?

Since it is new check with the System Maker's Support, their on-line documentation and<br />
drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues. As OEM the System Maker is<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Definitely check with the System Maker's Support since it is a new computer.<br />
<br />
Did you check the "Windows hangs or freezes" link and the "Windows failed to start" as posted in<br />
the last reply?<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Well automatic repair would be the first thing I would try of the two and it could take from 15
<br />
minutes to hours.<br />
<br />
A refresh is essentially a re-install of Windows while keeping your files and settings. You will<br />
need to re-install the programs. And redundant backups of your data off the main drive is<br />
always a good idea. It can also take hours.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<div>Btw the links didn't apply to me, I didnt get the error message. I have some updates but it says you may have to restart after updating so I'm afraid it'll mess up since I have to manually power off.</div>

            I think there is some misunderstanding here.&nbsp; There are two MS accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am keeping the one I have had for years and want to get rid of the other MS account which I created accidentally and it is still there on the start-up screen but not among the
 accounts in Settings.&nbsp; I think that I might have accidentally created it while setting up my new Sansung Galaxy Tab A, so I may have to reset the tablet to factory defaults to get rid of the unwanted MS account which does not even have password or PIN.

<p>
</p><p>Every time I boot up, I am immediately taken to the accidental account log-in screen, and it disconnects from the internet.&nbsp; I have to click OK which then allows me to change the log-in screen to the right account and then have to connect to the Internet

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error may occur from corruptions with Wlanapi DLL file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since some Wlanapi.dll files can be associated with malware infections, we recommend running a full antivirus scan using Windows Defender or your antivirus program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also boot your PC in safe mode since the error may restrict or limit you from complete PC access. Click

            &nbsp;I was on safe mode, got to update driver and it said it was up to date and then when I got to system file checker I got "Resource protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some" and then I tried DISM/ online/ cleanup-image/ Restorehealth" which
 just gave me "the source files could not be downloaded, use the "source" option to specify the location of the files....etc."
