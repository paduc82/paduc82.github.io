<p>Hi Nita,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows.old folder is created mostly when a user upgrader from lower versions of Windows or if they have set a restore point to go back if they needed. However, once this folder is deleted, you will never be able to restore it or use it to go back to
 your previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Frequent BSOD&#39;s</h2>
                    <p>We are frequently seeing BSOD's from several laptops. I've been trying to figure out what the problem is but haven't gotten very far. It's happens on several Laptop Models and brands (Lenovo,Microsoft), all of which I have fully updated the drivers. Would
 anybody be able to help analyze the minidump? I'll link to it below.</p>

<h2>            Skype online duplicated itself</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Skype online and I used to sign in with facebook, when that changed, I had to manually type in my email and password to get into skype, where as usually it would just say 'sign in with facebook'. So when skype online changed, I logged in with my
 email and password I use for facebook and it was a new skype, my old skype was gone but I added it and it seems its still there, I want to log into it and get access to it and delete the one I'm on now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me get back into my old skype, keeping in mind I used to the same email and password to access both.</p>
<p>

</p><p>You can no longer login to Skype via Facebook as of January 2018. All Skype logins have been streamlined to Microsoft accounts, allowing you to login with a single sign-in, unlocking all your Microsoft services ‚Äì including Skype, Office Online, Outlook,
 OneNote, OneDrive, and more ‚Äì in one experience, with just one password.&nbsp;To continue using Skype, either create a new Microsoft account or sign in with an existing Microsoft account if you already have one.&nbsp;

            <p>There is no such thing as a " max use limit" (other than being in use on only one computer at a time) for a WinXP Product Key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's no limit to the number of times you can reinstall and activate the same WinXP license on the same PC.&nbsp; Nor is there ever a charge.&nbsp; Nor does a Product Key (so long as it's not an evaluation license) ever expire.&nbsp; If it's been more than 120 days&nbsp;
 since you last activated that specific Product Key, you'll most likely be able to activate via the Internet without problem.&nbsp; If it's been less, you might have to make a 5 minute phone call.
<br />

Contact the makers of AutoCAD for assistance. I believe they'll do <br />
nothing more than try to sell you a newer version of AutoCAD, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
If you have Windows 7 Professiona;, Ultimate or Enterprise, you might <br />
be able to install AutoCAD in the WinXP Mode feature.<br />
<br />
The WinXP Mode, which is available only on Windows 7 Professional, <br />
Ultimate, or Enterprise editions, and which requires a computer that <br />
supports hardware virtualization, can be used to create a WinXP virtual <br />
machine upon which one can install legacy applications that simply can't <br />
be made to work with Win7's normal compatibility modes.<br />

    <title>Xbox One Microsoft Store Shipping Nightmare HELP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lspear76  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Microsoft Store Shipping Nightmare HELP</h2>
                    
<p>I pre-ordered on June 13. I no longer live at the address used for the order. I called Microsoft Store up a month ago to change my address to my PO Box that can also receive packages by using the post office's physical address. The guy said my address was
 updated.</p>
<p>I see that my order shipped and it's still been shipped to my old address. No problem, right? Just call UPS to 'hold for pickup' at my local UPS center and pick up my package with my valid ID that shows my old and new PO Box address to confirm my identity.
 I call UPS and they tell me they cannot process a hold for pickup because the shipper put a restriction on it and I have to call Microsoft to remove the restriction.</p>
<p>So I call up the Microsoft Store and talk to a rep I can hardly understand. She finally understands my info and agrees to call UPS to remove the restriction. After being on hold multiple times for over 45 minutes she tells me UPS will not remove the restriction.
 How can this be? Microsoft is the shipper and only they can call UPS to remove the restriction. The whole point of me calling Microsoft is to get them to remove it, yet she calls twice and tells me UPS can't remove it? I know UPS can't remove it for ME but
 since they are Microsoft they should be able to remove the problem.</p>
<p>So I'm at a loss for what to do. I couldn't stay on hold anymore. I got a case ID when I escalated the case to a supervisor at Microsoft. The supervisor told me she would 'try to call UPS to remove the restriction and email me the result.' Are they just
 not calling UPS? Are they incompetent? I call UPS and they tell me to call Microsoft. Microsoft calls UPS and says UPS won't remove the restriction.</p>
<p>HELP.</p>

<p>Microsoft you guys are IDIOTS. Here's the response I just received from UPS.</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out. I completely understand where you are coming from, but Microsoft has restricted any changes to be made to the package. This includes any changes they request to make. I'm very sorry, but we are not able to place this package on
 hold for you. No changes can be made to the delivery.</p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>You trying to pick up the package IS changing the destination. &nbsp;It's most likely for security purposes. &nbsp;They aren't shafting you or giving you a raw deal. &nbsp;You don't think that folks who specialize in stealing info do not know how to get ID's?</p>

<p>I called Microsoft. I have my Microsoft Account ID. Gamertag. New address. Old address. License with old and new address. There's no reason they should not be able to contact UPS and allow me to pick up the package from the local center. They're going to
 deliver my Xbox One to an address I no longer reside at. Their security isn't too great if that happens, right?</p>

            I have a Toshiba laptop that overheats at way too low.&nbsp; Its bios has a setting to maximize battery life which locks the cpu at its slowest speed. &nbsp; After a fresh install all the normal power configurations didn't exist. &nbsp; Starting in Safe mode they showed
 up so I set it there to normal balanced and ticked the cpu to 99% so no turbo boosting. And all was fine. After setting bios back to normal, the high performance mode showed up too.

<h2>            Desktop icons and font changed itself&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I just had a problem where when I booted my computer, all my desktop icons were rearranged and smaller, and all my font was smaller. This includes the time and date at the bottom, as well as things in internet browsers. Everything else is to scale
 though. If it is any help, I have my laptop plugged into my tv through an HDMI cable, but I never had a problem like this before. Any ideas?

 for the first time in nearly 3 months (been busy with school so no time to use FSX), and I am back to square one. The panels appear to work fine using the test software that Logitech have provided. I use the original SPAD because it is free, and I am unwilling
 to pay for software like FSUICP or SPAD.Nxt or whatever it is called. However there is a problem with this program too ; it has always opened as a background process instead of a .exe application. I don‚Äôt think this is the problem with the panels however,
 as it has always been like this and they used to work fine. All I did was double click SPAD to launch it and they turned on. Now, it doesn‚Äôt do anything. I have used all the online solutions to turn SPAD into a .exe application, but nothing works and I can
 not fix that. Anyway, the point is the panels are recognised by the computer as all of the buttons, switches and knobs get a response in the Logitech test software, but apart from that they do not function. When I run my simulator not one switch or button
 on either panel works. Sometimes the multi panel display will glow red but it won‚Äôt show any numbers. I even tried running the sim and then opening SPAD, opening the test software and running the sim, etc but nothing works. I have spent the last couple of
 weeks researching and nothing helps. It‚Äôs not a power issue, because 1. As I said earlier, it used to work fine. My PC is still the same, nothing has changed. 2. I have an Anker 10 port powered USB hub, which has worked fine for the last 6 months. I have tried
 using different ports on the hub and PC itself but nothing works. What I don‚Äôt understand is why it stopped working even though not one thing on my PC has changed. I have even tried cleaning up junk and using anti virus software like Malwarebytes to clean
 my PC and still nothing helps.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Pro Flight Multi Panel and the Pro Flight Switch Panel will not register automatically if you have installed them before installing FSX. I'd suggest you to reinstall the SFX, and try. I'd also suggest you to check the panels by connecting it on another
 computer. You can post your query on <a href="https://logitechsupport.force.com/saitek/s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Sorry but what is the SFX? Also that answer would make sense, because I reinstalled my simulator not too long ago as it needed a big cleanup.

            You said the panels will not work if they are installed before the simulator, so how will reinstalling the simulator help then?

<p>I read through the manuals, and both said this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>‚ÄúThe Pro Flight Switch [or Multi] Panel will not register automatically if you have installed the Pro Flight Switch Panel before installing FSX. To register the Pro Flight Switch Panel with FSX, click on the ‚ÄúLaunch the Flightsim X plugin manually‚Äù icon
 to re-run the program.‚Äù</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means that reinstalling the sim won‚Äôt help, no? Because reinstalling still means that the sim was installed
<em>after </em>the panels, which according to what you said and what the manuals say is the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I am using Logitech drivers because I think Logitech owns Saitek now, so there are no Saitek drivers. If I was to uninstall the panels however, I do not see how I could do this as there is only one driver installed and after searching the Logitech
 site I can no longer find this driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I have put numerous hours into getting addons for my simulator, including payware like ORBX. I would not be willing to reinstall because it would take at least a week until I get everything installed again, and then I would also forget half of the
 stuff I used to have to enhance my simulator.</p>

<h3> carl3977  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Hello and Camera Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 4 and over the past week or so have had some issues with my Windows Hello. I saw from a few forums here that this is a problem with others, however the fixes of uninstalling and reinstalling the program, re-setting up Windows Hello,
 and rolling back the drivers for the program have not helped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now not even able to set up Windows Hello from settings, as it will freeze on the "center your face in the camera" screen following a single blink of a white light near my camera. Prior to deleting the facial recognition information that I had previously
 set up, I was having issues where the camera "could not turn on".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are my next steps to fixing my issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Carl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There could be a number of reasons why such problem occurs. It is best to install all available

<p>We're glad to hear that everything is updated. By the way, may we know if you added any programs on your device prior to the issue? If so, please try to uninstall it. And check if Windows Hello will work again after uninstalling the program.

    <title>Wireless Logitech Mouse not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ck_129  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless Logitech Mouse not working</h2>
                    <p>I just solved my mouse problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Two days ago my logitech wireless keyboard and mouse stopped working.&nbsp; I have a backup set which also did not work so I knew it was not the hardware.&nbsp; I noticed my driver list had errors USB Receiver Code 28.&nbsp; I have an
 HP so I loaded all the latest BIOS firmware, patches, et all.&nbsp; Not a fix.&nbsp; I saw a Microsoft Update occurred midnight for me on 2/18, I tried to go back to the restore point.&nbsp; Not a fix.&nbsp; Then I went into the most recent updates, ignored all of the office
 updates and uninstalled the most recent update for windows, not the security update.&nbsp; That fixed the problem.&nbsp; This was hard to solve without a mouse by the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this will save you some headaches and the Microsoft patch people will pick up on this.&nbsp; I have temporarily paused updates which is not a great idea.&nbsp; My system had little security threat concerns when I could not really use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Window/X&nbsp; Settings&nbsp; Updates and Security&nbsp; View installed update history&nbsp; Scroll down until you see it&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uninstall reboot, use your mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes.</p>

<p>I am using a logitech wired use keyboard and use mouse on a USB switch, which worked fine before Feb 20, 2018.&nbsp; On Feb 20, I booted up the machine and had no keyboard or mouse.</p>
<p>I switched to other systems using the same USB keyboard and mouse with no problems execpt on my main system.</p>
<p>Checked recent fixes and the only change was "WayTech - Input - Office Keyboard" applied on Feb 20, 2018.</p>
<p>If I unplug the keyboard and mouse from the switch and directly connect to USB ports, they still do not work.</p>
<p>Checking the Hardware/devices it appears a driver cannot be found Code 28.</p>
<p>I had to use a different USB keyboard and hook an old fashion Mouse to the Green plug in the back to get a working mouse.&nbsp; Seems like the problem is with Logitech devices, since I can use a USB Dynex keyboard.</p>
<p>I checked Logitech and for my keyboard and Trackball a driver is not required.</p>
<p>I did not see any recent windows update other than the WayTech mentioned above and I power off the system every night.</p>
<p>I just got this system back after reinstalling Windows 10 after the BSOD problem Inaccessible boot device, so here we go again.&nbsp; No other products or hardware have been added prior to the latest issue.</p>
<p>Still working on it.<br />

<p>Sounds like it could be the same situation, too many similarities.&nbsp; I will note this did not happen with my other computer which also has a logitech mouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My logitech drivers were generics from 2006 so nothing special there and when I resolved the problem the drivers remained the same.&nbsp; The issue was that the device mgr was not able to define the USB receiver so the drivers were not active.&nbsp; All other devices
 that I had worked fine.&nbsp; I also had an error with my USB headset but it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is one day we will get an automatic patch that will fix this.&nbsp; Not long ago my outlook index feature stopped working.&nbsp; Then one day two weeks later it was working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a suggestion.&nbsp; &nbsp;I did not write down the revision number of the windows update that I uninstalled.&nbsp; However, it did come in tandem with a security patch which is number KB4056892.&nbsp; I did not need to uninstall that update but if you find that one
 installed in your uninstall updates list, and there is one right next to it that arrived at the same time.&nbsp; Make a note of the number, which is what I should have done.&nbsp; Try uninstalling that one.&nbsp; If it fixes your mouse, set your updates on pause or by permission
 so you have a little more control.&nbsp; Or you could use your alternate mouse for a week and then go back to see if the microsoft team has fixed the problem by just plugging in your usb and see if your can move your cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

<p>I removed KB4074588 for Windows Office and the problem was resolved after I rebooted.&nbsp; Now my Logitech USB wired keyboard and mouse work.</p>
<p>However, the same update is already waiting to reinstall, so I may have to re uninstall after I reboot again.&nbsp; I have paused the updated for a month, so we shall see.</p>

            Very good.&nbsp; The pause has worked for me so far.&nbsp; I was planning on waiting about a week and at a time where my computer can spend some quality time with it's own thoughts.&nbsp; Just in case I have to uninstall again.&nbsp; It took about a half hour to do.

<p>Looks like the problem was caused by an incomplete install of the removed update.&nbsp; It re-applied when I boot the machine up again and when complete all of my Logitech USB devices worked fine.</p>

<h2>            PC keeps logging off on it&#39;s own.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my daughter steps out from her PC with out shutting&nbsp;it off, &nbsp;the PC goes to Screen Saver. Then it goes off as normal, but when she comes back and moves the mouse, instead of opening to the Desktop, it opens to the&nbsp;Log on page. She has to click to User
 Name every time to get in. I tried changing different things in "Power", but nothing helped there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone tell me what else I could do to change it so she doesn't have to log in every time she needs to use the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She has it set up to use the Welcome Screen in User Accounts in Control Panel </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She has Windows XP/SP3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            I have increased the size of system protection disk space usage from 3Gb to 4GB, also changed how the daily backups are retained by keeping only the last system image successfully created.&nbsp; Have not had a unexplained recycle since.&nbsp; I don't know if this
 is the complete answer, but it seems to be working.

            Thank you for your recommendations and time &nbsp;but, I am sorry to say that neither solved the problem.&nbsp; I must say that I spend more time trying to fix Windows 10 anomalies than I do on my paying job.&nbsp; Windows 10 doesn't seem to be as good as advertised
 and there doesn't seem to be much improvement being made on fixing it.&nbsp; I yearn for the days of XP.&nbsp; Now it seems to be that the target is social programs and not business applications.&nbsp; I just had to whine a bit.

            <p>I can't tell from the threads here if Carlos sent a screenshot or not. As I am having exactly the same "problem" I am including a screen shot from my own PC. This has only happened recently on my desktop machine (since Update for Windows 10 Version 1511
 for X64-based systems (KB3122947), which update incidentally removed all my previous Windows 10 update history). Prior to this update this phenomenon was only experienced with the drive shown as J: which is a thumb drive. All the other drives are either USB2
 or USB3 SATA drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop, also running Windows 10, but where the latest update is Cumulative Update for Windows 10&nbsp; for X64-based systems (KB3116869) does NOT display this phenomenon. Also on my laptop I have the full Windows Update history since I installed Windows 10
 sometime in August. I only hope I don't get that Version 1511 installed on my laptop as I use that in a professional capacity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the screenshot:</p>

<p>TOSHIBA Canvio Hard Drive (F:)</p>
<p>The two above are USB 3.0 drives and are duplicate images (the problem).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the right pane (Folder/File) for each of the duplicate drives (F:) are&nbsp;the following Folder/File:&nbsp; Upon examination&nbsp;of these folder/files for each drive they seem to be identical but I can't be certain of that.&nbsp; Here is a picture of the right pane for

            I agree with your response above.&nbsp; I have given up on Microsoft fixing anything.&nbsp; I have outstanding difficulties from my initial installation of Windows 10 plus those created by version 1511.&nbsp; I have given up but I haven't forgotten,&nbsp;

    <title>Enable GPS Location Service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pete ame  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enable GPS Location Service</h2>
                    <p>I have reviewed all posts regarding using GPS (GNSS) functionality with the Windows Location Service in 8.1 and everyone has been frustrated by the default behavior of using the WiFi or IP address for location instead of integral GPS(es).&nbsp; My Dell Venue
 11 Pro has a built-in GPS along with the Sierra Wireless GPS in the WWAN card.&nbsp; It was frustrating for me to see the location hundreds of miles from me when using LTE.&nbsp; After reading through the posts, one thing struck me: "Windows Location Provider uses WiFi
 or IP but not GPS".&nbsp; So I tried what turned out to be a solution: disable the Windows Location Provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I verified in the Device Manager (Control Panel) that my GPS "sensors" were recognized under Sensors.&nbsp; I also saw the Windows Location Provider "device".&nbsp; I opened the Windows Location Provider device and Disabled it.&nbsp; I then tested all of the apps I normally
 use with location sensing and they -all- worked using GPS (Maps actually showed the area of accuracy get smaller as the GPS got more satellites locked in).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice one time when looking at the Device Manager that Windows Location Provider wasn't listed.&nbsp; I simply opened Maps, went back to the Device Manager and there it was so I could disable it.&nbsp; It now shows continuously in Device Manager as disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Simple" solution to the ever-present assumption by Microsoft that people don't really want to get the most out of their software and hardware.&nbsp; I don't know which GPS is being used but I know for a fact that at least one is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summary:</p>
<p>

            After installing the February 13, 2018 security update, KB4074588 (OS Build 16299.248), some USB devices and onboard devices, such as a built-in laptop camera, keyboard or mouse, may stop working for some users.
<br />Cause
<br />
<br />This issue occurs when the Windows Update servicing stack incorrectly skips installing the newer version of some critical drivers in the cumulative update and uninstalls the currently active drivers during maintenance.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />
<br />If the following KBs are are installed, right click each then click uninstall:
<br />- KB4074588
<br /> 
<br />If you are unable to do that...
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click Command Prompt (Admin)
<br />
<br />Confirm the drive letter for the Windows image. Usually D: √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú&gt; dir d:
<br />
<br />    Run the following to view the installed packages which will also show a date of install.
<br />
<br />    Dism /Image:D:\ /Get-Packages
<br />
<br />    Find the package(s) that were just installed by date. Run the following command on the last installed package:
<br />
<br />    dism.exe /image:c:\ /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~16299.248.1.17 
<br />
<br />If you are running 32 bit Windows, run this command instead:
<br />
<br />dism /online /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~16299.248.1.17
<br />

<p><span>Hi deadinthewater,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you receive any error message when you try to burn the CD?</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>How
 are you trying to change the length of the track so that you can fit it into CD for burning?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For your information, track length of an audio file is an attribute that cannot be modified by going to the audio properties of the file. Also,
 you cannot edit size and bit rate of the file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on my research, there have been some issues with ID3 tag version 2.4. If you are using files of version 2.4 then you might face this issue.
 It is not that windows media player 12 does not recognize ID3 tags. You can use 2.3 versions files on the windows media player but it will not convert 2.4 version files to 2.3.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
To resolve this issue, the best option would be to downgrade the version to 2.3 and then use the files. If need arise you may use a non-Microsoft tool to convert the files to the 2.3 version and then use them.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, you can use Windows Live Movie Maker to edit audio files. Windows Movie Maker is designed for capturing and editing video; however,
 you can also use it to edit audio files, or "clips". You can use Movie Maker to trim a file's end point so that it will fit on a CD, or you can split a clip into two clips, and then burn the resulting files to separate CDs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: To split an audio clip in Movie Maker and save the resulting clips as WMA files, follow the steps in the link given below.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Work-with-clips-in-Windows-Movie-Maker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Work-with-clips-in-Windows-Movie-Maker</a></span></p>
<p><span>Note: The steps provided above are for Windows Movie Maker. Since you‚Äôre using Windows 7, you need to download<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows
 Live Movie Maker</a> and you can follow the same steps to split the audio file&nbsp;so that it will fit on a CD.</span></p>
