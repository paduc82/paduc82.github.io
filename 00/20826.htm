<h2>            PowerPoint high CPU usage when playing video. Which formats should I use&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to help another department at work with powerpoint presentations basicly killing the CPU. I first started by checking if hardware acceleration was on (deactivate-box was not checked).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried with 4 different computers, all same problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to convert the videos in handbrake to other formats (including H264 + AAC audio like Google said. Same high CPU usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I play the videos in VLC, CPU usage is about 2%, with powerpoint it's about 40-100% (depending on the computer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- All drivers etc. etc. are up to date (also, like I said.. it's on 4 different computers)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is:</p>
<p>Which format does the video need to be, to make sure hardware works?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's especially bad on small dual-core ultrabooks, where CPU usage is 100% and it starts lagging.</p>

<p>PowerPoint is originally intended to be used for presentations. As such, it is best suited for short clips that does not require high usage of memory since it is designed to work using minimal media components. For any regular video players, 15MB is not
 a big deal, but this may not be the case with PowerPoint, which may explain the performance issues you're experiencing.</p>

<h2>            Remove Password Word Document</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>My grandfather died a few years ago. This weekend I cleaned his computer and found a word document wich contains his final words.. The problem is that the document is password protected and we really don't know what it could be..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched a bit on the internet and my conclusion is that there is no way of opening the document without paying for a program that opens such document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no other way I will buy one of these programs but I was wondering if there is no other way (contacting Microsoft maybe?). I am sure I am not the only one who has this kind of problem and I would find it very poor service of Microsoft if they
 don't offer any kind of support for such problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does annyone know a solution for this problem or how to contact Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Me and my family would be very grateful for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>Arne</p>

            No-one participating in these forums is permitted to help circumvent any form of security restrictions. No-one at Microsoft is likely to help, either. There are sound reasons for this policy.&nbsp;Whether any of the programs that claim to be able to break Word
 passwords will actually succeed is also not something anyone here could advise on.

    <title>Office 365 web based formatting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 web based formatting</h2>
                    <p>I find the ability to format my email very lacking...for instance I recently copied and pasted content from outside app and then when I continued to write my email it formatted it the way my pasted item was formatted and I was unable to a.) determine how
 the beginning of my email was formatted and b.) copy that format so that I could have continuity in my email. &nbsp;As a consequence my writting looks all hacked up and amateurish due to the poor editing capabilities of the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am disappointed in Office 365 for many other reasons also...I think it is a poorly put together program that is difficult to use and not very powerful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            ISO Error in Enterprise version</h2>
                    I installed an earlier version of the enterprise technical preview. It went through several updates and was preforming poorly so I thought I would reinstall it. the &nbsp;Windows 10 Build 9926 errors out on the file loading phase of the install every time.
 I have downloaded the iso three times, installed as both aversion 1 and version two vm to no avail. The error states that files are missing or corrupt. The standard preview works just fine. Any ideas?

    <title>I want to register complaint against a Nokia Care Service Centre. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> manojkaware  say:</h3>
<h2>            I want to register complaint against a Nokia Care Service Centre.</h2>
                    <p>Dear all;</p>
<p>Please let me know contact numbers and email of the Nokia India Upper level customer officials and grievance cell.</p>
<p>First I want to know the exact <strong>definition/meaning of "Liquid Problem"</strong> in Nokia C5-00 or in other Nokia mobiles. Actually I&nbsp;was running Software Update and during&nbsp;updation the NSU(Nokia Software Updater)&nbsp;displayed message that "Connection
 Lost" and after many efforts it never detect my&nbsp;mobile phone(Nokia C5-00). Then I have submitted it to Nokia Care Centre, where they told me that the problem is related to "Liquid Problem" and&nbsp; for reparing it will be charged. I want to know that what is the
 meaning of "Liquidity" in mobile at the time of s/w updation.&nbsp;They are fooling me. And if the problem&nbsp;is related to the "Liquid" then why the have not repaired within 8 days. Now they are saying that the&nbsp; mobile has been sent to the headquarter of the Nokia.&nbsp;9
 months before,&nbsp;15 days after purchasing the mobile the problem was related to battery in the same mobile. When I was charging the mobile with full battery, within 20 minutes the battery&nbsp;fully discharged&nbsp;with mobile got heated with a high tempearture. Then
 it was submitted to the same Nokia Care Centre, and they have charged me Rs. 1000(INR) while saying the problem was related to the "Liquid Problem". My phone is under warranty at the current moment.</p>
<p>At the last time&nbsp;(one week before), i have heard from many&nbsp;nokia users at the same Nokia Care service center&nbsp;that they are also facing the problem of "Liquidity" and they were&nbsp; also charged for repairing.</p>
<p>I want to know why Nokia Care are appointing <strong>unskilled/semi-skilled Service Engineer</strong> at the Care centre, the Care centre should be highly consumer/customer oriented, not for charging amount(the earning&nbsp;centre).:smileymad::smileymad::smileymad:</p>
<p>If the problem is related to the "Liquid" then, why now it is taking too much time to be repaired. While earlier the problem is resolved within 3 days. Now why it is being late.</p>
<p>I know that the problem is related to the s/w, because when I was trying to reconnect the mobile at the&nbsp;s/w updation&nbsp;time after failing updation&nbsp;my PC displays message that<strong> Nokia ROM</strong> is not detecting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it will continue then I think Nokia will lose their customers and people will think Nokia as a
<strong>"Defaulter"</strong> company who doesn't care to the customer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all I want to know the <strong>exact definition of the "Liquid Problem"</strong> so that I can ask it to the more than one Service Centre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I want to know where I have to lodge the complaint so that the necessary action should be imposed by the Nokia Upper level officials in this regards. Because Nokia Care Centre is sucking the blood of the customer in the form of money.</p>

<br />
</strong>Where Do you stay kiddo ?<br />
and Which area exactly did you subbit your Nokia Device ?<br />
You Can Actually Logde a complain in the Care Centre Itself, Either tell them your problem exactly, or.... LODGE A COMPLAIN &nbsp;in front of them so that they can know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try To Complain On Their Website, or Try here :&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mywoes.com/complaintdetail.asp?complaintid=3798" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mywoes.com/complaintdetail.asp?complaintid=3798</a>﻿<br />
<br />
You Actually Need to find the right person to do your job/repair.<br />
or The Right Care Centre LOL :D&nbsp;</p>

            By definition, a liquid problem on the phone would be identified by a care center when the liquid monitoring devices (little nobs or strips inside the phone that changes color when too much moisture is in the phone) are showing signs of liquid intrusion.<br />
<br />
The best you can do is to go to ANOTHER CARE CENTER and log your complaint there while having them check your phone, or send a letter to the Nokia Head Office in your country.

<p><span>I have got nokia c6-00 mobile. Warranty period is running. Many problems occur in this device. So many times it has been given in the service centre. So many times it becomes dead. Touch Pad do not work. Starting up problem is there. Each time the
 instrument is sent to the company and every time it returns after ten days. Proper answers are not given at the service centre(Surat- Rustampura Branch). They are saying that they haven't got the touch pad. It will take 10 days to receive from the company.
 My Jobsheet no. is 3084 on 29/10/2012. What to do ? Can Somebody guide me how to make legal complaint about this? I am tired of arguing with the persons at the service centre.

<p>Our systems show that repairs have been made to your device on two separate dates. If it is still less than one year since your purchase of this phone, then you would still have warranty - but you may need to provide a copy of your original purchase receipt
 in order to receive service.</p>

<p>Hello Erika,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email had been working in the past, but it developed an issue a couple of months ago and I had been unable to fix it. I had tried the outgoing mail server fixes several times, resetting and re-trying those solutions previously, but to no avail, but I
 had neither the time to spend, nor the knowledge to fix it. However, this time I got my teeth into it and was not letting go until I had the issue fixed. It took me from 6pm on day 1 till 4pm on day 2 with about 4 hours sleep somewhere in there, to finally
 fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to get around the issue by changing the email login password to something other than the domain cPanel login password. (I noticed they were the same and thought I might try that as a fix for some unknown reason). Then changing the password in outlook
 to match the new domain email login password. I then did a test email to my gmail and outlook addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That worked! For some unknown reason, having the same password on both cPanel login and email login was causing emailic constipation. I received the email sent to gmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as a direct result of that exercise, I discovered I had a deliverability issue with any Microsoft email addresses - outlook, Hotmail etc. The IP was on a black-list due to spamming by some other user of the shared hosting server I am using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A support ticket and a couple of hours later, the IP had been cleared for limited mailing i.e. just a few emails a day, which is fine because I only use the account to respond to customer queries. I have a 3rd party auto-responder on a different server for
 bulk mailing and I only mail to legitimate subscribers anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I had a double issue and managed to resolve it all. Thanks!</p>

    <title>Outlook Recipients List doesn&#39;t update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lm21009  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Recipients List doesn&#39;t update</h2>
                    <p>When I send an Outlook invitation out and then later on add other recipients why can't the original recipients see the added recipients in their meeting request?&nbsp; I thought it was due to when I click on the "You have made changes to the list of attendees.&nbsp;
 Choose one of the following: send updates only to added or deleted attendees or Send updates to all attendees.", I usually select the send updates only to added or deleted attendees.&nbsp; Would that not update other people's invites?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a specific one that I invited people, went back in later and added another person and then went in a third time and added text to the email body for the entire group.&nbsp; After all of these the original recipients still cannot see the person I added
 late.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>1) Make sure phone is fully charged and switch it off.<br />
2) Press simultaneously the green “call” button, ‘*’ and ‘3′, and keep them down.<br />
3) With those 3 keys down, switch the phone on.<br />
4) Only release the 3 keys when the phone shows signs of life such as the Nokia logo or the language selection screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Works with my 7390, which always goes into test mode if battery dies during the conversation.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe "TEST MODE" and "FIELD TEST"&nbsp;are only for the field engineers or somebody from NOKIA that tests the devices somewhere out there... :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to call the customer service and tell them that your phone suddenly displayed this message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They will replace your device, and i think even if its out of warranty, they will replace it...</p>

<h2>            How to remove operator splash screen &#40;boot animation&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I managed to remove the splash screen on mine. I'm still on release firmware and can "safily" operate on dev mode. However, this is done at your own risk!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have to do this from the terminal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1: Become root of your device: "devel-su" -&gt;enter "rootme" -&gt;enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are now in charge!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. bring out the correct folder: "CD /etc/mwelcome.d" -&gt;enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;"ls" -&gt;enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will now see the files within that folder. The splash screen should be stored here.</p>
<p>On mine the file mentioned in terminal after this command was named 320.conf. This was the only file as I could see. I don't know if this is just the name of the telenor splash screen or if every operator splash screen will have that name, but if there's
 only one file in the folder, I guess it's that one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. To remove the splash screen (you only move the file to another folder (MyDocs):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"mv 320.conf /home/user/MyDocs" -&gt;enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will now get prompted with that permissions and ownership can not be preserved. Nothing to worry about. Everything is fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5: "exit" -&gt; enter and "exit"-&gt; enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then reboot the device!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The file will be found in Mydocs now. I use filebox as a filemanager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To redo:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Become superuser again<br />
<br />
"CD /home/user/MyDocs/ -&gt;enter<br />
<br />
"ls"-&gt;enter and you will see the file - in my case 320 config.<br />
<br />
Now,<br />
<br />
"mv 320.conf /etc/mwelcome.d/-&gt;enter<br />
<br />
Reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea if the operator splash screen will be named something else on others devices, Mine is telenor Norway branded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess this could also be used to apply other splashscreens. What I don't know yet if you will have to remove the one first (i guess) so the folder which the phone reads from has only one splash screen file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you basicly do is to move a file from a folder to another one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I have tried this on my N9 a couple of times following the guide and succeded every time. BUT this is done at your own risk!
</strong></p>

                    <p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>I am getting this problem with Internet Explorer where in the middle of a session I click on a link on any page and a "Page cannot be displayed" error knowing that my laptop is connected to the internet and the proof is that the iTunes Store and online video
 games can still work. The problem used to happen occasionally and now it is happening quite frequently. Most of the add-ons I use are essential on Internet Explorer 11 and I use a Windows 7 computer. Thanks in advance to whoever tries to help me.</p>

<p>you are using wired or wireless connection</p>

<p>True.&nbsp; What you <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">must</span> do then is use the troubleshooter (e.g. wait for it to tell you it couldn't see anything wrong) and then wait for
<strong>its</strong> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">automatic</span> Refresh&nbsp;.&nbsp; Link at the bottom of the error page.&nbsp; Otherwise you are quite correct Refresh (e.g. F5) will do absolutely nothing but refresh the error message you were reading.&nbsp; I'm
 not sure what Ctrl-k will do in that case.&nbsp; E.g. does it retry the URL that you want or does it equally uselessly reshow you the same error page (i.e., without actually retrying the thing it is reporting on)?</p>

<p>For now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't be surprised if you have to do it again.&nbsp; It's not adaptive and there are no tweaks that we can do to try to improve things.&nbsp; If your environment doesn't fit in the&nbsp;default settings you will see odd symptoms accordingly.</p>

<h2>            Auto Populate of values from a table in to another sheet</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two worksheets one (Sheet 1) with values and other(Sheet 2) &nbsp;where i want to populate values based on Sheet 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>To explain a little more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sheet 1 has values as below in the picture</p>
<p>
</p><p>Multiple roles based on 3 specific locations and each role has two different rates, this is applicable for 2014 and 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sheet 2 - I have the following in Sheet 2 (Role, Location, Type) populated from LOV's from Sheet 1 + Start Date and End Date.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf8f69b6-8f1d-4be3-ab49-d897967dabf3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>My Requirement is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I want the value from 2014 to be populate for a particular role/location/type(chosen) if the start and end date is &lt;=30th June 2015</p>
<p>2. I want the value from 2015 to be populated for a particular role/location/type (chosen), if the start and end date is &gt;=30th June 2015</p>
<p>3. If my Start date is 1st April 2015 and End Date is 31st July 2015 - I want both rates to be applied (if possible) and final displayed in a seperate column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently am doing this manually and if this is achieved will help me a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rgds</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Here's an idea to get you started.</p>
<p>I set up Sheet1 like your picture and I named the columns (using Formulas &gt; Create names from Selection &gt; Top).&nbsp; Since 2014 cannot be a name I used headings "Rate 2014" and "Rate 2015":</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40626051-99f0-4d09-9044-a33cdfb69ee5" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and then in Sheet2 I created a formula:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39d2d80a-6757-446f-9f81-a6c7c8bf1095" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the formula so you can copy it if it's helpful:</p>
<p>=IF(E2&lt;DATE(2015,7,1),SUMIFS(Rate_2014,Role,A2,Location,B2,Type,C2),IF(D2&gt;=DATE(2015,7,1),SUMIFS(Rate_2015,Role,A2,Location,B2,Type,C2),"Mix"))</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't clear about what you wanted to do about tasks going over the year break.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can share a picture of your Sheet2 showing what you would do manually for a task over the break I will attempt to reproduce using formulas</p>
<p>

            <p>I've given both my sheets to see if this is achievable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently Sheet 1 is the input to my Sheet 2, just that it picksup only the 2014 rate for now given that we are in March.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario 1 - Start Date &gt;= Today and End Date &lt;=30th June - No Problems, as the already current 2014 rates get populated in my Sheet2 (Rate Card)</p>
<p>Scenario 2 - Start Date &gt;= 30th June and End Date &gt;30th June - No problems here too, as the 2015 rates will be picked up by the formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario 3 - Start Date &gt;= Today (or even &lt; Today) and End Date &gt; 30th June. </p>
<p>Here i need to choose 2 different rates for calculations and to achieve currently i split the number of days before 30th June and After 30th June in to two seperate rows to calculate the grand total for each and every line item.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is something i wish to avoid and bring in one forumla (if possible) even if means i have to create multiple columns that gets populated automatically based on the selections i make, but the grand total is "Pre June" and "Post June" rates total includes</p>

            <p>For the case of a task crossing the year end, you will need to know the amount of effort in each year.</p>
<p>The simplest approach would be to use 2 lines for such a task, one for the period to 30th June and the other for the period in the new year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The alternative would be to have columns for Rate_2014, Days_2014, Rate_2015 and Days_2015 and then Total would be Rate_2014*Days_2014 + Rate_2015*Days_2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way you could do it in one row with the columns you currently have would be if the effort was spread uniformly across the time from start date to end date; e.g. if the task was from 1-June to 29-August, 1/3 of the effort was at 2014 rates and 2/3
 was at 2015 rates.&nbsp; In that case the formula could be</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(E2&lt;DATE(2015,7,1),SUMIFS(Rate_2014,Role,A2,Location,B2,Type,C2),IF(D2&gt;=DATE(2015,7,1),SUMIFS(Rate_2015,Role,A2,Location,B2,Type,C2),((Date(2015,7,1)-D2)*SUMIFS(Rate_2014,Role,A2,Location,B2,Type,C2)+(E2-Date(2015,6,30))*SUMIFS(Rate_2015,Role,A2,Location,B2,Type,C2))/(E2-D2)))</p>

<h2>            How to setup Hotmail&#47;Outlook.com email account using Exchange in Mac Mail</h2>
                    I am trying to add my hotmail.co.uk account using Exchange in Mac Mail but it keeps asking me for the settings. Specifically it is asking for the internal URL and external URL. Can someone please tell me the settings to get a Hotmail or Outlook.com account
 working in Mac Mail using Exchange. I do not want to use a POP account as I have multiple devices, and IMAP does not seem to offer Contacts or Calendar integration. Please help!

Genius, thank you so much!! If anybody has the same issue adding an Hotmail account to a Mac:<br />
<br />
Go to Preferences, Internet Accounts</p>
<p>Click on the + sign, then select Exchange account on the right hand side</p>
<p>DO NOT add your real email address, but a dummy one, and a dummy password<br />
Click on Sign in<br />
It will go to a menu where you can add the internal and external URL</p>
<p>Add your real account information (email address + password) and then the URL outlook.live.com both in external and internal URL as indicated by Far-East (leave username empty, it will do it automatically, just fill in the email address field)</p>
<p>Click on Sign in</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enjoy your contacts synced on the Mac!!<br />
<br />
THANK YOU Far-East<br />

<p><strong>You will need to backup your data before you cleanly install windows.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Official way<br />
1. Wait for the 16299.15 ISO to be uploaded to the Windows Insider Download Site<br />
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced</a><br />
<br />
2. Wait for the Media Creation Tool to be updated to 16299.15 &amp; create an ISO<br />
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a><br />
<br />
The unofficial way (not supported or recommended by Microsoft)<br />
1. Download &amp; install 16299.15 by being a Windows insider &amp; using windows update<br />
2. Use a third party UUP to ISO tool to create an ISO - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.tenforums.com</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Use Rufus - <a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rufus.akeo.ie/</a> to create a bootable USB using the ISO</p>
<p>Boot with the windows 10 USB</p>
<p>Format the windows partition &amp; install Windows 10 Cleanly.</p>
<p>When asked for your product key, click "I do not have a product key" </p>
<p>then when you are connected to the internet it should activate if you</p>
<p>install the same version you had a valid windows license before (home or pro).</p>

<h2>            My Outlook Email and Xbox Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am not sure if this is the right spot to post this but I really need some help. &nbsp;I just created a new email in outlook from my previous email on gmail. Moved all of my important stuff over to this email as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried adding my email to my Xbox account it said I couldn't and it was already in use. So Xbox chat told me to make a dummy account, and make it the primary on my new email and to remove my new email. The rep said it might take 24 hours to have everything
 set so I can add my new outlook email to my gamer tag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my issue is that I can't login what so ever to my new outlook email. Will I have to wait the time period until I can added it to my Microsoft account before I can sign in my email address again?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try and login it says that my email does not exist. When I tried adding it to my Xbox gamer tag it says its already in use. So I am really confused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I just wait the 24-48 hours and try again or start all over.</p>

</p><p>Hi, thanks for the reply. I'm trying to add my outlook email to my current gamer tag which is a gold account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My outlook email was hooked up to a silver account so I had to create a dummy account to remove my outlook from that silver account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't sign into my outlook email anymore due to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately I want to add my outlook email to my gold account. Currently, it will not let me since it is saying it is already in use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has yet to be a full 24 hours yet, but I am worried that Ill have to create another whole new outlook email again.</p>

<h2>            Finally real information about OneDrive sync errors</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to 9879, there were some hiccups in the syncing of my OneDrive. usually when this happened in the past, I would select sync errors, be directed to the OneDrive app, but not be given any real useful information on how to resolve the problem.
 On 9879, after clicking on view sync problems, I received this image:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a524de6-cf8c-4abd-a22d-7e26a3d64219" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this is some helpful information and will make resolving future sync issues much, much easier.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well done Microsoft.</p>

            I deleted the folders on my pc, having the same errors, but Onedrive is not syncing with those online, i.e: there is nothing downloading into the Onedrive folder. Since all folders were showing the error, and I deleted them all, my Onedrive folder is completely
 empty, and not showing all my online folders and files...

            <p>Hmm... I noticed on my machine the folders it was complaining about were empty. This was expected because they were online-only so were "placeholders". It seems the transition to the new functionality may have some issues. I've also started to receive constant
 error messages about OneDrive shortcuts not being able to be deleted, but nothing is showing in sync errors. When I click on the error notification, it just takes me to the OneDrive folder without any real information about how to resolve this. So it looks
 like some problems are giving more information than before, but others are not giving any at all beyond the error notification.</p>

            Sorry to cool your excitement, but these descriptions were available in the old SkyDrive app two years ago. In fact, this whole "new" version of OneDrive is just the plain ol' SkyDrive from 2012 and a major step BACK. Even the setting UI and icon animation
 are the same, for god's sake!

            <p>I was able to fix the issues through deleting the files/folders that were generating the errors. I kept a backup of the files handy just in case, though for me&nbsp;it did not delete any files off OneDrive.com. Instead it synced them correctly afterward.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case it sounds like the 'transaction log' is broken (or whatever function serves this purpose) and OneDrive can't determine which version of the files is the one to keep since it sees them as different files. I had something like this happen once
 and had to remove all the local content and then I resynced everything from the cloud. It was a pain, and scary, but it did work. Definitely make sure you have a backup first.</p>

<h2>            Sharepoint  - Does a renaming of a file brake the link sent for sharing</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>I'm working for a company and have a file to be reviewed by several people. So I sent around the share link to people with adequate rights.</p>
<p>Now I realized the word fileprovided is a doc file &gt;&gt; Word online needs to convert it etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question: When I'm converting the file in Word to docx and store it afterwards, is the link still working? Otherwise I have to send a new link to the people again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional question: Does a link break even after renaming the file name, when I observed a typo in the name?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We work with Office365</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you open a .doc file in Word online for editing, it will convert it to .docx format (Word online do not support old file format for editing). When the document is converted, Word online creates a new copy with .docx file format.
 Since you shared the link of .doc file, if you wish other users to collaborate on the new document (.docx) then you must share the new file again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test, renaming the file will not break the shared link. The recipient of the link will still have the access to the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neha</p>
