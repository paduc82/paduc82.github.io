<h2>            Excel 2010 - How do I get Row Height Autofit to work reliably</h2>
                    <p>I have encountered this issue often in various spreadsheets.&nbsp; Basically, I will type something into a cell that is tool long for the cell.&nbsp; I will format the cell to wrap text and then, thinking it will do what it purports to do, I will click row height
 auto fit.&nbsp; And then the fun starts as the row fails to adjust.&nbsp; It's maddening!!&nbsp; Why have this feature if it fails near 100% of the time.</p>
<p>I can say it is not a scaling issue because I currently have the problem after using ALT-Enter to create several lines of text.&nbsp; But when I "Auto Fit" the row, nothing changes.&nbsp; I can only see the first line of text with the remaining rows missing.</p>
<p>When I Google the issue, I see suggestions ranging from, bite the bullet and do it manually (not a good option for me on principle), to resizing columns then auto fitting the row (impractical because the columns are then messed up), so basically, nothing,
 thus far, on line has helped.</p>
<p>Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; </p>

            <p><span>Hi Barbara. The code I gave could be run separately or added to the one already shown (likely with several modifications for your case), but it's more complicated than that; I was just giving the basic concept. To use either block of code you'd need
 to learn the basics of VBA. That's somewhat involved for someone unfamiliar, though it does end up being incredibly useful. If you're up for that, you could start with the tutorial
<a href="http://www.homeandlearn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that link seems too daunting -- note that the linked page is just the first of several parts -- feel free to PM me at markt99k at gmail dot kom and I can probably talk you through the process, which'd be quicker (albeit less useful in the long term) than
 having you learn about macros. Wouldn't charge you anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Bear in mind, my code snippet was for a sheet whose cell content was being
<em>entered</em>&nbsp;with VBA, vs. repairing existing cells, which sounds like what you're doing. I did see your earlier messages and couldn't replicate your issue exactly. But if it actually did work for you, it's probably worth pursuing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>That aside, FYI the code you appear to be looking for would be something like this:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For Each c In ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Cells<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; If c.WrapText = True Then c.Value = c.Text &amp; vbCrLf<br />
Next</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>That would be for every cell in a sheet. For just one column, you'd want:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For Each c In ActiveCell.EntireColumn.Cells<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; If c.WrapText = True Then c.Value = c.Text &amp; vbCrLf<br />
Next&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Again, these may need some modifications for your particular case.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, I'm not an Excel guru, so if someone else chimes in with a better tutorial link, take their advice. (I just googled a few to find that one.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Changed the tutorial link after noticing the one originally cited was for the pre-Ribbon version of Excel.</p>

<h2>            How do I link a phone to a tablet</h2>
                    My wife is disabled and is struggling to use her nokia lumia 635 phone to type messages. I am planning to buy her a&nbsp;8 inch tablet to make life easier. If I buy one running windows mobile 8.1 is there a way to allow her to text or even answer calls on the
 tablet&nbsp;

            <p>Windows Phone&nbsp;will not be able to make a link to a tablet so that phone calls or texts can be handled from the phone via a tablet. Nor am I aware of any third party app that adds this capability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However there are features on the phone that make its use more accessible, such as announcing&nbsp;incoming callers by name, verbally placing calls, reading aloud incoming text messages, transcribing verbal messages to text....would these features help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also recently learned that <a href="http://www.att.com/shop/apps/att-messages.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
my mobile carrier (AT&amp;T)&nbsp;</a> now provides a way to virtually connect my mobile number to their cloud services that would allow me to backup SMS &amp; MMS messages to their cloud as well as send &amp; receive text messages from a tablet or computer. That kind of service
 would provide a solution for your texting needs, but not for placing calls...you might check with your cellphone carrier to see if they offer a similar service.</p>

            <p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows Phone 8.1, you can use Cortana to send text messages by speaking. &nbsp;The availability of Cortana will depend on what region you are in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can project your Windows Phone 8.1 device to Windows PC over USB. &nbsp;If you bought her an 8" tablet that is running Windows 8.1, you can run the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Project My Screen</a> app on the tablet. &nbsp;The phone's screen would be mirrored to the tablet and you can tap the phone controls from the tablet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The audio would still be handled from the phone, it would not go through the tablet. &nbsp;This also requires the full version of Windows, Windows RT (Surface RT, Surface 2) would not be able to run the Project My Screen app. &nbsp;Some devices can do this wirelessly,
 but if you picked up a Surface Pro 2, it would right off the USB port.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/connectivity/project-my-phone-screen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Project my phone screen to a TV or PC</a> page for more details.</p>

<h2>            is there a way to use the &#39;Arial Rounded MT Bold&#39; font on Office 2010 docs</h2>
                    If I view a doc created with this font on Office&nbsp;XP, Office 2010 changes the font. This font is not listed as an option. Can this font be imported?

            Is the Arial Rounded MT Bold font file installed on the computer that has Office 2010? If the font isn't installed, and if it wasn't embedded in the document file on the Office XP computer, then Office 2010 has no choice but to substitute some other font
 in its place.<br />
<br />
That font is included as part of Office 2010, so it should be available. It's possible that it wasn't installed, though. Try this:<br />
<br />
In the Windows Control Panel, start Programs &amp; Features. Select the Office 2010 icon and click the Change button. In the wizard, leave Add or Remove Features selected and click Continue. On the next page, open the icon for Office Shared Features, click the
 Fonts icon, and choose Run All From My Computer. Click the Continue button and let it finish. Then check the font list again.<br />
<br />
If the font still isn't there, and if you have access to the other computer (or any other computer that has the font), copy the file C:\Windows\Fonts\ArlRdBd.ttf and paste it into the same location on your computer.<br />

<h2>            Integrating skype for business with Moodle</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
All students in the school have office365&nbsp;accounts,<br />
and we use Moodle for our learning system.<br />
I wanted to know how can I integrate&nbsp;Skype for business into Moodle so the teacher can open an online meeting for the Moodle course and limited it to be available&nbsp;only to the students in the same course.<br />
<br />
Does this sound possible? Is there&nbsp;any way&nbsp;to integrate it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Estysto,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no official article about integration between Skype for Business and Moodle. After lots of search, I find a similar thread for your references:&nbsp;<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/3e06ad88-bfba-46dc-881b-0762179690dc/skype-for-buisness-moodle-integration?forum=lyncdeploy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/3e06ad88-bfba-46dc-881b-0762179690dc/skype-for-buisness-moodle-integration?forum=lyncdeploy</a>.
 Since we focus on Office 365 for Business Online services, we are very glad to help you on this part if any needed. Thanks for your understanding and time.</p>
<p>

    <title>Lost Files&#47;Folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rmsm222  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Files&#47;Folder</h2>
                    <p>I had several Microsoft Word and PowerPoint files open today when I decided to upload a large folder onto OneDrive. &nbsp;The folder I selected to upload contained the files I had open. &nbsp;I was given an error message that windows couldn't preform this action because
 I had the files open and I pushed cancel. &nbsp;I then decided that it would be best to consolidate the files I was working on under a new folder. &nbsp;I created a new folder (also under the parent folder I had selected to transfer) and then used "Save As" feature
 to save all of my files into the new folder. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon closing the documents, I was unable to locate the folder I created or any of the documents I saved to them. &nbsp;I can still view the documents under recent files (in Word and PowerPoint) but when I try and open them it says the files cannot be located
 and might have been moved. &nbsp;I can also see the folder under the shortcuts from File Explorer but it gives me a similar message. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all I could find on accessing the temporary files, or auto recovery versions, but nothing I have found works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also note that the only remaining files on my computer that were not transferred to &nbsp;OneDrive were the original versions of the documents that I had open. &nbsp;Everything else has been moved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I might access these files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h3> john.mcdonnell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950 XL Battery lasts 6 hours mostly in idle</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having awful issues with my Lumia these days, currently the battery doesn't last half the day, even when the phone is mostly left idle, as I'm abroad and using another phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only apps I have on my phone that would be using the battery excessively would be:</p>
<p>WIFI</p>
<p>Skype</p>
<p>Whatsapp</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing else I'd use my phone for would be mobile data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also when I'm not at home and my battery drains I usually plug it into my work laptop, or monitor, but it seems that these devices cannot sustain a charge, so just keeps the phone powered on, but not charging. &nbsp;I understand there's an issue with Windows
 phones where by you cant charge them powered off but this is ridiculous...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any one any help or ideas?</p>

                    With this new upgrade or takeover of skype it seems like I'm getting the connection beep every few minutes during a conversation.&nbsp; The person on the other line doesnt' hear it but it's annoying.&nbsp; Anyone experiencing this?

<p>Hi David, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing up this matter to our attention. As of this writing, there’s no automatic way to sort pages or sections alphabetically, you can sort it manually by dragging the section or pages into the order you want. Having said that, we highly
 suggest that you post this query to our <em><strong><a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote UserVoice</a></strong></em> page. Our team will review and collate suggestions and incorporate them into product planning
 discussions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sort-pages-or-sections-alphabetically-9d5b2817-fc40-4199-9120-80aab89180f3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> for more details about sorting pages in OneNote
 alphabetically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for understanding. Should you have questions or other concerns, please don't hesitate to post back.</p>

            <p>So I went to check it out and of course it defaults to the Mobile and I got the same results as you where it is asking if you want to search for an app in the store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I clicked NO then tried the desktop link.&nbsp; That worked!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an aside, to test I ended clicking on this link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE0Q904gtMI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE0Q904gtMI</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/CE0Q904gtMI?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/CE0Q904gtMI?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was an Eagle that swooped down and tried to grab a baby.&nbsp; Whoa!&nbsp; Thank God it dropped the kid!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>So I played around with it just a little more and this is what I found.&nbsp; If you have IE set to DESKTOP (found under Settings in IE), then you will get that message.&nbsp;
<strong>If you have IE set to Mobile, then the message WILL NOT appear and everything works as expected.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you test it then delete the tab then start fresh so you then know that it works as expected.</p>

<h2>            Flight mode won&#39;t turn off</h2>
                    <p>Have spent the past day and a half trying to turn the flight mode off on my 620. Have looked through many posting regarding software updates,soft reset,hard reset,SD card in,SD card out,sim in,sim out. But nothing seems to work and now I'm beginning to get
 frustrated with the whole thing. Every time the phone reboots the small flight mode icon is still visible at the top left of the screen and when I go to settings to change it it just toggles back. Going by the various postings this is not a small glitch but
 appears to be quite a common one and comes from software updates. So can you guys get you finger out and sort it out.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for the advise. My issue like a few people is that it seems to be a software problem from Microsoft. I don't think we should be paying to get our phones fixed. Its a damn liberty if you ask me. If I cant get it fixed then ill have to dig out my wife's
 old iphone 5.</p>

 We understand how you feel. The repair should be free as long as the phone is still in warranty and there's no physical or liquid damage. Suggest visiting the nearest Care Point to have your phone assessed by our technicians. Don't forget to back up your files
 to avoid data loss.

            Normally doing a soft reset will clear files in memory. But if that does not help, download ClearTemp from
<a href="http://mobile-sg.com/ppc/apps/?p=ClearTemp." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://mobile-sg.com/ppc/apps/?p=ClearTemp.</a> It's a free tool that will

<h3> cdif409  say:</h3>
<h2>            Embedded Links in Word from Excel Problem Opening and Saving&#63;</h2>
                    <p>(I have seen other posts and it seems like everyone is having this problem, but I have not seen a solution??)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have many excel fields linked to a large word document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everytime I open word or save it, like many other posts, all the excel fields have to open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is literally impossible to work with the document as it takes 15 minutes to open, 15 minutes to save, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to disable all the links by either setting to manual or locked and nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It DID NOT do this in Word 2007. I have searched high and low for a solution and can find nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thought I was moving forward by upgrading to a newer version of word but this is a huge step back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts or suggestions?</p>

            <p>PROBLEM SOLVED (if your excel doc doesn't link to other excel docs)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I have learned:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem arises because of:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Links to other excel spreadsheets in your excel spreadsheet AND/OR</p>
<p>2. Broken references in your excel doc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aka, it all has to do with links/references in excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your excel spreadsheet has that error box (cannot update links or something) that comes up when you open it, the one that also shows up when the links in word update, you need to work on getting that box removed in excel, so that when you open
 excel, there is no error box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The word linking problem will not disappear until excel opens cleanly with no message box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, I had to disable links to other spreadsheets (they were old and not used any way), and, delete old cell references for names unused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your excel spread links to other spreads and you need that, I am not totally sure what to do, but you can mess around with the links to make that error box go away (research that part).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To remove the links to other spreadsheets:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In excel, go to data--&gt; edit links.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. For me, I disabled all links to other spreadsheets because I don't need them. If you need them, research how to make the error message go away while still linking (sorry, I don't have the answer for that part but it should at least give you enough
 to get started researching). It may simply be making sure it is referencing the correct spreadsheet and correct folder (check to see where the folder it is referencing is)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To remove the cell reference errors:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In excel, go to "Formulas--&gt;Name manager</p>
<p>2. Filter--&gt; names with errors</p>
<p>3. Delete all the names with errors (it is my understanding these are bad links. Aka, referencing cells that don't exist. You may wish to check up on this a little more before deleting this. I once used an old software with excel VBA and since I

<h2>            Custom Search Folder Categorized or Follow Up</h2>

<p>I was wondering if I may get some assistance with something I have been trying to do within Outlook 2007...</p>
<p>Is there a way to create a custom search folder that looks for eMails that are&nbsp;both Catagorized and marked for Follow Up instead of either/or?</p>

</p><p>The Parent buys a new laptop for little Johnny and enters his school&nbsp;email address to set the laptop up and gets the "Looks like this isn't a Microsoft account" message.&nbsp; So&nbsp;she has to set up a Hotmail account for&nbsp;little Johnny and then that's all he uses&nbsp;and
 his OneDrive is not his OneDrive for business and he doesn't do his homework and is always in trouble.</p>

    <title>Is there a Wi-Fi limit for phone data&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> isaid salazar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a Wi-Fi limit for phone data&#63;</h2>
                    So I've been wondering, is there any type of wifi limit for WP 8.1? In data sense, it says that I've used up 8.22 GB of Wifi data, and only 3.32 GB of cellular data. So is there a wifi limit or is it unlimited? I am guessing that the amount of wifi data
 I can use is linked with my router (Belkin), and if so, how can I find out? And are there any consequences for using up too much wifi data? (I'm downloading Halo: Spartan Assault, and so far its used up about .10 GB of wifi data.) lastly, is there any way
 to reduce wifi data usage? For example, my Nokia Lumia 521 is under bright spot Mobile, which is powered by T-Mobile. It's a prepaid phone and I get 3 GB of cellular data. Each month after I pay my phone bill ($35), my cellular data restarts to 0 GB used.
 Is there any way to lower wifi usage? I am scared that if I use too much wifi data, my router and home internet will crash or something. And the only reason I use wifi data is so I don't use up all 3 GB of my cellular data right away.

            The limit isn't set by your router instead it's set by your provider they will have the limit on your account so if you contact them they'll be able to tell you, if there is a limit and you reach that limit all that will happen is either your provider
 will turn your internet off or add additional charges onto your bill, I don't think there is any way to reduce the WiFi data used except in the IE settings you have the option to condense the pages under the data sense savings.

<h2>            Changing the default space after a table</h2>
                    <p><span><font color="#000000"><font>I'm looking for a way to change the default spacing and/or text wrapping for tables inserted into a Word 2013 document.
 Currently any text which follows a table does so with no space between it and the table.
</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>I'm aware that there are several options to introduce a space including; a hard space, adding ‘space before’ to the
 following paragraph, adding 'space before' to the body text paragraph style or changing the Text Wrapping properties of the table.
</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>However all these have negative side-effects e.g. hard spaces should be avoided, adding 'space before' adversely affects
 the look of the whole document and changing the following paragraph settings or table properties involve user intervention which moves away from the principle of making the template I'm designing simple to use.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>I have tried, and failed to find a way to change the text wrapping properties of the default table because this option
 is not available when editing a default table - infact the option to modify the settings of&nbsp;'Table Normal' is always greyed out.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>Is there a way to automatically add space after table when it is added to a Word 2013 document, for example by editing
 the properties of ‘Table Normal’?</font></font></span></p>

            The thread EvelynMhuge links to just reviews the options you've already rejected. Unfortunately, I don't believe there are any others. My solution is to use a Body Text Space Before style for the paragraph following a table. The "style for following paragraph"
 of that style is set to Body Text, so the rest of the document continues unaffected. It's not a perfect solution, since it's not automatic, but it's the best I've been able to come up with.

    <title>Excel 2013 won&#39;t go half page - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel 2013 won&#39;t go half page</h2>
                    In the past, I have opened Excel and then clicked button so that it only takes half the screen. I do this so I can view what is behind it. It said that it installed updates, now I can only have full screen. Restore down minimizes it to top of screen instead
 of making screen smaller. &nbsp;Anyone have any ideas?

            <p>It may be that the 'restore down' button is not changing the size because the Excel window was previously sized near full screen size while it was in the reduced size mode.</p>
<p>Click the Restore/Restore Down button:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/981c128b-adf3-40f8-90d9-aafa2fa16941" /></p>
<p>Click it until you get the 2-squares appearance as shown.&nbsp; Then move your mouse pointer down to an edge of the Excel window, right-click and hold and resize the window the way you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if that doesn't work.</p>

You must have accidentally typed the incorrect PIN to unlock your phone multiple times which is why you got locked out.<br />
<br />
If your phone is running on the Windows Phone 8.1 or Windows 10 Mobile operating system and you still remember your actual PIN to unlock it, please
<strong>charge it for 2 hours</strong> and you will be given the option to unlock it without having to wait for a month.<br />
<br />
<br />
Feel free to reply if you have further questions.
