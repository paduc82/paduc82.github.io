    <title>Outlook 2010 - I have 2 email addresses &#38; 3 pst files - and one of - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 - I have 2 email addresses &#38; 3 pst files - and one of the pst files requires a password</h2>
                    <p>I had to restore my computer back to factory settings, which meant I had to reinstall all software, thankfully I had a backup drive.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 2 comcast&nbsp;email addresses, one primary, the other secondary.&nbsp;When I&nbsp;originally set up Outlook&nbsp;(before restoring the computer to factory settings)&nbsp;I had set up my secondary email address before setting up my primary email address, and then created
 a password to open Outlook. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I reinstalled Outlook after the system restore, I set up the primary email address first, then the secondary address. In setting up the secondary address, I got an unknown error 0x8004011d. In spite of the error code, Outlook still synchronized both
 pst files, even though the secondary email address was not appearing in Outlook. The secondary email address did finally set up, but&nbsp;with a (1) behind it, and the IN box contains only recent emails. I currently&nbsp;do&nbsp;not&nbsp;have&nbsp;a password&nbsp;to open&nbsp;Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In reviewing the email setup in&nbsp;Outlook, I saw that the primary &amp; secondary (1) pst/data files were displayed on the data file tab (file/account settings/data file), while the original secondary email's pst/data file was not listed. So I added the secondary
 pst/data file -- when I added the original secondary pst/data file,&nbsp;Outlook asked for a password, and that password is the password that was&nbsp;required to open&nbsp;Outlook before I restored the system.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, emails sent to my secondary email address are appearing in the Outlook&nbsp;IN box of&nbsp;both&nbsp;my primary &amp; secondary (1)&nbsp;addresses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My questions are as&nbsp;follows: </p>
<p>1 - how do I combine the secondary email accounts and get rid of the new secondary file, the one&nbsp;with a&nbsp;(1) as part of the name?
</p>
<p>2 - how do I get rid of the password requirement on the original secondary&nbsp;pst file (I think the answer to&nbsp;this question&nbsp;will help me solve the former)?
</p>
<p>3 - what do I need to do to correct the secondary emails from appearing in the primary emails Outlook&nbsp;IN box or is this something I should have anticipated?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to solving this and appreciate your feedback.</p>

<p>How frustrating is it? Hotmail does not have a technical support contact. Therefor i had to log into microsoft access account and contact them through chat. They were unable to help at all &amp; then advised me to call 13 20 58 (Australian Number). They were
 also unable to help. They then told me to contact the Hotmail customer support. But they were unable to tell me how to contact them. Therefor i am now stuck not knowing how i can resolve this issue or who i can contact,</p>

<h2>            N8 photo viewer problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone! this discussion forum&nbsp;has been helpful so far, I have the same problem with battery not lasting too long. I'm gonna try the "warm up" tonight when I get home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok I have another problem, and I hope you guys can help me. I am able to take pics from the camera, but when I try to view it by tapping on the photo viewer, the screen goes blank or dead. I don't even know if the pic was saved or not. I still haven't installed
 a micro sd card, could this be&nbsp;the problem? Also for good measure I did the restore to factory settings and still no avail. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hiya,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My N8 (Tesco Mobile) had the same problem, dead easy to fix</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1st Make sure you backup the phone!</p>
<p>2nd Restore to Factory Settings</p>
<p>3rd Restore from Backup</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Camera and the Photo App was the first thing i tested on my N8 and i was a bit annoyed when it didnt work straight out of the box. &nbsp;Please Please make sure you backup I didnt and lost a couple of Web TV apps and loads of default backgrounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the phone has reset (takes a while) the photo app works fine, then just restore the backup using OVI. &nbsp;easy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh and if anyone is feeling really helpful, can they upload a backup of the default pictures, mine had a nice fireworks background that i lost in the factory reset</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rich</p>

<p>I solved my problem!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I backed up my data and then did factory reset with delete data. I supose there is a problem when I first transfered all my data from the old phone, pictures and music (old 6xxx phone) that made a lot of problems. I think there were some processes all the
 time running so that my phone lost battery after 4-5 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that I synhronized back my files and all was perfect. Now I run 3-4 days without recharge! After 2 days of hell I wanted to give it back, now I love the phone and I pitty thos iphone users. I mean it is very very stable and this is first version of
 the OS!</p>

<p>Hi DebShaw,</p>
<p>Based on my experience, this kind of issue usually occurs when the provision process is stuck, it's suggested you

    <title>Saving Multiple embedded documents in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> odelphi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saving Multiple embedded documents in Excel</h2>
                    <p>I have a large Excel spreadsheet that has about 50 embedded documents in it (The files are actually embedded in the spreadsheet -&nbsp;they are&nbsp;not a link to a file stored somewhere else).&nbsp; Would someone know of a way to easily save all those embedded documents
 as individual files outside of the spreadsheet (some are excel spreadsheets, some are in Adobe format, some are WORD documents, etc).&nbsp; In other words, I would like to "strip" all the embedded documents out of the spreadsheet and save them to my harddrive as
 individual files.&nbsp; I am wondering if there is an easy way of doing this (e.g.&nbsp; highlight all the embedded documents, right click and say "save").&nbsp; Currently, the only way I know to do it is to individually open each document and then save it.&nbsp; I am willing
 to consider some kind of VBA code to do it, if someone has programmed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Community. Let me also assist you with your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your previous response, it appears that the issue still persists after you've &nbsp;tried clearing your browser's cache. Please allow me to ask the questions that were previously asked by the MVP for confirmation and also to make sure that you've done
 all the initial troubleshooting. This will help us speed up the process of our investigation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried accessing other Microsoft accounts to your PC? If not, kindly try to do so and let us know if the same issue occurs on other accounts too.</li><li>Have you tried accessing your account using different browsers? If not, please try and let us know the results.</li><li>Have you tried accessing your account using different computer? Please try to do so to determine if the issue will also occur.</li></ul>
<p>On the other hand, if you've already done all of the above and the issue appears to be present on different browsers and PC and does not occur on different Microsoft accounts, we'd like to gather more information from you so we can conduct an in depth investigation.
 Please provide the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your affected Microsoft account</li><li>Browser version</li><li>Screenshot of your mailbox indicating the problem</li><li>Error message (if there's any)</li></ul>
<p>Provide the requested details in the private message area that I have created for you. Make sure that you are signed in to Microsoft Community to be able to access the private message.
Once signed in, click on&nbsp;<strong><em><span>"You have a private reply to this message. Click here to read it on our secure private messages section."&nbsp;</span></em></strong>(red font) link just above your post.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In the meantime, as a workaround, you may consider setting up your account to a mail application so you will still continue to view, send and receive emails.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope to hear from you soon!</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had a look at the browser options that you have supplied and I can see that Google Chrome fully supports Outlook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find Chrome to be excellent, not only with ease of use but also speed. The <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

            <p>Hello Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming back and we really value your insight. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To give you a heads up, I've checked your account and verified that everything is working fine on our end. To be honest, we can't confirm if the issue is within our end as we still need more information from you. We respect your opinion about not using other
 browser but please understand that we cannot give you the appropriate resolution you need if this information is not provided.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be very helpful if you can try accessing your account using other browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox or Safari) just to confirm if you will encounter the same behavior.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you may also want to consider accessing your account using a different computer. This is to ensure that your machine is not contributing to the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, I would like you to use&nbsp;private browsing in Google Chrome browser (<strong>Incognito mode</strong>). Press
<strong>Ctrl </strong>+ <strong>Shift </strong>+ <strong>N </strong>keys on your keyboard then access different Microsoft services (<a href="http://mail.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Outlook.com</strong></a>,
<a href="http://calendar.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Calendar</strong></a>, <a href="http://people.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>People</strong></a> and <a href="http://onedrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>OneDrive</strong></a>). If you're having a hard time following the steps, kindly contact Google support on how to do this. We just want to make sure if you can successfully access your
 account or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your cooperation and consideration is much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results afterwards.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Word tells me my password is incorrect...I am certain I have the correct password.</h2>
                    I have used the same password for this particular file for years. I never changed it. I was using an older version of word and have recently upgraded. Now it's telling me my password is incorrect. I need to access this file. It's protected because it's
 important. I am on a Mac. All system updates are current.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;Here is something that happens once in a Blue Moon. Although it was a common bug in older versions, of Office and MacOS; there used to be an issue with Username/Password combo getting corrupted in Key Chain.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>To fix, first write down your password and username (usually the email address used to purchase office subscription). (<em>Depends on whether you bought directly from Microsoft, or you bought through the Apple Store</em>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quit all Office Applications.</li><li>Go to Utilities.</li><li>Open Keychain.</li><li>Click Passwords</li><li>Look for any passwords with a modern date, and refers to Microsoft.<br />
(It might also refer to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.)</li><li>Delete those references.</li><li>Now open any Office app and sign in and save in keychain. <br />
(be sure to use correct username and password or else you'll have to retry.)</li><li>If you have entered everything right, you should be able to use applications without having to continually trying to sign in.</li></ol>

<p>Hi PawZN</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find Last Row and last Column you can use this</p>
<p>
</p><p>LastRow = ActiveSheet.Cells.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeLastCell).Row</p>
<p>LastCol = ActiveSheet.Cells.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeLastCell).Column</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>LastRow =&nbsp;<span>Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row</span></p>
<p>LastCol =&nbsp;<span>Cells(1, Columns.Count).End(xlToRight).Column</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If this answer would be the solution to your question, I'll appreciate you mark it as answered</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.</p>

<p>The Windows.old folder on Drive C will contain the data from the prior install.&nbsp; Your W8.1 data should be safe here for perhaps 28 days or until you delete this large folder.&nbsp;&nbsp; My Windows.old folder now contains a date of Jan 23 which is the install date
 of 9926.&nbsp; I suspect that my Build 9879 is now saved for a Restore back to last Build.&nbsp; I also sort of expect that any trace of my old W8.1 O/S is now toast .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed W10 on a W8.1 knowing that I had no real recourse to get back to W8.1 other than from source install media.&nbsp; I was aware of this and I have an extra PC so no big deal if W10 blew up.</p>

<h2>            Outlook is changing file names of attachments</h2>
                    <p>We are using Office 2013 from Microsoft 365.</p>
<p>Lately, Outlook is changing file names of attachments.&nbsp; We send an email with several Excel files and the recipient receives the files, but the file names have been switched among the files.&nbsp; At first we thought we had just made a mistake in naming our files,
 but this is starting to happen frequently.&nbsp; We have determined that the sender is sending the correct files, but the receiver is getting names switched.</p>
<p>Can anyone help with this?</p>

            <p>That is not the answer.&nbsp; It is occurring from multiple email accounts within our company.&nbsp; It not reasonable for us to change email accounts that have been in the company for years.&nbsp; There is a problem with Outlook 2013 that has been fixed in Outlook 2010.</p>

<p>I have the same problem. When I attach a file that I frequently name the same due to strict submission requests, Outlook adds a sequential number to the attachment.</p>
<p>For example, I add the file named "VO-Nikki" and it changes it to "VO-Nikki 2" and each time I send files of this name, it continues to add numbers sequentially, 3, 4, 5 etc. It is imperative that my file names are strictly as I name them, and remain so
 after attaching. How can I prevent Outlook from messing with my business?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Problems With WMDC and Windows 7.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have HTC touch pro 2 with Windows Mobile 6.5 (CDMA - Sprint) and I am trying in vain with&nbsp; Windows 7 (64) to use WMDC (6.1) to sync and I am having no luck. I have looked at all the other posts and have removed and reinstall everything imaginable. Nothing
 seems to work. I can get my hotmail through the windows live (on the phone) and I have my hotmail through Outlook 2007(on the computer) but cannot do much else, just trying to get my contacts over. Not too high tech savvy, so I would appreciate the help and
 knowledge.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

            I had exactly the same problem with a Dell X51 PDA&nbsp;and WMDC. I fixed it by removing the partnerships in BOTH the WMDC and the PDA. I then re-synced- problem solved

    <title>Text direction in comment balloons for documents created in a - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Text direction in comment balloons for documents created in a right-to-left language country </h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I work with English-language documents created on Israeli computers. Because Hebrew is written right to left, the default setting for the these computers is generally right-to-left, but of course the authors create their documents with a left-to-right
 text direction. However, when I add marginal comments to the documents, the default setting for the comment balloons remains right-to-left. I can change each one individually (and I do), but I have not managed to figure out how to set the document so that
 the comment balloons will automatically open for left-to-right writing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you.</strong></p>

            Most likely, this setting is coming from the defaults.&nbsp;&nbsp; In trying to help someone get rid of&nbsp; the grid that accommodates other alphabets, the fix was to replace the normal paragraph style.<br />
<br />
I don't have a language other than varieties of English installed so I can't test this so<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> try it on a copy of your document</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for your problem, make sure that a right to left language is not an enabled language
 in the document and then use import/export to copy a "correct" normal and&nbsp; comment text style over the ones in your document.&nbsp;

<h2>            Load a Picture on an image control in a userform</h2>
                    Hi!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have this code to change an image in an userform:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()</div>
<div>&nbsp; Path = Range("Z1").FormulaR1C1</div>
<div>&nbsp; Me.Image1.Picture = LoadPicture(Path)</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div>Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()</div>
<div>On Error Resume Next</div>
<div>Dim Path As String</div>
<div>Path = Application.GetOpenFilename</div>
<div>If Path &lt;&gt; False Then</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Me.Image1.Picture = LoadPicture(Path)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;xCmpPath = Path</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Range("Z1").FormulaR1C1 = xCmpPath</div>
<div>End If</div>
<div>ActiveWorkbook.Save</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem is that once I close the userform and open it again, the last image changed disappears. What I want is to open the userform change the image I want and save it, so that it remains till the next time I open the userform and decide to change
 the image again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What's wrong in my code?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!!</div>

            Your example code works as you describe. <br />
The image control is loaded with the graphic file from the path in Z1.<br />
<br />
The only reason I can see there would be a problem is you do not specify a worksheet so it will be the contents of Z1 on the active sheet. If Z1 is empty then the image control will be empty. If Z1 does not contain a valid path/file reference then you should
 see an error message.<br />

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having an issue within Excel (2016), where I can only scroll one cell at a time using the keyboard arrows. So normally, I can hold down an arrow key and it will scroll from cell to cell until I release the arrow key, whereas at the moment it only moves
 to the next cell. So, I need to keep pressing the arrow key to move between cells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be much appreciated.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your reply. Yes the scroll lock is off, as when I turn it on it moves the spreadsheet and does not move between cells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the scroll is turned off as it does not appear in the bottom left corner i.e. Scroll Lock.</p>

    <title>E55 bluetooth bluetooth connection to hands free device causes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kommentaattori  say:</h3>
<h2>            E55 bluetooth bluetooth connection to hands free device causes malfunction using navigation</h2>
                    
<p>I have E55 and&nbsp; voice commands work well via bluetooth. I have brand new Ford Focus which has built in integrated&nbsp; hands free feature in the audio system. But if E55 is connected to a car via bluetooth and you try to use Ovi Maps Navigation or if you try
 to listen MP3 music E55 becomes silent. The phone can´t use loudspeakers neither in the prone nor in the car. Because phone calls works well I think E55 has bug in the software.</p>

<p>I agree. I have a Nokia e55 with the latest build. It is prone to Bluetooth connectivity issues and constantly drops connectivity with either my Blaupunkt Bluetooth car stereo or my head piece.</p>

<p>I'm finding the same when pairing my E55 (f/w: 033.002 - the latest the the generic UK product code) to my *Nokia* carkit that calls get interrupted after 10-15seconds (if I'm lucky).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The carkit happily worked with some rubbish old WM5, WM6.5 and other Nokias.&nbsp; Just seems not to play ball with my E55.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Poor show that Nokia equipment does not work properly with their own kit.</p>

<h2>            Problems with Project Spartan shutting down&#47;10162</h2>
                    It works for a while then, fast&nbsp;like you flipped an off switch, it will shut off/down. Sometimes it will reopen for a while and other times it opens just long enough to see it then off again. Running&nbsp; build 10162 on a new Lenovo "teepee" laptop, Intel
 I3, Samsung SSD Pro drive. This build is the 1st install on this unit, an upgrade type install which kept all the original factory installed apps.

<h2>            Excel 2016 opening multiple instances from associated documents and no new file templates</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a strange issue when I double click on an excel workbook file in File Explorer it opens up 2 Excel 2016 windows, one with just the chrome and the other with the document. Double clicking on the same document again will open a third excel window
 in another instance (complaining about not being able to load my personal template file).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and using the Microsoft Troubleshooter that is supposed to uninstall all versions of Office and even ran through the manual uninstall instructions but nothing seems to fix it. I'm running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other issue is that when right clicking in a folder and selecting new, the new Excel file template is missing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way to fix this other than clean installing Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
