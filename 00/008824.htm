    <title>Conversation History Folder Missing in Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vegas3734  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conversation History Folder Missing in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>I have a user that may have accidentally deleted her "Conversation History Folder" in Outlook 2010. I have gone through all of the settings in Lync 2010 and Outlook 2010
 and verified that they are in the correct places. History is shown on the Lync side, just no longer on the Outlook side</p>
<p>She has Conversation history on the Lync side, but in Lync if you click on File&gt;View Conversation History, it doesn't take
 you over to Outlook, or find any history in Outlook.</p>
<p>I have tried creating a folder named Conversation History under the users root in Outlook, and that didn't work either. Possibly a registry error or value that I can change?
 (Couldn't find that either, not at all similar to Outlook '07) Tried looking on online forums too, no help. I also have disabled and re-enabled unified messaging on Exchange 2010, disabled the add-in console for the conversation history and put the add-in
 back, all with no result. </p>
<p>I need to figure out what is the broken link between Lync, Exchange and Outlook</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Please help, thanks!</span>

    <title>Any chance of retrieving photos from a Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> francesweir  say:</h3>
<h2>            Any chance of retrieving photos from a Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE, running 8.1, when I have fogotten my PIN&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded to&nbsp;a new phone a couple of years ago. Since then, my&nbsp;phone has sat, without a SIM, in a drawer. I would like to get my photos off the phone before I send it for recyling. I charged it up, but unfortunately have forgotten my PIN (and now it's making
 me wait 32 minutes between tries...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to my Microsoft account to do Find my Device. It finds the device.&nbsp;When I do 'lock phone', it asks for the phone number associated with the phone (so I&nbsp;tick the 'no phone number associated'), then the Lock phone screen pops up for a second,&nbsp;enough
 time for me to see&nbsp;there is a&nbsp;space to write a message&nbsp;and&nbsp;no option to change the lock key)&nbsp;but regardless,&nbsp;before I have time to type anything in, an error page&nbsp;pops up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a lost cause? Will I need to do a factory reset and lose all my photos?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it make any difference if I put a new SIM in the phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help!</p>

    <title>PowerPoint 2016 during the slideshow the Pen pointer option will not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 3arewe  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint 2016 during the slideshow the Pen pointer option will not stay once you move to the next bullet point or next slide</h2>
                    I am using Office 2016 for the Mac. I do a lot of PowerPoint presentation during class and my issue is this. During the slideshow I will right click the screen and set the Pointer Option to pen to draw on the slide. Once I advance the slide to either the
 next bullet point or to the next slide the pointer option quickly reverts back to automatic and I have to right click and select the pen option again. I have searched for a configuration setting in PowerPoint to prevent the pointer option from changing back
 but have not been able to locate the correct setting. On my Windows laptop running Office 2013 performing the same tasks, the pen option will stay set for the entire slide presentation. I am not sure what I am doing wrong but any help would be appreciated.
 Thank you for your help.

            <p>PowerPoint 2011 does the same thing, but PowerPoint 2008 works like the Windows versions and keeps the cursor in pen mode while changing slides. Here are a couple of ways to let Microsoft know about the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>In PowerPoint, click on the small <strong>smiley-face icon </strong>in the upper-right corner of the program window and choose
<strong>Tell Us What Can Be Better</strong>. Describe the problem and how it works in Windows. I've already submitted a report on this issue.</li><li>Visit the <a href="https://powerpoint.uservoice.com/forums/288925-powerpoint-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PowerPoint User Voice forum</a> and post a suggestion that the cursor should stay in pen mode as in the Windows version. Others can vote on your idea and Microsoft uses this input to add new features.</li></ul>

<h3> jonathoncook  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Save Multiple Attachments not saving to Network Drives</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated a user from Office 2010 to Office 2016 through Office 365, soon after the update, the user informed me that they were no longer able to use the "Save Multiple Attachments" feature in Outlook to save multiple attachments to a Network location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This method can save files to a Local drive without an issue, but will not save to a Mapped Network folder. I have tested this on two other computers, both in a different environment, with the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Files can be saved individually, even through the Save Multiple Attachments dialogue, it is only when attempting to save 2 or more files simultaneously. I'm hoping someone knows of a solution to this issue as this user can receive upwards of 10+ attachments
 in a single email for a project that they need to make available to a project folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They did not have this issue prior to the upgrade. Any thoughts or recommendations would be appreciated.</p>

<p>No, right now the issue is still being investigated and there are two workarounds described in the following article, you can keep monitoring it to get the latest update about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Save the documents to your own computer, and then copy them to the shared network drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Save the documents one at a time to the shared network drive.</p>

<h2>            Outlook mobile hanging while &#34;Looking for changes&#34;</h2>
                    <br />
I have WinMo 6 Standard with Outlook.&nbsp; Ive just recently started having a problem.&nbsp; (I've owned the phone - HTC Shadow for almost 2 years) When I&nbsp;try&nbsp;do a send/receive at the&nbsp;'looking for changes' screen my&nbsp;phone appears to be working but eventually the command
 stops and I've not received any new messages when I know that I should have. Sometimes this can take minutes to complete.&nbsp; My provider is T-Mobile.&nbsp; I've spoken to customer service and been told to&nbsp;create a new email account.&nbsp; I've done this, while keeping&nbsp;my
 original at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've had the same problem with the new account as well. Somedays everything works as it should, on others I experience the above problem.&nbsp; Tmo wants me to do a hard reset but I'm not convinced the problem is the software.&nbsp; I have
 a suspicion it's with there servers.&nbsp; Is it possible that Outlook has been corrupted?&nbsp; How can I trouble shoot this?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

            Backup the entire contents of your device to your storage card (you may need to install 3rd party backup software, like
<a href="http://www.spbsoftwarehouse.com/smartphone-software/backup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SPB Backup</a> ,&nbsp; to the device to do this).&nbsp; Then perform a hard reset, set the email up and see if you have any problems.&nbsp; If not, then there was something on your device that was causing
 the problem, and you'll need to reinstall software, and set things up from scratch (do not restore from your backup file).&nbsp; If you still have problems after the hard reset, then your problems are caused by something else, and you can restore your backup file
 and be back to where you are right now in just a few moments.

<br />
Before doing the hard reset, remove the email account on your device, restart and re-create it.

    <title>Nokia N8 Vibrate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jakefone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia N8 Vibrate</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, i'm getting annoyed with my N8 because when its on silent it only vibrates for about half a second when i text message comes through. All of my other phones have vibrated at least twice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vibrate is very weak to so you have no chance of feeling it unless you have skin tight trousers on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know its too late to change the strengh of the vibrate now the phones been made but maybe an option as to how long in seconds you want the phone to vibrate for would be a good option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>maybe if Nokia could change this in there upcoming firmware update or if anyone knows off an application to do the trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I've changed the ringing tone from off to message sound 1.</p>
<p>That's let it vibrate twice now for each message so its a little better, could have done with it being more like 3 or 4 times though</p>

            Try custom midi ringtone. Some ringtones have special note for vibrations.

            Hi Ed,
<br />Do you use Outlook desktop software for email?  It appears you have it set as the default for mailto links but don't have a profile set up properly.

<p>When you click on an email link, Windows looks for a <em>program</em> to use to send email. It looks as if you have Office Outlook on your computer, but it hasn't been set up to send mail. You can't use webmail (i.e. Outlook.com) to open an email link. You
 would have to copy the address behind the link, then use Outlook.com to send email to that address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, follow the instructions in the error message to set up the Office Outlook program to send and receive.</p>

            What type of email account do you have configured in Outlook? POP, IMAP, Outlook.com, or Microsoft Exchange?  
<br />Is Outlook open when you try to use the mailto link? 
<br />
<br />Is this a newish computer and you installed office over the preinstalled version? Its possible the preinstalled 'windows store' version is the problem.

<p>In Word 2010, you cannot do this directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Acrobat you can tell Acrobat to recognize text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the OCR function in OneNote if you have that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, you can find converters online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chances that you will have a document you want to edit in Word when you get done are small. Converted documents are usually filled with formatting anomalies that make them real pains to edit. If it were me, I would probably get the text via OCR and paste
 that into Word as plain text. I would proofread that text, and then format in Word.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have installed Office Professional Plus 2016 on windows 10 machine. it generates an Aria-debug log file while excel is open until C driver is full and the computer hangs. I've found somewhere that there is an issue with onedrive. I uninstalled onedrive
 but the issue still persists. Could someone please help?.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>

<h2>            User updated Outlook 2016 &#40;15.21.1&#41; and now she is no longer prompted for her password</h2>
                    
<p>My user likes to keep her data secure. &nbsp;She does not save her email password in Outlook, and prefers it to prompt every time she opens Outlook. &nbsp;Ever since updating to 15.21.1 this week, her password prompts went away. &nbsp;Our email is provided through an Office
 365 tenant account. &nbsp;I've deleted the Exchange entries from the Keychain and confirmed 100% that the password is not saved. &nbsp;In fact, if I change the password (in Outlook 2016) to something random, it doesn't seem to phase Outlook. &nbsp;Even though the password
 is 100% not correct, Outlook is still able to connect, send and receive new email! &nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize this is sort of the opposite of what others have been experiencing, but has anyone seen this? &nbsp;Is there a fix?</p>

<p>hi applebottom5693,</p>
<p>yes, the scenario from your side is apparently opposite to what other users might be experiencing. to troubleshoot the issue, i’d like to confirm the following information first:<br />
1. how did the user set up her account in the outlook 2016 for mac client? via exchange (auto-configuration) or imap/pop?<br />
2. to check if the issue can be reproduced from our side. please provide the detailed settings you’ve set up to let the outlook for mac application prompt for password at every start. some related screenshots are appreciated. to upload pictures, please click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> and <strong>insert/edit media</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ef300f13-641d-4d48-84c4-03dcc8e5c38e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3def300f13-641d-4d48-84c4-03dcc8e5c38e" /></a><br />
<br />
3. if possible, could you take some time to test if the issue can be replicated on another mac device? also, to identify whether it is more related to the account or the client, please try setting up another office 365 account on the affected device and check
 the issue.<br />
4. to make sure the issue has nothing to do with the old profile, please try to create a new profile and check if there is any improvement. for more information:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-profiles-in-outlook-2016-for-mac-fed2a955-74df-4a24-bef6-78a426958c4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">manage profiles in outlook 2016 for mac</a></p>
<p>and regarding ‘password changing doesn’t seem to phase outlook’, generally, the old password will stay valid for some time after modification due to cache. in some cases, the duration might be several hours. thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>we are looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />

<p>Because my Mobile is logged into Outlook&nbsp;I will see logins during the night time even if&nbsp;both my devices are turned off during this period - my mobile phone and PC eg both and only devices I personally use to access my Outlook account ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If answer is still yes could you explain what is accessing my Outlook account when I am switched off?</p>

<h3> randybw57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013&#58; View Settings get reset in Search</h2>
                    I am in my Inbox.
<div>I click in the Search All Mail Items box and enter a search string.</div>
<div>The results get built. The view is not like I want it.</div>
<div>I click View, then View Settings.</div>
<div>I make the changes I want.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Those changes seem to last during my session.</div>
<div>But get lost when I reboot.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>

            Sure,

<div>
<ul>
<li>I'm in my Inbox (for my Yahoo IMAP account)</li><li>I click in the box for 'Search All Mail Items'</li><li>I enter a search word</li><li>The view changes to 'Search'</li><li>And here is where I noticed that the view was not like it was when I set it up.</li><li>For example, the Reading Pane is on the Right. And I had it Off.</li><li>I click on the View tab.</li><li>I click on View Settings.</li><li>I change the setting I want to change. &nbsp;For example, I changed to font to size 10, I turned off the Reading Pane</li><li>Finally, I click OK in the Advanced View Settings: Compact window.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<div><br />

<div>Is it possible that these settings could get lost if the pc was rebooted without Outlook being shutdown first? &nbsp;I think I have seen this happen when updates are applied to Windows.&nbsp;</div>

            I just saw on windowsphone.com that you can actually use windows media player to sync and don't have to stick with the "windows phone app for desktop" which is what I referred to as the Sync App. &nbsp;I'll try media player tonight as I believe I can import
 my zune play lists into there and check everything out.

            Hello SwaibuMnandi 
<br />
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, My name is Miguel T. I'm an independent Advisor  
<br />
<br />Your Skype name is the username you created when you first joined Skype, other than your email address or phone number.
<br />
<br />If you sign in with an email address or phone number instead, then you have a Microsoft account, not a Skype Name.
<br />
<br />This is named as SKYPE ID
<br />
<br />To find out you Skype ID, with Skype Client open up, Click your Profile at the top left of Skype.
<br />
<br />Your Skype name is displayed in your profile like: the picture below:
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this information has been useful, please let me know if you still need assistance.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0557aa1-c583-495d-be2a-bf6078f11eb4?upload=true" />

    <title>Windows 10 Windows Defender versus Microsoft Security Essentials - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryan1000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Windows Defender versus Microsoft Security Essentials</h2>
                    <p>I had MSE on Win 7 Pro before I upgraded. MSE is still in my Win 10. The upgrade was perfect. However now on every start-up I'm left with a message "WINDOWS DEFENDER This app has been turned off and isn't monitoring your comp...etc." But MSE is monitoring.
 MSE is obviously seeing Windows Defender as 'another app'. If I try to remove MSe it won't allow it. I've upgraded another computer which had Windows Defender set on Win7 and there is no notification on its start-up.</p>
<p>The start-up pop-up is a nuisance only but it would be nice to have a clean startup each time.</p>
<p>Any solutions gratefully accepted.</p>

            <p>Hi Bryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Security Essentials was upgraded to Windows defender and it was a default security software from Windows 8. You cannot have both as they are one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you get this annoying popup at the startup i suggest you&nbsp;to disable&nbsp;any Microsoft Security Essentials entries in Startup tab.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<span>Open the Task manager.&nbsp; by pressing Press CTRL+Shift+ESC.</span></li><li>
<span>click on Startup tab</span></li><li>
<span>Right click on </span>Microsoft Security Essentials entry and click on Disable.</li></ol>
<span>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Restart the&nbsp; computer and check if that helps.</p>

<p>Hi Erika,</p>
<p>Yeah, you are right.&nbsp; In Exchange 2010 Service Pack 1 (SP1) Exchange introduc a feature that allows Outlook 2007 and later version clients to automatically map to any mailbox to which a user has Full Access permissions.</p>
<p>If a user is granted Full Access permissions to another user's mailbox or to a shared mailbox, Outlook automatically loads all mailboxes to which the user has full access.</p>
<p>As IMAP doesn’t support the auto-mapping feature, the shared mailbox is not able to appear in the Outlook client.&nbsp; Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>The Outlook for iOS and the iPhone built-in app don’t support us to view the shared mailbox yet.&nbsp; However we can view it in the OWA for iOS App.</p>
<p>Furthermore, could you send the service ticket number to us via private message, so I can help you to check it?</p>
<p>I have sent you a Private Message to collect it. Please perform the following steps to check it:</p>
<p>1. Go to the&nbsp;<b>Your details</b>&nbsp;section on the right side of the community site.</p>
<p>2. Click the&nbsp;<b>Private Message</b>.</p>
<p>3. Click the subject title of the response to read the message.</p>

<h2>            Not able to open or create emails - possible upgrade required&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have opened up outlook this morning to find that I am unable to open up received emails - I can see the list of new emails received, however when I click on them, they simply advise they are "loading" and a blank screen is visible and that is it.&nbsp; Likewise
 - I am unable to create an email to send out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that in my 'junk folder' there is an email there with a heading "Email Alert - Complete account upgrade" - I obviously cannot open this to check the email is legitimate.&nbsp; If I do need to upgrade my account - how can I do this without being able
 to access my email??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate some technical advice (I am not technical by the way - so advice in the basic format would be greatly appreciated :) ) - It is imperative that I access my account today (21 MAR 2016).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            Same issue, I can open my Account, al emails listed, new and old, but you cant open them, it just shows a white screen. having same problem for 24 hours. Also cant delete, and there is NO drop down box to Log Off. Same problem on 2 of my Laptops, My mobile
 phone and my Ipad, so dont say it is a problem at our end, its on your end! I was told my Account was migrated, what ever that is, and now it does not work. My wifes account works fine on all tese devices, mine does not. So stop trying to remotley access my
 patop to delete Cookies, it is not my Laptop that has the fault,

            Nothing to do with what you have written. It has only been happening since last night. And it is on ANY Device the same problem occurs, Ipad, Laptop, Mobile. There is a Problem with Outlook, not the devices

            <p>I have exactly the same problem - first occurred 21st March and still active this morning - yet on 20th March everything was OK...what's changed Bill (Gates) ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access my account from all browsers, and on my Laptop and desktop (both Windows 10 devices).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see all my old and new messages, all my folders, everything but can't do a darn thing - nothing works, no drop down menus, no logoff menu, and when I "open" a new email to read it I get a white screen that doesn't change (yes, I left it sitting there
 for a couple of hours while I did other things just in case the system was busy 'processing' something).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's going on ?, I depend upon Outlook to stay in touch with my family overseas as well as dealing with all my personal business affairs...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One thing I HAVE noticed is that the Calendar function in Outlook 365 has suddenly massively improved performance - it was painfully slow last Friday but I noticed yesterday when I first logged on at work that it had been sorted and was back to performing
 like it did 6 months ago with virtually instant response...now I'm wondering if the changes to Outlook code to fix the calendar performance has somehow affected outlook hotmail ????</p>
