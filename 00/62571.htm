<h2>            windows 10 privacy</h2>
                    OK Microsoft. You have a lot of pissed off customers at you. why on earth are you collecting so much private information on us. Your privacy policy is the reason why I stopped using Windows 10. If you want Windows 10 to continue to be a success for you
 then you should stop collecting such information when users install Windows 10 or have your stupid intrusive privacy policy as opt-out on default and leave up to the users to decide for themselves if they want to share such information with you. furthermore,
 where do you get off on having a keylogger installed on the operating system. You obviously didn't listen to the user base. In the past I your have always had a great privacy policy, but ever since the disaster of Windows 8 and even Windows 10 for that matter
 you are going back 30 years. I demand that you stop with this current privacy policy. I demand that you include more details regarding the patches you role out, I demand that you give the control of what updates we as the user in

</p><p>this is so depressing than I decide to totally turn off my windows update service</p>
<p>and I even delete the windows update from my start menu</p>
<p>because I know that the next updates is going to be about windows 10 or some tracking data **** file</p>
<p>it's so sad that microsoft is acting like that</p>
<p>after million of people put their trust to microsoft for years</p>
<p>and now that trust come to an end with windows 10</p>
<p>I can't wait to see</p>
<p>what is going to happen</p>
<p>when Microsoft will end the support for windows 7 in 2020</p>
<p>microsoft is going to lose million of users&nbsp;</p>
<p>who won't upgrade to windows 10 not even for free</p>
<p>I guess in the end we will keep running our computers with windows 7</p>
<p>without the microsoft support or swap to an alternative like linux or whatever is available &nbsp;</p>

<p>I installed Windows 7 over Linux just because of what I heard of Windows 10.&nbsp; I am so disappointed with the Windows privacy policy and their open spying on their customers that I am a hairs breathe away from putting Linux back on it if Microsoft does not
 change their ways.&nbsp; I was quit happy with Ubuntu and may be again if something does not change and for the better.</p>

            So basically I would go back to linux. I ended up going back to Linux all together minus my wife's computer. I have a WSUS server setup at my house and I block everything from Microsoft until I can get around to looking up the details on the update. I
 oppse everything Apple, Microsoft now. I will never use another client side OS again. Sucks I have to administer MS NOS and they are just as bad. Server 2016 is all of the same opt in privacy invasion. I am just looking from&nbsp; business prospective. I think
 MS has really screwed everyone with this kind of thinking. This is the same reason why I am not on an sort of Social Media. I don't need anyone data mining what i do on the internet and my history. Cookies are disabled. I don't like it one bit.<br />

            <p>For me the issue was with the pictures library. I had to delete and create again the "shortcuts" of the library. Then the app started normally.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: To re-create the "shortcuts" of the pictures libraries:</p>
<p>- Right-click on the start button.</p>
<p>- Click "run".</p>
<p>- Type "<em>shell:Libraries</em>" (without the quotes) and click Ok.</p>
<p>- Right-click on the pictures libraries and&nbsp;click Properties.</p>
<p>- Delete all the locations and add the correct ones.</p>

    <title>Game updates that are paused start by themselves after power on or - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vlaka123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game updates that are paused start by themselves after power on or reset</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p><p>Ever since the big layout update on xbox one I have had this problem. Due to having a slow internet connection I have to pause many of my game updates. Basically everytime I turn on or reset my console all of the updates I've paused actually resume&nbsp;on their own. I have gone through all the settings and I have the 'Keep console up to date' and 'Keep my games &amp; apps up to date' unchecked. I also have the 'Power mode &amp; startup' set to Energy saving. Is this a bug? Or is there a setting I have missed? Any help or info would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hey, Vlaka!</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm sorry to see any issues with automatic downloads!&nbsp;This is definitely weird, and I was immediately going to come in here and have you check those settings. Looks like you've got that covered!</p><p><br /></p><p>The last thing I would suggest is a <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">factory reset</a>. Since you do have such a slow connection, I&nbsp;suggest keeping your games &amp;&nbsp;apps first to see if that "console refresh" adjusts the operating system for you. This will ensure you don't have to reinstall all of your games.</p><p><br /></p><p>Let me know how that works for you!&nbsp;We may need to look at other options, but I feel this may get everything sorted out. :)</p><p><br /></p><p>--------------------------------------</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Hmmm, that sounds like a bigger issue might be going on. I know it will be a pain to download your games again, but have you tried the other factory reset option to wipe the console completely? The fact that the "keep my games&nbsp;&amp; apps"&nbsp;one didn't work at all suggests that the operating system didn't install properly on your console, and we'll need to start fresh. Let me know how that goes!&nbsp;:)</p><p><br /></p><p>--------------------------------------</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>with everyone's help I thought we had resolved issue</p>
<p>BUT ===</p>
<p>made W /7 pro backup system image of my system</p>
<p>deleted all (except Defender) anti virus, malware , and ad blockers</p>
<p>made sure all large files moved to external device. I have much more space than needed for new install</p>
<p>reinstalled new clean win 7 pro from my original disc received from Dell</p>
<p>followed your instructions and loaded W/ 10 from disc ( clean install ) </p>
<p>I think the <strong>shutdown and rebooting at startup</strong> was the key to installing as reboot is where my problem was, according to error message I repeatedly received from my many attempts of installing W / 10</p>
<p>YEA==successful installation</p>
<p>BUT ===</p>
<p>Could not activate == would not accept my original code I received with machine</p>
<p>so removed Win / 10 and reinstalled 7 pro from system image backup</p>
<p>tried to download 10 again early this morning and received same old error message of
<strong>reboot failure</strong></p>
<p>NEW ISSUE IS ==</p>
<p>if I am able to download 10 from internet I don't need code as Microsoft system, as I understand it, as it already recognises that my computer is, in fact, running an original authorized version of Win 7</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>where do we go from here? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone give me a new code? == repeated attempts have cost me dollars to buy extra GB's</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>I feel MS has really dropped ball on this</p>
<p>Those of us that are not IT specialists are having real problems with these issues</p>
<p>giving me a very bad taste for MS</p>
<p>Will recheck back later hopefully for a code to finally resolve this issue</p>

            <p>Wish you would have asked because there is never a reason to reinstall Windows 7 , just use the latest media provided in my earlier post to do a Custom install, skip Product Key during install then afterwards activate with Window 7 key.

<p>
</p><p>one other response I receive earlier is just mind boggling to me in it's complexity</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is what caused my comment concerning MS</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side comment what will happen when MS, as rumored, starts a forced automatic upgrade for W / 10</p>
<p>I have already spent, to me, a large sum buying extra GBs on this endeavour&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my instance if they tried a automatic download, and my reboot problem was unresolved, then I could envision a cycle of failures and additional expense</p>
<p>My view is that MS should have the capability to recognise issues on machines and have in place various patchs to automatically correct prior to starting the activation process</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps this is simplistic opinion&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4a. Did you activate (use) the Dell-preinstalled McAfee free-trialware?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4b. Did you ever uninstall the McAfee free-trialware?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5a. Is&nbsp;KB3124275, KB3124000, KB3124001, KB3121918, KB3109560, KB3110329, KB3108664, KB3121461, and/or KB3121212 listed in

            <p>I have to correct my reply.. for those who are having problems with the store and apps here is what I did and it worked</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Gather all the troubleshooting tips you can find except for those advance troubleshooting tips like refresh and reset your PC.
</p>
<p>2. Perform first the troubleshooting tips that don not require restart and then perform lastly those that require start.</p>
<p>3. start your PC in Clean Boot State then perform step 2.</p>
<p>4. start in safe mode and repeat step 2.</p>
<p>5. restart and repeat step 2.</p>
<p>6. restart and check if the store is working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>note: make sure no antivirus is running. It should be Disabled or uninstalled( preferably uninstalled, besides you have windows defender. if you want to install an antivirus. download all the apps you want and need first before installing it)</p>
<p>make sure also that you are signed in into a Microsoft account and has a good internet connection</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hope it helps :)</p>

<h2>            Xbox One X UPNP Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am having lag issues and I think it's due 
to ports not being opened correctly. When I check my netgear&nbsp;router i can see 
the following port is being used 3074 but what i dont understand is no 
other ports are being used.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If I check which ports fifa uses then I would have expected all the ports the game requires would be in the UPnP section??</p><p><br /></p><p>Can anyone check theirs and come back to me??<br /></p>

<p>Switching consoles shouldn't cause an issue unless you had purchased it on a different account. However, if you haven't already, try doing a license transfer (<a href="http://xbox.com/drm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com/drm</a>) and then redownload
 the content. Anything you've purchased can be redownloaded from your download history for free -

<h2>            Entry point not found error</h2>
                    <p>I've looked up solutions to this error, but i get it for almost every app i have on my pc except google chrome, it sends out a standard error message saying The procedure entry point could not be located in the dynamic link library and then Windows system32
 windows.storage.dll.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06106f63-993e-48d5-9a07-44775ec46016?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06106f63-993e-48d5-9a07-44775ec46016?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the picture i uploaded is what popped up when i treid opening valves steam app, the same thing popes up when i try to open anything besides chrome so if anyone could help with this i would be thankfull.</p>
<p>I also tried the cmd sfc/scannow to troubleshoot it and it showed nothing wrong, and to search every file that cant be located is alot of work so is there an actual fix to this or i have to manualy download each file that is "missing" and put it in there
 or do i have to reinstall windows? Im looking for a solution that doesnt involve the ones i mentioned so it saves me alot of time and trouble, thanks in advance.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Compatibility issue could be one of the reasons why the <strong>Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse</strong> stops working after installing the

I have a similar problem with System Files taking up 181GB of space. What was the issue with McAfee because I'm running that too?<br />

<h2>            What is the difference between windows 10 pro free and the bought version&#63;</h2>
                    What is the difference between the two of them? Do you get the same bell's and whistles or does the bought version have more? I had the Windows 7 Ultimate and upgraded to the free Windows 10 Pro when it was available. I'm buying a new hard drive and I
 want to know if I should buy a new Windows 10 Pro software or if I should just transfer what I have to the new hard drive?

            Hi  CJNoland, you should re-install your Intel PROSet\Wireless Bluetooth device drivers, click the link below to download that, then reinstalling that should resolve this error:

<h2>            Stop Windows 10 upgrade - won&#39;t let me &#39;cancel&#39;</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 7 on a Desktop and Windows 8.1RT on a recently purchased laptop.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 7 is a solid reliable system that lets me put 'non-running programs' on the desktop (where I prefer them) and shows 'task' (running programs) on the Taskbar where I'd like them to be.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 8.1 massively reduced my productivity by changing file folder Views at random and its annoying 'charms' bounce in randomly with the date etc when I move the mouse around, interrupting anything I'm doing.&nbsp; I also find the 'Start' menu with its programs
 running that I don't need get in the way..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short Windows 8 and 10 appear to step back to Windows Vista - lots of stuff that gets in the way and adds little - but also in the case of Windows 10 appears to have major inbuilt spying software that reports
 back what I do.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 'upgrade' icon appeared on my Desktop PC.&nbsp; I was offered reminder to install Windows 10 despite not knowingly asking to 'reserve' it.&nbsp; I followed the bulletin board advice to 'Cancel my reservation'.&nbsp; I found and used the 'Cancel reservation'
 option.&nbsp; However the Get W10 icon is still on my taskbar.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>To prevent it loading Win 10 I've set my Windows Update to 'manually approve installation'.&nbsp; When I use Windows Update I now get a list of Win 7 updates.&nbsp; When I select them and press 'OK' the "Get started" installing Windows 10&nbsp; dialog box pops up.&nbsp; It
 seems that I can't install W7 updates - and am being steered to simply upgrade to the unwanted W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me to finally bury Windows 10 upgrade?</p>
<p>

            <p>Thks for your note but unfortunately this doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had my GWX setting on the "Hide notifications..." since it first appeared but its still there.&nbsp; It simply 'moved' to the ^ (Hidden Icons) area.&nbsp;&nbsp; The procedure is also clearly still 'active' as my windows update will not let me install any updates unless
 I accept the W10 'upgrade'.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The last update that I manually 'accepted' without this was on 10/3 - before the date I was informed that the W10 'upgrade' was available.&nbsp; I now have 25 Win 7 updates waiting but the only way to get these appears to be to press "Get started" on the Win10
 upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems the only way forward is to install W10 and then go back to W7...</p>

            We shouldn't have to add an outside program to do what we want to do. &nbsp;These are our computers and when Windows 10 causes problems we should be able to say we don't want it, leave our computers alone!! &nbsp;I am not going to go buy another driver for my computer
 just because Windows keeps trying to force feed us windows 10. &nbsp;I had mistakenly "reserved" and copy, but doesn't matter. &nbsp;They just take over your computer and do what the heck they want to. &nbsp;I am not an apple person, but makes me wish I had an option to
 microsofts man handling of my computer. &nbsp;I bought and paid for Windows 7 and works beautifully. &nbsp;Windows 10 did as well but I began having connectivity problems. &nbsp;Twice in the past 2 hours they have tried to re-install Windows 10 again and I cannot get in
 touch with a "real" person or find the info I want. &nbsp;Imagine that.

            Hi Jamal.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is this a work PC or did you add a work or school account to it?  See here for an apps permission issue that might apply:  <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-camera-and-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you don't have Pro version where Group Policy has been set to manage settings, then it could be a bug, possible caused by your antivirus.  So I'd first uninstall you Anti-virus to try running with built-in Defender which always offers best Windows performance with least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.  
<br />
<br />See also the fixes here:  
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-update/windows-update-how-to-fix-some-settings-are/a5160e9d-21e8-4ecd-8218-6a6b88134748">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

<br />
<br />Usually one of these fixes will resolve it.
<br />
<br />If not go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            As an initial recommendation, we suggest that you disable the driver signature enforcement by following these steps:
<br />Click Start.
<br />
<br />Click the Power button.
<br />
<br />Hold the Shift key and click Restart.
<br />
<br />Choose Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options.
<br />
<br />Click Startup Settings.
<br />
<br />Click Restart again.
<br />
<br />Once your computer restarts, press F7 on your keyboard to select Disable driver signature enforcement. Your computer will now restart automatically.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists after disabling the driver signature verification, disable Secure Boot temporarily in your computer's UEFI/BIOS. You can contact your computer's manufacturer or check the device manual for the steps on how to do this.
<br />
<br />Important: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. 
<br />
<br />If you can't find the toggle to disable Secure Boot, a firmware update for the UEFI/BIOS may be required. This can usually be found in the manufacturer's website.
<br />
<br />After disabling Secure Boot, boot normally into Windows and check if you can install the programs. If you're successful, boot back into the UEFI/BIOS and re-enable Secure Boot since this is an important security feature.
<br />
<br />We look forward to your response and the results of the initial troubleshooting.
<br />
<br />If you are running Windows 10 Pro, Education or Enterprise
<br />
<br />Windows Key+R
<br />Type gpedit.msc in the box and hit Enter
<br />On the pop-up window, head to Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components
<br />Scroll down on Windows Components dialog, find and right-click on Data Collection and Preview Builds
<br />Then double-click on Allow Telemetry on the right pane
<br />Tick on Enabled and choose 3-Full from the drop-down menu.
<br />Then click OK to save settings
<br />Now you should see that the message is now gone

            Hi  Ibnu,
<br />
<br />1.
<br />If you are running Windows 10 Pro:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type gpedit.msc and hit Enter 
<br />
<br />Go to Computer Configuration - Administrative Templates - Windows Components 
<br />
<br />Scroll down and right-click on Data Collection and Preview Builds 
<br />
<br />Double-click on Allow Telemetry in the right pane 
<br />
<br />Check the option - Enabled and choose 3 - Full from the drop-down
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Now undo this change again:
<br />
<br />Double click on Allow Telemetry on the right pane 
<br />
<br />Set to Not Configured
<br />
<br />Then click OK to save settings 
<br />
<br />You should see that the message is now gone
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />If you are running Windows 10 Home:
<br />
<br />Boot into BIOS (Usually F2 or Del on the Manufacturers logo screen when your system starts 
<br />
<br />Turn off Secure Boot in BIOS (UEFI) settings 
<br />
<br />Check to see if this resolves this issue, if not turn Secure Boot back on . . .

<li>When shutting down, the laptop proceeds as normal until the screen turns off.</li><li>After the screen turns off, it takes a while for the battery LED to go off.</li><li>After that the power led remains on and it looks like the laptop is stuck in this state forever.</li><li>When I try to get my laptop to sleep, something similar happens; the power led remains on, the battery led turns off and the laptop appears to be stuck in this state.</li></ul>

            Hi 10gic, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />I think you're right, the only two options you'd have from now are to reinstall absolutely everything, and if that still doesn't work, you might need to contact ASUS for warranty in case it's a hardware issue.
<br />
<br />Like you said, you've already tried everything and it's possible that the issue only occurs in Windows because of the way Windows accesses your hardware. If it's a hardware issue then this could be the case.
<br />
<br />Here's the link for ASUS support:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.asus.com/uk/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.asus.com/uk/support/</a>

<br />Let me know if you have any other questions! Thanks!

<br />Can you try turning off Fast Startup which can adversely affect some systems including issues with long shutdown:

    <title>Phantom Account or extra user account is getting generated in Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ron da silva  say:</h3>
<h2>            Phantom Account or extra user account is getting generated in Windows 10 while giving administrative privilege to a user account.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Phantom Account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phantom Account &amp; Windows 10 </p>
<p>
</p><p>About two years ago I had three PCs in my home network. A Gateway desktop with Windows 7 Ultimate aboard, a Dell laptop also with Win 7 Ultimate and a Lenova laptop with Win 7 Pro. Some were older than that but that’s of no significance. About a week before
 Windows 10 was released I purchased a new MSI Dominator, 16GB, with Win 8.1 Home aboard … it is a fantastic machine. In all cases it was setup with myself as the administrator and an account for my godson who’s a college student … all with no logon passwords,
 no one else has access to my PCs. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as Win 10 was available I downloaded it to a thumb drive and updated the MSI. Because Win 8.1 Home was aboard it would only update to Win 10 Home. That was a headache. Some of my applications raised havoc, particularly Advance System Care, and I
 went through about ten reinstallations to get it somewhat tamed. After all the updates it has been running great for months.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a month ago I finally decided to update the Dell and Lenova laptops to Windows 10. All, because of the Windows aboard, were updated to Windows 10 Pro. There have been no problems and the logons remained password free. Think I did have to go through
 the ‘netplwiz’ bit on the MSI, but again, no problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now the problem begins. About two weeks ago I finally got around to upgrading the Gateway desktop to Windows 10, because of the Win version Pro was installed. Because it was finding disk problems I should’ve seen the handwriting on the wall. But it worked
 ok for a short time. At the end of last week the hard drive gave out so I purchased a Lenova desktop with Win 10 Home. I set it up with the same two usual accounts checked on update and Windows 10 set about reinstalling itself. On the two accounts, myself
 as the administrator and an account for my Godson, Victor, I went through the ‘netplwiz’ bit and unchecked users must use passwords … to no avail. Tried to change passwords, after inputting the password and leaving the updates blank … would not work. I then
 tried to give Victor administrator rights and that’s when a phantom logon appeared. The two accounts, myself and Victor’s, were also there. The phantom did not work unless you checked the right box, input an email address and password. So, I removed Victor’s
 account and he and the phantom Victor disappeared. I then added Victor’s account back in. So far so good, only two accounts appeared at logon. I again tried the ‘netplwiz’ to remove passwords … again to no avail. I then again tried to give Victor administrator
 privileges and then the phantom Victor reappeared. So, seeing what I thought was the problem I again removed Victor’s account knowing the next time I wouldn’t be trying to give him administrator rights. Oops, this time the phantom Victor remained. I checked
 the registry for “Victor” … not found. Is ‘netplwiz’ the culprit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see where many others have had a similar problem and there seems to be no resolve from Microsoft. In all instances while updating to Windows 10, when a prior version of Windows was aboard, there was no problem with account passwords, all were carried over
 … no passwords. Windows 10 Pro was updated on three of my PCs. Is it possible that this problem does not exist with the Pro version? If three of my PCs had advanced version of Windows whereby Windows 10 Pro was available why not their replacements purchased
 with a Home version of Windows? But, that’s a horse of a different color. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There has to be resolve from Microsoft in removing phantom accounts. There has to be a somewhat simpler way in setting up accounts in Windows 10, particularly assigning password privileges.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>It was the unchecking of 'Users must enter a user name and password' in 'Netplwiz' when the phantom account appeared. Returned the check and the phantom disappeared. Was then able to automatically logon without a password with my administrative account but
 that was only a trial test. Was unable to automatically logon with the 'Victor' account. Working on that, think I know the answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many helpful hints at tenforums dot com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still think a single accounts window to setup accounts would simplify this matter.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks but I had already tried most of those options. The answer was so simple I can't believe I didn't spot it at first glance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some were questioning whether Netplwiz was causing the "Phantom Account" ... that was probably true in many cases because MS did not clearly state the procedure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When one goes through the Netplwiz routine instructions tell you to <strong>select
</strong><strong>user</strong>, <strong>uncheck</strong> must enter a password, <strong>
enter and confirm password</strong> to automatically sign in. It automatically fills in a user name, one would assume that Microsoft would automatically fill it in with the name selected. It doesn't, so assumed that MS was just creating a short cut. That's
 what creates the phantom account and no automatic sign ins. <strong>One must replace the user name, filled in by MS, with the actual user name ... the full MSN account name if it's an MSN account, i.e., *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
</strong>No phantoms appeared and auto signed in. Had no problem with this on my PCs with prior versions of Windows aboard when updating to Windows 10, it defaulted to my original settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to my post, still upset when my PCs that had Windows Ultimate and Pro aboard were updated to Windows 10 the Pro version was installed. But, my two latest PCs, replacements, came with Win 8.1 Home and Win 10 Home so had to settle for the Home version
 of Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been with PCs since there was a Radio Shack Model 1, TRSDOS. Since then have been through all Windows versions subsequent to that. Windows 10 is ok ... once I figure out all the tweaks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            No administrator rights in Windows 7</h2>
                    Hello people!
<div>Well, this has been a long journey and I'm at my wits end here.&nbsp;</div>
<div>My problem arose back in December when I tried updating to the newest version of Itunes on my Toshiba Laptop. It was always related to not having access to specific directories...at first I thought it was an Apple issue and have spent all these months
 reading their community support and pretty much doing everything I have seen there, with no success.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Last month I tried updating Adobe Flash Player and I get errors of the same sort...so that's why I'm writing here in the Windows Community...could this be my solution?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's the error message I get when trying to update Itunes:</div>
<div><b>Error writing to file: C \Program Files (x86) Common Files\ Apple\ Mobile Device Support\ AppleMobileDeviceHelper.resources\ clientdescription.plist. verify that you have access to that directory</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>Here´s the error message I get when trying to update Adobe Flash Player:</div>
<div><b>User does not have sufficient privileges to install Adobe Flash Player</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>My operating system is Windows 7 Home Premium and I only have one user account on my laptop, and it's mine as administrator...so this baffles me. I haven't been able to sync my Ipods in 6 months and I've been pretty close to throwing my laptop out the
 window:).&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please help!!!!!</div>
                </div>

            This is a standard UAC message. Here are a couple of methods to deal with it:
<div>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the installation program, then left-click "Run as administrator".</li><li>Temporarily turn off UAC.</li></ul>

The phrase "No luck" is wide open to interpretation. It would be interesting to know exactly happened when you tried each of my two suggestions.

            Here is what your report tells me:
<div>
<ul>
<li>Your account has admin privileges.</li><li>You have full access to the Apple folder.</li><li>Nobody else has any access to this folder. This is entirely inappropriate.</li><li>You are unable to access the file "ClientDescription.plist", which is the cause of your problem.</li></ul>
<div>Something or someone has modified some file/folder permissions in the Program Files folder. Malware? Here are the options I see for you:</div>

<ul>
<li>Seize ownership of the Program Files (x86) folder, then grant everyone full access. This
