    <title>Individual ringtone saved for Contact does not work - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Individual ringtone saved for Contact does not work</h2>
                    <p>Lumia 950 XL - 14393.189 build. Yesterday, I downloaded the Zedge ringtone app from the Store, and&nbsp;downloaded individual ringtone and text tones for two contacts. Different ringtones and text tones were saved to both contacts. Both ringtone and text tone
 work for contact #1, but only the text tone works for the contact #2. The ringtone heard for #2 is the overall one set under Sounds, which is what you hear for anyone without an individual&nbsp;ringtone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've a tried soft reset and changing back to other tones not downloaded from the app. I also deleted and re-entered the contact. None of this has worked. I keep getting the overall ringtone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not appear that the desired ringtone for contact #2 is corrupt because I tested it on contact #1 and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like the file for contact #2 may be corrupt, but deleting and re-entering did not fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have ideas or the same problem?</p>
<p />

            W10M has several ringtones. Try some of those for individual contacts. Perhaps there is something wrong with the Zedge ringtones?

<p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually fixed the problem by deleting and re-entering the contact a second time. The ringtone now works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time, I deleted the contact from the profile screen vs. the contact list, and then quickly re-added it. The second time, I deleted it from the profile screen as well, but also from the contact list.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it was a function of how quickly I re-entered the contact after deleting it the first time. Perhaps the deletion was not instantaneous. Or maybe&nbsp;you have to also make&nbsp;sure the contact is not in the list when deleting it from the profile screen.</p>

<h2>            Finding Duplicates in a Mailing List - Excel</h2>
                    I currently have a mailing list with over 5000 rows from which I am trying to weed out duplicates. I need to find, and copy these duplicates to another sheet. There are multiple column criteria but I am really only interested in two of them: columns B
 and E, last name and address. I am looking to find instances where both the last name and the address are duplicates. Also, in some instances the address may not be identical (ex: Park Avenue Apt 10 vs. Park Avenue #10). I would like to be able to still identify
 these instances. So in summary, I am trying to find instances of people with matching last names, living at the same address. I need to be able to highlight and copy these items to another sheet, so they cannot be deleted. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

            <span>Hi,
<br />
<br />
Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community and posting the question. <br />
<br />
I understand that you’re unable to remove/disable Access from Office 2007.<br />
<br />
I will assist you to resolve this issue. <br />
<br />
We need to have the installation source to troubleshoot the described issue, as Office installation is corrupted. You might even start experiencing other issues while working with Office applications.<br />
<br />
Provide additional information for better assistance:<br />
<br />
1) How was the Office suite installed? Did it come pre-installed or did you install it?
<br />
<br />
2) Which edition of Office suite did you purchase? <br />
If you’ve purchase Microsoft Office Professional 2007, Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 or Microsoft Office Small Business 2007 and have the product key for same, you may download the backup media from the following link:<br />
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/office/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/office/downloads/</a>
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
3) After downloading the Office suite, you may uninstall the existing installation and then re-install it.
<br />
Follow the instructions mentioned in the link below for instructions on how to uninstall the Office suite:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928218</a><br />
Note: Ensure that you have the installation source and the product key before uninstalling the Office suite.<br />
<br />
I hope the above information helps. Reply with necessary information and the result for further assistance.<br />
<br />
Thank You.</span>

            It is nice to see that you too recommend removing the cookie itself - that is what I said too and using the web site that I provided does just that.&nbsp; Incidentally, I did identify the cookie first then checked after ScorecardReseach web site was asked to
 remoive their cookie and I can confirm that the cookie had been removed.

<p>Well, I wouldn't advise going to their site to get rid of their cookie. I wouldn't be going there again, but that's just me.

<p>Hi NateSavona,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>Could you also try the following steps and check the result?</p>
<p>1. Add the following sites to trusted sites. Below are the detailed steps:</p>
<p>1) Click <b>Tools</b> button and <b>Internet options</b>.</p>
<p>2) Click the <b>Security</b> tab, and the click <b>Trusted sites</b> &gt; <b>Sites</b>.</p>
<p>3) In the <b>Add this website to the zone</b> section, add 
https://*.sharepoint.com, https://*.microsoftonline.com and
https://*.microsoft.com.</p>
<p>4) Close this window, and return to the <b>Security</b> tab, choosing <b>Local Intranet</b> &gt;
<b>Sites</b> &gt; <b>Advanced</b>.</p>
<p>5) In the <b>Add this website to the zone</b> section, add <b>*.sharepoint.com</b>,
<b>*.microsoftonline.com</b> and <b>*.microsoft.com</b>.</p>
<p>6) Restart Internet explorer and try opening the invitation link with Internet Explorer again.</p>
<p>2. Check whether a third-party service or program is conflicting with Internet Explorer by following this KB article:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956196</a>.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your phone might restart constantly if there is an issue with the software, hardware and others. We suggest that you check if there are any phone updates available by going to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update</strong> <strong>&amp; security</strong> &gt;
<strong>Windows</strong> <strong>update</strong> &gt; <strong>Check</strong> <strong>
for</strong> <strong>updates</strong>. This is to make sure that software improvements are installed on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to the blacked out apps on your phone, it could be the app data from your old SD card. This usually happens if you reformat the SD card from where apps are installed and stored. The best way to uninstall or remove it from your phone is to perform
 a <strong>hard</strong> <strong>reset</strong>. Take note that this method will <strong>
remove</strong> <strong>all</strong> files on your phone and it can rule out any software issues. Make sure to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17232/windows-10-mobile-back-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a backup</a></strong> so you can avoid data loss and to easily restore files. You can perform a reset by going to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong> &gt; <strong>
Reset</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>phone</strong>. The process might take a little while to complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any questions.</p>

            <p>Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
Thank you for opting Windows 8.<br />
<br />
I need certain information before I approach for the resolution:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div>Do you get any error message while using it?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would suggest you to uninstall the Bing bar and reinstall it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please use the following steps to uninstall the Bing bar:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Press Windows and x key simultaneously.<br />
2) Select control panel.<br />
3) Open Programs and features.<br />
4) Double click on the Bing bar program and follow the onscreen instruction to uninstall.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After uninstalling, please download the Bing bar from the following link and install it:</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>These steps did not fix the issue, as a matter of fact the reinstall of the Bing Toolbar removed "Slacker Radio" from the options entirely, and that was the one I was really using.&nbsp; None of the icons function.&nbsp; They will let me know what they are for, but
 when I click them, nothing happens.</p>
<p>Your instructions are the steps that I did before contacting you for assistance.&nbsp; I've been around the block with computers for many years and know what I am doing.&nbsp; I've basically "felt my way around" Windows 8 and found various ways into the "old" control
 panel and other settings.&nbsp; I've been working with computers since early DOS days and sometimes wish that we never left certain points.</p>
<p>This change occured after an automatic install of 13-15 updates for Windows 8.&nbsp; As a matter of fact those updates messed with my Palm Pilot Desktop program (for my Palm TX - yes it is old, but it was previously syncronizing, even with Windows 8!).&nbsp; Now the
 calendar is totally gone in that program.&nbsp; I've reinstalled that program and nothing changed!&nbsp; I am highly frustrated!!!</p>
<p>In general I was very impressed with Windows 8, but if this is any indication of what is to come, I will be highly disappointed.</p>
<p>I've had Norton 360 check out my registry and it cleared quite a few issues, but others it seemed to leave and just mark as "problems."&nbsp; I assume that I am running into issues with this program and will need to get an upgrade from Norton for the new Windows
 8 environment.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any other suggestions - I really liked that Big Toolbar and it seems that I am not alon e in having issues.</p>

<h2>            Sleep option missing in 10240</h2>
                    <p>I have a stock Dell XPS8700. &nbsp;Windows 10166 seemed to be solid. &nbsp;Computer entered sleep mode per the power setting. &nbsp;Yesterday WU upgraded me to 10240 and i noticed that it would no longer enter sleep mode. &nbsp;I checked in the power settings and there is no
 sleep setting. &nbsp;Just turn off moniter after xx minutes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where is sleep mode?</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I checked WU yesterday, it had a new nVidia video driver update and build 10240. &nbsp;Somehow the video driver install messed up. Today I uninstalled the video driver and all the related software and reverted to the driver I was using on 10166 and the sleep
 option is back. &nbsp;Fixed!</p>

<h2>            Yammer open graph</h2>

<p>
</p><p>Is there a test tool to validate how Yammer fetches open graph metadata? I'm using an open graph URL and posting it in Yammer. I noticed that the thumbnail loaded is not correct and sometimes quite old. It seems cached.</p>
<p>A tool to validate which data Yammer is fetching would be great. </p>

<h2>            Mail Merge Skipping E-Mail Addresses</h2>
                    Word mail merge (MS Office 2013) is skipping e-mail addresses.&nbsp; All of the information from my Excel spreadsheet is merging into my&nbsp; letter in Word.&nbsp; When I check the "Recipients" in Word, all of the e-mail addresses are there. When I merge the information
 into my letter and click the "Merge" to e-mail the letters, it looks like all of the letters are being sent.&nbsp; When I check my "Sent Mail", not all of the e-mail addresses appear to have sent.&nbsp; I have tried merging and sending just one of the missing e-mails;
 but, it still will not send.&nbsp; This is happening with every group of mail merge letters I attempt to e-mail.&nbsp; Why would the mail merge skip random e-mail addresses.&nbsp; If I have multiple people from one company getting the letter, some of the letters will send
 and some will not.&nbsp; Help!!

            <p>I cannot explain what is happening, but as a work-around, you might try using the Merge with Attachments facility on my Merge Tools Add-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can download the MergeTools – 20150422.dotm Add-in that I created from the following page

<p><span><span><strong><span>Do NOT open the MergeTools – 20150422.dotm file.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></strong></span><span><span>(There are no user serviceable parts inside and it should NOT be used as the basis for creating your mail merge main document.)<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The MergeTools – 20150422.dotm file needs to be saved in the Word Startup folder.&nbsp;
</span><span>In Windows Vista and Windows 7, 8 or 8.1, and 10, the default location for that folder is
</span><span><br />
C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
<br />
If you do not see the AppData folder: - <br />
<br />
In Windows 7, - In Windows Explorer, click on the Organize drop down and then on Folder and search options and in the Folder Options dialog, go to the View tab and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to
 uncheck the box for "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
<br />
In Windows 8,</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>8.1 or 10, in the File Explorer, click on Options on the View tab of the ribbon and then on the View tab in the dialog that appears and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp;
 While there, it is a good idea to uncheck the box for "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".
</span><span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>When that has been done and Word is started\re-started, the tab shown below will be added to the Ribbon:

</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><br />
</span></span></span><span><span><span>The requirements for using the system are:</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>The mail merge main document must be of the Letter type, though that does not mean that the output cannot be sent as an e-mail message.
</span></span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>For the Many To One, Merge with Attachments and Merge to Individual Docs utilities, the data source may be either a table or query in an Access database, or in the form of
 an Excel worksheet and that worksheet must be the first sheet in the Excel workbook. If the data is on some other sheet, you can easily move that sheet so that it is the first sheet in the workbook by clicking on the sheet tab and dragging it to the left.
<span>&nbsp;</span>For the Chart Merge utility, download the Mail Merging with Charts document that is also on that page of my OneDrive for additional requirements of the data source for use with that utility<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the field names must be in the first row of the worksheet and there must be a field name in all of the cells in that
 row that are within the range of columns that contain the data.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>For both types of data source, the field names must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character
 (0-9). <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The&nbsp;number of characters in the field names, including spaces, must not be more than 40.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the data must start in the second row of the worksheet and there should be no empty rows within the range of data that
 is to be processed.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>If there are multiple addressees in either the To or CC fields of the data source, the email addresses need to be separated by a semi-colon.</span></span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span><span>NOTE: The MergeTools applications cannot handle “Compound” MergeFields such as the «AddressBlock» or «GreetingLine».</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Instead of using those fields, you will need to insert the individual merge fields.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may also want to download:</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>the Merging with Attachments document that is also on that page which explains how the system is used.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is not actually necessary to have separate attachments as the facility can be used to send just the documents created by the merge itself as attachments, either as the body of the message itself or in the form of Word files or .pdf files.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>the Mail Merging with Charts document that is also on that page.<span>&nbsp;

    <title>How do I change the time my calendar daily schedule is emailed&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vigilante  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change the time my calendar daily schedule is emailed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This seems like a simple thing but there is just no option to change it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like getting the "daily schedule" email from my calendars, because I have a lot of daily tasks. The problem is, the email is being delivered half way through the day! It doesn't do any good to get my agenda for the day when multiple appointments have already
 past!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I got the email at 11:13AM, complete after one of my morning appointments. Frankly that is just a bit useless really.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is there a way these can be delivered some time BEFORE my tasks are scheduled? Perhaps deliver it first thing 12am, that would make sense, especially if I have a 1AM appt!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are you using any email client to access your account? </li><li>Where there any changes made to your account or system prior to the issue?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure your address is added on the registered email addresses for calendar notification. And check if your notification is turn on. You can try to locate that by clicking the cog/gear icon on the top right part of your calendar. Then click Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

            <p>I use many email clients, on my phone, or Thunderbird, or directly from the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what "changes" you mean. I pretty much just started using the calendar and testing it with various scheduled tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notifications are ON and of course my email is registered, that's how I got the scheduled task notifications!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I'm saying is, I have no control over when the calendar sends me the daily agenda. But it should be obvious that they should not be sending the daily agenda hours after you have scheduled events.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general I would encourage MS to either give us the option of setting a time for this agenda to be emailed, OR do the obvious thing and email it at 12:00AM so we get it long before the day begins.</p>

    <title>weighted average of filtered data and excluding blanks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> orfishome  say:</h3>
<h2>            weighted average of filtered data and excluding blanks</h2>
                    <p>I have a large spreadsheet with three columns of pertinent data.&nbsp; Column A is a loan type (text) , column B is a loan balance ($), and column C is a borrower debt service coverage ratio (#.##).&nbsp; Data begins in row 3 and continues through row 748.&nbsp; Columns
 A and B are fully populated; however, only some of the rows in column C have an entry.&nbsp; I need to be able to filter column A to show only a certain loan type and then calculate a weighted average debt service coverage ratio using&nbsp;columns B and&nbsp;C.&nbsp; The weighted
 average should only consider those rows with a value in column C.&nbsp; I've tried using sumproduct and subtotal(109), but that doesn't seem to&nbsp;exclude the rows in column C that are blank.&nbsp; Treating those rows as zero values skews the average.&nbsp; Can anyone help?&nbsp;
 Thanks so much.</p>

            <p>Scott,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think we&nbsp;have different understanding of what we're trying to calculate here.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the way I understand you want to do it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Column A&nbsp;is simply text and is a flag for the rows we want to include.</p>
<p>Column B are numbers we want the average of</p>
<p>Column C is the weighting we apply to get that average.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that's the correct way around then the formula I gave you is correct. For the data set below the weighted average of the 2 relevant rows in Col B is 15. If we add a 4 to row&nbsp;2 then the weighted average becomes 17.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT((A1:A4="aaa")*(B1:B4)*(C1:C4))/SUMPRODUCT((A1:A4="aaa")*(C1:C4))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, You seem to be saying we are averaging column C and column B is the weighting and if that's correct then we need a different formula. We need this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT((A1:A4=E1)*(B1:B4)*(C1:C4))/SUMPRODUCT((A1:A4=E1)*(B1:B4)*(C1:C4&lt;&gt;""))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the data below this produces a weighted average of 5. because both numbers in Col C are the same so the weighting is not relevant. If you add a 4 to row&nbsp;2 the weighted average then becomes 4.576923. You can demonstrate the weighting is working by putting
 the 4 in row&nbsp;2 and getting 4.576923 and then putting a zero against that in Col B. Because the weighting of 4 is now zero the weighted average goes back to 5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this doesn't work then please tell us what your averaging and which column is the weighting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Willem,</p>
<p>I wonder where do you want to download folders from, the SharePoint online site or your own OneDrive for Business library? We may be not able to download the
<strong>folders</strong> from there, but we can use <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-OneDrive-for-Business-187f90af-056f-47c0-9656-cc0ddca7fdc2#__how_does_skydrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OneDrive for Business sync app </a>to synchronize your OneDrive for Business library or other SharePoint site libraries to your local computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But I notice there is no “download” icon in both kinds of the libraries above until we open a file in the browser. As a result, a picture about the case will be appreciated and help us better know the question.</p>
<p>To upload a picture on this forum, click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> under the reply box and then click&nbsp;the first&nbsp;<strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong> icon.</p>

<h2>            Cell color changes when pasting from Excel to Word&#59; Paste Options broken</h2>
                    <p>When I copy (ctrl+c) and paste (ctrl+v) a formatted table from Excel to Word, the colors in the cells change.&nbsp; If I try to specify "Keep source formatting" or "Use Destination formatting", the table doesn't copy at all.&nbsp; This issue started within the last
 few days.&nbsp; I'm using an up-to-date version of Office 365 on Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; I'm trying to figure out if other people are having this issue or if my install is somehow broken.&nbsp; Four other people in my office have the same problem.</p>

<p>Does this problem occur with a particular Excel file and a particular Word document?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, see if copy/paste works as expected in a Word session running in Safe mode (see

<p>As you have indicated that it is Office 2013 that you are using, I assume that it is not a subscription version that you have installed on your existing computer.&nbsp; That being the case, if you don't have the Product Key, download the BelArc Advisor and use
 it to make an inventory of your existing computer.&nbsp; That inventory will detail all of the software that is installed on it and it will also provide the Product Keys were applicable.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to set tabs precisely in Word 2010&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ellis neuman  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to set tabs precisely in Word 2010&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In Word 2002, you could just click Format | Tabs to precisely (by numerical value) set tabs, rather than do it imprecisely by clicking on an
</p>
<p>approximate desired spot on the ruler.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me how to do this in Word 2010?&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

            Right-click the paragraph where you want to set the tabs, and click Paragraph (or click the little arrow in the bottom right corner of the Paragraph group on the Home tab). In the bottom left corner of the Paragraph dialog, click the Tabs button to open
 the same dialog as in previous versions.<br />
<br />
You can also get to the Tabs dialog by double-clicking on the ruler, but that also sets a tab at the place where you double-clicked, which you might not want.<br />
