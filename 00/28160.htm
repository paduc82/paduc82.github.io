<h2>            Deleted Messages</h2>
                    <p>Why do my deleted messages not delete. I want messages that I delete to be gone and not sit there for what ever time. Is there a way so that when I hit delete that they are gone "for ever". &nbsp;I mark a lot of unwanted emails as spam but they still sit in my
 deleted folder, is there a way to have them gone when I close windows mail</p>

            Open your Deleted folder Hold down the CTRL Key Press A this will highlight all emails in your deleted folder then right click and press Delete. Easiest way I have found to delete.

    <title>Outlook not printing or downloading attachments after forced change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rob_wasting_time  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook not printing or downloading attachments after forced change from Hotmail</h2>
                    <p>Why does this new outlook not want to print attachments or even download them?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<strong>Vista (all updates installed)</strong></p>
<p><strong>IE9 (all updates installed, including KB 7244842)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cookies have been deleted</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can open attachments online, then going to "File-&gt;Print" it asks to convert it to PDF but nothing happens when you try this... My printer is online but this new outlook doesn't see it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clicking on the attachment "Download as zip" does nothing...<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You would think it is simple and one of the most important features of emails to download and print attachments, the basics, but not with this new Outlook email.&nbsp; I've wasted hours now trying to fix this.&nbsp; Hotmail worked just fine, others I've spoken to
 also don't like this Outlook, maybe it is time to join a different provider...&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This is the second time I'm posting this because my last thread was locked with the reply below, i could not respond and the information it askes for is in my post already!</strong></p>

<p><strong>...This is a problem with a laptop</strong></p>

<h2>            Hybrid Mode 365 Mailbox Creation</h2>
                    
<p>We will stay in hybrid mode and are looking for an easier way to create 365 mailboxes.&nbsp; Currently this is your process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create account in on prem AD. </li><li>Create mailbox for account in Exchange on prem. </li><li>Synch AD account object to tenant. </li><li>Migrate mailbox to 365 cloud. </li></ol>
<p>Is there an easier way to do this?&nbsp; Can we create the account on prem in AD and run a powershell command to create the mailbox in 365 instead of on prem first and then migrating it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would like to bypass creating mailbox on prem and create it in 365 tenant instead?</p>

<p>Hi ufg,</p>
<p>In a hybrid deployment, we can use the Exchange PowerShell cmdlet <b>New-RemoteMailbox
</b>to create an mailbox directly in Office 365 instead of creating it in the on-premises, then move it to Office 365.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<b>New-RemoteMailbox</b>&nbsp;cmdlet creates an on-premises mail user. The mail user contains a specific attribute, which indicates that an associated mailbox in the service should be created when the user is synchronized to the service using directory synchronization.
 Directory synchronization must be configured correctly for a mailbox to be created in the service. Creation of the mailbox in the service isn't immediate and depends on the directory synchronization schedule.</p>

<p>I found a way around the problem by setting my Win 8.1 as the default OS and boot loader gives me the choice. If I select Win 10 TP, the boot loader does not show the screen though it still waits for 30 seconds as set in my msconfig. Set your default OS
 to W7 in msconfig. Just run msconfig.exe at command prompt and you will see system configuration box. Under "Boot" tab you will see the choice. Good luck.<br />

            <p>That is normal for dual boot. The default will be the last OS installed. You can change the default very easily. Open the Run box and type--
<strong>msconfig</strong>. The Boot tab lets you change the default OS. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>However-&nbsp;</strong>The reinstall might have installed over your win 7 drive. Did you choose a custom install and choose the second hard drive to do the clean install by booting to the dvd you burned from the iso file? Open Windows Explorer and check
 the 2 drives to make sure the OS are on diff drives. It is a good idea to rename the drives because when it boots to win 10 it will be called C drive and win 7 will be on D drive and the opposite when booting to 7 and that can confuse the issue. If the Win
 10 drive is called Win10 it will show up as C: Win10 when you boot to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That is normal for dual boot. The default will be the last OS installed. You can change the default very easily. Open the Run box and type--
<strong>msconfig</strong>. The Boot tab lets you change the default OS. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>However-&nbsp;</strong>The reinstall might have installed over your win 7 drive. Did you choose a custom install and choose the second hard drive to do the clean install by booting to the dvd you burned from the iso file? Open Windows Explorer and check
 the 2 drives to make sure the OS are on diff drives. It is a good idea to rename the drives because when it boots to win 10 it will be called C drive and win 7 will be on D drive and the opposite when booting to 7 and that can confuse the issue. If the Win
 10 drive is called Win10 it will show up as C: Win10 when you boot to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, I selected Custom Install and a clean install. &nbsp;Using W7 right now but the cold boot took a very long time after selecting W7 from the menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, changing the default in "msconfig" works with the boot up stopping to select the drive to boot from or without an input resumes in 25 seconds, I think. &nbsp;Thanks for the tip!</p>

<p>Thanks for the information, Reba. This is actually a known issue that Outlook 2010 users experience when sending emails to groups.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, the cause might be extra quotation marks around the recipient's email address (""*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"") thus making it incorrect . We won't necessarily need to create a System Administrator to fix the issue, but here's what we can do:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1) Open Outlook in safe mode.</strong></p>
<p>The next time you send emails to a group, try sending them while on safe mode. This basically disables add-ins that could be causing the issue. Here are
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026478/outlook-open-outlook-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">instructions</a></strong> for doing so.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2) Change the NK2 file designed for email auto-completion.</strong></p>
<p>This is one of the files that could be adding the extra quotation marks, as it's designed to autocomplete email addresses when you're typing them down. Here's how you find and change it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows key + R</strong> on your keyboard. This will open the run dialog box.</li><li>Paste <strong>%appdata% </strong>and press Enter. </li><li>Select <strong>Microsoft </strong>&gt; <strong>Outlook</strong>. Here, find<strong> Outlook.NK2</strong> and rename it to
<strong>Outlookbkp.nk2</strong>. You will need to display file extensions and hidden files to do this. Simply click View while on File Explorer and check File name extensions and Hidden items.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c84c8de9-576c-46c2-bec2-ea7f6877fb07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c84c8de9-576c-46c2-bec2-ea7f6877fb07" /></a></li><li>Once done, try again and see if you can send emails without issues.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, can you share the entire error message with us? This should help make our troubleshooting more accurate.</p>

<h2>            Windows mobile - choose what can be activated for transfer</h2>
                    Hi, great service but I woulld love to be able to control what is transferred between my phone and the server - in this case i would like to deactivate the sync and storing my music as backup. Having all the music will just clog up the free space which
 can be so useful for other more important back-ups<br />
It would be great to be able to decide what is transferred between the phone and Windows My phone portal.
<br />
Thanks guys and girls, great work so far

    <title>OneNote 2016 Equation Number Formatting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            OneNote 2016 Equation Number Formatting</h2>
                    In some of our OneNote 2016 notebooks when we do a simple equation like $8543737.60 - 1526050.04=$7.02E6, the result shows the number in scientific notation format, is there a way to have it show the full number?&nbsp; We have other OneNote 2016 notebooks where
 it works just fine.&nbsp; I have spent hours researching and can't find any number formatting options.

            Hi CC121889，<br />
<br />
I tested from my side, it all comes with a scientific notation format. And there is no entry to change it. You mentioned you have other NoteBooks has it show the full number, could you share a screenshot of it?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I try to change the number formatting in <strong>Control Panel\Clock and Region</strong> &gt;
<strong>Change date, time, or number formats</strong> &gt; <strong>additional settings</strong>:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5efe558-02af-4fcd-b8a1-4fc96fca63c8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5efe558-02af-4fcd-b8a1-4fc96fca63c8?upload=true" /></a><br />
If I change the<strong> No. of digits after decimal</strong> to a bigger number, like 8. Then OneNote will caculates like<br />
<strong>$8543737.60 - 1526050.04=$7.01768756E6</strong><br />
still scientific notation format. These might be a workaround.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Outlook is Running in Safe Mode</h2>
                    <p>How do I get Outlook out of Safe Mode?&nbsp; Recently it started loading only in Safe Mode.&nbsp; I tried the suggestions for rebooting my machine, making sure I was not in Safe Mode.&nbsp; I also tried the Repair option for MS Office.&nbsp; Neither has worked.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be telling me that the add-in called mssphtb.dll is causing the problem.&nbsp; The system&nbsp;has disabled this add-in, but it still continues to launch in Safe Mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe Mode is preventing me from keeping my Outlook screen customized, isn't allowing for automatic deletion of documents in the Deleted folder (upon closing Outlook), doesn't&nbsp;retain Preview Mode between launches, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any guidance.</p>

            <p>The response indicated that the problem was due to the latest update that contained bad code.&nbsp; I didn't understand the workaround that was given.&nbsp; I also didn't know how to uninstall the latest version of Office and reinstall the previous version to avoid
 the problem that way.&nbsp; So I guess I live with the problem until Microsoft fixes it through updates.&nbsp;</p>

Daniel, I believe the Surface Pro model is not running Windows 8 RT.&nbsp; There is not currently an Access version for RT, though I can't say that there will never be one.

<p>Actually in the case of the pro edition, since it says you can install ANY software, then this means exactly what it says, and since we can install Access on that computer then there is NO POSSIBLE technical reason that all of a sudden would NOT allow VBA.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind the pro tablet is running windows 8. This is essentially the same OS core as windows 7 from an operating system point of view.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything is literally the same as windows 7 in terms of the abilities for you to install + run software.&nbsp; What this means is in theory is you can even run and install access 97 on this tablet. So Access 2000, or runtime or any software you have NOW will
 run on this computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there is absolutely NO RESTRICTIONS in the kinds of software and what you install to this computer.&nbsp; And as I pointed out, it's essentially the same operating system as windows 7 with h the METRO layer on top.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also means that on this computer, you can launch the metro layer. In fact it starts out with it launched. However you can also exit out of METRO layer and return back to your familiar windows environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows RT:</p>
<p>Windows RT is essentially a tablet for consumers, and it ONLY has the metro layer and system.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>That metro layer is the part that is "locked down" and works just like an iPhone or Ipad. This METRO layer is the system that you CAN ONLY install applications from the store. There is NO user installing of the software permitted.&nbsp; You cannot tinker with
 this software layer, and you can not modify it, and you cannot install your own software with this system</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you used something like a windows 7/8 phone, or something like an iPad (like the 100+ million consumers), then IN ALL OF these systems they are "locked down" environments and end users CAN NOT install or change anything on the OS. No user installable
 software exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the end user is unable to download and install software into that METRO computer system EXCEPT from the software store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The METRO part of windows WORKS EXACTLY THE SAME.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So with this ONE&nbsp;piece of knowledge, then everything else can be logically deduced on one's own accord</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Windows Pro tablet = full blown computer + METRO part on top. </strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Windows RT table = METRO only computer.<br />
</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>So the METRO part works identical on both systems</strong>. It is just that the RT version is a lower powered ARM based system that does not run windows software and in fact does not even have a INTEL compatible processor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pro tablet is a full blown computer in every respect and feature and operation that we all are familiar with. It will run any and all versions of Access that can run on say a typical windows 7 computer. It is a full blown OS installed on that tablet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the METRO part is COMMON TO BOTH, but the standard windows OS is not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Access will install + run fine on any windows Pro tablet.</p>

<div>I understand Windows 8 is a full OS, and RT is METRO only. The Surface RT comes equipped with a lightly-modified version of Office 13 Home/Student pre-installed (without Access). My questions is: has Microsoft mentioned anything about offering a version
 of Access for the RT platform? Or, in other words, will I have to buy the Surface Pro version in order to use Access on a Surface tablet?&nbsp;</div>

            I have not heard of any plans for the foreseeable future to migrate Access to Windows 8 RT.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you look at the licensing and design choices, the Surface / Windows RT / Office RT is intended primarily as a consumer content consumer device rather than&nbsp; content creation device.&nbsp; RT does allow content creation and modification, but it is limited.&nbsp; Surface
 RT has no "Desktop" mode like the PC version does.<br />
<br />
Yes, you will have to wait for the Windows 8 on the Surface pro or other "PC compatible" device.<br />

                    <p>Currently, I have a worksheet with&nbsp;slicers&nbsp;where a user selects the product results they wish to&nbsp;review on a pivot located on another worksheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible to ask for a password when a&nbsp;slicer&nbsp;is selected so the user cannot see other product information?</p>
<p>Or does anyone have other recommendations on restricting access to Excel&nbsp;reports based on&nbsp;the user selection?</p>
<p>Purpose is to prevent restricted information from being viewed.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft Excel has built-in options that allow workbooks, worksheets or certain elements in the file to be protected by using a password. Based on our findings, one way
 the desired output that you would like to see can be achieved is by using macros or VBA scripts in Excel. What we'll do is move this thread to the Microsoft Office programming category so that experts with coding can provide assistance in getting the desired
 result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Outlook Mac Error 3253 Outlook version 16.9--Happening on some computers not all.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I work in a office and recently only a handful of our Macs are having the 3253 Error and when it happens they lose the ability to send and receive on our POP account. They restart their computers and it works again for a little while. Brand new iMacs
 and Office 16, other macs are just fine and have no issues some have to restart 5+ times a day just to get emails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried other options like moving outbox into new folder, clearing cache, taking off Norton those sort of things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated, I am not sure where to go next Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you please tell us if the issue has been resolved up to now? According to my experience, please navigate to Tools&gt; Accounts, and then check the server information of the effected account, you can get the server information (such as incoming server
 and its port, outgoing server and its port, if the SSL is needed) from your IT admin or your email provider. If any of them are incorrect, just modified it to see how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists after correcting the server settings in your Outlook for Mac, I suggest request further assistance in Outlook for Mac
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_mac-mso_mac2016/new-contact-support-feature-in-outlook-2016-for/d4fc21c4-25e2-4e10-b943-1fba6542b517">

    <title>Syncing Outlook.com calendar with iCloud&#47;OS X Calendar&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> learnedlin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Syncing Outlook.com calendar with iCloud&#47;OS X Calendar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I primarily use the iCloud/OS X Calendar, and would like for it to sync with my calendar on Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried making my calendar public on iCloud, going on Outlook.com &gt; Add calendar &gt; From internet, then inputting the publicly available iCloud calendar URL into the Calendar subscription fields. &nbsp;This method works in importing the already-available
 calendar items on iCloud. &nbsp;However, iCloud calendar appears to be static; in other words, any new updates to the OS X Calendar that occur after import/subscription to the Outlook.com calendar is not reflected in the Outlook.com calendar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to maintain a continuous sync between the two services? I am fine if the calendar on Outlook.com has access to a read-only version of the OS X Calendar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook has stopped syncing to hotmail account</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm currently assisting an Outlook user who is currently having this problem:<br />
<br />
- hotmail folders won't sync, they're all empty<br />
- Outlook app is in a constant Disconnected state (a few times it will say Connected but switches back to Disconnected)<br />
<br />
He can send emails though<br />
I believe he's using Outlook 2016<br />
It uses Exchange server (mail server: eas.outlook.com)<br />
<br />
I've tried a few things but they don't work:<br />
- http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-outlook/outlook-2013-starts-up-disconnected/493dc4ab-e017-4013-84e7-675b1cad4bcf?page=5<br />
- clicking Work Offline repeatedly<br />
<br />
Is this a server-side problem? Anyone else getting it?<br />
<br />
OS is Win 7 64<br />
<br />
Thanks </p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

            <p>Have you tried re-adding the account already?</p>
<p>The name of the server suggests that the account has been migrated to the <a href="https://www.howto-outlook.com/howto/outlookcommigrationinfo.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
new Outlook.com mail platform</a> already and in that case it is recommended to add it as an actual Exchange account instead of an EAS account.</p>

            They uninstalled Outlook and reinstalled it. Seems to work now. I didn't change anything or re-add any account. Problem just vanished. Will try the re-add option if it happens again. Thanks.

            <p>Same issue. I just opened my Outlook 2013 which syncs with my hotmail account. I watched as all my email was deleted and just the folder structure was left. Slight panic...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added my account back again File/Add Account, added details (same as before) and left it to do it's business. Restarted outlook when it told me too and everything was back again as normal. I then deleted the old empty account. The new account type is '
 Microsoft Exchange'. The old account type was 'Exchange Activesync'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Must be something at the Microsoft side that has changed. Going to be a few unhappy folk out there until they find this page.&nbsp;</p>

            Dear Richie,
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community using my experience with Microsoft products.
<br />In order to retrieve the emails that were deleted more than 30 days you can use Email Recovery App <a href="https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104380447?tab=Overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/o...</a> First insert the Microsoft Account from which you want to retrieve emails (These instructions better to perform on PC in browser) There is no guarantee that those emails will be restored, but it still is worth to try.
<br />1. Login to <a href="https://outlook.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/</a>
<br />2. Click the gear icon at the upper right side of the screens then click view full setting.
<br />3. Select Mail &amp;gt; Customize actions, then click “Get Add-ins” and hit save. (Note: If you already have the “Email Recovery” under Customize actions, please proceed in clicking on it, then hit save, and proceed in step # 10.)
<br />4. In “Inbox” folder, click an email (if you don’t have an email, please try to send a test email to your own email account, then once you received the test email, please click on it.)
<br />5. Click the “Gift” icon (Get Add-ins)
<br />6. Type and enter “Email Recovery” (without quote symbol)
<br />7. In the search result, under the “Email Recovery”, click “Add” button.
<br />8. Click “X” icon to exit.
<br />9. Go back to “Customize actions” page, click “Email Recovery” and hit save.
<br />10. Again, in “Inbox” folder, click an email, then the “Email Recovery” icon will be visible now, and click on it.
<br />11. Recover both Recoverable Items and Purges.
<br />12. Please do not do anything while the recovery is in progress.
<br />13. Once it’s finished, a folder will appear on the left pane which contains the emails that you recovered.
<br />Please note that there is no guarantee that those emails will be restored as it depends on server status and what happened to the storage space where they were stored.
<br />I hope these helped to recover your emails you’re looking for.       
        </p>

            It will update to full, but not upgrade to full-there is a difference. See the latest

<h2>            Time shift in Outlook Calendar,</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>I work in different time shifts. Monday and Wednesday from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Tuesday and Thursday from&nbsp;2:00 PM to 10:00 PM, and Friday I switch in between
 both time shifts.</span></p>
<p><span>I want my client to be able to see when I’m at work on my Outlook calendar, but when I go to
</span><b><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Calendar work week</span></b><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">,
<b>Start time</b><span>&nbsp;and<span>&nbsp;</span></span><b>End time</b><span>&nbsp;lists</span> it only allows me to set one time work for the days I selected. Which makes complicated
 for clients to set meetings and knowing when I’m at work.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Do you know how can I customize my work time?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Regards,</span></p>

            What a pity, such a great tool don't have that simple thing.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>It would be great to have that in my Calendar, since I manage all my meetings there.</div>
