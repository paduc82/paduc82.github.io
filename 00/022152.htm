<h2>            E72-1 Feedback and Feature Request</h2>
                    
<p>G'day all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure if this is the correct place for feature requests/usability feedback as I've seen mixed posts here and the developer forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After updating to firmware 051.018 I found some annoying changes from the previous firmware, plus features I hoped would have been added from previous Nokia products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Bluetooth dropouts. I mostly updated the firmware to see if the Bluetooth dropouts were resolved. &nbsp;They don't appear to be. &nbsp;My 6300 used to sit connected to my laptop all day or in the car via a Parrot system with no problems. &nbsp;I find the E72 will disconnect
 and reconnect for no apparent reason to the laptop. &nbsp;At times when I'm on a call connect to the Parrot, the bluetooth connection will drop though the call will stay connected. &nbsp;I either have to switch to the handset and have it auto connect again, or turn
 off and then on the bluetooth again. &nbsp;This I think is a critical flaw. &nbsp;My previous 6300 and wife's E65 worked fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Copy calendar entry. In the 6300 you could copy a calendar entry to another date. &nbsp;Not move, or reschedule, but physically copy the entry. &nbsp;This is a really handy feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Stop snoozing. In the 6300, when an alarm went off you could snooze it, but could also cancel the snooze if needed. &nbsp;If you missed the snooze alert, it stayed active on the screen.</p>
<p>With the E72, if you miss a snooze event, you have to wait until the next defined snooze time to actually know that you missed an alert. &nbsp;On the contrary if you intentionally snooze, you can't "wake up" rather you have to reset the alarm back to the original
 time it was set for (i.e. if you look at the event timer, say an alarm, you'll see the alert time has been modified to the new snooze time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Digital clock shrank. &nbsp;The digital clock appears to have gotten even smaller when you don't use the active home setting and it's positioned to the top right of the navigator key at the bottom of the screen. &nbsp;Don't understand why this would have changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Keylock locks everywhere. &nbsp;Regardless of whether you are in an application or standby the keypad will now lock. &nbsp;In the previous firmware, this was only in standby that it would lock. &nbsp;Very frustrating if you're reading something, or waiting for something
 to download that the screen locks on you. &nbsp;Yes I could disable, or set longer, but then I miss out of the usefullness of the auto lock feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Stop watch. &nbsp;The stopwatch and downdown timer apps on previous Nokias is nowhere to be found on the phone or in the Ovi store</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Groups in address book. &nbsp;It's difficult to find your groups rather than people contacts, apart from prefixing the group name with something like "Group" or looking for the group icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bluetooth is a killer for me and the calendar copy and alarm/calendar snooze events make using a pleasurable device quite annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is not the correct location, please point me to the correct place to I can suggest there instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Scott</p>

<p>Some problems seem new, others are well known (keylock, snoozing).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia firmware updates are notorious for being buggy: while some malfunctions are removed other things which worked perfectly before may be broken. Due to the nature of the updates (complete repacement not incremental) it may happen that you have to hard
 reset your phone afterwards thus losing everthing (programs and data) on the phone.</p>
<p>I am still using firmware version 022.007 for exactly that reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus my general advice on firmware updates for Nokia phones is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>Unless you are positively sure a new version corrects a bug which makes the phone less usable in your daily use, while not breaking some other important functions - don't update!</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IMHO you should never put an update on a Nokia phone just because "its there" and you want to have the newest version.</p>

<p>Completly aggre withalarm snooz. I face this problem every morning!! It is irritaing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have compiled a nice list of&nbsp; feature request I would also like to add a request from my side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get lots of emails daily with phone number in senders' signature. And there is no way I can dial that number. A simple way I am expecting is that should I copy the number then I should be able to paste that number in the dial screen. Hope Nokia team read
 this!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
That's curious, nokia advert that we don't have to upgrade unless we're sure it will resolve a bug, but as soon as we have a problem the first answer is to upgrade.<br />
<br />
So, for fw 51, no more news than some updated software, and 450+ bug corrected.<br />
<br />
how do you hnow if <strong>"[...] a bug which makes the phone less usable in your daily use [...]"</strong> will be solved by update ? How do I know is my E72 450+ bugs are the same bugs as update ?<br />
<br />
The real problem is that nokia publish bugged software, without any complete change log.<br />
<br />
Here is my feedback :<br />
<br />
* optical navi key settings are not loaded at startup, I set it to high sensibility, but sensibility is back to medium or low as I restart the phone, even if in settings I can read high, I must set it to low or medium, and back to high to get it work correctly<br />
<br />
* I use VOIP over WLAN, sometime connection is lost, at home or when I leave network coverage range. but when i want to restart VOIP service, E72 is unable to connect to WLAN, and so to VOIP provider. curiously web and other online services work fine. (I studied
 this error with network captures, connection manager and have a lot of details on this error, so it's too long to explain)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Why "internet tel" menu has been deleted from firmware to be replaced by "advanced VOIP settings" software ? I'd like to have it back</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A question to nokia developpers :</p>
<p>Do you use your mobiles or services ?</p>
<p>Do you need testers ?</p>
<p>Why is there so many bugs after near 30 major version upgrade (22 to 31 to 51) ?</p>
<p>What are these 450+ bug corrected ?</p>
<p>Do you care why <a href="http://www.symbian-guru.com/welcome/2010/07/symbian-guru-com-is-over.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
symbian guru give up</a> and did you learn something about it ?</p>

<p>Actually you can have exactly that with a Symbian software called BestProfiles. It costs about 10Eur/$.</p>

<p>yes it's maybe available but it does not allow the podcast episode to be view in the audio player&nbsp;as a podcast, and to resume an episode where you've left it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia should juste release a firmware update of the nokia e72 where the podcasting client would be available and the podcast seen in the audio player.</p>

            Windows 10 and Edge are "smarter" technologies, so it streams instead of downloading. I haven't tried it, but if you go into your settings within edge, there is an option to turn on always ask about downloads or something...is that enabled? If so, have
 you also tried holding over the link and see if it gives you a save option?

<br />
One way:<br />
<br />
Sub doit()<br />
Const n As Long = 3<br />
Const hz As Double = 5<br />
Const waitsec As Double = 1 / hz<br />
Dim i As Long<br />
Dim st0 As Double, st As Double, et As Double, t As Double<br />
' sync with Timer clock edge<br />
st = Timer<br />
Do: st0 = Timer: Loop Until st0 &lt;&gt; st<br />
' beep n times<br />
st = st0<br />
Beep<br />
For i = 1 To n - 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; et = Timer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t = et - st<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If t &lt; 0 Then t = t + 86400&nbsp; ' across midnight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loop Until t &gt;= waitsec<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; st = et<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beep<br />
Next<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
However, your ability to distinguish the expected number of beeps will depend on:&nbsp; (a) the sound (.wav file) chosen for "default beep" in the Sound and Audio Devices control panel; and (b) the frequency chosen (hz).<br />
<br />
Also, the reliability of the beep frequency depends on what else is running on your system, notably system interrupts.<br />
<br />
Note:&nbsp; This assumes that you are running on a Windows platform, not a Mac.&nbsp; See the Timer help page.<br />
<br />
[EDIT] Also note that the actual time between beeps is about ROUNDUP(waitsec/0.015625,0)*0.015625.&nbsp; This is due to the Timer update frequency, namely every 15.625 milliseconds.<br />
<br />
[EDIT] PS:&nbsp; We could get more accurate timing by using the QueryPerformanceCounter.&nbsp; But given the limitations listed above (due to sound duration and minimum practical frequency), that kind of accuracy is unnecessary, IMHO.<br />

 misc apps are also saying "app is not installed. please go to Store to install", including Cortana, etc...

I am trying to resolve without a "Fresh or Clean" recovery. I have attempted a few system restores, that have been successful. Yet, the issues still remain.

I did choose, in Recovery, to run a Refresh, and choose&nbsp;a&nbsp;local account instead of the Outlook.com account.

<p><span>Hi Srikanthsd,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your post.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>I am sorry to hear about the audio problem you have with your earpiece.&nbsp;Please try another earpiece to confirm that the problem doesn't come from the earpiece itself. If it still low with another piece then you can</span>&nbsp;do a hard reset by typing
 *#7370# on the device but since this operation will delete all your data, please do a backup first using
<a href="http://nokia.com/nokiasuite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Suite</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
If you are still experiencing problems please plug your Nokia C3-00 into your computer via usb and install(or reinstall)<span>&nbsp;</span>the latest software version using
</span><a href="http://nokia.com/nokiasuite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Nokia Suite</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you still cannot get the audio to operate normally, I believe it would be a hardware issue so I will invite you to take your device to your local&nbsp;</span><a href="http://nokia.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Nokia Care point</span></a><span> to
 be repaired by a specialist.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>The most obvious is that the NUMBER recorded is NOT in the same format / [country]&nbsp;
<p>

<h2>            Nokia lumia 710 . call end bug. still prevalent</h2>
                    i have brought Nokia lumia 710 , The phone has also been updated on 16 jul 12. the current version is 7.10.8773.98 firmware version is 1600.30318.8773.12121 since this update , I'm. not able to make any call. when I call any number the call ends after
 3-4 secs. I face a similar problem 2 months back then it was a new phone so I reseted it and the problem was solved. since this time I'm not able to backup all the software ( contacts , apps , apps data, calendars etc) I can't reset the phone to resolve. what
 a dichotomy, hope some one help on this. this seems to be a basic feature - to call and it's erupts time after time. request looking into the matter Nokia. good bye raj shastri

<p>Here is the soution for that. In dailler pad,select call settings .. Select option show my caller id to .My contacts ..then press back button then dail and check ny one number in your contacts.It will be dailled.</p>
<p>After this again come back to the caller stettings ,it will b showing everyone.again select to My contacts.after its done dont press back button again change it to the everyone.then press back button.</p>
<p>Now tourn off your mobile ,remove your sim card.then turn on your mobile without sim card .again turn off your mobile now insert your sim card and restart it properly.. It will work..</p>

If you are still experiencing issue with this then the best thing to do is to visit your local Nokia care point where the device can be inspected.<br />

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suddenly experiencing this after no obvious update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to create new mail, or pop-out a message, or reply-all, the new window doesn't appear. Interestingly its preview appears in the start bar, but when I click on it/alt-tab to it nothing shows. Also, other items e.g. opening meetings, creating new
 meetings opens fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be linked to the pop-out windows regarding sending mail. I can still receive mail fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.</p>

<h2>            Automatically Digitally Sign Emails.</h2>
                    At my office we work a lot with digitally signed documents , and for time saving and faster work time , we use the share feature incoporated in Office , but when we use the share feature the Digitally Signature doesn't "activate" automatically , except
 on one pc where you can send any atachment you want and it will be automatically signed. How can we make it that it will be like that on all the pc's , or is it a bug on that pc?

<h2>            Mcrosoft Access going from 2007 to 2016</h2>
                    <p>The group I am involved with has an Access DB originally created as an mdb file and was subsequently converted to accdb format for use in Access 2007 where is seems to work fine. We have now acquired Access 2016 but have so far been unable to open the file
 under 2016. We get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;'Your database contains a missing or broken reference to the file MSCAL.OCX version 7.0. To ensure your database works properly You must fix this reference.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I follow the instructions by going back to Access 2007 , opening the db in Design mode, opening Visual Basic and checking the references, there is no MSCAL.OCX file in the reference list. So I can't add it or delete it.

<h2>            How to view &#34;Title And Text&#34; layout in PowerPoint 2010</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
In PowerPoint 2010, the layout "Title and Text" is not viewable. If I run this line of code<br />
ActivePresentation.Slides.Add(ActivePresentation.Slides.Count + 1, ppLayoutText)<br />
<br />
the layout will be available in slide master.<br />
<br />
My question is: In Office 2010, Is there any way to view the layout "Title and Text" upon creating a new template ? we can only see 9 available layouts.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
Can<br />

            <p>Title and Text is there only, I suspect, as a legacy feature, to support older PPT presentations that use this layout.</p>
<p>New presentations use Title and Content, which accomplishes pretty much the same thing and more.</p>
<p>I can see where you might want to retain the older layout to simplify training though.</p>
<p>You'd have to force the layout to appear in the master using code if you want it to become part of a new template, but once that's been done, the template would retain the new layout once it's saved.&nbsp; In other words, if users base a new slide presentation
 on the template, they should be able to choose this layout.</p>

            <p>Hi CalleVx,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Which version of Internet Exploerer are you using?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to try the following troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> Please add the website to your IE Trusted Sites. If you’d like to disable it, please follow these instructions for Internet Explorer.
</p>
<p>

</span></span></span>Click on Tools </p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on Internet Options 
</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on the Security tab 
</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on Trusted Sites 
</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on Custom Level </p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Scroll to Miscellaneous section and find “Web sites in less privileged web content zone…”
</p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Choose Enable </p>
<p>
<span><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on OK, then Yes, then OK
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> You can refer the article in the below link on how to use security zones in Internet Explorer.</p>

<h2>            Displaying fonts properly</h2>
                    I'm glad to see Opentype font support at last! But I've noticed that Word seems to cut off the bottoms of fonts that dip below the line. Increasing the spacing between lines doesn't fix this, as it doesn't appear to be a problem with how wide the space
 between each line is but rather how tall Word thinks the font should be versus how tall it actually is. Fontin, available here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fontin.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fontin.html</a>&nbsp;is the one I'm using and noticing
 that y, g, and others get cut off at the bottom. Any ideas? Or can I report a bug to MS somehow without having to pay them for the privilege?&nbsp;

<div>Have you got the Line Spacing (Paragraph formatting) set to At Least and not an Exact setting?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are using something like At Least 1 line, then it suggests that there is an error in the information packed with the O/T font as Word will adjust the line spacing based on the information in the font.</div>

<p>I've downloaded both the OpenType version of Fontin and the TrueType<br />
version available on the same page, and tried both of them in Word<br />
2003, 2007, and 2010. The descenders are cut off in the OpenType font<br />
in all three Word versions, but they are correct in the TrueType font.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the ReadMe file in the TrueType zip file says:</p>
<p>"This is a new conversion of Jos Buivenga's "Fontin" typeface into<br />
TrueType format for Windows.&nbsp; In this version, <strong>the descenders are<br />
intact</strong> and the line spacing is much closer to that of the Macintosh<br />
original." (emphasis added)</p>
<p>I'd conclude that the OpenType font is defective.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may want to perform a full system virus scan on the computer to ensure that it is free from virus. Sometimes, malicious and other potentially unwanted software, including rootkits, try to install themselves on your PC. This can happen when
 you connect to the Internet or install some programs from a CD, DVD, or other media. Once on your PC, this software might run immediately, or it might run at unexpected times.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Windows Defender Offline can help remove such hard to find malicious and potentially unwanted programs using definitions that recognize threats. Definitions are files that provide an encyclopedia of potential software threats. Because new threats
 appear daily, it's important to always have the most up-to-date definitions installed in Windows Defender Offline. Armed with definition files, Windows Defender Offline can detect malicious and potentially unwanted software, and then notify you of the risks.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Lumia 920 outgoing call waiting notification</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I Have a Lumia 920, and this phone does not show a " Outgoing Call Waiting Notification" if the person, i'm calling is on another call.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Example, on the earlier Nokia and Android mobiles (Samsung, Sony), &nbsp;when I take a call and the person i'm calling is on another call, the phone would display a message saying "call waiting" then i could call back later, but on the Lumia 920 &amp; other Lumia's
 as well, it just says Dialing.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And this is not only on my Phone I've checked it with another 920 as well as a 820.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>&nbsp;if I call a guy who is calling someone else and this guy is activated the call waiting function, I have to get a message "waiting" and then you decide to continue disturbing him or to hang up.</span><br />
<span>Also that his is an operator thing. I contact my operator they has already activated this service.&nbsp;</span></div>
<span>Also that his is an operator thing. I contact my operator they has already activated this service.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>

<p>Hi</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>Dwayne</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>I have problem with my Nokia lumia 920</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>hello</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>Hello there.</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>How may I help you?</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>My carrier supporting 4G - LTE</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>but my lumia 920 no have any 4g button in options</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>I understand.</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>No worries. Let me assist you with this.</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>Before we proceed further, may I know your first and last name.</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p><span>last name darshana</span></p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>Okay. Please be advised that you need to coordinate with your local Nokia Technical support team.</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>why?</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>Please be advised that we have limited support for Nokia in Sri Lanka.</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>but i bought this lumia from Thailand</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>I understand.</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>You need to coordinate with your local Nokia support team and with your network provider as well.</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>ok</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>next problem</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>I Have a Lumia 920, and this phone does not show a " Outgoing Call Waiting Notification" if the person, i'm calling is on another call.<br />
<br />
Example, on the earlier Nokia and Android mobiles (Samsung, Sony), &nbsp;when I take a call and the person i'm calling is on another call, the phone would display a message saying "call waiting" then i could call back later, but on the Lumia 920 &amp; other Lumia's
 as well, it just says Dialing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>how this will fix</span></p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>I understand.</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>ok</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>what can do</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>Actually, if the call waiting is not activated on the person that you are trying to reach, you cannot really see the notification.</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>I try with my other mobiles all phone waiting activated</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>The idea is the call waiting functionality should be activated on the phone of the person you are calling.</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>Because if call divert is off on that persons phone, and he is already engaged on a call when you are trying to contact him, then won't really get a notification of call waiting.</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>My lumia activated call waiting other person phone also activated &nbsp;</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>i'm asking other person in other call my phone want to indicate other party on call wait notification</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>it not showing this windows mobile os</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>I'm sorry I cannot understand this one - i'm asking other person in other call my phone want to indicate other party on call wait notification. I would appreciate it if you can clarify this to me.</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>Example, on the earlier Nokia and Android mobiles (Samsung, Sony), &nbsp;when I take a call and the person i'm calling is on another call, the phone would display a message saying "call waiting" then i could call back later, but on the Lumia 920 &amp; other Lumia's
 as well, it just says Dialing.</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>if I call a guy who is calling someone else and this guy is activated the call waiting function, I have to get a message "waiting" and then you decide to continue disturbing him or to hang up.</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>i'm not getting this waiting notification</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>are u got me</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>Okay.</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>Okay. Let us check some settings on your phone then.</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>Kindly navigate your phone to the settings.</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>And then look for calls+sms.</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>ok</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>lumia 920 don't have calls + sms</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>I have this options 'Messaging"</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>and "Phone"</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>Okay. I forgot you are from Sri Lanka, there might be some slight difference.</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>call waiting available in "network+"</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>Kindly activate the call waiting from there.</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>it's ON</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>already</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>The person that you are trying to reach, May I know if the call divert is activated on that persons phone?</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>*person's</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>thwy call waiting activated</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>I have another phone Samsung it showing i'm on all waiting notification</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>but i try with lumia 920 not showing</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>You cannot isolate the concern by trying on a different phone.</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>You need to make sure that call waiting is activated on the phone.</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>already activated i try with other mobiles same issue</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>I mean activated on the person that you are trying to reach.</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>all activated</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>I understand. If that is the case I suggest you contact the local support of Nokia in Sri Lanka so they can further check on this one.</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>ok. i think this is software issue</p>
<div><span>Dwayne</span></div>
<div>
<p>I believe they are handling concerns for customers who are based in Sri Lanka.</p>
<div>Dwayne
<p>Will there be anything else you would like me to assist you with?</p>
<div>Buddhika Sampath
<p>nop</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the same error with my new printer HP Envy 4500.</p>
<p>I have created a document with MS Word 2007 and have added 2 images. In the screen I can see them fine (I see the entire&nbsp;image) but when I&nbsp;print the document with my new printer HP Envy 4500, the images appear as cropped, with the correct size of the image,
 but different zoom scale, so the image appears cropped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have printed those images from another application as MS Paint, and the images are printed correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also created a new MS <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-hardware/impression-doc-word-2010-sur-hp-envy4500-non/70ca5c85-a939-4f64-8023-002a959ae89d?rtAction=1391681453546#">

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am experiencing the exact same problem and have wasted pages of paper and ink trying to resolve it.</p>
<p>I sort of stumbled across a partial cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried exporting the file on a USB stick to my Laptop which has Word 2010. The MS Word 2010 programme "converted" the file and it printed fine (via Wireless). I will need to have a look at the properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the ENVY 4500 attached to your PC by USB, it may also be worth converting it to Wireless.</p>
<p>Takes a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upshot of all this is HP ENVY 4500 does not like / support Word 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The people at HP seem uninterested in the problem and blame Microsoft, just go on line and see all the complaints.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't help you much in solving the problem but we need something in Word 2007 which converts it to Word 2010 format
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">or</span></strong> HP and MS to sort it out
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindest Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve B</p>

            <p>Sorry to disagree. Word 2010 prints perfectly from the Laptop but Word 2007, from the PC crops and corrupts images and text (as David explained above) .&nbsp; I have tried your "driver" solution without success loading from both the Printer Disc and HP Website......!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just look online at the trail of complaints about this issue!!&nbsp; Both HP and Microsoft need to work in tandem to resolve this issue.....neither of these Giants seem to be interested though.</p>

            Well, I have to disagree with you.&nbsp; While other printer manufacturers do not seem to have a problem producing printer drivers that work faultlessly with Word from one version to the next, HP, on the other hand, do not appear to be capable of doing the
 same thing and almost every time that a new version of Office is released, an upgrade of the HP printer drivers are necessary.

<p>I've used 2 or 3 HP printers in the last 10+ years with Office 2003 to 365 ( A number of different PC's) and I've not had any issues with the HP printer software, excepting one regarding printing envelopes, not from within Office.</p>

            I have used at least six HP printers (three laser, three inkjet) since 1992, and the only problems I've had have been operator error. In some cases, trying to use an older printer with a newer OS (using a generic Windows driver) is less than satisfactory,
 but when there is an HP driver, it is always splendid.

            Not sure that the problem is with the printer as I was having the same problem. The images printed on my computer at home but not at work, so I started looking closer at the document itself and discovered that all my documents were in compatibility mode.&nbsp;
 Once I converted all of my documents to Word 8.1 and out of compatibility mode, the images printed.&nbsp; When you have the document up, look at the top and see if it shows (compatibility mode).&nbsp; If so, click file, and you will see Convert - click on that, say
 OK, and you should be good to go.

            <p>Hi Activity Dept,</p>
<p>
</p><p>VMT for your input. However, the documents are not in compatibility mode, I checked using your suggested method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention you converted the documents to <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">WORD</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>8.1</strong></span> . All the docs are in Word 2007 and the system hosting it is
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 8.1</span></strong>. </p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>VMT for your help, but honestly I have tried the HP printer drivers and no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Works fine from my Laptop (Windows 8.1 and Word 2010)</p>
<p>but hopeless from my PC (Windows 8.1 and Word 2007)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both are connected to the printer wirelessly. By the way, I have always had HP printers and like you have had no problem with them.</p>

<h2>            How do I get Lumia Selfie Back &#63;</h2>
                    I am currently using a Lumia 535 running on Windows 10 Preview Build 10536. I accidently&nbsp;uninstalled the Lumia Selfie app and now I can't get it back. I've searched the app store and only found a paid version.Hence I checked some third party Sites and
 the app package is not compatible.Recently I got the link of the selfie app and tried installing it but the store said your device is not compatible with this app. The only option left was to roll back to WP 8.1 but I don't want to. Is there anyway to get
 it back other than rolling back to WP 8.1?

<p>
</p><p>Watch out for fake apps in the store. The app you are looking for is probably<br />

<p>It is currently listed as Not Available in the store. I hope it will be back soon?</p>

</p><p>An October 26. 2015 updated version of Lumia Cinamagraph now claiming to be Windows 10 compatible just appeared on my Lumia 720 on WP8.1. It's plausible that the Lumia Selfie app also requires an update to be fully compatible.</p>

            <p>That's called sideload. It is currently not an option for end users.<br />
- Even if it was, a retail phone checks the store online and refuse to install an app that is not suitable for the phone, or has been revoked from the online store.</p>

<h2>            Get.workbook help in Macro Language in Excel 2011</h2>
                    =Getworkbook no longer works in Excel 2011. Has the command been changed?&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Two other related questions:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. can one access the 2004 Help file? If so which folder does it have to be placed in</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. Another annoyance which must have a simple answer. When one opens a workbook with macros a dialog box comes up with the alternatives. In the good old days I could hit command e and enable macros would be executed. I have tried multiple combinations
 of key strokes without success. P;lease what is the key &nbsp;stroke.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance</div>
