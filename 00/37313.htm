    <title>Surface Pro 3 touchpad not responding on small distances - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 touchpad not responding on small distances</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have a problem with small movements on the touchpad of the Type Cover 3. I&nbsp;think I saw someone describing the same problem somewhere on the internet&nbsp;but I can't seem to find it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the mouse pointer is still and I try to start moving it with the touchpad nothing happens the first few&nbsp;millimetres. After that the pointer start moving. But it is not a delay or something because I can put my finger on the touchpad, without moving
 it for some time, then start moving and the first few millimetres nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I tried the delay settings&nbsp;but&nbsp;they are not helping.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried placing the pointer on a line on the screen, then placing my finger on the touchpad, moving 2 millimetres, lifting my finger, placing it back on the touchpad, moving few millimetres and so on. The pointer didn't move a pixel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is no one else having this problem. This makes it extremely difficult to click on small buttons that are next to each other like here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5a81b6e-0f99-4a82-a6b4-a91280cee735" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I will be extremely happy for a solution :)</p>

            I experience the same issue. This wont happen with my laptop track pad only with the surface track pad...the only way to deal with it is to move the fingers quickly. Hopefully microsoft release a better driver or firmware to fix it. I hope is not a hardware
 issue.<br />

my discussion thread</a> for the same issue. This&nbsp;is forcing me&nbsp;to bring a mouse with me every day! And with one USB port, I can only use a Bluetooth mouse, and Bluetooth mouse often dies from interference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think we can write our feedback directly through their new Surface Hub App in the store. I'm doing it right now. The touch pad is an agony to use.

            <p>Me too! The slight spatial (not time) delay of the trackpad is annoying as heck! It seems like it is designed not to respond to the first few millimeters of movement. Even if the finger has been on the trackpad for a long time, a small movement will not
 move the cursor. As a result, fine control very difficult!</p>

            <p>Has anyone had any success in stopping the touchpad from behaving in this way, or is the general consensus that this is by design?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've opened a case with Microsoft about it and they're keen to send out a new Type Cover. From what I've read here, I don't believe it is a hardware fault. I'm starting to think that I'll just have to get used it.</p>

    <title>Vista freezes at Start Up, at &#34;Microsoft Corporation&#34; logo. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kcodon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista freezes at Start Up, at &#34;Microsoft Corporation&#34; logo.</h2>
                    Hi all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For some reason, when I turn on my computer Vista gets stuck at the "Microsoft Corporation" logo screen, with the little green bar loading, and it will not move past this point. I then have to hold down the off button to turn it off, and then use System
 Repair (or is it Startup Repair?...the one that comes up automatically anyway...I have to use System Restore too) etc for it to work. The problem is that this happens about half the time I turn the computer on, so is a slow process that I've had to put up
 with.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have any ideas? I hope it does't mean I have to format the hard drive and reinstall Vista, as that isn't something I know how to do...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Other points to note are that it seems to be linked to the Antivirus programs...I had Norton, and sometimes when the above problem happened, after logging in, Norton would say my computer was unprotected and a whole lot of things were turned off...I couldn't
 turn them back on. I gave up on Norton a while ago, and it seemed to fix it for a while. Now however I have AVG and a similar problem occasionally occurs (although very rarely...normally the computer just freezes at startup as above). I've also noted that
 Startups take a lot longer now, and occasionally if the computer does get past the Microsoft Corporation screen, it will just have a black screen for 20 seconds or so, and occasionally comes up with a message referring to registry keys (I can't remember the
 exact message). It does start eventually however.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also found the following similar question:&nbsp;<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/af488955-1080-4329-a5a0-774916c7341e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/af488955-1080-4329-a5a0-774916c7341e</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I used System File Checker tool as stated in the answer to the above question, but the result was "no integrity violations", so I guess it isn't that.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks, and any help would be much appreciated,</div>
<div><br />

</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 error" message. To resolve this, restart the computer and try again. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Ensure that the Safe mode option is selected (the top option)
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Press Enter. The computer then begins to start in Safe mode.

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>Perform the Clean boot procedure to find the service which is causing the issue.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue persists, you need to do inplace upgrade to resolve your issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h3> stephensallinger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft partner listing</h2>
                    <p>How or where can I find a list of certified Microsoft Partners. I hate when I call a number that appears on my computer announcing that a problem has ocured and I should call the listed number to have the problem fixed. The called person usually says they
 are Microsoft certified technicians and can fix the problem if I allow them to access my computer and best of all they want money up front usually over $100.00. I have learned not to trust anyone trying to gain access to my computer and need to have a way
 to feel comfortable allowing someone to resolve a real problem. Having a list of Real Microsoft partners would be a big help.</p>

<p>I do not have a list, but never call a number that appears on you screen or in an email. No one knows if your computer is having problems except you. They are all scams. For this on in particular:</p>

<h2>            How to REALLY change computer name in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I changed my computer name from generic DESKTOP-0LALO37 to Donner and all seems fine and well in windows menus. However, after several reboots ipconfig /all still outputs the DESKTOP-0LALO37 as hostname.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I require this data to be uniform as I use several software solutions using FlexLm licensing. Help?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Open a Command Prompt (Adimin) window:<br />
Win+X, A, Alt+Y</p>
<p><br />
Then run the following command in it to change your computer name to Donner:<br />
<strong>wmic ComputerSystem where "name='%ComputerName%'" call rename Donner</strong></p>
<p><br />
Reboot your computer, then try to run ipconfig /all command, you should find that the Host Name in Windows IP Configuration list already has been changed to Donner.</p>
<p><br />
Good luck.</p>

<h2>            Trouble in Windows Movie Maker opening screen</h2>
                    <p>When I open Windows Movie Maker, it display screen as under:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05f14c3b-3a6f-49ac-8707-a17de445474c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05f14c3b-3a6f-49ac-8707-a17de445474c?upload=true" height="479" width="902" /></a></p>

<p>My guess would be a problem with your graphics driver. Try updating the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To figure out the make/model of your GPU and the current driver version/date, use these steps:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold down the&nbsp;<span>Windows&nbsp;</span>logo key and press&nbsp;<span>R</span>. This will bring up the&nbsp;<span>Run&nbsp;</span>dialog.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span>dxdiag</span>&nbsp;into the text box and press Enter. This will start up the&nbsp;<span>DirectX Diagnostic</span><span>&nbsp;tool</span>.</li><li>Click on the&nbsp;<span>Display</span>&nbsp;tab. If you have more than one Display tab, please check each one.</li><li>On the Display tab, look to the&nbsp;<span>left</span>&nbsp;under&nbsp;<span>Device&nbsp;</span>-- Note down the&nbsp;<span>Name&nbsp;</span>and&nbsp;<span>Manufacturer&nbsp;</span>of your GPU.</li><li>On the Display tab, look to the&nbsp;<span>right</span>&nbsp;under&nbsp;<span>Driver&nbsp;</span>-- Note down the&nbsp;<span>Version&nbsp;</span>and&nbsp;<span>Date&nbsp;</span>of your GPU drivers.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it appears that you have moved, renamed or deleted the original source video because you are seeing lots of yellow triangles with exclamation points, instead of thumbnails from the actual clips.</p>

    <title>May 2013 Surface Pro update breaks Jabber Video client - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> veljharig  say:</h3>
<h2>            May 2013 Surface Pro update breaks Jabber Video client</h2>
                    <p>My workplace has confirmed on two separate Surface Pros that the May 14, 2013 hardware update for Surface Pro appears to break Cisco's Jabber Video client.&nbsp; The culprit appears to be the outdated Intel HD 4000 video driver update (version 9.17.10.3062) that
 is installed in the "System Hardware update - 2013-05-14" for the Surface Pro.&nbsp; After that driver is installed, Cisco Jabber Video clients 4.5 and 4.6 don't even start up.&nbsp; They generate an error saying that a necessary video hardware feature is missing to
 support the Cisco Jabber Video client (I suspect it is the OpenGL 1.2+ requirements for Jabber Video that are failing).&nbsp; Previous Intel HD 4000 drivers worked without incident with the Jabber Video client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fix is to install Intel's latest driver for the HD 4000 graphics chipset (version 9.18.10.3071)&nbsp;from the Intel website.&nbsp; The driver is available here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/9Ok30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://goo.gl/9Ok30</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not an ideal solution for two reasons: 1) the Surface Pro is now running a video driver not certified for use with the manufacturer hardware, and 2) Windows Update will continue to prompt that Surface Pro owners "update" to the older Intel driver
 on subsequent Windows Update checks (unless the update is hidden).&nbsp;&nbsp;Manually updating the video driver and then supressing the "System Hardware update - 2013-05-14" for Surface Pro is&nbsp;the only current solution for the problem that I am aware of, however.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because&nbsp;this update&nbsp;breaks a major&nbsp;Unified&nbsp;Communications vendor's H.323 and SIP desktop client, please expedite updating the Surface Pro video drivers to Intel's latest driver version (9.18.10.3071).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            You can try if factory reset works on startup troubleshooter.<br />
First turn off your console (in power saving mode)<br />
Next, a bit tricky, hit and hold BIND and EJJECT <strong>both at same time&nbsp;</strong>and hit power button without releasing the others two. When comes the troubleshoot, you have a factory reset option, see if comes with the same error.

                    <p>I've already put in a problem report but have had no response... So today I was updating Fortnite, randomly the update went into queue&nbsp;and warframe&nbsp;started to install. This has happened&nbsp;before, however, today was different. When I went to start the Fortnite update installation it qued all of the updates. I kept trying to restart the Fortnite&nbsp;update and nothing happened. I also restarted my Xbox; both ways of course. Still, nothing happened.&nbsp; After this the update disappeared, I still couldn't launch&nbsp;the game either. It was the same error code, 0x87e1000c .&nbsp; I even&nbsp;tried to completely&nbsp;uninstall&nbsp;the game. Doing this was literally&nbsp;doing nothing, it was&nbsp;as if I hadn't even tried to uninstall it. Please help... I really enjoy Fortnite, all of my friends are saying they're&nbsp;doing the "Take The L" dance in honor&nbsp;of me...</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t Access My External Hard Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mannystarlord  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Access My External Hard Drive</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently using a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (Core i5 w/4GB RAM version) and I've had no issues accessing the content on my external hard drive, a Seagate 1TB 'Expansion Portable Drive' when plugged into the single USB port. Ever since I got the latest
 Windows 10 Anniversary update I am no longer able to accesses the drive and I'm met with the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center">E:\ is not accessible</p>
<p style="text-align: center">The request is not supported</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to getting the update, everything used to work fine. I was able to read and write on the drive without any issues. I've always ejected the drive properly before unplugging it. I went to the Seagate website to get the latest drivers for the HDD and
 I'm still met with the same issue. I'm confident that this isn't a problem with the HDD as the drive can still be read on PCs running Windows 7 and on my Samsung smart TV. I also have a micro SD card slotted in and that works fine as well&nbsp;(D:\).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read several discussions and post on this site, Reddit, and other forums&nbsp;but all to no avail. If there's anyone out there that could give me some advice it would be greatly appreciated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello SuJata,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I truly appreciate the time given to help me with my HDD problem that I'm currently having. Unfortunately I am still experiencing the same problems even after going through both solutions and downloading the drivers and firmware
 for my Surface that you had suggested. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Could there be another solution? I've read elsewhere that people who've had the same problem&nbsp;pinpointed the cause from when they got the Windows 10 anniversary update. They then rolled back the update and&nbsp;no longer have that issue. Would Microsoft be coming
 up with a fix via software patch to address said issue? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Cannot Switch To Desktop Mode&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I performed some system update yesterday and since then, I cannot get out of Win 10 mode -the screen with all the tiles that shows all of the apps that i never, ever use because I cant quite get a grasp of Windows 8/10.<br />
<br />
I just want to be able to get to my programs &amp; files - everything that I had pinned to the desktop?&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been searching the web &amp; really not finding a thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Incredibly frustrated.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I just can do NOTHING.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm here in Win10 mode (if thats what its called) on this browser but not too happy about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have or had all of my documents, files, etc. all accessible via the desktop.<br />
<br />
At one point, I accidentally DID get to Desktop Mode but cant replicate that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<br />
DEAR GOD, WHY MUST THE COMPTUER COMPANIES ALWAYS FEEL THE NEED TO BE INNOVATIVE WHEN ITS NOT NECESSARY?!<br />
<br />
Thank you - huge thank you in advance.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
(MICROSOFT: PLEASE DONT TELL ME TO PERFORM A REBOOT OR ANY COMPLEX PROCEDURES, I'M SURE ITS JUST SOME WEIRD SETTING)&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks!!

            Hi.&nbsp; It looks like the problem may have been that the computer was somehow switched to tablet mode.&nbsp; I don't know how that happened....but now I have af ar, far, larger issue!!!
<br />
<br />
I have NO sound.&nbsp; The sound will work for a few minutes then just fail completely.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has been going on since the day after I updated to the new Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe its just a coincidence!??&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm so upset I don't even know what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; Feels like I can never
 get anything working on this.&nbsp;

            Hi ZuZu9FS
<br />
<br />Close all open applications
<br />
<br />Download the Font(s)
<br />
<br />Those will generally download as zip files, unzip the downloaded files) so you can see the TTF file(s)
<br />
<br />Right click the resulting TTF file(s) and choose 'Install'
<br />
<br />If that does not succeed, copy the TTF files into C:\Windows\Fonts
<br />
<br />Restart your PC . . .

            Hello ZuZu9FS 
<br />
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft community. My name is Miguel T.
<br />
<br />If you want to change Default Font in Windows 10 the easiest way is:
<br />
<br />Please note: before any procedure with the edition of records, it is risky and can cause irreversible damage to your installation if you do not do it correctly. It is recommended to make a full backup of your system before continuing. Alternatively, you can create a system restore point, which will also help you revert the changes you make.
<br />
<br />* Open the control panel.
<br />
<br />* Open the Fonts option.
<br />
<br />* See the font available in Windows 10 and write down the exact name of the font you want to use (for example, Arial, Courier New, Verdana, Tahoma, etc.).
<br />
<br />
<br />* Open Notepad.
<br />Copy and paste the following registration code into the text file:
<br />
<br />Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
<br />
<br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ Microsoft \ Windows NT \ CurrentVersion \ Fonts]
<br />"Segoe UI (TrueType)" = ""
<br />"Segoe UI Bold (TrueType)" = ""
<br />"Segoe UI Bold Italic (TrueType)" = ""
<br />"Segoe UI Italic (TrueType)" = ""
<br />"Segoe UI Light (TrueType)" = ""
<br />"Segoe UI Semibold (TrueType)" = ""
<br />"Segoe UI Symbol (TrueType)" = ""
<br />
<br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ Microsoft \ Windows NT \ CurrentVersion \ FontSubstitutes]
<br />
<br />"Segoe UI" = "ENTER-NEW-FONT-NAME"
<br />
<br />* In the previous registration code, be sure to replace ENTER-NEW-FONT-NAME with the name of the source you want to use as Courier New.
<br />
<br />* Click on File.
<br />
<br />* Click on Save as.
<br />
<br />* Under "Save as type", select All files and assign a name to your file with the .reg extension.
<br />Click on Save
<br />
<br />* Double-click on your new .reg file to merge into the registry.
<br />
<br />* Click Yes
<br />
<br />* Click on OK.
<br />
<br />
<br />* Restart your computer to complete the task.
<br />
<br />* Once the computer is restarted, you should see the new font family in all items, including File Explorer, message box, taskbar, and applications that use the default system font.
<br />

<h2>            Fully repair .NET Framework 2.0 and 3.0 in Vista</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>

<p>
<strong>Ok, I've had this problem for a while now and it is starting to get to me.</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>Each time I want to install or run something that needs .NET Framework 2.0 (or above) it just crashes out and says the classic "***
 has stopped working, windows is checking for a solution to the problem"</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>Then I get the "Debug" or "Close Program" options. This has been becoming more and more frequent and I think the problem started when
 I installed the Visual Basic 2008 Express (along with C++ and C# to give them a go and see what they were like). They didn't run so I uninstalled them and the problems started.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>My copy of Vista came with my HP Laptop and it is the Home Premium 32Bit. I have 4GB of RAM and an Intel Centrino Core 2 Duo processor
 and a high end NVidia HD graphics card (so this laptop is not low spec and it was expensive).</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>Please help!</strong></p>

            Ok, I've run SFC (or whatever its called) and it found some errors (too many for me to trawl through). Because Vista came pre-installed with my Laptop, how can I access the repair options that are found on an OEM or Retail DVD?
<div><br />
<div>I have a partition on my HDD with (what I guess) is some secured files in an image that I can't open.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What can I do now?</div>

<p>Hello Jamlava,</p>
<p>You can use the following KB article on how to fix errors with SFC. Click on the KB article number to bring it up.</p>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB Article ID: 928228</a> - How to analyze the log file entries that the Microsoft Windows Resource Checker (SFC.exe) program generates in Windows Vista</div>
<div>If you don't have an install disk, then you will need to contact your OEM or find a friend who has a Vista install disk.</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

<p>I have an OEM install disk (from another computer), but that is Windows Vista Ultimate, my version on my laptop is Windows Vista Home Premium.</p>
<p>Will it still work? Also, do I just put the disk in and run the SFC?</p>

<p>Hello Jamlava,</p>
<p>An install disk will work unless it is only a recovery disk. You might check with your OEM to see if you can get an installation disk.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Not from what I've seen. &nbsp;The game is pretty good, though. &nbsp;So if it is at 600 points, definitely get it.</p>
