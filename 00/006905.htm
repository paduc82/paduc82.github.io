<h2>            Something positive about Microsoft support</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I would like to post a very good experience with the Microsoft support.</p>
<p>My band 2 stuck with battery icon on lower right side, not possible to bring it back to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started a service request at Microsoft website and received a detailled description of what to do and also a UPS shipping label.</p>
<p>It took only 4 days from shipping the band to Microsoft germany and receiving a brand new one today. No costs for me at all !!</p>
<p>You have to notice that the band isn't sold in germany, I bought it in the Amazon UK store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So even if I am not 100% happy with the band and especially the ios app, the service is 100% perfect! And because I hope for further improvements in the ios app I will of course keep using my Band 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>....just to tell a positive story...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Grantler from germany</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 follow-up flag no longer has options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jwkim022  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 follow-up flag no longer has options</h2>
                    <p>Just recently, I noticed that all the follow-up flag options, such as today, tomorrow, and next week, has disappeared on the mail side of the application (<strong>Outlook 2016
</strong>not the native Windows 10 outlook). For some reason, my gut is telling me that this was an intentional "update" from Microsoft and probably is related to Outlook.com. Nevertheless, I'm wondering if anyone else is exhibiting this issue as well and if
 so I'd like to bring this to light to the developers because they need to bring it back. Setting to-do task flags on E-mails is one of Outlooks most core and powerful features. Regardless of whether it syncs with Outlook.com or whatever other reason there
 may be,&nbsp;it is ridiculous that it has just disappeared. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried contacting Microsoft's Answer Desk but they&nbsp;seem completely useless on the subject matter and seem to need some training on what "customer" service means.

<h2>            Contacts on Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime not getting sync with Microsoft Outlook&#47;People</h2>
                    <p>I`m using Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime having Android 4.4.4. I have synced all of my Hotmail Account data (emails, calendar and contacts) with my device using "Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync". Whenever I add a new contact on Microsoft Outlook/People, it gets
 downloaded on my device automatically and vice-versa should work but reversing the procedures i.e., adding any contact on the device isn't helping the cause meaning that whenever I add any contact on my device using "Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync", it should
 save that newly created contact on Microsoft Outlook/People too but that's isn't happening. The added contact gets saved on the device only and doesn't appear on the Microsoft Outlook/People. I have tried syncing the device again and again but contacts are
 NOT getting uploaded on Microsoft Outlook/People. Also I have tried removing the account and making it again but all in vain.</p>
<p>

            If you're viewing your message list arranged by <i>Conversations</i> you can select the header above a conversation's messages to select all messages in that folder and move those messages to a folder. If you're viewing messages with the
<b>Reading Pane</b> on the right you can click the <b>Conversations</b> button next to the Subject at the top to view all messages from all folders in the conversation.
<div><br />
<div>However, Outlook has no way of letting you select or move all messages in a conversation (messages in multiple folders) to another location.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please be sure to let Microsoft know you'd like to see this feature in future versions by using the
<b>Help</b> --&gt; <i>Send Feedback</i> mechanism in any Office application.</div>

    <title>MS Edge and Adobe reader - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonylawlor  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Edge and Adobe reader</h2>
                    <p>I was using MS Edge to bowse a website that required me to download or open adobe files to provide information. When I went to open the .pdf files MS edge said my adobe Reader was out of date and I needed to get the latest version and gave me a link to do
 just that. I followed the link and updated Adobe Reader just like I have done hundreds of times before. I relaunched MS Edge and lo and behold I get the same message I have to update Adobe Reader, so I do it again check the update version is indeed the latest
 and reboot my laptop. Again on loading the website MS edge tells me my AR is out of date and I need to update. Fed up now I run IE 11.248.16299.0, load up the website and open the pdf files without issue. I then tried Chrome, again no issue. There is no doubt
 there is a substancil issue with Adobe Reader and MS Edge. Ever a quick browse of the MS forums bears this out and whats more it has been an issue for a long time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW my Windows 10 OS is fully up to date as is my version of Adobe Reader. My question is Why has this issue been allowed to linger for so long. If Microsoft wants it's customers to use MS Edge as their daily browser they will have to do better than this.
 In many respects it is a fine browser but issues like this make it unuseable.</p>

<p>Hi Mercedes, so sorry that series did not work. &nbsp;It is indeed frustrating. &nbsp;Keep digging through the suggestions in this forum and try them all. &nbsp;It took some perseverance on my part. &nbsp;Hopefully a new release will come out that will address the problems.

            The comtrol you're looking for in the Additional Controls is "Microsoft MonthView ontrol 6.0 (SP4)". Tick its check box, then click OK. The Toolbox will now display an additional icon for the MonthView control click this, then click in your userform to
 insert a MonthView control. By default, its name will be MonthView1.

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have problem with the glance screen. It sometimes stops working in my Lumia 950. When it stops the telephone app is not working properly.
 Also it becomes completely black and you can't see who is calling or to call up.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have experimented with that to do a master reset of the phone and several soft resets and notes that the glance screen works for
 some time and then it suddenly stops working again. The most common reason for this error is if the battery runs completely out of power and the phone dies.
</span><span style="color: rgba(15, 15, 95, 1)">After charging, the problem always occurs the above error.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The solution I found to restore the glance screen and telefoni app is by turning off the phone-remove the battery and put back-turn
 your phone back on. Most of the time resolve the error but it can happen that I get to do this several times before it is OK.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I don´t know if the</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> problem may
 be caused by a hardware error or if I can make any changes in the phone.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also note that I, as a protection for the screen uses a 0.3 mm tempered protective glass. Because this accessories is for sale, I think
 it will work with this phone!</span></span></p>

    <title>Office 2011 for Mac&#58; why does &#34;Line Input&#34; in vba ignore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dougrsm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2011 for Mac&#58; why does &#34;Line Input&#34; in vba ignore carriage returns&#63;</h2>
                    In the previous versions of VBA for Word, Line Input performed correctly, reading a file up to the first carriage return. Office 2011 for Mac ignores carriage returns, making it impossible to access a text file line by line.<br />
<br />
What's more, the "Get" command as described in VBA literature yields an error (compile error: expected: list separator) when used to replace Line Input.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any info?<br />

</span></div>
<div><span>&gt;&gt;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>What seems to have happened is that previously (e.g. Word 2004) Word recognised ASCII 13 (CR) as a line end, but now it recognises ASCII 10 (LF) instead.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>You could argue that 13, or rather 13,10 is the "Windows" standard and 10 is the "Unix" standard on which Mac OS X is based (i.e. if you create a file in TextEdit) and that VBA should use the local standard. Or whatever.&nbsp;</span><span>Personally,
 I think VBA should continue to recognise the standard it always recognised, and I suspect this change is accidental. The VBA documentation suggests that because it says the following (and says 13 + 13 where I think it should say 13 + 10 :-( )</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><span><i>The&nbsp;<b>Line Input #</b>&nbsp;statement reads from a file one character at a time until it encounters a carriage return (<b>Chr(</b>13<b>)</b>) or carriage return-linefeed (<b>Chr(</b>13<b>)</b>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<b>Chr(</b>13<b>)</b>) sequence. Carriage return-linefeed
 sequences are skipped rather than appended to the character string.</i></span></span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>But the best you can probably manage is to use the Word-&gt;Help-Send feedback... to say you'd like some other option.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>&lt;&lt;</div>
<div><span>What's more, the "Get" command as described in VBA literature yields an error (compile error: expected: list separator) when used to replace Line Input.<br />
</span></div>
<div><span>&gt;&gt;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>What happens with Get depends on the file open mode (there are aspects to this that I never really understood), but the following general approach seems to work:</span></div>
<div><span><br />

                    <p>The majority of the drop downs on my ribbon on both Word and Powerpoint are not working, they are not giving me the option to select further.</p>
<p>For example, when trying to change the margin in word, I cannot select which size as they are not becoming visible.</p>

<p>Recent reports of this have all been solved by updating to the latest release of Word, AFAIK.

<p>It could be that this latest release only installs the 64-bit version.</p>

    <title>Add saved signature to email sent via Excel VBA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dusty615  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add saved signature to email sent via Excel VBA</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am hoping someone can help me out with a vba code addendum.</p>
<p>I have a spreadsheet and am using vba to send many-to-one rows of data to email recipients, which is working fantastically.&nbsp; However, I need to add in my autosignature from Outlook into the message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been searching the net for assistance, and have found numerous references to
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rondebruin.nl/mail/folder3/signature.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.rondebruin.nl/mail/folder3/signature.htm</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is now a dead link.&nbsp; I've also reviewed his site trying to find that information; unfortunately, each reference to doing the autosignature listed in his site that I've found leads me back to the dead link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me amend my code so that it adds the autosignature from Outlook to the mail messages?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my code (below my signature), along with the Function RangetoHTML that Ron says is required; any help is Greatly appreciated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi Eric, thanks for your reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first option&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;clicked copy in .emz file and in word when I select paste special it only gives me package object, files options to select.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second option of&nbsp;insert didn't help. When I tried to select object and create new I don't see Microsoft visio drawing in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Click <strong>Insert</strong>
</span></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Object</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"> &gt;<strong>Create</strong>
<strong>New</strong> &gt; <strong>Microsoft</strong> <strong>Visio</strong> <strong>
Drawing (cant find this in the list)</strong></span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In Addition I tried copying to powerpoint and excel, the image comes as cropped, it is weird that the .emz created from visio 2013 comes as a proper image without getting cropped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards, </p>

<p>I have had a simialr problem with Visio 2016.&nbsp; EMZ files created with Visio 2013 import fine to Word (using Insert &gt; Picture &gt; select EMZ file).&nbsp; Now after having Visio updated to 2016 when I create an emz file from the same Visio page and insert the emz
 file it comes in as a cropped image (right hand side of image gets cropped).&nbsp; Nothing I do changes the way Word imports the emz file. I spent months with my IT helpdesk trying to sort this out.&nbsp; In the end we un-installed Visio and re installed Visio with
 a different Build No.&nbsp; Old version 1708, build no 8431.2372, new verion 1708 Build No is 8431.2250.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The emz file worked fine for a couple of days, and then out the blue Voila!&nbsp; same problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Back to the helpdesk to try and fix the problem.</p>

            You can't update an N82 using that method. There are no over the air updates available for that model. Even if you get the server settings you won't find an update there.<br />
<br />
The only ways to update are:<br />
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/softwareupdate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nokia.com/softwareupdate</a><br />
<br />
Or at a nokia care point:<br />

<h2>            Outlook for Mac does not correctly sort search results</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm noticing that whenever I search my email in Outlook for Mac (v. 15.36 build 170702), the search results are not correctly listed by date order -- even if I specify that is the sort order (in View&gt;Arrange By or by clicking the top of the column).<br />
<br />
A couple recent emails will be at the top of the column, and then some from last year or the year before... and then more from this year.<br />
<br />
If I sort by ascending date, the incorrect order is simply reversed at the bottom of the list.<br />
<br />
This does not appear to be a Date Receive/Sent issue, as there is only a "Date" column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you an idea ? I have this problem at the first use of outlook for mac since 2 years.</p>
