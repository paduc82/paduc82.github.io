    <title>Denial of Service - Hacker - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Denial of Service - Hacker</h2>
                    
<p>To All,</p>
<p>There is a well known hacker / modder who continues on an almost daily basis to disconnect and freeze Xbox's from the Live service. He is denying service to paying customers. He maliciously and purposely destroys gameplay. He will tell every player in a
 game that he is disconnecting you from Live then proceeds to do so. In recent months he has done this to hundreds if not thousands of Xbox Live customers. My legaly&nbsp;paid for service, hardware and software are unusable as advertised, intended and purchased
 while this individual is allowed to continue his behavior.</p>
<p>He was very active with the same activity&nbsp;approximately 3 years ago with the same gamertag. He recently came back late last year with his old gamertag, which has since been shut down. He simply made a new account and continued on with his criminal activity.
 He has stated with his modding / hacking ability he can produce unlimited free gold accounts. Although he does play MW3 quite often, the criminal activity I describe above is in regards to older COD titles. He may also be actively hacking / modding MW3 and
 other titles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compaint after complaint has been filed by myself and countless others and yet he is on almost everyday. The enforcement team seemingly had him shut down for a couple of weeks when his account was banned. He makes a new account - same BS. I come to these
 forums&nbsp;seeking advice and information that will help anyone who cares to&nbsp;rid the Live service of this cancer. He is denying service to paying customers. He is denying service to my family with close to $4K invested in Xbox products. He is denying service to
 a product we enjoy and gladly pay for. I am willing and able to take the time and spend my own money to help shut him down.&nbsp;I am considering the following:</p>
<p>DNS - Criminal Complaint:&nbsp;&nbsp; Several&nbsp;potential roadblocks&nbsp;with this approach - Law enforcement jurisdiction, ponderous privacy issues, meeting criteria for a prosecutable offense. Although law enforcement may not want to invest resources in a case like this,
 they may be interested in what other nefarious / illegal&nbsp;activity this individual may be pursuing.</p>
<p>Small Claims Court (ToU18.1.5) :&nbsp;&nbsp; This will take much less effort and hopefully yield a solution to the problem. I believe I have a case. The implied warranty of merchantability has been breeched. I purchased a service and products that cannot be used as
 advertised and intended. I have plenty of documented evidence and I am in a state that disallows lawyers in small claims court. Do I want a succesful judgement? Of course. Is it about monetary damages? No. It is about drawing attention to criminal, malicious
 and purposeful behavior taking place on a service I enjoy and gladly pay for.</p>
<p>Yes I have considered filing a dispute notice (ToU18.1.3). I have been told by others that this did nothing for them&nbsp;to help solve the&nbsp;issue.</p>
<p>With all that said I have 2 questions for the masses:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is anyone aware of or had experience with a DNS case or Small Claims Case with similar circumstances as described above. Specifically on one of the 3 major online gaming providers.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any advice on who or what to contact to help resolve this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I welcome all replys, paying special attention to useful and insighteful information. Thank you for taking the time to read this. See you on the battlefield.</p>

<p>&nbsp; First of all , this isnt a place you will find much help, and really isnt even a place to bring it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp; You pretty much meantioned all the steps you can take, but you also suggest that you have done none of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp; If you know who this person is, as you suggest, you should contact the right authorities ..... otherwise, your post just sounds like unfounded accusations.</p>

<p>Unfounded accusations? I'll leave that one alone.</p>
<p>I am not expecting a miracle posting in this forum. I would expect out of the thousands of people that read and potentialy post in these forums I may receive some useful, intelligent and perhaps 'professional' information.</p>

<p>Just report this incident to the FBI and let them contact MS. What he's doing is against the law. Any hacking at all is against the law.</p>
<p>If the individual is doing what you say he is a criminal and should be put in jail. Contact your ISP they should have records of any denial of service attacks.</p>
<p>Contact and put in a report to the FBI, your ISP, and MS and let them do thier thing. If he still around continue to do it/</p>

<p>I appreciate the response. </p>
<p>I agree 100% regarding the criminality of the offenses. I am not sure it warrants FBI involvement but I'll look into that. I do like the idea of contacting my ISP and see what they have to say. When all is said and done it truly is Xbox Live's problem and
 should be resolved by them.</p>

<p>No it isn't. He uses outside methods to disconnect players and I'd be pretty sure that Microsoft can't track it. Your ISP may not even be able to track it back to him.</p>

<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">A DDoS attack is performed on a PC using third party unauthorized software. This is something that MS can not control or regulate on their service as it is done from outside their service. If you would like
 to know more about how a DDoS attack works, then I recommend you Google/Bing it.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">*</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">The only action MS can take against the offender is exactly what they are already doing, permanently banning each and every account he does this activity with. All you need to do is
<strong>file a complaint </strong>against him/her. Enforcement action on XBL is not instant as it does take time to investigate before any action is taken.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">*</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">The people whom you do need to contact whom can actually take the appropriate legal action against the offender is your local/federal law enforcement agency. I recommend you contact them in regards to this
 matter as this activity is illegal in many countries. In the US alone it carries a ten year prison sentence. Why would you think this does not warrant FBI involvement? It is a cyber crime. They handle cyber crimes. Perfect organization to contact.&nbsp;</span></div>

<p>Lung Butter Bob,</p>
<p>When I say it is Xbox Live's problem I am referring to the fact that this individual creates or purchases gold accounts that are not hidden. You can look him up and follow him like any other gamertag. He blatantly and clearly violates several of the ToU's
 on an almost daily basis. He has been reported countless times in game, direcct to XBLET and beyond. By his own admission he has been banned before. One of his accounts right now is banned under code of conduct.&nbsp;If his criminal activity was performed using
 a phantom account, no gamertag, then yes I would agree with you. (I have seen this before) He is not trying to hide this activity.</p>

<h2>            0x800700B7 Error when running Windows 7 &#40;64 bit&#41; backup</h2>
                    <p>Running Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit on Dell XPS 8500.&nbsp; Out of nowhere, recent backup run (done daily) backed up my documents fine, but when it started the operating system image, it spit out error 0X800800B7 and would not complete the backup.&nbsp; Several attempts
 produced the same results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ran SFC.exe, found nothing.&nbsp; Tried suggested deletion of the Windows Backup folder in the 'HKEY_Local_Machine\software\Microsoft\windowsNT\currentversion\schedule\taskcache\tree\Microsoft\windows" location; attempted fresh backup and the system ran fine
 until it finished "My Documents" and started to create an operating system image when it kicked out 0x800700B7 again and stopped the back up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, I am unable to get the system to back up.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            New Windows 10 computer telling me I have an update ready to install and it is an upgrade to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought a new computer last weekend with Windows 10 already installed.&nbsp; Today it says I have an update.&nbsp; The update says Upgrade to Windows 10 Homer Version 1511,10586.&nbsp; It says it is ready to install and will do it at a time I am not using the computer.&nbsp;
 Why would it be installing windows 10 when windows 10 is already installed on my computer?&nbsp; How do I stop it from installing it?&nbsp; If it installs it anyway will the usb recovery that I made when I got the computer still work in case I ever have to reinstall
 windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Shirley</p>

            <p>The advent of Windows 10 heralds a new way of updating. Windows 10 is an on-going operating system that is being continuously upgraded unlike previous versions which were static apart from service packs and security updates.</p>
<p>You should allow the upgrade .</p>

    <title>Run multiple instances of Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> weeping tree  say:</h3>
<h2>            Run multiple instances of Skype</h2>
                    <p>Just installed the Skype update and I'm not at all impressed. Ignoring that it changed the language and there doesn't seem to be a way to change back (which is annoying enough), I can't seem to run two instances of Skype at once. This is important to me
 as I have two accounts which I often use at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The help article here –&nbsp;https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA829/how-can-i-run-multiple-skype-accounts-at-the-same-time – doesn't work, and is in fact misleading because it refers to the default location of the "old" Skype, not the "new" Skype. I've tried
 creating a shortcut with the /secondary pointing to the new location, but that didn't work for me. Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

<h2>            hdmi handshake issue</h2>
                    
<p>Terrible. All of a sudden my Xbox will not display on my TV. Either through hdmi or component. Shows 'no signal'. Was working just fine a few days ago. Tried everything. Also called 800 #, tried everything. Now Microsoft wants to charge me for repairs? Crazy!
 Why send it, why charge me $99 when we all know its a software issue? Why make money on a problem Microsoft can solve?</p>

<p>So when will there be a software update to fix this? We have been waiting or at least I have been waiting since Dec 2014. What is the "at home solution" here? Please do not answer that &nbsp;have to send the console in because if I do I will be charged $99 and
 this is $99 that Microsoft dos not need to make off of it's customers who already paid for their product. Microsoft should not squeeze more money out of me when clearly this problem is theirs. Again when will there be a Firmware update to fix this???</p>

<p>Okay. So I have 2 xbox 360 slims at home. both the 4gb models. one I got a bigger hard drive for. the other is still 4gbs. they work fine. flawless. I just bought another xbox 360 yesterday. so I decided to just unplug the 4gb one and put this new one on
 there. and the hdmi screen just stays blank. what the hey Microsoft. so I unplug it and plug the 4gb model. and that one boots up normaly thru the exact same hdmi cord and port. what just happened here. I have 3 xbox 360 and two work perfect while one doesn't
 want to accept hdmi. so I use a rgby cable and it boots up thru there but it does on a black and white screen. so I try a normal white yellow and red cable and that boots up perfect. but its looking cheap o and grainy. I mean it works. but I rather use the
 xbox thru hdmi where its more clear and better looking. I have 3 HDMI cables and 2 tvs and 2 other normaly working xbox to play with. any suggestions?</p>

            Hi Ben
<br />
<br />When you closed your Skype account, you closed the associated Microsoft Account . . .
<br />
<br />If it is less that 60 days since you closed your Skype Account, then all you need to do is log into your Microsoft Account online to re-activate your account on all Microsoft Online services . . .

<h2>            Windows 10 Logo</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder What is the idea behind windows 10 logo?</p>
<p>What is the meaning of it ?</p>
<p>and why Microsoft has changed the regular windows logo (four colour windows) to one colour logo?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Vulcum,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your issue. We recommend to power off your phone/pc completely. If you are on a phone we also recommend to try it on a PC. Also try different browsers, internet explorer, edge, firefox, chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I have a silver account that friends use when they come over and I've added a few 1 month for $1 dollar xbox live gold deals which probably total 3 months all up and that account has a tenure of 1 year.... So based on my experience tenure counts even when
 silver.</p>

<p>First I would suggest reading this <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-360/networking/dos-attacks-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../dos-attacks-faq</a>.</p>
<p>Then try turning your router off for two minutes and restarting. This should fix your internet connection.</p>
<p>Next file a complaint against the person and block communications. Information on how to do both can be found behind this link
<a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/HowTo/360/File-a-Complaint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">enforcement.xbox.com/.../File-a-Complaint</a>.</p>
<p>Also you should consider contacting your ISP. What you describe is illegal and they should take it very seriously, as it is an attack against their network.</p>

<p>Thank you for jumping on this one vote! Much appreciated!</p>
<p>MONDO please follow through with the above advice. It will most certainly set you on the right path and remedy any issues you are having. Be sure to file that complaint, the report will be sent off to the PET (Enforcement Team) and they will conduct a very
 thorough investigation and take the appropriate action necessary once they reach a conclusion.</p>

<p>I've also heard that changing IPs isn't that hard to do. I'd assume the level of difficulty would be dependent on who your provider is. Not sure if that helps you any at this point, but hey, it's out there :)</p>

<p>Most people have what is called a Dynamic IP. This means it changes every time you connect to the internet or reset your router. This will give you a new IP address.</p>
<p>In some cases you'll need to contact tour ISP in order to get it changed. If your IP address remains the same no matter what then you have what is known as a Static IP. These aren't usually issued to home customers but to people and companies who run their
 own websites.</p>
<p>DDoS attacks are therefore far more of an issue for the latter.<br />
<br />
Edit: I know that is a simplification but it holds true for most people.</p>

<p>Mine is Dynamic. Tested it last night using a site that shows you your own IP address. Much rather be Dynamic then Static given the effects you can suffer if attacked on an address that doesn't change :/</p>

<h2>            Headphone jack malfunctioning on Windows 8</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I purchased Windows 8 Pro today and installed it on my laptop. Everything was working fine until I discovered that the headphone jack wasn't working correctly. I plugged a pair of headphones in but no sound was playing through them. I've checked them on
 other devices and they have worked fine. I'd appreciate any help on how to solve this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
                </div>

            <p><span>Hi SeanLarkin, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to know that you are facing an issue to use the headphones after installing Windows 8.
<span>It would be helpful if you could reply to these questions to assist you further.</span></p>
<p><span>1. What is the make and model of the laptop and headphones?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Are you able to connect and use other headphones?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Are you able to get sound from inbuilt speakers? Do external speakers also work?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s try the following steps and check if it helps to fix the issue.</p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p>Update the Sound card and Chipset drivers.</p>
<p>a. Press "<b>Windows key + R".</b></p>
<p>b. Type "<b>devmgmt.msc</b>" in the Open box and click <b>OK.</b></p>
<p>c. Expand "<b>Sound, video and game controllers</b>".</p>
<p>d. Right click the <b>driver </b>and<b> </b>select<b> update</b>.</p>
<p>Restart the computer and check for the issue.</p>
<p>You may also refer to the computer manufacturer website and try installing the chipset and sound card drivers.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Windows 8 drivers are not available, then you may install the Windows 7 drivers in Windows 7 compatibility mode:</p>
<p>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</p>
<p>a. Download the <span>driver </span>from the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>b. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on <b>‘properties’</b>.</p>
<p>c. Click on the <b>‘compatibility’</b> tab and check the box <b>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</b> and select Windows 7 operating system from the drop down menu.</p>
<p>d. Click on <b>‘Apply’</b> and click <b>‘OK’</b> and run the file to install it.</p>
<p>For further information, refer the article:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>Set headphones as default.</span></p>
<p><span>a. </span><span>On the start screen of Windows 8 press the <b>Windows key + X</b> key on the keyboard and then click on
<b>Control Panel</b> and then <b>Hardware and sound</b>.<br />
b. Click on <b>Sound</b>. Select the <b>Playback</b> tab, right click within the window and check<b> Show Disabled devices.</b></span></p>

<b>enable</b>. <br />
e. Highlight that headphones and click on <b>Set as Default</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you need further assistance, please reply and we will be happy to help you.</span></p>

            Hi ΘωμάςΘωμάς 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />After Skype v7, all conversations are stored in cloud. So when you login, all your conversations which you had using v8 Skype will be visible to you.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            The chats will be visible only if they were stored in the cloud and this started with v8 Skype. Hence, if you installed v8 Skype on 10-Oct-18, then you can see the chats starting from 10-Oct-18. All chats prior to 10-Oct-18 were not stored in the cloud, hence will not be visible. 
<br />Prior to 10-Oct-18 chats could have been recovered from main.db file of Skype which you seems to have lost.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the only thing I can find is that it is/was a Deal done by BestBuy in Canada. (Which currently can be found here: https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/xbox-live-3-month-gold-membership-digital-download/10629884.aspx )</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if that is the situation for you, that you purchased it from BestBuy in Canada then it's best to contact the store itself regarding this deal.</p>
<p>Which means that it's not an Xbox deal in it's origin but a BestBuy deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the deal was from somewhere else then it's best to contact them.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that deals may be different per region, so if it was a local offer then it's best to contact support via Phone for your region.</p>
        </p>

            The promotion was BOTH on the Microsoft website AND my Xbox Dashboard. There was no information what so ever on any “regions”. It clearly states valid in the US. Frankly, I feel cheated because I bought this promotion specifically for the VC and now they’re
 all telling me it never existed.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/228d9700-cfa0-4f1b-a39d-a46453a89a67?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/228d9700-cfa0-4f1b-a39d-a46453a89a67?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3551da1-db82-4640-8a8b-e63a284d4bc2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3551da1-db82-4640-8a8b-e63a284d4bc2?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a71a1585-2418-4951-9f55-c1cc7eb59242?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a71a1585-2418-4951-9f55-c1cc7eb59242?upload=true" /></a>

<p>I’m having the same issue as well except they told me that since im in Canada, I would not get the deal, even though it showed up on my console. Now to find out the article says they have up to the end of the year to give us the code. I don’t know who to
 believe. Is that the reason I have not got my code? And not the fact that im in Canada? Sounds like they don’t really know left from right. I’ll wait for my code if its coming 100%. But im not gonna wait till 2019 then attempt to ask for a refund.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>can you check to which Region your console is set? If that is set to the US you will see US related deals, which might not be available in your region. If it is set to Canada then the deal is likely to be available for you as well and in that case you'll
 likely receive it around the specified date </p>
<p>12/31/2018</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check the region set on the console see Settings - Language &amp; Location .</p>

<h2>            Skype notifications on my Android</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>I notice when I send a Skype message from my Windows 10 computer that when people reply it only show notifications on my computer but not on my phone.&nbsp; It only shows a notification on my phone when I originally sent the message from my phone.</p>
<p>Why does it not show notifications on my phone also?</p>

            Thats because you would not be signed into Skype on the Android device when you are receiving notification on your Windows 10 desktop.
