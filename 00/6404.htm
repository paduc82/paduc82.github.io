<h2>            Microsoft return guarantee</h2>
                    <p>February 2018 I started my journey to get my refund from Microsoft.&nbsp; I was soon contacted and I have a return number.&nbsp; I am qualified for a refund and I am on the list.&nbsp; Every month or so I call to see when I will get my refund. The customer service for
 the returns program are very nice and professional but I do not get my refund.&nbsp; They assure me I am qualified for the refund, the refund has been approved, the check will come as soon as they get the funds released from Microsoft.&nbsp; I have tried to call the
 Microsoft company but they are less than pleasant.&nbsp; The last person I talked to refused to let me talk to his supervisor.&nbsp; When I complained he put me on hold and then said we needed to hang up and his supervisor would immediately call me back.&nbsp; Of course
 we all knew that was not going to happen.&nbsp; What I don't understand is I did not do anything wrong.&nbsp; I returned the card with a letter and the number they gave me.&nbsp; They called to tell me they had received the information and that they would send me a check.&nbsp;
 Why is Microsoft not honoring their word?&nbsp; I worked 27 years for a retail company, most of it at the corporate office.&nbsp; I know most companies value customer service as a very important part of their business.&nbsp; I am at a loss as what to do to get my refund.&nbsp;
 It has been almost a year and I have been patient but surely there is a reason why Microsoft is not keeping their promise.&nbsp; Can you help me?</p>

<h2>            Wont Install Apps On Nokia Lumia 635</h2>
                    <div>It downloaded Apps and installed no problem before then out of nowhere it downloads but then it wont Install. It messages saying to make sure my phone updates is up to date and I keep checking and it says updated. So what is the
 problem? My phone carrier recently cut off my service but I've had an iPhone before and had no problems without service? So I went into my nokia account and put my credit card as payment preferred instead of phone bill. It installed eBay today out of the many
 times I've tried previously. I dont know why all I did differently was look at the release notes. It wont install anything afterward now I dont know how to cancel downloads so I'm stuck with this big list of things to download. Really frustrated with this
 phone it says the same thing to make sure my phone is up to date but I checked and that Lumia denim isn't available for me 😠 Can anyone help me with this? This phone sucks and seriously going to go back to apple👎👎👎 especially since buying a 32gb sd card
 cuz the memory sucks on This phone. Why wont it Install? It downloads no problem!!!!!!

<h2>            Pivot Tables in crisis over missing &#34;Match Destination Formatting &#34; option  Excel 2016</h2>
                    I've looked in several forums and find variations on this question, but not much in the way of answers. &nbsp;Our company just switched from Excel 2010 to Excel 2016 (O365) and I'm trying to figure out how to make things play together now. &nbsp;I have a dashboard
 made up of several pivot tables based off of a report that I generate in MS Access. &nbsp;When I want to update the dashboard, I generate the report in Access, export it to Excel, copy the data and paste into the dashboard "data" worksheet. &nbsp;I've always used the
 paste option "Match Destination Formatting" which has allowed me to paste the data, refresh the pivot tables and everything works beautifully. &nbsp;Now, however, the Match Destination Formatting option is not even showing as available on the paste menu and when
 I found it in the list of "all commands" to add to my quick access bar, it remains greyed out all of the time, so it is unusable. &nbsp;When I paste my data, even as "values only", my dates come through al

<p>Hi Kim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my understanding, you are encountering the following problems:</p>
<p>1.The Match Destination Formatting option is greyed out when you want to use it.</p>
<p>2.The data format in pivot table is different from the one in the source data.</p>
<p>3.You cannot group the Dates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my understanding is correct, then:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Point 1 #: I test Match Destination Formatting feature on the latest version of Excel (1707 build 8326.2096), the feature works fine. Please
<a href="https://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZle2Ky4bWAhVFT7wKHRQ6Ba4QFggxMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.office.com%2Fen-us%2Farticle%2FInstall-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5&amp;usg=AFQjCNGrvdhD_e9SH54u60ME8UntAIFpMQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
update your Exce</a>l to the latest version to check whether the problem exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Point 2#: I would like to explain that this is a normal behavior, dates are treated specially in pivot table. But we can change the format in Date filed by clicking on
<strong>Filed settings</strong> of Date field and go to <strong>Number Format</strong> to change its format as you need.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c71b32b-d829-473a-8a5f-8f157095d9f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c71b32b-d829-473a-8a5f-8f157095d9f8" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Point 3#: Please create a new pivot table by the steps in this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-a-PivotTable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-A9A84538-BFE9-40A9-A8E9-F99134456576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create a PivotTable to analyze worksheet data</a>, then check whether you can group data by the steps in this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Group-or-ungroup-data-in-a-PivotTable-report-c9d1ddd0-6580-47d1-82bc-c84a5a340725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Group or ungroup data in a PivotTable report</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, please provide the following information to let us better understand your situation, so that we can move forward:</p>
<p>1.A screenshot of "I don't get any grouping options".</p>
<p>2.Please record a video to show us how you create the pivot table, how you group data and the behavior it exhibits, this will give us a better understanding of your situation and more information to move forward. You can upload the video to this OneDrive
 folder via the private message.</p>
<p>3.A screenshot of your Excel <strong>File</strong> tab&gt;<strong>Account</strong> page.</p>
<p>4.A sample file to let us test this on our side, please upload it to the OneDrive folder above as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If my understanding about the problem you are encountering is incorrect, please feel free to post back and clarify your question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Joanne </p>

    <title>Tracking meeting attendees without requesting responses - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Tracking meeting attendees without requesting responses</h2>
                    I created a meeting and sent it to several hundred people through a distribution list. I didn't want to receive emails to say they'd responded so I unchecked the request responses option. However, now my manager has asked me how many people have accepted.
 Is there any way to tell? The tracking section just shows 'none' for everyone. Btw I know I can set up rules to not get the email responses but I prefer to do it on a meeting by meeting basis depending on whether I need the responses or not.

 onto my new computer?</blockquote>
a playlist on the PC is a list of songs, and includes their file location. &nbsp;If you copy the playlist file, and the music is not where the playlist says it is, you will run into trouble. &nbsp;But, you can reverse sync them from device to the new PC, after you also
 get the music there...
<div>I'd suggest you move the music first, then reverse sync playlists.</div>
<div>Copy the music from the old to the new PC by some convenient process. That could be over a home network, by using an external disk drive, burning them to CD and copying to the new PC,etc. &nbsp;It can even be done by reverse syncing the zune device under certain
 circumstances...</div>
<div>Zune pass music: &nbsp;copy or reverse sync to the new PC &nbsp; Login and try to play a track on the new PC... it may take a few seconds but the DRM (copy protection) will reauthorize the music if you haven't exceeded the 3 PC limit.</div>
<div>Purchased music: &nbsp;copy MP3 (or any non-DRM'd compatible file) by any convenient means.</div>
<div>Purchased music with DRM (will be wma format.) &nbsp;If you have any of these, you will have to burn them to an audio (not mp3) CD, and re-rip to the new PC. &nbsp;Zune went DRM free a couple years back, so you can no longer restore these from the marketplace.</div>
<div>To reverse sync: &nbsp;connect the device, and in zune software click device. &nbsp;navigate to the content or playlist and select one or more. drag and drop to the PC icon. &nbsp;The limitations on this are:</div>
<div>Playlists: &nbsp;I think autoplaylists will copy back as static or manual playlists only (the 'auto' part is only on the PC.) Static&nbsp;playlists&nbsp;should be fine.</div>
<div>Music: &nbsp;if you have set the software to transcode music to lower bit rates (smaller files) to fit more on the zune, you can only get that transcoded version back off the zune. &nbsp;</div>

<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Restart </strong>your phone.</p>
<p>2. <strong>If not </strong>go to <strong>Settings &gt; Extras &gt; Equaliser </strong>
then plug in your headphones and enable <strong>Virtual surround </strong>.</p>

 to change this to the only other option, "Every Month (Current Branch)", I got the following error:</p>

 at which it will allow users to get Office updates from every 4 months to every month.&nbsp;</p>

            Well, I see you also have a different version of Office 365 than I, so maybe that is an issue also.&nbsp; I am guessing it will eventually show up on your machine.

<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 multiple issues.</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 7, 64 bit, and now have internet explorer 11. </p>
<p>1. When in my emails screen on BT mail and I click on IE print preview the email text does not show on the preview and only shows the&nbsp;BT heading. It is the same thing&nbsp;that my printer prints. There is
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">no</span> email text. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It will also not open&nbsp;any web pages when I click on&nbsp;the blue <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
underlined text</span>. The new tab appears with e in it and nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Some web sights do not open I just get e in the tab with nothing happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have only upgraded in the last 2 days to IE 11 and I now expect to find many more problems. I started with&nbsp;IE&nbsp;7 which works fine but I feel I should be moving forwards.
</p>
<p>I have had to remove all&nbsp;IE upgrades from 8 to 10 which all gave me the same problems and I feel that I should not have to remove&nbsp;IE 11 for these reasons.
</p>
<p>I am sure that someone with more knowledge old me will have all the answers.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Does Internet explorer show blank webpage when you say, "new tab appears with e in it and nothing happens"?</p>
<p>2. Have you made any hardware or software changes to your computer recently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Please run this Microsoft fixit and check.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Fix Internet Explorer issues to make IE fast, safe and stable </strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/ie_performance_and_safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/ie_performance_and_safety/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not help, then use method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Please use suggestions provided in this Microsoft help article and check the issue.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Unable to print or view the print preview of a webpage in Internet Explorer</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973479</a><br />
(Also applies to Internet explorer 11)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue still persists, then use method 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
Use suggestions provided in this help article and check.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Nothing happens when you click a link in Internet Explorer</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/175775" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/175775</a><br />
(Also applies to Internet explorer 11)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Important Notes:<br />
The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note these
 sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</p>
<p><br />
I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>When I clicked on "Method 1 web text" it shows there is a new tab with e (internet explorer e) and this time says "blank page" but I don't usually get Blank page in the tab and X to close the tab. There is nothing else here, no page is displayed just the
 tab. I tried to insert a screen print of the page but it wouldn't show here, too many characters I think.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;still &nbsp;have to try Methods 1-3 once I read them and understand them, will get back again later.</p>
<p>Dave&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Method 2: There is nothing I see here that looks as if it would sort my problem.</p>
<p>Method 3: These look like things that fix it would have sorted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I opened Google and working from there I could do everything just fine print email text and opening web pages.

            <p>Hello, Amid K. Verma,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just reset internet explorer as you suggested and I still have the same problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still&nbsp;have an error message on the '.dll' files that we mentioned before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message reads:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>The module <strong>"mshtml.dll</strong>" was loaded but the entry-point DllResgister was not found.</p>
<p>Make sure that "mshtml.dll" is a valid DLL or OCX file and then try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the same for</p>
<p>regsvr32<strong> shdocvw.dll</strong></p>
<p>regsvr32<strong> browseui.dll</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Message on<strong> regsvr32 </strong><strong>msjava.dll</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The module "msjava.dll" failed to load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure the binary is stored at the specified path or debug </p>
<p>it to check for problems with the binary or dependent .DLL files</p>
<p>
</p><p>These messages do not mean much to me and I think that I need&nbsp;to know how to do what&nbsp;they say.</p>
<p>Do you think that this could cause my problems?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave</p>

<p>&nbsp; Don't worry about it.&nbsp; Those tips are&nbsp;obsolete.&nbsp; The implementation has changed so that in some cases: the module no longer exists, the entry points required to allow the regsvr32 command have been removed, or there are permissions constraints set on the
 registry keys involved so that even if neither of the first two problems are present the regsvr32 command won't work anyway.&nbsp; If you want to see a list of modules which you could try doing that to, use DependencyWalker to find which ones still have entry points
 for DllRegisterServer or DllInstall; &nbsp;then you could try using the appropriate regsvr32 command syntax accordingly.&nbsp; In some cases syntax that we might expect to work doesn't and doesn't have any useful effect.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp; regsvr32.exe&nbsp; /i&nbsp; ieframe.dll&nbsp;
 might be expected to work because that module has both entry points in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, only&nbsp; regsvr32.exe&nbsp; /n&nbsp; /i&nbsp; ieframe.dll&nbsp; actually does something useful.&nbsp; Etc.</p>

<p>Some kind of compatibility issue with printing using IE11?&nbsp; Unless it will work with either Compatibility View (Alt-x b) or an emulation mode (F12, Ctrl-8) you would probably be best to try a different browser.&nbsp; However your other problem cases might be
 worth diagnosing in case there is really something wrong with your browser or your OS (and not just the site).&nbsp;&nbsp; If you figure out an emulation that works for you, you can report it here:</p>

            <p>Hello, Robert Aldwinckle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, as I can see no end to these problems I will just go back to EI 8, which will work fine but may not have the same security attached to it. No other IE from 9-11 has worked on this HP desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively I can get everything to work on Google Chrome both of these Print e-mails and open all web sight unless my Norton tells me not to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be a step backwards but it will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again you have been helpful.</p>

<h2>            Viewing e-mails in Outlook, Problem.</h2>
                    I have a problem, when I sign into the outlook account, and press to view an e-mail, it tells me to refresh the page or log back in. It does this VERY often. What is the problem and how can I fix it?

    <title>Recovery Key for windows 10 mobile phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peater s.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovery Key for windows 10 mobile phone</h2>
                    <p>Hi!<br />
I've got 2 day ago used lumia 640xl from ebay as a present for my friend. I turned it on and there was no edge explorer and I couldn't login.<br />
Then I found out that it was windows 10 mobile insider preview&nbsp;version installed. Hard reset didn't help me. So&nbsp; I've downloaded windows device recovery tool, connected phone to the computer by USB and reinstalled windows 10 mobile.</p>
<p>By a new start I need now to enter 25 digit recovery key. </p>
<p>I guess that Reset Protection has been turned on after I did first hard reset.</p>
<p>The phone is not connected to my account so I can't get this key by myself.</p>
<p>How this problem can be resolved?</p>

<p>Odds are that it is a stolen phone. The owner would have removed reset protection (Really 'Device encryption'). If the seller is the true owner, then they may be able to help.</p>
<p>Otherwise go to MS help desk. They may want the IMEI to check the status of the phone.</p>
<p>If it has an SD card in it, have you tried reformatting that in another device?</p>

            If I could do something by myself with this problem I wouldn't ask for help. This phone is allegedly connected to somewhats account (but may be not in case of a bug in insider preview version). I have created account after first hard reset but the phone
 didn't connect to it. So I have a message on that my accounts page that I don't have any devices. I hope Microsoft will investigate my case using IMEI of the phone.&nbsp;

            I have been having a similar issue, using Word 2013. Very often when I try to highlight text to format it (bold, underline, etc.) the screen freezes and becomes unresponsive for several seconds up to a minute or two. This happens with other types of formatting
 as well. For example, I just opened a new document and tried to change it to landscape orientation. This resulted in the same unresponsive screen for about a minute. This shouldn't happen.

<h3> pgoelz  say:</h3>
<h2>            What are we doing here&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So... what ARE we doing here? &nbsp;MS releases build after build that seem to just add frufru features.... as well as pretty serious bugs. &nbsp;We try to install and then report the bugs we find.... and the bugs never seem to be fixed. &nbsp;The next build has the same
 bugs plus new ones. &nbsp;With essentially zero useful MS participation here, there doesn't seem to be much point in participating on this forum or the insider preview program. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, of course this is beta software and bugs are to be expected. &nbsp;But in order to actually USE the phone normally and provide useful real world feedback, we have to be able to install the update and then make it through the day without serious bugs that
 render the phone unusable. &nbsp;That does not seem to be the case with most insider previews I have tried to use. &nbsp;I use the phone for less than a day, find a serious issue that means I cannot trust the phone or one of its core features to be operable when I need
 it..... and I go back to my Android phone which ALWAYS works.... and yes, it too is on a beta build. &nbsp;But Android beta builds seem to get better with each release. &nbsp;No way I can say that about Windows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And while I'm at it..... what does MS actually release as a production build? &nbsp;One of the preview builds? &nbsp;If so, I don't hold out much hope.... I haven't had one in the last six months that was even close to reliable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we got the latest preview build with non-functional bluetooth, that was the point where I gave up on insider previews for now and reverted back to the production build... my phone works great now ;) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I am fully and painfully aware that insider builds are NOT production releases. &nbsp;But in order to allow real world use, they have to actually be usable without crippled bluetooth, flakey networking, sudden severe battery drain, disappearing volume
 sliders, permanently stuck Store updates, failure to install the preview build itself or any of the other serious usability issues that seem to crop up with every new insider preview. &nbsp;I only have one cell account and one SIM card. &nbsp;The phone I put it in is
 going to be my daily driver, so it actually needs to be reasonably functional or I won't use it. &nbsp;</p>

            Hello John, <br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting the question.<br />
<br />
I understand that you want to know how to integrate Acrobat into Outlook 2013. <br />
<br />
I will provide you necessary information, however I have a quick question for you:<br />
<br />
Is the version of Acrobat compatible to work with Outlook 2013?<br />
<br />
Outlook 2013 is a new program and some 3rd party programs might not be compatible with it.
<br />
Check about the compatibility with the Acrobat support. <br />
<br />
If it is compatible, check whether Acrobat's add-in is listed and enabled/disabled in Outlook.
<br />
<br />
To access the add-ins from Outlook, <span>
click on <b>File</b> menu, click <b>Options</b>, <b>Add-ins</b>, <b>Go</b> button besides Manage:
<b>Com-in Add</b>.<br />
<br />
If the add-in is disabled, enable it and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
Hope the above information is helpful. Reply and I'll be glad to further assist you.
<br />
<br />
Thank You.<br />
<br />

<div><br />
<div>I have the same problem as John. I followed your instructions, but it appears impossible to move Acrobate PDFMaker Office COM Add-In to the group of Add-ins available. Actually, it appears a message saying: "Not loaded. A runtime error occurred during

    <title>Office 2010 25004 Error after installing Visio and Project 2010 Trials - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardhaynes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2010 25004 Error after installing Visio and Project 2010 Trials</h2>
                    I have been using Office 2010 ever since Beta stages and never had a single issue up until now.<br />
<br />
I needed to create some database ERDs and create a gantt chart to show project timeline so obviously Visio and Project were needed.<br />
<br />
I installed the Trials to see if it was worthwhile getting full licences for each but after installing both and restarting, my standard Office installation stopped working. I tried running Visio and Project and both report EXACTLY the same error.<br />
<br />
The error reads:<br />
<br />
<i>Microsoft Office Professional 2010 configuration did not complete successfully.<br />
<br />
Error 25004. The product key you entered cannot be used on this machine. This is most likely due to previous Office 2010 trials being installed. (System error: -1073422308)</i><br />
<br />
My Office installation was never a Trial and this is the first time I have ever installed Visio or Project Trials so I dont understand why it is saying I had previous trials as this is incorrect.<br />
<br />
I have read several forum posts on this and tried several of the solutions with no joy and I am now at my wits end as I have no working Office installation and several deadlines looming.<br />
<br />
Some sites report that this issue is by design and I am horrified that Microsoft can force my fully purchased Office installation to stop working after installing two totally separate products. I consider this 'compromising' my system and liken it to a malware
 attack which i believe is a criminal offence in the US.<br />
<br />
I hope someone out there can resolve this for me.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Richard Haynes.<br />

Have you tried to simply re-activate (not re-install) your Office installation(s)?<br />
<br />
You can sue, but if you read the MS License terms, the&nbsp; best you can hope for is a refund of the purchase price ...&nbsp; your license essentially says "use at your own risk".<br />

Firstly, I made NO changes to my Office installation. I only installed Visio and Project which are sold completely separately of Office and therefore should not have had any affect to Office. The suing part relates to them making modifications to a part of
 my system I didnt authorize them to change or at least wouldnt resonably expect to change since they are separate products.<br />
<br />
As for my solutions, I have tried about 15 now so I cannot fully retrace my steps but some I can recall trying are: re-activating all three resulting in the same error; uninstalled Visio and Project and I get the same error upon trying to reinstall; tried an
 Office repair; deleting registry keys apparently related to the product keys and activation.<br />
<br />
I am reluctant to uninstall Office itself incase im prevented from reinstalling it in some way as that would really be the icing on the cake.<br />

            OK, to be completely clear, you had a legal and working copy of Office. Then you installed TRIAL versions of Visio and Project.
<br />
<br />
Have you bought copies of Visio and Project?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Yes, Visio and Project 2010 only sold standalone, not as part of any bundle.&nbsp; BUT, MS insists marketing as part of "Office", what ever that means.&nbsp; I believe that also means they use the same activation process and system.&nbsp; When you start "bolting on" stuff
 (like Visio and Project to "Office"), other stuff can get broken (great technical terminology, right).
<br />
<br />
Activation is a deep dark black hole that MS just doesn't tell us about.&nbsp; We see problems like yours here all the time.&nbsp; "All of a sudden" there is a mysterious problem with activation. Sometimes the cause can be traced back to Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />
With your system in it's current "fragile" state I agree that simply uninstalling Office is probably not a good idea.<br />
<br />
But that is only because of the activation problems you are having. If you currently have a copy of Office purchased from a legal retailer the license terms allow you to re-install it on the same computer even if it is one of the "1-computer" licenses like
 OEM or PKC.<br />
<br />
At this point I see only 2 options. First is to call the MS activation center to see if they can help you with the problem. When you call in, don't answer the initial phone system prompts, wait a long time until you are offered the option to talk to a live
 service rep.<br />
<br />
Other than that the only thing I can suggest is the lame old standard, re-install WINDOWS.&nbsp; That way you start with a fresh slate.&nbsp; When you are re-installing the various Office apps,
<b>make sure that only one is not activated at a time.</b><br />
<br />
If your Windows re-install is from a refresh partition, then either activate the factory trial of Office, or uninstall it. Reboot the computer, Install your copy of Office, activate it. Then install Visio (or Project) and Activate it. Then finally install the
 last program and activate it.<br />

Thank you for your reply Rohn007.<br />
<br />
The Office installation is indeed a legit copy. I downloaded the installer package and purchased a PKC from PC World a couple years ago.<br />
<br />
I have tried the activation center but whilst they have confirmed my PKC is legit, they are at a loss as to why I have had issues. 'It shouldn't happen' was their response. They even got someone who was able to RCD into my laptop and they themselves couldnt
 understand what was wrong.<br />
<br />
Using your 'reinstall windows' idea, I have however been able to 'reproduce' the problem under a virtual machine. This gave me a clean slate to ensure there was no conflicting programs or corrupt registry keys etc.<br />
<br />
The VM had a legit copy of Win7(x64) installed and I was able to install Office Professional 2010(x64) using my PKC and have it running successfully. Then I tried installing Visio and Project Trials again. This completely broke Office so there is something
 majorly wrong with this Trial system they implement.<br />
<br />
I now have three VMs, one for a functioning version of Office, one for Project Trial and one for Visio Trial. Its a solution but far from ideal and I get the suspicion my upgrade to Office 2013 isnt going to be a smooth one anymore!<br />

            Good trouble shooting.<br />
<br />
I am surprised you were able to use the PKC to activate a second (?) copy of Office in a VM.
<br />
<br />
I'm glad to hear that they also say "it shouldn't happen". <br />
<br />
This is a total shot in the dark, I wonder if this is a x64 issue. I'm sure others have had similar x86 Office / Visio / Project installations. But since relatively few people have Office x64 there is less chance many others have tried this.<br />
<br />
Just out of curiosity, do you have a specific need to us Office x64?&nbsp; Are you dealing with large (2GB) files?<br />
<br />
3 VM's is not an ideal solution, but at least you have something that works, more or less.<br />

            Hi Rohn,<br />
<br />
Thats how I got to speak to the activation center in the first place as it threw a wobbly about already being used and they 'released' it somehow.<br />
<br />
And yes, I handle large data sets. We are upgrading from an Excel-based system to a database-driven website system (hence the ERD diagrams and project plan!) as I spend most of my day combining 20 different spreadsheets into one 'master' spreadsheet. Stupid
 system but its always worked so noone ever changed it until now.<br />
<br />
Also, I now have further issues as I was testing out Office 365 alongside my normal installation (didnt have any issues in the two months I was using this set up until the Visio/Project installations) which is now showing as 'unlicenced'. I have checked my
 licence and its still valid so Microsoft have royally bust up my system! I will probably find Windows stops working tomorrow!!<br />
<br />
Now that would really take the biscuit!!<br />

<h2>            SYNC app for Windows Phone</h2>
                    I just purchase a new 2015 Ford Escape which has SYNC powered by Microsoft for all the voice control commands. &nbsp;When I visit SyncMyRide.com surprisingly only Andriod and iPhone have a SYNC app. &nbsp;Are you kidding me Windows!! You can't even create an app
 for your own product? &nbsp;You want people to buy your phones but only your competitors get the support by all other products. &nbsp;Even the ones that you power! &nbsp;Your phones have been out for however long now and I keep hearing that these apps will appear any day
 now. &nbsp;Doesn't seem very promising. &nbsp;

            You're absolutely right. &nbsp;I realize my post was pretty specific on this issue with the Ford app not being available for Windows. &nbsp;It makes sense that they only supplied them the hardware. &nbsp;Really it comes down to NO one making apps for Windows. &nbsp;My aggravation
 should go towards the millions of companies that choose to have apps only available for Android and iPhone. &nbsp;But why is that?? &nbsp;Is it just that not enough people carry Windows phones? &nbsp;Is it just to expensive to write the application? &nbsp; Why can't Windows do
 anything to fix this issue?

            <p>Hi, PintuNOKIA.<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
We understand that call recording is not showing on settings of your Lumia 950 XL. Please follow the steps below to enable it on your Windows 10 mobile:<br />
</p>
<p><strong>How to Enable it on your Windows 10 Mobile:</strong><br />
1. Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Phone<br />
2. Scroll to the end, and look for option which says “Choose the app you want to use to manage recorded phone calls.”<br />
3. The default is set to none. Tap to select Voice Recorder.<br />
<br />
<strong>How to use it:</strong><br />
1. Make a voice call, a circular button (Record) will show up.<br />
2. Tap, and it will start the call recording.<br />
<br />
<strong>Where are the recording saved :</strong><br />
1. Launch File Explorer and look for a folder named as “Recorded Calls”<br />
2. Open, and all the recorded calls will be available against the contact name.<br />
<br />
<strong>How it the quality of recorded calls :</strong><br />
It is loud, and clear. The files are recorded at 170 kbps.&nbsp; While the background noise is not completely surpassed, the voices in calls dominate.<br />
<br />
<strong>Other Features:</strong><br />
You an also take a quick look at recorded call while you are on the dialer. Hit the menu bar &gt; select&nbsp; Recorded Calls. It lists all the recording chronologically with details on duration of call recording.<br />
<br />
1. To view the contact number, and other details,&nbsp; long press on the recording to get option “Open Contact”.<br />
2. Using the native audio editor (tap on any of the call recording to listen to launch), you can edit, trim, mark important points, and share it over Outlook, bluetooth and other places.<br />
<br />
