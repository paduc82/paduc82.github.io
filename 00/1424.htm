    <title>SharePoint credential loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnathanferguson  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint credential loop</h2>
                    <p>In a government corporate setting -&nbsp;I have a user that is getting prompt over and over for her credentials when attempting to access the SharePoint. It happens in any browser we choose (IE, Chrome, FireFox) and it also happens to any user that logs into
 the same&nbsp;PC under their own profile and attempts to access the SharePoint including myself with elevated privileges.&nbsp;All outcomes were the same (being prompt over and over for credentials).
<br />
<br />
Neither smartcard nor RSA credentials work however, if you use your network login information you can access the SharePoint but if you close out the browser you will&nbsp;get prompt again if you attempt to re-access. There is not an option to "remember me" and I
 have already searched the web and none of the available options work as we are unable to change the trusted sites or any of those type of settings in IE because they are applied by policy and besides that, as I mentioned before, it doesn't work on any browser
 anyway. Also since this is only happening to one user at this time we are not changing any settings on the server itself especially since the user can go to a different PC and access the SharePoint with her regular profile like normal with no issues.
<br />
<br />
The time on the PC is not off and I double checked the time in her BIOS as well. I verified that the user is receiving group policy settings and have applied them over a dozen times just to be safe. As I mentioned before the user can go to a different PC and
 access the SharePoint just fine with no issues so I do not think it is related to her profile or our SharePoint. No one else is within the company is experiencing any issues and short of reimaging her PC I am stumped. Can anyone shed any light on this issue?
 It must be related to the PC itself.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
John<br />

<p>hi</p>
<p>i am having issues getting onedrive for business to actually login to either the onedrive for business sync or sharepoint sites.
</p>
<p>although it is running, when i click the sync option to sync a library, it goes through various steps, eventually asking for login details.

<p>Hi </p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions. </p>
<p>I don't want to use the Next Gen client as we are also using SharePoint (I was having the same problem on SharePoint , too).
</p>
<p>I have just tried again with the OneDrive Sync and it worked first time by simply clicking the "Sync" button. It didn't even ask for credentials, so I was unable to verify if what you have suggested there would work as it just went straight in.
</p>
<p>The only thing that had changed is that I had logged into ODFB and Sites using an office desktop program. (Excel). It still didn't work after doing that, but I have just rebooted (courtesy of a power cut) and it worked first time. (I had tried rebooting
 previously, prior to signing in via Office). </p>
<p>I then tried my own Team Site documents folder - this DID ask for credentials but I hit enter as you suggested and that seemed to do the trick!</p>
<p>I can now see both a Onedrive For Business Directory and SharePoint Directory in explorer with the relevant files in there.
</p>
<p>I originally encountered the problem when trying to sync documents from a team site from another company with whom we work very closely. The site has external sharing enabled and I have full control permissions. I have tried to sync docs from that site as
 above but to no avail. It asks for credentials but will not get past entering them. I was under the impression that this was possible? Could you advise if I am correct?</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help. </p>
        </p>

<h2>            Outlook stopped working</h2>
                    
<p>Outlook stopped working. It partially loads, then "freezes". The mouse pointer moves around but clicking on any control button gets no response. I asked for help in this forum on 3rd Nov, and a re-install was suggested. Thanks for the replies, but&nbsp;reinstalling
 Office&nbsp;hasn't helped. My wife doesn't use Outlook so I went onto her account and performed what is essentially a clean set up. This works fine, so presumably the issue is not the software, but is to do with corrupted profiles or similar (I'm no expert). I
 have tried running the .pst scan/ repair tool. This found errors, but repairing them didn't help. If a "clean" install is what I need, how can I do this? Otherwise any new suggestions would be welcome. Please bear in mind that I can't access any menus in Outlook
 when in my user account (I can in my wife's), so any fix would have to be outside Outlook itself. Incidentally my antivirus is F Secure, but this is probably not relevant since it is operating when using my wife's account.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

Yes it would, but then it would be less likely to be caused by an add-in but by an external application. The link covers both scenarios ;-)

            I have done the clean boot routine and still Outlook doesn't work. One new event is that on my wife's Windows User account (where outlook still works) I received a message yesterday when attempting to open Outlook. "Outlook experienced a serious problem
 with the 'F-Secure spam control add-in'...Do you want to disable this add-in." I disabled and Outlook opened normally. I recall a similar message on my own Windows User account, probably a few weeks ago before the trouble started. Outlook didn't freeze immediately
 after this, but a few days later. I see there have been issues between Outlook and F-Secure going back years. However unloading F-Secure doesn't cure the problem (nor did unticking all F-Secure items in clean boot), so if F-Secure has had an effect it must
 be to have corrupted a file I guess. Is there any way to reinstall Outlook as a clean reinstall i.e. not looking for an existing .pst file, as if it has been installed for the very first time?

            Thanks. A new profile works fine. The obvious problem is that it doesn't hold my contact information. I thought I could replace this by synchronising with my PDA. However the PDA seems to keep looking for the old profile and times out (because the old
 profile doesn't work). Any idea how to get a PDA running Windows Mobile 6 to synchronise with a specified Outlook account?

            Thanks. As it happened, for no obvious reason, the next time I connected my PDA it synchronised contacts,&nbsp;tasks and notes perfectly. Unfortunately, if I click on Calendar Outlook just hangs. I then got a message about Outlook being unable to open folders,
 though restarting the computer seemed to stop this. However when Outlook was next started&nbsp;it tried to open the old profile and hung. I checked the Outlook settings and it was definitely set to open the new account. In the end I deleted the old account and
 it opens normally with the new account now. Unfortunately it still hangs when I try to open the calendar. Any suggestions?

<h2>            Microsoft Excel xls to xlsx conversion</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am in a situation where&nbsp;I need to convert Microsoft xls files to xlsx on a server (windows server 2008), where we do&nbsp;file modification through the openxml standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been looking through the use of Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack / FileFormatConverters.exe / ofc.exe.&nbsp; My understanding is that these tools ultimately do require Microsoft Excel to be installed on the machine that is doing the conversion.&nbsp; Firstly,
 is this correct?&nbsp; Secondly, if not, is there a tool that doesnt require excel to be installed that is not 3rd party (ie spreadsheetgear etc).</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Would an acceptable solution be to use a connected system with either Excel 2007 or 2010 on it that would have some VBA code to identify and open .xls files on the server and then automatically "save as" in .xlsx format?</p>
<p>To specifically answer your question, yes, the Compatibility Pack is an add-in for pre-2007 versions of Excel so that they can open and work with 2007/2010 files.</p>
<p>As for 3rd party solutions, I personally aren't aware of any, but I haven't looked for any and so just because I don't know of any doesn't mean they don't exist.&nbsp; You might do a web search for something like "convert excel 2003 to 2007" or similar phrases&nbsp;and
 see what turns up.</p>

            <p>I have a similar problem to Taylor's.</p>
<p>Using an excel macro or vba code is sub-par for my use.&nbsp; (I know how to write these).</p>
<p>The point of doing it on the server without office loaded is so there is not a dependency to mine or someone else's PC.</p>
<p>(Also so can pass security reviews easier.)&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Then other than doing it by hand on a system with Excel on it, I really can't think of another way to do this efficiently (and in a relatively short time) without resorting to VBA code.&nbsp; You can't just rename the file as .xls - the actual format of the file
 itself must be altered, and that means the use of some type of code:</p>
<p>Exception: - again doing it by hand through Excel on a machine would be one way, but...</p>
<p>VBA code within an Excel workbook designed for this task</p>
<p>Some code in some language that knows how to read a .xlsm file and then output the same information in .xls file format.</p>

            This usually means a missing reference. What exactly are you doing when you get that error? Did you check your references (Ctrl+g&gt;Tools&gt;References) for Missing items?

            If your 'phone is a Windows Phone, have you tried 'Find my 'phone' from windowsphone.com? This is the purpose of that facility. Otherwise, I'm afraid you'll need to use the support route for your specific 'phone - we only discuss Microsoft's Windows smartphones
 here.
<div>P.S. windowsphone.com also lets you reset the 'phone, which I would recommend, since if the thief can use the internet on your 'phone they can presumably also access information stored on it. Too late now, but next time do put a PIN on it. But use 'find
 my 'phone' before you use 'reset my 'phone' as you'll probably not be able to do 'find' afterwards.</div>
<div>Also, have your mobile operator put a stop on the SIM card and report the theft to the police. Make sure you are in the clear on these points, so that you are definitely not responsible for any 'phone charges the thief may incur. Again you may need to
 do 'find my phone' first of all though - the Windows Phone 'find' facility will use either text messages or an internet connection depending on how you've configured it, the default being text messages, and text messages need your SIM card still in the 'phone
 and active.</div>

<p>The source data doesn't show, the sub-titles like "Average of Monthly Return", the various calculations for each sector or the calculations in the Grand Total row.&nbsp; Below, is part of the source data.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why you are experiencing that issue. That said,&nbsp;one question just for clarification. If you log into outlook.com with you Live account on a PC (or using IE on your device), do all your contacts appear there?

            <p>The ~$ at the beginning of the filename indicates that this is the "owner" or "lock" file for a template that has probably been deleted (see

            I had the same error but am using Word13 on the platform. Windows Explorer would not find the ~$Wiz14s.dotm despite complete and repeated searches. Apparently, while I thought I had turned off all hidden files in my app folder, I hadn't, so it must have
 been hidden. Your suggestion about it being an add-in leftover led me to Word/options/add-ins where I found the original AVWiz14s and that led me to the lock file. The Avery add-in is still installed, and works, even after the lock file was deleted, but now
 Word opens without error and I've learned something. Thank-you.<br />

    <title>Managing users in a Hybrid O365 Environment - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meinradobolinao7238  say:</h3>
<h2>            Managing users in a Hybrid O365 Environment</h2>
                    <p>We've recently had setup for us a Hybrid O365 environment which consists of the following:</p>
<p>On premises 2 x Exchange 2010 servers where the majority of mailboxes still reside and 2 x Exchange 2013 servers where things pass through/communicate through to O365. We have DIRSync setup on premises to update our on prem AD to O365.</p>
<p>Now for user mailboxes that have been migrated to O365 when that user leaves the company part of our process is to disable their AD account. However we've since found that O365 "deletes" their mailbox and makes it inaccessible. I'm uncertain around the timeframe
 as to how quickly it does this so if someone can elaborate that would be great. But should this be the case?</p>
<p>As part of our termination process we would normally hold onto the user data including mailbox for sometime, in case someone needed access to it for example. But now in O365 it appears we have to change the way we do that. For example before disabling the
 account convert it to a shared mailbox so it is still easily accessible. If others can suggest or mention any other issues they've experienced with user management that would be appreciated.</p>
<p>So for the accounts that were disabled in AD and had their O365 mailbox made unavailable. How can I get the mailbox back? Do I just enable the AD account and it comes back after a period of time if so how long?</p>
<p>Or in the O365 Admin Portal under "Users" &gt; "Deleted Users" do I just select the required users restore them? In doing this process does it enable the disabled AD account? Once again how long before the mailbox appears once more?</p>
<p>TIA siapao</p>

<p>I hope I'm not hijacking this thread as I think my question might have some relevance. I just want to know in a Hybrid scenario (Exchange on prem &amp; O365), when disabling an AD account is this considered the same as deleting? As I'm finding this is how O365
 is treating the mailboxes.</p>
<p>I also thought converting the user mailbox to a shared one would help me, but this isn't the case as has been stated above although converted once the user account is deleted it removes the mailbox as well. Once again I thought disabling and deleting an
 account are two different things so not sure why it is being treated the same.</p>
<p>Is there something that can be done to achieve the required outcome of holding users data before purging after given amount of time? It sounds like the account needs to be kept active which defeats the purpose when you want to disable access to it from an
 employee who has left.</p>
<p>I also read even if you were to reset the password, if the ex-employee has access to the email on a mobile device they will still be able to send and receive email regardless in an O365 mailbox. Is this true? I've yet to test it myself but seen it mentioned
 more than once which is concerning.</p>
<p>Do I have to migrate the mailbox back on premise to achieve these outcomes which is really "backwards" considering we're trying to move to O365 and don't intend to have on prem servers anymore.</p>

<p>Hi Siapao,</p>
<p>Generally, disabling ad account will not delete remote mailbox because there is no Exchange related attribute which is removed. I would like to confirm how you disable user accounts. Could you reproduce the issue for other accounts? To narrow down it, could
 you try to enable the AD account, and run Dirsync to see if you get the mailbox back? It is not recommended to restore users via Office 365 Admin Portal –&gt;Users &gt; Deleted Users as this is a Dirsync user. If you do that, the user may not be synced.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, the issue could be related to the Exchange attribute when disabling AD account.</p>
<p>Regarding the password, it is not an expected behavior. You can create a new thread with the detailed information, and we will focus on it.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Johnny Zhang</p>

<p>Hi Johnny thanks for the reply. In answer to your question I simply disable the AD user account in AD Users &amp; Computers. Our Dirsync is run as a scheduled task every half hour, so after this sync occurs some time later the mailbox disappears from Exchange
 Online Admin Console and in the O365 Admin Portal the user is removed from Active Users and placed in Deleted Users.</p>
<p>This has been happening to every account that has been disabled when their mailbox is on O365. I'm pretty certain I've tried to enable an AD account in the past and the mailbox does not come back online.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this exercise I will enable an account now and manually run the Dirsync task to expedite the process and report back in an hour if not longer to see if the mailbox comes back.
</p>
<p>With respect to your comment "Based on my experience, the issue could be related to the Exchange attribute when disabling AD account." What do you mean by this exactly?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Siapao,</p>
<p>It is weird. I would like to confirm the following things.<br />
1. &nbsp;Is the impacted user’s type a remote user mailbox? You can provide the value of msExchRecipientTypeDetails in ADSIedit for impacted users.<br />
2. &nbsp;Do you have any policy for the operation (disable user accounts)? &nbsp;For example, do you set up Dirsync filter?<br />

3. &nbsp;Could you use the FIM client: ”C:\Program Files\Windows Azure Active Directory Sync\SYNCBUS\Synchronization Service\UIShell\miisclient.exe” to check if there is any update for the synced user?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

I STILL see message checkboxes being selected before I select them. THIS SHOULD NOT EVER HAPPEN.<br />

<br />
DO YOU REALIZE HOW STUPID THAT IS??? That is BEYOND STUPID. AMAZING STUPID. INCREDIBLE STUPID. BEYOND STUPID.<br />

I don't like Hotmail. It is also quite stupid. For example it allows graphic characters in the subject lines. But Outlook.com makes Hotmail look like polished GENIUS.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum.&nbsp; I like LCRT am a bit confused as there is no "alarm" feature associated with Find My Phone.&nbsp; If someone signs into your account on
<a href="http://windowsphone.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">windowsphone.com</a>&nbsp;they would be able to ring the phone but this is not something that should continue for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you would like to prevent any Find My Phone services from working, you can remove the phone from your account on windowsphone.com.&nbsp; While the phone is not showing on the site, it will not be able to be remotely tracked, rang, locked or erased.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Is Windows Defender the only anti-virus&#47;malware software I need to be fully protected&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a new HP computer containing Windows 10. &nbsp;It Windows Defender on it, but also McAfee &amp; "something" Bytes as virus/malware protection. &nbsp;Of course they want to charge me to continue to use. &nbsp;My question: &nbsp;IS WINDOWS DEFENDER ALL I NEED TO
 PROTECT MY COMPUTER?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

 a third party program. &nbsp;I use WD plus run occasional scans with Malwarebytes Free on my Win 10 - I've had no malware issues.</span></p>

            Thanks. &nbsp;That helps me to decide, &amp; I think I will use WD as my main protection &amp; do the occasional Malwarebytes Free scan, also - as you do. I appreciate your response.

            I upgraded to Windows 10 and already had Premium (paid version) of Malwarebytes on my pc. Windows Defender didn't turn on since I already had a malware program. But then recently the Windows Defender turned on and started running and states my&nbsp;pc is protected
 and everything is fine. Yet my Malwarebytes is up to date and stating everything is fine. So I wonder if Malwarebytes made updates to their software so it will now be compatible with Windows 10 using Windows Defender???

            <p>When I purchased my Lenovo it operated on Windows 8 and I installed McAfee, which failed to protect my computer from infection. When I contacted McAfee they said they could provide better protection, for a price. The McAfee app also sent countless distracting
 messages and needlessly slowed down my machine. It was a mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 at the first opportunity and have since relied solely on Defender, leaving McAfee behind. My machine has not been infected and I've had no problems. I hope other users have a similar experience. I can't offer a direct report about
 Norton, as I've never used it.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>The problem is getting worse because now while just been at Outlook it is enough to switch some &nbsp;folders that I get these problems again, specially switching the Contacts folder and the Inbox folder. Part of my screen gets a blank graphic that seems to be
 over my text so I cannot see anything. I have a good computer moreoever with good graphics. The rest of the programs work ok with this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm opening again my old question with a different title, due that I do not see (SO FAR) that problem when I use Outlook in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone help me out trying to see with I do not have this problem in Safe Mode but I do have it in Normal mode?</p>

            <p>a picture of my whole screen showing my problem. It is impossible to get rid of this blue stuff (sometimes it becomes white) It is in the Inbox Folder with the Right Reading Pane. My cursor lies at your email message.
</p>
<p>The same with other folders specially the Contacts folder.</p>
<p>Lately the problem gets worse. That when I open a second instance with "Open in New Window" it creates the problem again.</p>
<p>I don't have this problem with no other software. I don't have it so far with Outlook in Safe Mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Harsha I appreciate if your help is until we solve the problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look at the many previous questions I opened. At the beginning everybody says beautiful things that they will help out, suggestions...and then ... they disappear. Please hang in there! thanks</p>

            <p>This would be the standard procedure to set a document's language and make it extensive to the parent template:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open any of the problem documents (every document is based on a template).</li><li>Language is defined in the document's styles, so access <em>Format</em><em>&nbsp;&gt; Style…
</em>in the main menu at the very top of the screen and highlight a style (start with the Normal paragraph style).</li><li>Click on "Modify" and select "Language" in the dropdown menu at the bottom left of the newly opened Modify Style dialog.</li><li>Select your language and make sure there's no checkmark next to "Do not check spelling or grammar."</li><li>Click on the "Default" button to propagate the language change back to the original template (if this is not available, it will be grayed out).</li><li>Click OK twice to exit that style's language dialog and its Modify Style dialog, but do not close the main Styles… dialog.</li><li>Select "Styles in use" in the dropdown menu at the left of the Styles dialog and sequentially highlight all styles, making sure they have the proper language. Many will, since they will be based on the Normal style. You can check it in the style's summary
 description and/or access the style's definition through the "Modify" button. To enter a change, do steps 3-6.</li></ol>
<p>That should take care of the theoretical aspect. I say this because even if a style defines a language, you can override it by selecting text and manually applying a different language. To ensure against that, do
<em>Edit &gt; </em><em>Select All</em> (or <em>Command A</em>), then do step 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above does not work, try changing the template by opening it via Word's
<em>File &gt; Open</em> menu (otherwise you'd be opening a document based on that template). Do steps 2-5 to properly define the styles' language at least in the Normal paragraph style. For good measure, manually apply the language to the main text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMPORTANT: When manually applying a language, it's very important to select text before selecting the language. This is because "language" is a text attribute just like boldface or underline and works exactly like them. Thus, you need to

<p>I have tried everything changing the region, hard and soft reset turn on and off.</p>
<p>I am sure the the hardware is not damaged as suddenly both the cameras cant stop working.</p>
<p>I have also updated my phone to windows 10 and then again rolled back to 8. In windows 10 it would give me error codes. But in windows 8 its just that it starts and the previous screen reappears. I have also tried third party apps but no luck.</p>

<h2>            Excel 2007 - Create drop-down box using multiple criteria which is not unique</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp; I wondered whether anyone has tried to implement a drop down-box using multiple criteria?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to use a drop-down&nbsp;box (see sample data below) so that I can choose, say, BALL in the drop down, then choose either Red, Green or Blue

<p>I'm struggling because my first selection is not unique, so will only bring back the details of the first line it finds for BALL.</p>
<p>Any&nbsp;ideas anyone?</p>

            You could use two dropdown lists: one for the type and another for the color. In your example, they appear to be independent of each other, but if the available colors depend on the type, you could use linked dropdown lists - see

    <title>Duplex Printing using Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vincentroccanova  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplex Printing using Word</h2>
                    <p>Given: A printer capable of automatic duplex printing.</p>
<p>Given: Microsoft Windows 7 Pro ; Office 2010</p>
<p>Given: A single word document containing some pages to be printed one-sided and other pages needing to be printed on both sides.</p>
<p>Given: Users who are NOT computer literate; they can print, but don't expect them to get too fancy with physically printing pages then re-printing by refeeding the pages, or by initiating multiple print jobs for the same document by printing a few pages
 at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: Using only Microsoft Word, can you print some pages one sided and other pages two sided within the same document and within the same print job?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: A Word document that is&nbsp;12 pages long. The printout should result in only 9 pieces of paper being printed:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 1 = single sided on physical sheet 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page&nbsp;2 = single sided on physical sheet 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page&nbsp;3 and page 4 printed duplex on the same sheet of paper&nbsp;on physical sheet 3</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page&nbsp;5 = single sided&nbsp;on physical sheet 4</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page&nbsp;6 and page&nbsp;7 printed duplex on the same sheet of paper on physical sheet 5</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page&nbsp;8 and page&nbsp;9 printed duplex on the same sheet of paper on physical sheet 6</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page&nbsp;10 = single sided on physical sheet 7</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page&nbsp;11 and page&nbsp;12 printed duplex on the same sheet of paper on physical sheet 8</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 12 = single sided on physical sheet 9</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for any possible answers!</p>

NOT Likely</span>, but maybe ...<br />
<br />
Word is pretty simple minded, in general all or nothing. This flip flopping between single sided and duplex is beyond the basic support it provides. But, you can beat it into submission using some advanced features. The question remains, can you present the
 required technique (embedding field codes) to your users?<br />
<br />
Sorry. <br />
<br />
Assuming your printer can handle PCL, this tip tells how to embed a PCL printer code to turn on duplex.

</p>
<b><span>Summary:
</span></b><span>If you have a printer that will print on both sides of a piece of paper, you may want to use that ability within Word. Unfortunately it's not as straightforward as
 you might hope.</span><br />
<br />
This page goes along with the above tip:<br />
PCL Escape Codes to Use with the PRINT Field

<p>
<span>This article lists some of the escape codes that can be used in the PRINT field for printing documents to H</span><span>ewlett-Packard (HP) or HP-compatible printers. For example, the construction {PRINT 27"&amp;l2S"} at the top of a
 page causes a duplexing printer to begin printing on both sides of the page. </span>

<span>Printing in duplex has not always been easy in Word, particularly when you want that printing to be controlled by a macro. Throw multiple paper trays into the mix and things can get dicey. Here's an idea of how you can solve the printing
 problem, however. This tip (5681) applies to MS Word versions: 2007 <span>

            A UK-bought 2720 fold will not work in North America.<br />
<br />
The 2720 fold is a dual-band GSM phone. Those sold in the UK and pretty much everywhere else in the world except North America operate on the 900 and 1800 MHz bands. North American GSM networks operate on the 850 and 1900 MHz bands.<br />
<br />
The reason you can't place/receive calls has nothing to do with your SIM or contract. Your phone is not "tuned" to the local frequencies.

<p>I would suggest get the UK phone unlocked and purchase a sim card here in Canada it should work then.</p>

<p>@pah - your information is wrong. The problem has to do with the hardware on the phone itself. the antenna does not recognize the NAM bandwidths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A UK phone recognizes GSM 900/1800, while North American versions of the phone uses an antenna that reads GSM 850/1900.</p>
