<h2>            OneDrive for Business - SharePoint Library Sync</h2>
                    <p>I'll start off by explaining how we're attempting to use OneDrive for Business then list the issues we're encountering, hopefully someone can point me in the right direction, even if that direction is stop trying to use OneDrive for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. ~30 Users, all have the latest version installed with the Registry entry to allow SharePoint libraries to be sync'd (v 17.3.6798.0207)</p>
<p>2. Clients all have Surface Pro 3, mix of Windows 8.1/10, all have external HDD plugged in, we've pointed OneDrive sync location to these drives as the Surface's don't have enough available space.</p>
<p>3. We've moved a large chunk of our Network drives into SharePoint libraries, these are then entirely sync'd back to the clients</p>
<p>&nbsp; a) Share1 &nbsp;231GB &nbsp; 104,549 files, 6,668 folders</p>
<p>&nbsp; b) Share2 &nbsp;97GB &nbsp; &nbsp; 172,479 files, 13,822 folders</p>
<p>4. A copy is also sync'd onto a server here which then has the locations mapped as network drives for the staff that still can't use OneDrive for Business properly</p>
<p>5. We've got a 100MB fibre connection for internet and looking at the usage charts we're not hitting the limits</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issues we have are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Around half the users can't even download the entire libraries, it sometimes gets to say 70GB out of the 97GB for Share2 then just stays there for weeks</p>
<p>2. Some users find that their "Location" drops, so they have to log back into SharePoint and click Sync again, they point it to the existing location which then spends hours (possibly days) to reconcile the differences before we get the green tick again.</p>
<p>3. Some staff are noticing that their computers are noticeably slower, once we close OneDrive they magically start performing normally again</p>
<p>4. Some staff are getting errors instructing them to reboot their computer as OneDrive has crashed</p>
<p>5. Some staff just have OneDrive close and reopen throughout the day (they end up with lots of clouds in the notification area until the roll the mouse over them)</p>
<p>6. Some staff have noted that folders/files they delete sometimes reappear later on</p>
<p>7. We've have an alarming amount of occurrences of old files superseding the latest version, even though the computer identified as the one that has created the new version would never have even opened the file. &nbsp;It seems to just grab say version 3 and make
 that the latest which might be version 6</p>
<p>8. We're getting lots of additional versions of files, i.e. "file.docx", then "file - pc1.docx", then "file - pc2.docx", even though those computers wouldn't have ever opened the files either. &nbsp;On Share2 alone we have over
<strong>10,000 additional files</strong> thanks to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that the SharePoint sync feature is very new, but is anyone else having issues, has anyone else managed to fix these types of issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've contacted o365 support and they basically just fob me off hoping to close the call, i.e. responses like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)"><em>My apologise for the delay getting back I have been waiting for a response for our OneDrive team as this does seem an unusual case.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)"><br />
<em>I wishing to confirm with them first as the next stage will be to otherwise to unlink and reset up the sync and I want to confirm if there is anything else we can do before we have to proceed with that resolve.</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<em>I will be in the office for the next 6 hours. In the event I do not receive a response, in accordance with our service policy, this ticket will be released allowing you to raise another at your convenience. One of our available agents will then be in contact
 within 10 minutes</em>."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We've tried lots of things, for example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. We've heavily reduced the amount of folders/files in the libraries as we figured maybe we were pushing it</p>
<p>2. Unlinked/Linked accounts many times</p>
<p>3. Uninstall/Reinstall One Drive many times</p>
<p>4. Used the /reset feature many times (I actually think half the issues with the duplicate files is due to the reset)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users don't want to selectively sync folders/files, hence we're doing a full sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't found anything regarding soft limits, but are there any? Should we not be trying to sync that much data? &nbsp;Any suggestions would be most welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            <p>Although there is only 15 GB threshold for single file size and no upper limit for the total amout, some performance or syncing issue will come up if you sync large amout of data, as well as complicated file structure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I assume that you have all staffs syncing these files in their machines, considering some users may delete files while others users may restore them, and co-authoring result in saving conflict, so there is no doubt lots of additional versions of files
 show up.</p>

            <p>It would be nice if MS actually published something indicating at what point you might encounter performance issues, obviously companies aren't keen to point out anything that detracts from people wanting to use their software though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of the conflicts have been caused on just a few machines, and I know for a fact that one of those machines has never opened any of those files ever, however it has their computer name attached, hence I think the OneDrive client side software on their
 computer is somehow causing the duplicates itself. &nbsp;This seemed to occur after we ran the /reset command. &nbsp;The user doesn't open the files via OneDrive as they have it mapped as a network drive from the server, so any files they opened which caused duplication
 would be named "file - servername.docx" rather than "file - computername.docx". &nbsp;I watched one machine after we initiated a /reset and there were notifications appearing frequently indicating a conflict was encountered and the files couldn't be merged, this
 machine also would never have used their OneDrive files as they never downloaded fully, this in particular was probably stuck for a week or more before we did it, so there would have no doubt been many files changed since it last sync'd. &nbsp;I understand that
 conflicts will occur, and we're happy for that to happen when there is a real reason for it to occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your comments.</p>

            <p>Hi Warcrow,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you specify "The user doesn't open the files via OneDrive as they have it mapped as a network drive from the server"? Do you mean they don't use OneDrive in their machines but still have duplicate files generated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, <span><span>I would suggest you follow the steps given in the link below in these problematic machines to check if some issue can be identified.</span></span></p>

            <p>Yes, that is exactly what I mean. &nbsp;The user(s) have OneDrive for Business installed and setup to sync the SharePoint library (all of it), while it was getting the full sync (which can take days) they continue to use the mapped drive. &nbsp;So they have it setup
 but aren't yet using it, while in this state duplicates are created allegedly by their computers based on the file name created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the link, we have tried all those options before without much luck. &nbsp;We've had to use the last step many times "<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe
 /reset"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's disappointing that something that sounds great should turn out to be so <strong>
useless </strong>and <strong>unreliable</strong>. &nbsp;Support have basically come back saying they can't help.<br />
</p>
<p>At this stage we're leaning towards altering our approach on how we leverage this technology, we'll probably dramatically archive off data in an attempt to make it "work", and perhaps look to use Dropbox for some of the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd caution anyone looking to use OneDrive for Business as a network drive replacement to think twice about attempting it, during our initial testing we didn't really encounter many issues, however once we started piling on the data it became apparent it
 was unable to handle it, perhaps partly due to the amount of changes being made continually to documents, and that we wanted a full sync.</p>

            <p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, make sure your Office 365 services (OneDrive and SharePoint) are listed under<strong> Connected Services</strong> in
<strong>Office Account</strong> page. If not, you can click Add a service&gt; Storage&gt; Office 365 SharePoint to add.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0932d5e9-2737-411e-ace2-1628c3b4a53c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0932d5e9-2737-411e-ace2-1628c3b4a53c" height="332" width="536" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then try the following steps to see the outcome:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In Outlook, click File &gt; Account Settings, in <strong>Account Settings</strong> page, click
<strong>Data Files </strong>tab, select SharePoint Lists and click Remove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. In <strong>SharePoint Lists</strong> tab, remove the problematic calendar lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Close Outlook, go to <strong>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook</strong>, delete all SharePoint lists files. (Also the ones with a number in name)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fdc653aa-e617-4443-a57c-24841847ec79" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fdc653aa-e617-4443-a57c-24841847ec79" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Launch Outlook and add the calendar lists to Outlook again.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes when we use outlook to reassign a SharePoint task received by email, it returns an error 'The task could not be updated at this time.'. This happens fairly often across any user or computer. What can be done about this?</p>

            <p>Hi Deepa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The reassign option is in the task assignment email within Outlook.</p>
<p>2. Domain however the computers are accessing SharePoint Online</p>
<p>3. Exchange</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The steps you described are for tasks that are generated by Outlook. In this case, it's an email from SharePoint.</p>

<h3> bluecrab88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Num Loc key does not come on</h2>
                    <p>After applying the April 2018 update for Windows 10 Pro on one of my laptops the Num Loc key does not turn on. I tried the registry fixes and none of them worked. There was an entry in the form in 2014 that stated the functionality on the Num Loc key can
 be turned on and off, but the indicator does not turn on. That is my problem after applying the April 2018 fix. Is this a new problem or the old one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A second laptop had the same update applied but there are no problems with that pc.</p>

<p>Hi KaiDeian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please run PowerShell commands to check if the subfolder has been deleted in server:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell</a></li><li><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd351164(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get-MailboxFolder</a> (Please refer to Example 5 to get all levels of folders under Inbox in the userâ€™s mailbox)</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the subfolder, may I know if it is a custom folder created by user himself or all of users in your organization have the folder? In addition, except the subfolder you mentioned, is there any other folder that
 cannot be deleted?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, please try to sign out your account in Outlook client (PC and mobile device) and then delete the folder in OWA to check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

    <title>How to enter numbers into a row of cells without pressing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kali_917  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to enter numbers into a row of cells without pressing enter&#47;tab etc</h2>
                    <p>I don't know the name for what I am looking for - hopefully I can explain it well enough.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I am making a form for our employees to fill out in which they will have to put in an accounting code.&nbsp; Most of our employees do not use accounting codes on a regular basis, so I want to remind them that the sequence is always _ _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ _ _&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;To
 format this in Excel,&nbsp;I thought I would shorten the column widths and draw a border around each cell (so I have 11 little boxes).&nbsp;&nbsp;But this makes it cumbersome to type the numbers in, as you have to click on each cell.&nbsp; If you highlight the group, the Enter
 key will move from left to right, but it would still be prefered to just type in the string of numbers without having to hit enter after each one.&nbsp; I have seen this in other programs where it will automatically put one number in each cell, but I'm not sure
 if Excel has the capability.&nbsp; If it does, please let me know how to do it.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            <p>Excel can't detect things being typed into cells, so it has no way of really knowing when you've typed anything into one until you press the [Enter] or [Tab] key, use one of the arrow keys or click on another cell with the mouse.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time such a request has been made - you might look at this one discussion and see if any of the offered "work-arounds" might do the job for you.&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.mrexcel.com/forum/showthread.php?76114-Can-Excel-be-made-to-auto-advance-to-the-next-cell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.mrexcel.com/forum/showthread.php?76114-Can-Excel-be-made-to-auto-advance-to-the-next-cell</a></p>
<p>You might also be set up a custom number format for the cell which would let them enter the 11 digits without entering the dashes but have it appear with them after they move to the next cell.</p>
<p>Select the cell, choose [Format] then the "Format Cells" option and when you get to the dialog, choose Custom and enter this format</p>
<p>00-000000-000</p>
<p>and [OK] out of the dialog.</p>
<p>If you then type in 12345678987 (and move out of the cell), it will appear as</p>
<p>12-345678-987</p>
<p>(but internally it still remains as 12345678987).</p>
<p>Does that help any?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, can you update the Exchange server 2010 to the latest version (<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh135098(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Build number 14.03.0389.001</a>)
 to check it? Since we don't recommend the use the old Exchange server 2010 for the hybird migration. Please see:</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jaro,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your concern here at the Microsoft Community forum. Let me assist you with your concern.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>Did you try changing the screen resolution and check?</li><li>Have you installed all the latest drivers?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>There might be optional update for the drivers due to witch you might be facing the issue. Follow these methods and check if it helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1</strong>: I would suggest you to update all the latest device drivers through Device Manager. Also make sure all the Windows Updates are installed.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>To update driver follow these steps.</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Right-click</strong> on the <strong>start button</strong> and click on
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Expand</strong> all the devices on by one.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Right-click</strong> on the <strong>device driver</strong> and click on
<strong>Update</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Also visit the computer manufacture support site and install the latest drivers.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue persist, proceed to next method. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> Check if you face similar issue in Safe mode.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If issue doesnâ€™t occur in Safe Mode uninstall graphic card drivers from device manager, restart the computer and check.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Driver updates for devices such as video cards can occasionally cause errors because the files being installed are damaged or aren't the right files for your Windows operating system. Windows Update should provide you with the most up-to-date drivers
 for your Windows operating system. However, if you have a problem installing device drivers from Windows Update, contact the manufacturer of the device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.
</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>It's reassuring to hear that you're familiar with REGEDIT.</p>
<p>I would backup the registry or create a restore point then find and edit out these strings [HPNTDF] and [BRI/1] from the 4 registry keys listed in the "Problem: Nested UA String" section of this page<br />

<p>My web search found no useful information on those items.</p>
<p>If those items reappear in the UA string, after deletion, there are other troubleshooting steps which can be taken.</p>

<h2>            Relationships Not Appear in Web Queries &#40;Access 2010&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have created a new web database.&nbsp; In my web tables I defined several one-to-may relationships and used the lookup field&nbsp;to connect the relationship; however, these relationships do not show up in web queries.&nbsp; For example, I have a 'resources' web table
 and a 'publishers' web table.&nbsp; One publisher can publish many resources, but each resource belongs to one publisher.&nbsp; I went through the lookup &amp; relationship wizard on the resources (child) table to connect it to the publisher (parent) table.&nbsp; This worked
 perfectly for filling in the forms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I want to create some web queries (for the purpose of creating reports), but when I add the resources table and the publishers table, there is no relationship between them and I receive a the following message when I try to run the query 'Web queries
 must have relationships between all tables.&nbsp; Add relationships or remove the tables that you do not need'.&nbsp; There is no line between the tables in the query to represent a relationship existing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why did the lookup &amp; relationship wizard not create the relationship (weird that it works for entering the data in the table/form)?&nbsp; Since the relationships button is disabled on the database tools tab, there does not seem to be any other way to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your time,</p>
<p>Nicole</p>

            <p>In my case when I drop in the tables, the "join" line is drawn for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gee, that is somewhat strange. I suppose you could manually draw the join line and the query should work. (so draw the join line by clicking on the primary key of the parent table, and then then drag over to the child table and onto the foreign key used
 in the child table).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It not clear if you have enforced referential integrity when you setup the relationship, but at the end of the day even without RI the join lines should draw in for you automatic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not really sure what the issue here is, but I would try drawing in the join line manually when building that query.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While manually drawing in the join line will likely fix this, it still sounds like some issue is wrong here. I would perhaps bring up the child table in layout mode, click on the column used to relate back to the parent table, and then in the ribbon "fields"
 tab you can click on "modify lookups". I would perhaps enforce referential integrity (last screen of the wizard) and see if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So foir now, try a manual drawing and conneciton of the two tables in the&nbsp;query builder.&nbsp; At noted, this should work, but it suggests we might be "band aid" over some other issue we don't know about as of yet.</p>

<h2>            Word&#58; How to adjust so its like a Selectric typewriter</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm having continual difficulty with the multiple complexities of Word and would greatly like to somehow adjust it to do the most simple of tasks,</p>
<p>rather like how in years past a Selectric typewriter worked.&nbsp; With the Selectric you set your margins, picked your font ball and off you went.&nbsp; No mess, no fuss.&nbsp; I just can't stand using "Word 2016."&nbsp; Help, please!</p>

<p>Hi Sue, <br />
<br />
A long time ago, I first read a book titled "<span><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0938151312/balancecheckbookA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Microsoft Word Books Manuals Help">The Mac is Not a Typewriter</a></em></span>."

You <em>could </em>use WordPad which is included with Windows. <br />

Bottom line is that Word is not a typewriter. It is much more powerful, but with that power comes complexity. It is not possible nor desirable to make it work like one. That said, you can control the formatting through styles. There is a Single-spaced template
 that you can download. It is not that hard to use for most tasks.<br />

<p>I purchased a Correcting Selectric II in 1975. I used it to start my typing business (actually it forced me to start my business, when I got the bill for my first batch of carbon ribbons and lift-off tape). I had a dozen different type balls. I loved that
 machine. I replaced it with an IBM Wheelwriter (with, eventually, eight print wheels) in the early 1990s. It was a giant leap forward: it could do proportional printing (justified) and word-wrapped automatically, and pages could be stored to memory. So if
 I had to go back, I'd probably go back only that far, even though I never loved that machine the way I did the Selectric (which had gotten balky and unreliable).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 1992, however, I got my first PC, with Word for Windows 2.0, and an HP LaserJet 4. I would never go back! When I think of the time I wasted retyping pages, not only for revisions but also because I'd miscalculated and the footnotes wouldn't fit on the
 page, I know I wasn't charging enough! Users rarely appreciate how much work Word can save them if they just take advantage of its features, such as first-line indents, spacing between paragraphs, and yes, automatic footnotes. It's worth taking a little time
 to learn how to use Word (after 26 years, I'm still learning), and Shauna's pages are a good place to start.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 640 contiuously reboots when I get home.</h2>
                    My lumia 640 has started to continuously reboot making the device unusable.&nbsp; I have found it only happens when I am at home but since last Friday I have soft reset it, hard reset it downloaded the Microsoft Windows Device recovery tool and reset it that
 way.&nbsp; If I take it away from the house it settles down and works fine, within minutes of arriving home it starts the reboot.&nbsp; At this point I can't turn it off and the battery drains faster Usain Bolt running in the Olympics.&nbsp; This all started on Thursday
 night Friday morning.&nbsp; I don't know if the problem is with my wifi but I have seen that there are other people saying they have problems with their home wi-fi and they have Netgear routers and tha is what I am using.&nbsp; This is beginning to be seriously frustrating.&nbsp;

<p>Seen more reports about having rebooting issues with 2.4gHz WIFI networks and an active Bluetooth on the phone.</p>
<p>Don't know it it will solve your problem but you can take a closer look, and try if disabling Bluetooth if it's enabled</p>

            Hi again,&nbsp; Right that didn't work, I didn't disable the wifi and the phone was again rebooting all night, I took it away from the house and again turned wifi off for an hour (it is one of the autuomatic functions when you disable it)&nbsp; It was fine for the
 hour but then went back to rebooting.&nbsp; At least I now know that if I need the phone I only have to pop out of the house and turn the wifi off but is still very frustrating.&nbsp; I will turn the wifi on the phone off before I get home tonight and check it again
 after the hour.

            <p>I have a similar problem but my Lumia 640 DS reboots most mornings and every evening when I am connected to my home WiFi. It seems to have become worse since installing AU and am now on version 14393.67.&nbsp; I don't recall a reboot during the day when connected
 on 4G. I get the impression that this really happens only evening and early morning and reboots at other times of day when connected to WiFi are very rare.</p>
<p>I don't plan on using the device recovery tool at the moment as I am travelling for the next two weeks or so and can't take any risks just before leaving!</p>

            <p>Hi, mine is as I get home and then continuously unless I go for walk to get away from the wifi and switch it off.&nbsp; That said I had an automatic phone update at the beginning of the week which I picked up on my works&nbsp;wifi and everything has run smoothly since.&nbsp;
 Using the Window Device Recovery Tool did not fix the problem and I was about to find my local Lumia Care Point Location and visit them.&nbsp; Should the problem come back I will be heading directly to them.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The Windows Device Recovery Tool was not a success and I was about to find my local Lumia Care Point Location but I managed to take a phone update while I was at work earlier this week and I have not had a recurrence of the problem since.&nbsp; If it does come
 back I will almost certainly go to a Care Point Location.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help and advice much appreciated.</p>
<p>Simon</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick update on this after 11 days free of any problem got home tonight and as soon as the wifi symbol appeared on the phone it froze and has since started to reboot.&nbsp; A little frustrated to be honest but looking up the Lumia Care Point Locations now.</p>

<h2>            Computer unusable during updating, I have to manually download and install  the whole mpam-fe.exe  64 MB update file every time. </h2>
                    
<p>MSE was working fine till&nbsp; a few days, now it just freezes during a update and my computer&nbsp; becomes very slow with MSE running, the restore down button keep getting jammed every few seconds.I uninstalled and reinstalled it twice but the problem persist.I
 don't have any anti virus running right now and my computer had become super fast once again.Yesterday I received a Windows update file MSE Client Update Package KB 2254596, since MSE is not on my computer I chose not to install this Package.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was this missing KB 2254596 file the reason why I was having all these problems. If I reinstall MSE from here http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/ will this Client update package KB 2254596 be included in it ?</p>
<p>Can I manually download KB 22545596 ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Is the PDF you got the image is protected? Does it happen to only one file or others? Have you tried to get from another PDF to test if that only happens on the said PDF wherein you got the image? Because that might be the reason why you are seeing a plain

<h2>            Auto Recover Does Not Work&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have the same on going issue with just 1 of my excel files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 4 excel files open all day, every day, and annoyingly, Windows likes to force updates on you. I have auto-recover set to every 10 minutes (can't find any of these files) yet when there is a forced update, the ONLY file to not auto-recover is the most
 important one!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last auto-recover/auto-save on this particular file is 15/11/17 at 18:29. The other 3 files were all saved at 20:10 on 17/11/17 - so why was the most important one not saved at the same time? Where are the auto-recover files at 10 minute intervals? This
 is the 3rd time I have lost information on this file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not suggest I manually save my files (that is what auto-recover is for), do not suggest third-party apps or tools (I am not clogging my computer up with software), and do not suggest that I have the same file saved in a couple of locations (this does
 not solve the issue - if it won't auto-recover in one location, why would it in 2?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>We pay through the nose for MS Office, it's 2017 and you can't get a simple thing right like auto-save? There are so many free Office-like tools out there such as Libre which has exactly the same functionality, opens in Office with no problems, and guess
 what, auto-save works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I supposed to do to prevent this happening again? For all your updates, when are you going to provide a tool which actually works?</p>

auto recover</a> applies to the following situation: If an Office app closes unexpectedly and you did not a get a chance to save your most recent changes, Document Recovery automatically opens and helps you get your file back the next time you open the Office
 app. What you want may be &nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-AutoSave-6d6bd723-ebfd-4e40-b5f6-ae6e8088f7a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AutoSave</a>, it's our new feature which is available in Excel and PowerPoint 2016 for Office 365 subscribers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the update, could you clarify it is Office update or Windows update? If you refer to Office update, you may choose File&gt;Account&gt;Office Updates, or it may be managed by the global administrator in your organization. If you mean Windows Update, you
 may make some setting in Windows Update&gt;Update settings&gt;Advanced options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you mean you open the file when Excel closes unexpectedly, and you can't find the auto recovery file, could you&nbsp; provide the scrrenshot of your Office version for us to investigate?(Open Excel&gt;File&gt;Account&gt;Product Information)</p>

<p>Hi Zixuan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Auto-recover should have saved this file too as it saved the other 3 files which were open at the same time, and it is the 3rd time this has now happened. It is always this file and none of my others. The disable auto-recover for this book option is not
 selected either - to be honest, it is stupid to give an option to not auto-recover, under what circumstances would you not want to recover your work should the computer crash?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding auto-save, it is such a basic option, why should it only be available to Office 365 customers? What guarantees are there that it will work? I have auto-recover set to every 10 minutes, looking at the last 5 auto-recovers, they were 'saved' at 11:01,
 11:13, 11:36, 12:10 and 12:21. I wouldn't call that every 10 minutes, and what has happened to my auto-recoveries for the last 2 hours considering I have added information? Why do Microsoft products not work as they should do? Why do they crash at least once
 a week? Why does it auto-recover EVERY file except the most important one!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to have to move my file into my OneDrive to auto-save. I am sure there is no valid reason for this, but it does still go back to the fact that if auto-recover doesn't work, what guarantee is there auto-save would work?</p>

<p>Hi Claudio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Weâ€™d like to focus on troubleshooting auto recovery to avoid the issue happens again. Could you share the following information with us?</p>
<p>1. Your OS version and the screenshot of your Office version. (Open Excel&gt;File&gt;Account&gt;Product Information).</p>
<p>2. Copy the content to a new file. You may open Task Manager&gt;choose Microsoft Excel&gt;End task to check whether the issue occurs again.</p>
<p>3. Did auto recover work properly previously? If so, did you make any changes like installing or updating some software or add-ins?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Windows Update, you may make some settings in Windows Update&gt;Update settings&gt;Advanced options. And considering you have concern about autosave, please post your feedback in

<p>Hi Zixuan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was a Windows update, not an Office update. Autorecover has worked on this particular file as recently as the 15th of November this year due to a Windows update, I then had another update on the 17th annoyingly. It still doesn't explain why auto-recover
 would work for the other 3 files and constantly fail on the most important one. All the file types are the same, they are all saved in the same location, yet it fails on this one only!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, can you explain why, in 2017, Microsoft haven't included an auto-save feature? Also, why is it only available to Office 365 users, and why only on Excel and Powerpoint? Do people not use MS Word anymore? Are Word documents not deemed as important as
 presentations or spreadsheets? Why does the end user need to subscribe to have an auto-save option, and why is it only available if you save the document in the OneDrive? Is it so Microsoft has everything saved in their cloud, on their servers and they can
 access it whenever they like? Why can't it just be saved locally? My PlayStation One could autosave. Other free word processing and spreadsheet programmes auto save locally, why are Microsoft so different? What added value am I getting by saving it in the
 cloud? No, I do not want to access them at home, who wants to work whilst at home?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact we pay through the nose for MS products makes this even harder to believe. You can only auto-save if you save things in the cloud - the biggest tech company in the world hasn't cracked auto-save locally yet - and your auto-recover option is about
 as reliable as Belkin routers. As a side note, I genuinely Googled 'as reliable as' analogies, and you have to see this link -https://www.warriorforum.com/off-topic-forum/245559-theyre-about-reliable-____________.html and scroll down about 2/3's of the page
 to the last comment... 'as reliable as any Microsoft product'. Further digging around on other sites and it seems a lot of people like to have a dig at the reliability of Microsoft products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this not lead you to consider building something that works rather than trying to get people to hand all their files to Microsoft before what they bought works as it should?</p>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I refrained from responding because I didn't really see the point. As before, I have 4 files open, 3 auto-recovered, 1 didn't and it is ALWAYS the same document that doesn't. The update was a Windows update and has nothing to do with it apart from the fact
 that is what caused my system to shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, against my will, I saved the document in the OneDrive and autosave was working fine.... until today. Microsoft have managed to surpass themselves this time round. The autosave feature is no longer available! No longer available meaning it is no
 longer in the top right hand corner. Not greyed out. It is simply not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I took your advice, and unsurprisingly, the option isn't working. 4 days into using it, it is not available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you explain this one seeing it was your recommendation? Or are we going to beat around the bush with lots of suggestions which have nothing to do with it? You don't need product details or anything, I have a screenshot below for you which clearly shows
 autosave is not there anymore!&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Please please please please I beg you, make a product that works! Autosave is present on another file I tested, so why is it THIS file again. Funnily enough, the same file which never autorecovers!</p>

<p>An update for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After checking 3 other files, the autosave option has disappeared on all of them! Only one of the 4 excel files I use daily has the autosave feature present.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it safe to say that the product is broken? IT would seem so wouldn't it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to transfer everything to Google Sheets which works perfectly? I mean, it has all the functionality I want, it saves to the cloud, it saves everything I do immediately, even if the computer crashed half-way through a word it would have saved that
 half word.... I don't suppose excel can do this can it? No I didn't think so.</p>

<p>Hi Zixuan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a novice, I know where options are, but just to prove it to you, here, have a few screenshots:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/090d5b8e-c694-4a6f-b46f-e4f47cb9aee2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/090d5b8e-c694-4a6f-b46f-e4f47cb9aee2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, there is no such option. So I thought I'll go to more commands and look what happens:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88e81c5c-4f3c-480a-b836-b61def92d7b0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88e81c5c-4f3c-480a-b836-b61def92d7b0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4702e2d4-f3d4-4289-a976-816b12784e05" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4702e2d4-f3d4-4289-a976-816b12784e05" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, there is no such option! </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have taken your advice, moved it into the OneDrive, Autosave worked fine, then stopped. When are you going to admit there is a fault with the program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what's next? Apart from actually fixing the bug, what magical nonsolution (it is a real word, you can check here -&nbsp;https://www.thefreedictionary.com/nonsolution ) do you have now?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office HUP 2013 Won&#39;t Install - &#34;We found a problem&#33;&#34;</h2>
                    Happy New Year!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am trying to install Microsoft Office HUP 2013 on my boyfriend's Windows 7 laptop and I get this error message:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"We found a problem! We found a pre-release or Beta version of an Office product on your computer and can't install because of it. Please Uninstall any pre-release Office software using the Programs and Features item in your Control Panel and try installing
 again."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I ran the Fix-It program and that didn't work. I also turned off his Windows Firewall and avast anti-virus and ran the Fix-It again; didn't work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Before this, he had Microsoft Office 2003 (I know, big upgrade) and never had any beta or trial version for anything after that to my knowledge. I can't find anything and uninstalled nearly everything made by Microsoft Corp. in the control panel. I had
 already uninstalled Microsoft Office 2003 before trying to install 2013, if I remember correctly.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was originally launching the exe from a disc, but a few minutes ago I tried downloading the exe straight from his computer. That didn't work either.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any idea what the problem is? He doesn't even have that much on his laptop as a few years ago he had to get a brand new hard drive and lost his old files.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you,</div>
<div><br />

            Anyone else have an idea? Still can't get it to install. :( Is there a way Microsoft could remote connect to my computer and help me?

                    <p>I installed OneNote 2016 and I can only see the Office 365 sign in window. How do I get to the Personal Microsoft account sign in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>When I first installed OneNote 2016 (on Windows 7 Professional 64bit)&nbsp; I was getting the same Office 365 Work or school account sign in as per first post. I don't have an Office 365 account and want to login with my Microsoft account. So I downloaded and
 installed OneNote 2016 again and it let me sign in with a Microsoft personal account.</p>
<p>I don't know what changed.</p>
<p>Then when a different user logged in to the same PC, the Office 365 sign in came up again. I can't find how to get the microsoft sign in to come up again.</p>
<p>I know it exists and on this PC too. Don't know why a separate user login on the same PC would be any different. Used the same install file on another PC and the Office 365 sign in comes up on that PC too. Very frustrating.</p>
