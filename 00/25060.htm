<p>You don't need to drain the battery on modern phones. Modern batteries don't care whether they're drained, it makes no difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you do need to do is make sure the battery is totally full when you've stopped charging. It should take anything from 1.5 to 3 hours to fully charge a phone's battery, make sure you leave it charging that long before disconnecting it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your 5130 is new and it definitely drains far too quickly, take it back and demand a replacement or a refund. Either the shop or Nokia will be obligated to fix your problem because it's a new device.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it is a common problem.. I also baught a nokia 5130 XM and it's battery stands for
<strong>JUST 1 DAY !!!</strong></p>
<p>Then you have to recharge again... It is not the time span mentioned in its advertisements.</p>
<p>I think Nokia is either cheating us, or there is a serious mistake that they are not aware...</p>
<p>I think, we (5130 users) should gather and make a sound to make it fixed.</p>
<p><strong>We CANNOT charge a phone EVERYDAY!!!</strong> :smileymad:</p>

<p>hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just blatantly saying that&nbsp;its a common problem doesn't make it common though, it all depends on the user's usage per day and how well&nbsp;the person is &nbsp;using the mobile to keep up Battery power</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>how many hours of music u play on the device ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>how many calls u make a day ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>how frequently u user GPRS on the device ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>faulty batteries tend to malfunction that needs to be replaced and checked</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>check out</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cheers.....</p>

<p>hi krizanand,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm curious about whether you have a Nokia 5130 Xpress Music Phone? But I guess you're not...</p>
<p>I don't want to make it personal but we are wronged here and that's why it may seem offensive to you.</p>
<p>But I'm not making that problem up. You can search for it. If you know Turkish, there is a site that people talk about 5130 and also that problem:
"&gt;
http://forum.donanimhaber.com/m_27593466/mpage_10/key_/tm.htm&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><u>First (before I have bought that phone) I thought just like you. I thought that very low time spans must be a result of heavy use of the phone.. But when I bought the phone I have realized it, it is not.</u></em></p>
<p>I give you today's statistics and you can judge from that numbers; <strong>TODAY;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Music Play:</strong> for most half an hour (appr. 20 min.)</p>
<p><strong>Calls:</strong> 13 minutes in total</p>
<p><strong>GPRS:</strong> NEVER</p>
<p>It's not a faulty battery, most of the users have that problem as far as I read...</p>
<p>And I bought it brand new in a closed box, not a second hand...</p>
<p><strong>And now battery meter shows appr. 1/3 </strong></p>
<p><strong>At these moments, the phone has been on for 22 hours appr.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It means that the battery will die out in the middle of the day, tomorrow.</strong></p>
<p>Am I right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it is a huge flaw for a NOKIA phone...&nbsp;:smileyindifferent:</p>
<p>And I will continue to defend that claim...</p>

            On my 5130 xpress music battery stands for 3-4 days. Speak about 30-40 min/day but, for moment i never need to play music on it. My observation: if you forget bluetooth on, battery will be empty very very fast (~ 1 day). My specific type of the phone:
 5130c made in Romania.

<p>dear getodacul, I think your phone can stand up for such a time, I think, because you don't listen to music. I bought this phone a week before and I've charged it for 4 times already and my "Total call time: 01:14:46". You say you speak with one charge for
 appr. 2 hours. But I was able to achive half of it in 4 charges!!</p>
<p>As you can guess I started to use this phone fully to check whether it will effect the charge span. (When I sent my first messege to this topic I was using this phone for only lightly texting and calling for very short times to measure its battery life...)
 And when I started to listen to music and sending a few files on bluetooth (BT is normally off and I start it only when I am using it..)
<u>it's battery started to decrease to a stand time: UNDER 48 HOURS.</u></p>
<p>And then I was in need of using the camera one day.. And I took like 20 or 25 photos in an hour. I could'nt believe that my battery emptied itself in appr. 36 hours.. I mean I charged it a day before and battery couldn't stand any longer after I took these
 photos. Camera seems to be sucking all the power out of the phone..</p>
<p>And my phone type is: <strong>Nokia 5130c-2 </strong></p>
<p>Software info.: <strong>V 06.65 - 01-04-09 - RM-495</strong></p>
<p>I know that there is another hardware version of this phone and it is <strong>
RM-496</strong>. I guess that people whose phones stand longer than this extremely low time spans might have a version
<strong>RM-496</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>That's why I ask whether anyone here has a <u>RM-496</u> and how is its charge standing??
</strong></p>

            i went two different nokia shop in istanbul and they say only one thing..it's all about the message traffic you have..because the phone use more charge when writing and receiving message and the screenlight is on when you read and write a message..they
 say 2 day is normal for your using. i couldn't believe first when i heard that but the other shop assistant told the same thing now i'm a little bit more satisfied..but if o knew that phone's battery performance..i would choose another brand or model..

<p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>You can probably use something like the following:</p>
'''save as a different file name<br />
ActiveDocument.SaveAs FileName:="C:\Temp\Test.doc"<br />
'''I recommend that you use a fully qualified path<br />
ActiveDocument.AttachedTemplate = "C:\OtherTemplate.dot"<br />
<p>The gets the your document attached to another template, and if you're using styles correctly everything should be smooth sailing. However, most likely you will have some re-work to do for some of your content.</p>
<p>HTH,</p>
<p>Dave</p>

<p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>If you insert a Section break at the end of the source document before copying, and copy everything including the Section break, you should get the headers &amp; footers too, along with the page formatting.</p>

<p>The problem is that you cannot select all of the document at the same time in order to copy it. A document consists of a a variety of story ranges. Imagine a pile of transparencies each containing an element of the document, which only reveal the whole document
 when they are stacked together.</p>

<h2>            Change format of &#39;file as&#39; for all existing contacts</h2>
                    I can change 'file as' format through Options to first name last name, but can I change all existing contacts from last name, first name to first name last name in one command or do I have to change each contact?

<p>Hey TrisR76,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest you just use the animation feature to make it look random, and then when someone gets the answer right, you click next and it moves there. This would make the most sense. If you're using Office 365, you can even use the
<a href="https://24slides.com/presentbetter/powerpoint-morph-and-zoom-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Morph and Zoom function&nbsp;</a>to create some pretty cool effects, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're looking to use something a bit more creative, you could combine the animation effect with some visual templates, such as this
<a href="https://24slides.com/templates/dashboard/view/organization-planning/timeline-roadmaps-template-package" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
timeline template&nbsp;</a>or <a href="https://24slides.com/presentbetter/how-to-make-timeline-in-powerpoint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
make your own one</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to identify more about this issue. I have put all the details in this MS answers forum
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_powerpoint-mso_win10/jagged-pen-writing-or-smoothing-issue/af030a69-86a6-487a-a510-4547ef8d3b81">
post</a>. This appears to be an issue in the slide view of PowerPoint version 16+ since it is not an issue when annotating a slideshow. Sorry about the late reply I have been busy with school and did not notice this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some quick answers.</p>
<ul>
<li>First encounter? After upgrading from Office 356 version 15 -&gt; version 16.</li><li>Changes? Upgrading Office 365.</li><li>Specifically in PowerPoint? Yes. This issue does not appear in OneNote.</li><li>I have tried the tips given by David97531.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I have since downgraded and have been using Office 365 version 15 to avoid this issue. I cannot remember if the issues remains in word or excel, however I vaguely remember inking was only working smoothly in OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response.</p>

<h2>            There is a big problem with Office for iPad</h2>
                    <p>Recently,I am using Office on iPad Air2.It's very fast to open a file smaller than 5M in less than 5s.BUT!! once the file is larger than 5M(such as 5.23M,6M,just a little bigger than 5M),It takes almost &nbsp;a whole day(literally 8 hrs that I will be waiting).</p>
<p>The truth is the file cannot be opened, and the Word seems to get stuck.(The picture below is the situation).By the way,I am the user of Office 365</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are having trouble opening a file, It’s probably because it has been saved in a file format that Word doesn’t support on your device.</p>

<p>Thank you so much Jose!</p>
<p>But it may not be the improper Word format that contributes the happening for this problem,because I can quickly open a similar file with the same format but less than 5M in Word. So I guess it is the file size that makes this happen.In addition,is there
 possibly a BUG in the software.If that's true,hope you can improve that.I will appreciate it 🙂</p>

    <title>Applying a Ranking to a Pivot Table with multiple Row Labels - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikeclaynfl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Applying a Ranking to a Pivot Table with multiple Row Labels</h2>
                    Hoping someone has an easy solution for this. Excel 2010.<br />
<br />
I have a pivot table with multiple Row Labels: Player and Team<br />
I then have a bunch of stat categories under Values, one of which is 'Pts'<br />
I have the table sorted by Pts, but I need a 'Ranking' column<br />
I created a second Pts column and used 'Show Values As - Rank Largest to Smallest', but it's not working. It's showing up as '1' for all columns, regardless of whether or not I pick 'Team' or 'Player' as the base field.<br />
If I remove 'Team' as a Row Label, however, it works perfectly.<br />
<br />
I need Team and Player for this Pivot. Can anyone instruct me how to get this to work?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

    <title>3110 Classic Java App GPRS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vigneshe  say:</h3>
<h2>            3110 Classic Java App GPRS</h2>
                    Present software version in my phone is 5.50 dated 14-08-07.<br />
<br />
What is that setting which allows java apps to access internet thru GPRS? Why so(ooo) confusing settings for GPRS? Where can I key in the port and ip address manually? Seems to be a very basic flaw with the software, but I have no success to have a java application
 accessing internet. Yahoo Go is also useless, so as all the nifty applications get me stock quotes and cricket scores.<br />
<br />
Any success story for someone here?

            Call your provider and ask them to send you the settings, that is the easiest way. In most S40 phones, Access Points can't be manually set if your provider has a port number other than the standard(ie-8080), but I don't know whether this is right with
 your phone.

            Only after my service provider sent the settings, I was able to see atleast some page loading thru built-in browser. You are right, my service provider gives 9401 as the port.<br />
<br />
Is it that difficult to provide a setting for user configurable port? Heaven knows.

            Hi Vignesh,<br />
I also have 3110 mobile. I have vodafone chennai network. But these customer care people are giving some different GPRS setting which is not similar to my mobile. Also they asked me to send me an sms to get a system generated setting in the sms. But even that
 is not giving me any setting.<br />
<br />
Can anyone please send me the same setting as your 3110 mobile phone for GPRS ?<br />
<br />
Hope i will get a helping hand.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.

            I also asked the Vodafone customer care whether they have EDGE or not. She was not even aware of it and said its not available after thinking.<br />
<br />
How could a very famous VODAFONE network which came inside india for a profitable business who dont even have EDGE along with their GPRS?<br />
<br />
Also, there is no change in the sim card which HUTCH was selling before. For example. If i see the Access Point's then i can only see HUTCH ACCESS. There is no vodafone in the list.<br />
<br />
Is VODAFONE in india only to get the profit and not here to serve people with high quality services?<br />
<br />
I was once happy to hear VODAFONE came to india but now i dont feel the same happiness becas there is no change in the network speed, my frend's GPRS speed and their service quality is poor.<br />
<br />
They only treat india as a market to sell the items which other country dont sell. And we indians are the most suffering on the hands of the european companies ruling in india.<br />
<br />
Something that we must all start to think of.

<h2>            In Microsoft Excel, &#34;03&#34; keeps autocorrecting to &#34;3&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I need to enter grades in a spreadsheet but I need them formatted in double-digits, like 03 for 3rd grade, 08 for 8th grade, etc. But every time I enter a single digit number with "0" first, like 03, it autocorrects to 3 only. I need that 0 there. I tried
 turning off all autocorrect options under "File"--&gt;options --&gt; Autocorrect options but it's still happening. Is there any way I can turn this feature off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>There are 2 options -</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Enter with a leading apostrophe which will not be visible in the cell but only in formula bar and doesn't impact anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence enter as '03</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You can select your column / cells &gt; Right Click &gt; Format Cells &gt; Text</p>
<p>Now, you can enter as 03 etc...(Before entering the cell needs to be Text. If few numbers are already entered, you will have to re-enter them after formatting as Text. Or you can use Data tab &gt; Text to Columns &gt; in 3rd step choose, Text to convert already
 existing numbers to Text)</p>

<p>
</p><p>I was unable to create Form control in Excel 2016, So, i installed 2011 and created the Form control and added my macros and trying to run that in 2016, Then its getting crashed once macro execution completes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I removed that form control and added some alternative and now its not getting crashed.</p>
<p>But i see a crash "EXC_BAD_ACCESS" on closing the excel version: 15.33.</p>
<p>On the later versions its working fine.</p>

    <title>How to scale the objects on a slide&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> orthoducks  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to scale the objects on a slide&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In PPT 2010. I copied a slide from one deck to another. I did Select All, Copy in the original slide; inserted a blank slide in the destination; and pasted. The pasted objects occupy space about twice as wide and high as the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Visio I would fix this by grouping the objects, scaling to fit, and ungrouping. The documentation I've found appears to say that should work in PowerPoint, but it doesn't. When I open the Group dropdown with all of the objects selected, the Group item
 is disabled and the Ungroup item is enabled. (BTW, when I select just a few individual objects the Group and Ungroup items are both disabled.)</p>
<p>
Apparently "Group" means something completely different in PowerPoint than in Visio, but I'm left without a way to rescale my slide. How is that done?</p>

            <p>Generally, grouping works the same way but certain shapes (placeholders for example) can't be included in groups, so if they're part of the selection, you can't group.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, things come in a reasonable size if you're pasting into a slide that's the same size as the one you're copying from.&nbsp; Sounds like maybe you're not doing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another dodge that may work for you:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go into Slide Sorter view and select the slide you want to copy.</p>
<p>Switch to the "target" presentation, insert a blank slide, then Paste Special and choose Enhanced Metafile.&nbsp; After the paste, scale the results to fit the slide, then if you need to edit, ungroup it.</p>

<p>Thank you for your update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for you to be able to transfer the Office installation to your new computer, you should have the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>You should have a license type that allows "transfers".</li><li>The 25 character product key.</li><li>A generic installation disk or a file for the Office bundle that matches the product key.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For a complete list of how to do the transfer, please visit this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_install-mso_other-msoversion_other/copy-move-or-transfer-an-office-installation-to/956244a0-385d-4e21-a21e-87b4179111d1">link</a></strong>.</p>

</p><p>Changed the RSIZE to "Large". The Live Tile is now updating correctly. And, equally important, it hasn't stopped other Live Tiles being updated.</p>
<p>Do problem solved. Bit, I have tp as why it didn't work with a 1920x1080 resolution??</p>
<p>Just so you know, I'm working on a Surface PRO 3 @8GB RAM 7&amp; 256GB SSD drive.</p>

            <p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad to know that the live tiles are working fine now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to let you know that the screen resolution should be set to at least
<strong>1024 X 768 </strong>size for the modern Windows App and live tiles&nbsp;to work fine. However, it should work with the higher resolution (1920x1080) as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you update display drivers and check if it works. Refer <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">

<p>These webpage script errors are usually harmless. Try disabling the warnings.</p>
<p>From IE&gt; Tools&gt; Internet Options&gt; Advanced...<br />
Check "Disable script debugging (Internet Explorer)" </p>
<p>and "Disable script debugging (Other)" </p>
<p>and uncheck "Display a notification about every script error."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option:</p>
<p>Internet Explorer is gong to suffer more JavaScript problems than other browsers. If scripting is always troublesome on a particular website you may have to use another browser to access that site.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why a hyperlink is not working. One of which is if the browser or the app that you are using has broken app components or there is a third-party add in causing the app not to work as expected. Please tell us more about your issue
 by answering the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did the issue start?</li><li>Are using an app or a browser to access Outlook?</li><li>Were there any changes made to your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you try these steps to resolve your concern if you are using the Outlook app.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Install Office updates. Installing optimal updates can help resolve issues by replacing outdated files.</li><li>Launch Office in safe mode. Here's how: Press the Windows key + R key, type outlook /safe, then click OK. It lets you safely use Office without encountering certain startup programs. If the issue does not occur in safe mode, disable the application add-ins
 and COM add-ins one at a time to check which add-in causes the issue.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            It's windows 10 that doesn't like Chrome. In My case it's Torch that I'm using. Firefox seems to be the best browser to use at this time, but that's subject to change on any update.

    <title>My text turned into wingdings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kimkouski  say:</h3>
<h2>            My text turned into wingdings</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I am writing a novel and I noticed that the last 5 pages have all turned to wingdings. None of the rest of the novel is like this only the end. Does anyone know why this happens and if I can turn it back to text?? I"ve tried highlighting it and trying
 to change it to regular text, but it comes out with squares. I've tried putting it through translators too but again comes out as squares. I've noticed it's this way in the other versions that I had saved. Please understand, I'm a newbie at computers so you'll
 have to talk to me in simple terms. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Kim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to know more about the challenge you're experiencing with writing your novel. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>Can you tell me which word processor program you're using to write your novel?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li><li>What is the current <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>OS Build</strong></span> of your Windows 10 device? Right-click the
<strong>Start</strong> button, select <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong> and then scroll down to
<strong>Windows specifications</strong> to find this information.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using Microsoft Word, I advise disabling add-ins. Some add-ins can cause this kind of issue when creating a document. You can refer to this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-manage-and-install-add-ins-in-office-programs-16278816-1948-4028-91e5-76dca5380f8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="View, manage, and install add-ins in Office programs">
<strong>article</strong></a> for steps on how to manage add-ins in Office. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also perform a clean boot if you're using a different program. A software conflict is possibly causing the font to turn to
<em>Wingdings</em>. A clean boot starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This isolation method will help us determine whether a background program is interfering with your program. For the steps on how to perform a clean boot in Windows
 10, refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="How to perform a clean boot in Windows">support article</a></strong>. Follow the steps under
 the section: <em><strong>How to perform a clean boot</strong></em>. You can also watch our

            <span>Thanks, but I actually found a solution. I posted a section on another board and someone said when they copied it to their computer, the language looked like it could be Greek. I copied the text from my OneDrive to
 my work computer that doesn't have windows 10 and again, yes, it looked like the Greek language, so I put it through a translator and was able to get back my work. So for some reason, my text went from English, to Wingdings, to Greek back to English. I have
 no clue what happened or why my work even changed. No idea at all!! I read somewhere that word can't recognize&nbsp;bullets for some reason and can change the font? I used bullets to organize my work. Anyway, I got it back again. I wish I knew what had happened.&nbsp;</span>

<p>If the text was truly in the Greek language, it must have been through some translation service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if text characters turned into a symbol font, because such a font (Wingdings, for example) was applied to text by mistake, it often happens that Word won't be able to convert it back. Copying the text into WordPad and then back into Word
 will fix that problem, though.</p>

</p><p>See if you have inadvertently turned NumLock on.&nbsp; If you can't use the keyboard shortcut which is supposed to toggle it off open the OnScreen Keyboard (osk.exe) and use its NumLock key instead.</p>
