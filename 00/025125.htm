    <title>Copy data from one record to another - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Copy data from one record to another</h2>
                    
<p>Let me start by saying that what this user wants goes against all I know about database design.&nbsp; I've tried to offer alternatives, tried to explain why it's better to do it differently, how easily I can design a report that will show her exactly what she
 wants to see how she wants to see it, etc. but I've gotten nowhere.&nbsp; What the user wants is what she wants - end of discussion.&nbsp; So let me explain what that is.</p>
<p>We have a database that is used to track donations from sponsors for an annual charity event.&nbsp; It contains 3 tables:&nbsp; tblSponsor, tblDonations, tblComMbr.&nbsp; tblSponsor obviously stores basic contact information about the sponsor, tblDonations contains data
 about the year the sponsor donated, what or how much they donated as well as any notes about that particular year's donation, and tblComMbr contains the name of the Committee member in charge of contacting them.&nbsp; The main form is based on tblSponsor and has
 a subform based on tblDonations - simple, basic design...what you'd expect to see.&nbsp; However, the user wants to be able to see a history of the notes contained in the subform whenever she proceeds to a new record.&nbsp; I told her no problem and showed her how we
 could display each record in the standard datasheet view.&nbsp; She doesn't like viewing in datasheet view though&nbsp;- she wants single form view only. And she really only wants to see the Notes field history, not the history for each field.&nbsp; So, what&nbsp;I eventually&nbsp;suggested
 was copying the data from the notes field in the previous record to the notes field for each new record (the Notes field is a memo field btw) because I didn't see any other way of making her comfortable with the design.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;just so completely redundant though.&nbsp;
 The fact that it's a memo field and you really can't do much with those anyway makes me feel a smidge better, but still.&nbsp; Anyway - is there some option I've not thought of?&nbsp; Also does anyone have any code suggestions to actually accomplish what I suggested?</p>
<p>Thanks so much for any suggestions.</p>

<p>If the user does not expect to be able to edit this combined notes, I think you can get away with using a single text box with an expression that uses the Concatenate function at<a href="http://www.rogersaccesslibrary.com/forum/generic-function-to-concatenate-child-records_topic16&amp;SID=f5b4fe95-6286-ec83cee3-dezbd6ef-48845efb.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.rogersaccesslibrary.com/forum/generic-function-to-concatenate-child-records_topic16&amp;SID=f5b4fe95-6286-ec83cee3-dezbd6ef-48845efb.html</a></p>
<p>If the user insists on editing the combined notes, then I think&nbsp;you need a separate table with the notes memo field.&nbsp; Then the notes subform can be bound to the new Notes table and used&nbsp;in any situation where donation data is entered/edited</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome back to your thread, arrangefrom. We would like to confirm if you have already tried the links that I have given you to optimize your browser and/or to use other browsers/PC to know if the same issue will arise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, please tell us what you mean by "Desktop version of Outlook". Are you referring to the default mail app on Windows 8? Or are you pertaining to the web site view, which are the PC view vs the Mobile view".</p>

            Unfortunately that doesn't work for all members of the team who need access to the documents. &nbsp;We need to read/edit them on the move hence why I looked to store this info in a cloud. &nbsp;Is there no work around? &nbsp;I need to keep the documents password protected
 for GDPR purposes. &nbsp;This worked fine with dropbox but moved them across as was looking to get a Microsoft office subscription which included the cloud data in one drive.

                    <p>So I am using VLookup to make a column of entries from another sheet. But when I try to make&nbsp;the sum on that column it is wrong. The table below is the values that are being&nbsp;displayed&nbsp;and formulas that I am using. If you need more information please let
 me know.</p>

<h2>            Gmail issues within the Mail app on Win RT 8.1</h2>
                    So, having some issues with the email app and Gmail on the Surface RT. I can receive emails normally, but I can't send anything. Whenever I try, the message just sits in the outbox permanently, and will not show up in corresponding folders on other devices.

            <p>Hi surfaceapple64,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for taking the time to reach out to the Surface Community! I am sorry to hear about the issue with sending emails on the Mail app and Gmail. I'd love to help you with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To understand your issue better, could you answer the following clarification questions?</p>
<ul>
<li>Just to confirm, do you have all updates installed?</li><li>When you say issues with the Mail app and Gmail, can I assume that you are using Gmail in the Mail app?</li><li>Do you have other accounts synced with the Mail app? If so, can you send emails from other accounts?</li><li>Could you clarify what you mean by emails not showing up in corresponding folders on other devices?</li><li>Have you tried force restarting the device by pressing the power button down for 30 seconds, let go for 30 seconds, and turn the device back on to see if it helps?</li></ul>
<p>Please let me know your findings.</p>
        </p>

            <p>1) I do. Everything is up to date</p>
<p>2)Yes, I'm trying to use my Gmail account through the Mail app rather than the web browser. Gmail tends not to like the web browser on the Surface and runs extremely slowly, so using the Mail app is usually the best option.</p>
<p>3)I do not. I only use one email account regularly, and that's my Gmail account.</p>
<p>4) If I were to send something with the mail app, it shows up in the outbox on the Surface. If I were to check Gmail on another computer, the message simply does not exist. It's simply not sending, I suppose.</p>
<p>5)I have. It didn't affect it at all. I did, however, notice that whenever I try to send a message or click the sync button, it'll pop up a message in the upper right corner of the screen that says something to the tune of "Gmail is unavailable". Despite
 this, new received emails show up as they should.</p>

    <title>Trouble with list of figure in Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tgarb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble with list of figure in Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>In an existing word document, I have a list of figures that is hyperlinked to numbered figures throughout the document. I had to had a new figure in the middle of the document (ex: Figure 10) and now I have two "Figure 10"s and the numbers for the figure
 beyond 10 are now one off. The hyperlinks are all still working, but is there a way for Word to easily fix the numbering issues in the list of figures as well as throughout the document?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried clicking on "update table" under the references tab, but that just completely deletes my new "Figure 10" from the list of figures.</p>

            <p>How did you create the captions? Via References tab | Insert Caption? In that case, you can update the numbering by switching to Print Preview and then return to your previous view (you can use Ctrl+F2 followed by ESC).
<br />
<br />
If the list of figures is based on caption labels, clicking inside it and pressing F9 should update it. On the other hand, if the list of figures is built on styles, make sure the correct style has been applied to the caption.</p>

            If this is an autogenerated figure TOC, you should not manually edit it for this purpose.&nbsp; Instead select the entire figure TOC, right click it, then left click
<em>update field</em> and&nbsp; <em>update entire table</em>.&nbsp; If you have already inserted the new figure caption in the text and if the caption autonumbers have updated, the numbering in the figure TOC will be in sequence and match the numbers in the text.<br />

<h2>            Creating Groups - for security and email purpose</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to create a group which I manage only in one go - to give access to specific documents on share point and also being able to send emails to that group (aliases)</p>
<p>I am trying to figure out the group setting in office 365. When choosing Groups in the admin navigation pane I seem to be able to only create security groups - there is no wizzard opening as descriped here
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-an-Office-365-Group-in-the-admin-center-74a1ef8b-3844-4d08-9980-9f8f7a36000f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I of course I could now easily create two different groups one for the security and one for the emailing purpose - but that is not really logical in my sense.</p>

<p>Does anyone now how to do this more effectively or what I am doing wrong here.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Phone locks out&#47;times out on Lumia 950 when playing music</h2>
                    My lumia 950 will go to lock screen and stop playing music. &nbsp;I have to keep the screen active to keep playing. &nbsp;This is very annoying!! I simply want to hit play and it should keep playing. &nbsp;The lock screen has a max time out of 5 minutes. &nbsp;Can this be
 adjusted anywhere else. &nbsp;Also, having same issue when trying to have Grove sync to all my music I installed on my SD card. &nbsp;Got to keep screen active to keep syncing. &nbsp;Also, very annoying.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently took the windows 10 update for my nokia 950, this problem is now happening on my phone. It is most annoying when out for my morning walk to have to keep taking the phone out and reawakening the screen so it plays.</p>
<p>The build no ofmy upgrad is 10.0.15063.297 so after the one you quote here.</p>
<p>Is this another issue and is there a fix?</p>
<p>I have tried lengthening the delay on&nbsp; time out but I shouldn't have to.</p>

<p>Me too. Since a couple of months ago anything playing in Microsoft Edge will stop playing at exactly 10 minutes under the lock screen. Even though I have the edge browser set to always allow in the background it still turns off at the 10 minute mark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would love that this is fixed, I can handle most things but you take away my music I'll switch to another platform.</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;This is still&nbsp; an issue unfortunately. I was hoping it would be fixed by now. Anything streaming in Edge used to work underneath the lock screen, so it it obviously possible. Please sort this out Microsoft!</p>

<p>All, I know that MS has stopped updating the OS for Windows phone users (except for security or major stuff) but wouldn't it be nice if they could have one last effort to help all the people (like me) who spent $500+ on a piece of hardware (Lumia 950) that
 continues NOT to perform simple tasks as outlined in this question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to use the handset to stream music / audio from a website (based in the UK called BBC iPlayer Radio) via Edge and after XX minutes (the lock screen timeout) it all stops.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Annoying / frustrating / downright sloppy for a company that got us all to invest a load of hard earned cash to support MS's new venture into phone technology then for us to be abandoned with a smartphone that is now almost as useful as an old 'dumbphone'
 2G Nokia handset from the late 90s and getting worse as more and more dedicated apps fail to be developed.&nbsp; We can make calls and browse the internet to a level but...........</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft, invest a little of those eye watering profit numbers and give your supporters a bit of help by solving this and a number of other things that should be straightforward given your technical and cash resources.</p>

<p>Agreed my Lumina 950 XL phone is still working like new but the app and OS support failings after such a short support life period is appalling&nbsp; when xbox360 is still supported after so many years. The whole point of purchasing a major manufacturers product
 is through life support. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone is dying because of your lack of software support and investment, not because the hardware has expired.&nbsp; Shame on you Microsoft......</p>

<p>Hi Dipayan,</p>
<p>To clarify your situation, could you provide the following information?</p>
<p>1.What is the type of the affected account, Office 365 Business account, Outlook.com or Gmail.com?</p>
<p>2.Where did the issue occur? &nbsp;If it occurred in the Outlook desktop client, I suggest you create a new
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook profile</a> to check the result.</p>
<p>3.More details about “apparently caught in some infinite forwarding loop”. Some screenshots will be useful. To upload screenshots, select
<b>Use rich formatting</b>, and then click <b>insert /Edit</b>.</p>
<p>4.Does the issue occur in another computer?</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Toby</p>

<p>Hi toby, thanx for your quick reply. To answer your questions, the issue occurred in the office 365 email provided by GoDaddy as a part of their package.The web page is not allowing to take screenshot ( saying it is HTTP, so I can not take screenshot for
 security reason), but it is basically a completely blank page with this address in the address bar: &nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=4&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf</a><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">ct=1451034574</span>&amp;rver=6.6.6556.0&amp;wp=MBI_SSL&amp;wreply=https%3a%2f%2foutlook.office.com%2fowa%2f%3frealm%3******&amp;id=******&amp;whr=******&amp;CBCXT=out&amp;msafed=0#wa=wsignin1.0</span></p>

<p>Hi Dipayan,</p>
<p>Thanks for clarifying your situation.</p>
<p>According to your description, I understand that your subscription is purchased from GoDaddy and cannot to sign in to OWA now. &nbsp;Please let the administrator check if your Office 365 licenses were removed. If not, the issue might be related to the back end.</p>
<p>However, since our forum mainly focuses on Office365 subscriptions which is bought from the Microsoft official website directly and there are many differences between the plan from the official site and that from a Syndicate partner like GoDaddy, Telstra
 or Vodafone. To resolve the issue, I recommend you contact GoDaddy support. Your understanding will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Toby</p>

            If you are talking about a ZIP file, then the file must be bad on the server. You'll have to ask them to re-upload the file. This is not an Excel issue. :)

Did not receive any error messages. It just did not show up in my outlook. I am able to log into Mimecast online and see my account so I know it is working.&nbsp; I went into File, Options, Add-ins and surprisingly found it in disabled section...interesting...I
 enabled it and restarted my outlook and now I cannot locate it in the Add-Ins sections.&nbsp;

            <p>No. Whatsapp has never made a version of their app for the Windows Mobile OS your HD2 runs,&nbsp;though they&nbsp;have made one for&nbsp;the newer Windows Phone 7 OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess in the discussion we all sort of sidestepped your actual concern, sorry. I'll try&nbsp;to be clearer- the Marketplace for WM6.5 was a completely different market than current WP7 phones access, with different apps. There was never a Whatsapp app for your
 HD2, either&nbsp;available in the WM6.5 Market or outside it, and even if Microsoft magically brought the&nbsp;WM6.5 Market back today, you wouldn't find a Whatsapp app to download and install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the bad news and initial confusion, but I assume that answers your question.</p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span>I need to create a Word document<em>
</em>with <em>different</em> <strong>custom</strong> “Picture Watermarks” (or <strong>
no</strong> watermark at all) on specific pages.<span>&nbsp; </span>Later on, imported text will “flow over” the watermark images and “fill in” the form. This document must be in Word.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>FWIW, I got this to work perfectly in Libre Office Writer, version: 6.0.1.1 (x64).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, these <strong>“.<em>ODT</em>”</strong> files are not readable in Word either
<em>1)</em> directly or <em>2)</em> after export into a native Word format.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In both cases Word fails to displays the watermarks. </span></p>

</span>Can Word 2016 can accomplish <strong>all</strong> of the following???<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The watermarks on pages <strong>
#1</strong> and <strong>#2</strong> must be different.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Pages <strong>#3</strong> and <strong>
#4</strong>, must <strong><em>not</em></strong> have any watermark.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Later on, text will be imported from ASCII text files and must flow over the watermarks to “fill in” the form.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>The watermark must be “anchored” to the
<strong>original</strong> page number and must <strong>remain #1 </strong>and<strong> #2</strong> after the text file import.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I apparently cannot utilize shapes (with a .PNG) “Behind Text”.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>For various reasons an actual Word merge is not an option.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>

<p>When the document contains multiple sections and you have unlinked the headers, you can add your watermark objects&nbsp;(one by one)&nbsp;<strong>manually</strong> to the header (that is, you can't use the Design | Watermark option). For example, you can cut an existing
 watermark and then reinsert it by pasting it into the header paragraph. See also

<p>Thank you for your very prompt and informative response.&nbsp; As per your kind suggestion I was indeed able to paste different custom watermarks on pages 1 &amp; 2, maintained no watermark on page 3, and save the document.&nbsp; This part appears to work great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, so good!&nbsp; Unfortunately, things go haywire when I import text from an ASCII text file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the "Insert" tab, I click on "Object", select "Text from File...", and finally my text file.&nbsp; Formatting problems now appear.&nbsp; (This requirement is the&nbsp;<strong>fourth&nbsp;</strong>point specified in my original post underneath&nbsp;<em>"Question:"</em>).</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>The issue</strong></em>:&nbsp; Imported text does not merely flow&nbsp;over watermarked pages #1 and #2 and the remainder onto page #3.&nbsp; Instead, Word disruptively inserts three new page with page #1's watermark.&nbsp; Page two is pushed to page position #4.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, I need&nbsp;<span>the original&nbsp;</span><span>pages #1 and #2 to remain</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>as #1</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>and
 #2</span><span>&nbsp;(<strong>statically</strong>) after the text file import.&nbsp; Additional text for page #3 and beyond needs to flow onto blank (no watermark) pages.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em><strong>NEW QUESTION:</strong></em>&nbsp; I now wonder is Word even technically capable,&nbsp;</span><span>upon text import,</span><span>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>statically
</strong>maintaining the first two (watermarked) pages and then creating subsequent&nbsp;<strong>blank
</strong>pages to accommodate&nbsp;the text flow?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks again for your great response.</span></p>

<p>Create a new section using a Next Page section break.</p>
<p>Make sure that none of the headers are linked to previous. This is a setting for each of the three potential headers in the section.</p>
<p>Remove the watermark(s) from all headers in that section by deleting them from the header, not by using the Remove Watermark command.</p>
<p>Insert your text into the new section that does not have the watermark(s).</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing static about Word. It is intended to be used as a word processor with text flowing from page to page. Watermarks are creatures of headers which are creatures of Sections. With different sections you
<em>can</em> have different headers and footers, but the default, reasonably, is to continue from previous sections. You need to tell Word what you want.</p>

<p>Thank your for your kind reply.&nbsp; I really had no idea that my particular need would not have some rather straight-forward solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not need a special <strong>one-time</strong> document and here's why.&nbsp; Currently I must 1) pre-print the 2-sided "form", 2) collate blank sheets in-between each "form",&nbsp; 3) import my ASCII text, and 4) run through the printer second time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, I need a reusable original document onto which I can simply import my text and send to the printer.&nbsp; It turns out that I can do this quite successfully and simply in Libre Office Writer.&nbsp; The problem is that this solution is not exportable to Word
 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am beginning to suspect that Word, even with all of its advanced features, is incapable of the point #4 in my original post.&nbsp; I really hope that I am wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm open to any further suggestions.&nbsp; Thanks to all so far, I really appreciate your all's help!</p>

<p>Your process is just plain daft.&nbsp; The term in Word for a reusable original document is "template", it maybe that it is an application for mail merge and the "reusable original document" would be the mail merge main document.</p>

<h2>            Unable to send Emails Reached Daily Limit - Outlook Premium Member</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep getting a message to say I have reached my sending limit albeit I am a Premium member and today had sent maybe 4-5 messages and can't send since 8.00AM.&nbsp; Have work to do and unable to send emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have sent Outlook support and no reply from them,&nbsp; Tried to reply to email with screenshot but stated unable to send as sending limit reached and put's it in draft folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been with Hotmail/Outlook for over 15 years and never had such an issue.&nbsp; Really annoyed as travelling abroad over weekend and had some important emails to send.</p>
<p>Can someone look into this please as I have already contact Outlook support but why the heck do I have a Daily Limit especially I have not sent 100 or 500 emails only send dozen emails everyday.&nbsp; I also paid for Office 365 &amp; Outlook premium today and this
 problem started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bit annoying this to be honest!&nbsp; I hope it's fixed tonight as unable to do any work due to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Subscribing to Outlook Premium doesn't give you unlimited amounts.</p>
<p>It could be that your account has been flagged as a spammer and you are being limited. Did you get any such emails from Microsoft saying that? Maybe in your Junk folder.</p>
<p>Regardless of the whys, since it sounds like something specific to your account you'll have to work with Tech Support as they are the only ones with access to the accounts on the back end.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it can take days/weeks for Tech Support to respond.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Days or weeks for Tech to respond,&nbsp; I will rather just move away from Outlook and request a full refund for Office 365 and Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had no emails from Microsoft and also I use it as a business but hardly send on daily 30-50 emails and never had any message to say it's marked as Spam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although today in my Inbox I had a sudden rush of say around 500 Spam Emails in my Inbox but they were from other's not mines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How long do these daily limits last as I need to send some urgent emails but if Tech will take weeks to respond then what am I meant to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty useless this then!!!</p>

</p><p>The article you sent is helpful, but it doesn't work in Sharepoint because it doesn't accept external data sources. I managed to use a work-around of the 'Connections' under the Data tab to pull the external data, and then transfer that into the master spreadsheet

<p>My client's sales force uses notes in calendar items.&nbsp; This is an easy thing to in Outlook.&nbsp; However, I am not able to find a way to do this in Office 365 calendar.&nbsp; I can, of course, edit my own and add notes but not add notes from someone else's calendar
 item.</p>
<p>Is it even possible?</p>

<h2>            Moving from an Office365 Personal to an invite from an Office365 Home account</h2>
                    <p>Hello. Together with my partner we have recently been using two separate Office365 Personal accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon her renewal we decided to&nbsp;upgrade her account to Office 365 Home and have me then accept one of her 5 accounts. When the invitation is accepted (via email), I am directed to my Account page and do not see the option to move onto this new subscription,
 while keeping my existing applications and One Drive files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to do this or should one wait for the current subscription to expire? And if it does, are all the files retained for a grace period of time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
