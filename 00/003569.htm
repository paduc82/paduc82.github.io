    <title>Office 2013 freeze and crash when out of focus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013 freeze and crash when out of focus</h2>
                    <p>So this has been an extremely big issue in the IT department recently. It effects both Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10 PC's we have deployed. Not everyone but random employees computers will freeze and crash when out of focus, no matter how long
 the program has been open once it looses focus it, but every instance of this issue everyone's computer does the same thing and no they are not all the same hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event viewer doesn't give me any error info besides:</p>
stopped interacting with Windows and was closed. To see if more information about the problem is available, check the problem history in the Action Center control panel.<br />
&nbsp;Process ID: 2c50<br />
&nbsp;Start Time: 01d2ff1c71e6b254<br />
&nbsp;Termination Time: 31<br />
&nbsp;Application Path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15\WINWORD.EXE<br />
&nbsp;Report Id: e3ed38a7-6b31-11e7-87d5-c4d987ea3bce<br />
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Basically these our the steps we always try and do BEFORE we have to just build/image them a new computer because nothing fixes it.<br />
Check Windows updates (From Microsoft not our patch server)</p>
<p>Check and install the newest Video Driver (Only from manufacturer site, NVIDIA Quadro cards)</p>
<p>Disable hardware acceleration on anything we can</p>
<p>Change power profiles on NVIDIA's config for prefer max performance (caused issues with Windows at one point in previous builds)</p>
<p>Ran the OffCAT tool and applied whatever configs it recommended if any.</p>
<p>Ran repair.</p>
<p>Completely remove/uninstall restart completely install restart.</p>
<p>There is no prior versions of office on the computer and never was for most of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with the issue? It hasn't been to crazy high of an issue but we seem to be getting another wave of this issue on our domain, not sure if it may be a group policy thing or what.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also checked this out with no help from the article:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016-word/known-issues-that-cause-word-2016-to-crash-or-stop/585eaee2-d771-4c88-86a3-733314dfc81d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016-word/known-issues-that-cause-word-2016-to-crash-or-stop/585eaee2-d771-4c88-86a3-733314dfc81d</a>&nbsp;(Yes

<p>This issue first started happening about 8 months or so ago to random people in the company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We install all updates available for Office and Windows (patches and updates). We do have Malwarebytes Anti-Malware and Anti-exploit (turned off anti exploit when testing the crashing issues with no luck). We also have Sophos endpoint anti virus as well.
 Defender and windows firewall is off when on the domain (only happens on the domain).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue randomly happens to some office programs, Word and excel and some others don't, but also at the same time all office programs won't work after being out of focus and they all will crash, it is a random issue with either some programs working but
 usually none work when out of focus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue happens on both Windows 7 64bit (up to date) and Windows 10 64bit (up to date).</p>
<p>
</p><p>No changes that i know of or could think of settings wise, or group policy wise or security wise except definition updates obviously.</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. For us to check if this is an issue with the update, we may need to perform some troubleshooting steps. Please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Disable add-ins manually. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Right-click the <strong>Start</strong> button (lower-left corner), and choose
<strong>Run</strong>. If you're in Windows 7, you can click on <strong>Start</strong> &gt;
<strong>Run</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Type one of these commands:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Type <strong>excel /safe</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong> to start Excel.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Type <strong>winword /safe</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong> to start Word.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Type <strong>powerpnt /safe</strong> and press <strong>Enter </strong>
to start PowerPoint.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Download the latest version of Malwarebytes which is v. 3.1.2. Please click this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Office-crashes-or-hangs-after-updating-to-Windows-10-Creators-Update-and-with-Malwarebytes-3-0-installed-7A59DFBC-5997-4798-903E-A9E709F17692?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-GB&amp;ad=GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>

            The question isn't answered. I didn't find any serial numbers in places you've pointed to. BTW how is broadband connection related to a serial number? The only one place to search for it is a factory box for the device. It has IME. Not sure it can be treated
 as a serial number.

<h3> yourmom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does anyone find the pricing for the premium service to be an impediment to its use&#63;</h2>
                    I would like to be able to use the premium features to keep up with my children.&nbsp; However, I find the pricing to be rediculous.&nbsp; Sprint has a similar service that allows me to do all the same things regardless of phone operating system.&nbsp;&nbsp;They charge a
 very low monthly fee for this service, and it is unlimited. Since the carrier and the device are providing most of the features required to enable this functionality,&nbsp;Microsoft should have a simple unlimited yearly fee. Say something like $24.95.&nbsp; Any thoughts
 on this?

            My Phone's premium services are designed to be used only occasionally, if the windows phone is lost or stolen, not as a regular use.&nbsp; It seems you are looking for something that can be used all the time and that is not how the premium services work.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 16.0.7870.2024 crashes editing subject line</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I'm using the latest version of office 365 with Office 2016 fully updated.</p>
<p>I always used the edit function for change the subject line on the mail messages that i receive (also with previous version of office)</p>
<p>Form few months when i edit the subject line outlook sometimes crashes. I've checked for malaware, i've disabled unused Outlook addons, etc without any change. As it has worked in past with office 2016 i suspect that the problem arose after some changes
 to the system (maybe a windows update?).</p>
<p>For the other things, all is ok, and outlook is stable, it crashes only editing the subject lines.</p>
<p>Someone has some suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <span>Hi Enrico,<br />
<br />
According to your description, the issue may occur after some changes on your computer and you have already tried some steps on your side. Thus, I would suggest you firstly try to run a quick repair Outlook client. You can refer to the article below to do it:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b</a><br />
<br />
Then I would confirm that as you said sometimes the issue occurred when editing the subject line, if you disable the availability to edit subject line and reset the view, then enable editing the subject line again, will the issue persist?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</span>

    <title>Pivot tables are giving wrong data when the data source is a table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josh_onstrategy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pivot tables are giving wrong data when the data source is a table</h2>
                    <p>I am currently working on a project reviewing where visitors come from when they come to stay in my cities hotels.&nbsp; I added all the hotels to a table and then did a pivot table to look at what markets they are coming from.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the original table, the total sum of all room nights came out to 2,758,777.&nbsp; When I do a pivot table that looks at the sum of each room night by market, there are suddenly 3,072,866 room nights.&nbsp; In the attached screen shot, you can see that I compare
 what the pivot table out put vs what happens if I use sumif.&nbsp; The sumif column equals 2,758,777 while the pivot Sum of ROOM Nights column equals 3,072,866.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant explain why the pivot table is coming up with more room nights from some markets and not others.&nbsp; You can see in Aberdeen, WA that the pivot table output has 16 more rooms.&nbsp; There are a number of other discrepancies as you move down the list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I was missing some crucial pivot table element.&nbsp; In order to resolve the issue, I converted my table to a range and re ran the pivot table and got the correct values equal to if I use some if.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone explain why a pivot table based on a table vs a range outputs different results?</p>

<p>Do you know if this error has anything to do with my Microsoft Office Outlook 2010 IMAP settings or it is the problem with Yahoo! Mail Server?</p>

    <title>Word 2010 problem with PostScript Type 1 fonts and PDF export - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zombie010  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 problem with PostScript Type 1 fonts and PDF export</h2>
                    
<p>I have been using Office 2010 since the Beta period and I am now using the release build.</p>
<p>I use Adobe Postscript Type 1 fonts regularly in my documents, and I have found that Word 2010 (and presumably all of the Office 2010 applications) has several problems working with PostScript fonts.</p>
<p>Most notably, the "Save as PDF" function will create documents with an odd gradient effect applied to all PostScript fonts.</p>
<p>Secondarily, the Word editor frequently glitches and renders PostScript fonts using a sans-serif font that looks to be Arial.</p>
<p>The following are a demonstration of the issue:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tsotech.com/images/office2010/original-doc.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tsotech.com%2fimages%2foffice2010%2foriginal-doc-small.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>This is an original document typed in Minion, an Adobe PostScript Type 1 font.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tsotech.com/images/office2010/pdf-version.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tsotech.com%2fimages%2foffice2010%2fpdf-version-small.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>This is the document as rendered by muPDF, a very lightweight PDF reader.&nbsp; Note that the official Adobe Acrobat Reader will render the document correctly.&nbsp; I suspect Microsoft only tested the PDF export functionality with the Adobe Reader and concluded that
 it was functioning correctly.&nbsp; But please note that alternative readers are fairly commonplace, especially with so many security issues being found daily in Adobe's products.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tsotech.com/images/office2010/mac.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tsotech.com%2fimages%2foffice2010%2fmac-small.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I don't have access to a Mac, but the above screenshot was from a Mac's PDF reader attempting to display a different PDF document I had sent a colleague.</p>
<p>Finally, during regular use of Word 2010, the editor will fail to render PostScript Type 1 fonts correctly, falling back on a sens-serif font that I believe to be Arial.&nbsp; See below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tsotech.com/images/office2010/display-glitch.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tsotech.com%2fimages%2foffice2010%2fdisplay-glitch-small.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Please investigate these issues, Microsoft!</p>

<p><strong>There are 4 issues in this thread for Word 2010 RTM:</strong></p>
<p>1. Some PostScript fonts display incorrectly after being edited in Word's Print Layout.</p>
<p>2. Documents with some (but not all) fonts containing PostScript outline data (Ex: Helvetica, Times) crash on open.</p>
<p>3. Documents using fonts with PostScript Outline data saved as a PDF in Word render correctly in Adobe Reader but incorrectly in some other PDF Viewers.</p>
<p>4. Documents using fonts with PostScript outline data saved as a PDF in Word render the text as a static image rather than selectable text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Issue #1</strong></p>
<p>To assist us in solving this issue, please answer the following questions. Thank you.</p>
<p>1. What is the full name for the printers you have installed? Which of these is the default printer? [Start -&gt; Type "Devices and Printers"]<br />
2. What editing languages do you have enabled in Word? [Open Word -&gt; File -&gt; Options -&gt; Language]<br />
3. When in a corrupt state, does changing to a different printer (and back) fix the issue? [File -&gt; Print]</p>
<p>4. Can you reproduce the issue in *.doc files? [File -&gt; Save As -&gt; Save as type = "Word 97-2003 Document (*.doc)"]<br />
5. Can you reproduce the issue in *.docx files?&nbsp; [File -&gt; Save As -&gt; Save as type = "Word Document (*.docx)"]<br />
6. Can you reproduce the issue in Draft View? [View -&gt;Draft View]<br />
7. Can you reproduce the issue in both Portrait and Landscape orientations? [Page Layout -&gt; Orientation]<br />
8. Can you reproduce the issue in a version of Windows earlier than Windows 7 / Windows 2008?<br />
9. Can you reproduce the issue in a version of Word earlier than Word 2010?</p>
<p>&nbsp;===</p>
<p>Here are several workarounds for this issue from my other thread, but please continue to assist us by answering the questions above. Workarounds in order of most convenient to least convenient are:</p>
<p>1. Add a Right-to-Left language, such as Hindi, to your list of editing languages. [(In Word) File -&gt; Options -&gt; Language -&gt; [Add aditional editing languages] -&gt; Hindi -&gt; Add]</p>
<p>2. Each time a document is opened with the incorrect font being displayed change to a different printer (and back). [(In Word) File -&gt; Print]</p>
<p>3. Uninstall all printers from Windows. [(In Windows) Start -&gt; Devices and Printers]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Issue #2</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problem A</span> ‚Äì Use one of these workarounds if you are crashing when opening documents with fonts Helvetica or Times.</p>
<p>- Remove offending PostScript font substitutions from the registry location. Restart computer.<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\FontSubstitutes]<br />
- Install the OpenType versions of the offending PostScript fonts.<br />
- Uninstall the offending PostScript fonts.<br />
- Open the Font Dialog Box (Ctrl + D) before attempting to display an offending PostScript font. This fix lasts until Word is closed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problem B</span> ‚Äì Use one of these workarounds if you are crashing when opening documents with fonts other than Helvetica or Times. In this case you are most likely crashing due to your printer driver.</p>
<p>- Change your default printer to another printer that does not crash (ex: Microsoft XPS Document Writer).<br />
- Uninstall your printer (or all printers).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Issue #3</strong></p>
<p>Currently the best workaround is the one already given by the original poster: Open your PDF documents in Adobe Reader rather than muPDF or the Mac's default PDF reader.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Issue #4</strong></p>
<p>When saving documents using fonts with PostScript outline data, Word 2010 only supports outputting the text as a static image, and does not support outputting the text as selectable text. Currently the best workaround is the one already given by the original
 poster: Use a printer driver that outputs to PDF such as Adobe Acrobat or CutePDF.</p>

</p><p><span>Good idea to scan with Malwarebytes...</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Edge evidently is still susceptible to adware issues from what we read on the forum. &nbsp;That tendency may be significantly reduced with the Win 10 Anniversary
 Update planned for next month which is to include some enhancements and improvements to Edge.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I use Windows Defender plus the free version of Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit and I have not encountered any problems with Edge (or any other browsers).</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Week Starts on Friday - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martinezjr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Week Starts on Friday</h2>
                    
<p>I have to print out a report that for a 28 day period where the week starts on Friday.&nbsp; So I searched the forum/net and found this:</p>
<p>[code]</p>
<p>Public Function YearStart(whichyear As Integer) As Date<br />
<br />
Dim WeekDay As Integer<br />
Dim NewYear As Date<br />
<br />
NewYear = DateSerial(whichyear, 1, 1)<br />
' original line<br />
'WeekDay = (NewYear - 2) Mod 7 'Generate weekday index where Monday = 0<br />
'mod for boot camp<br />
WeekDay = (NewYear - 6) Mod 7 'Generate weekday index where Friday = 0<br />
<br />
If WeekDay &lt; 4 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YearStart = NewYear - WeekDay<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YearStart = NewYear - WeekDay + 6<br />
End If<br />
<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
Public Function WeekStart(whichweek As Integer, whichyear As Integer) As Date<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WeekStart = YearStart(whichyear) + ((whichweek - 1) * 7)<br />
<br />
End Function</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>Which works great........ until the Year 2013, 2014,2015, which has the week starting on Thursday.&nbsp; For the Years 2016, 2017 and 2018, it goes back to Friday.&nbsp; Then, for the years 2019,2020,2021, week starting on Thursday again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there something in the formula that is wrong or is it a bigger issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Joseph</p>
<p>FYI: Office 2000 Pro, Win2k Server</p>

            You can return the week-starting date for any date very simply with the following function:<br />
<br />
Public Function WeekStart(intStartDay As Integer, Optional varDate As Variant) As Date<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Returns 'week starting' date for any date<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Arguments:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' 1. intStartDay - weekday on which week starts, 1-7 (Sun - Sat)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' 2. vardate - optional date value for which week starting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '&nbsp;&nbsp; date to be returned.&nbsp; Defaults to current date<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If IsMissing(varDate) Then varDate = VBA.Date<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(varDate) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WeekStart = varDate - Weekday(varDate, intStartDay) + 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
End Function<br />
<br />
So in a report's underlying query you can return the Friday week starting date for each row like so:<br />
<br />
SELECT *, <br />
WeekStart(6,TransactionDate) As WeekStarts<br />
FROM Transactions;<br />
<br />
If you want to group rows by each 28 days you can simply round towards zero to an interval of 28 using the following function:<br />
<br />
Public Function RoundToZero(dblVal As Double, dblTo As Double) As Double<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim intUpDown As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim lngTestValue As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim dblTestValue As Double<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim dblDenominator As Double<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If dblVal &lt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intUpDown = -1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intUpDown = 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dblDenominator = intUpDown * dblTo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dblTestValue = dblVal / dblDenominator<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lngTestValue = Int(dblTestValue)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RoundToZero = intUpDown * lngTestValue * dblTo<br />
<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
Because Access uses 30 December 1899 00:00:00, which happens to be a Saturday, as the origin for its date/time data type implementation, you need to offset the date by one for a Friday week-start, so to give the start date for each 28 day range you'd call it
 like so:<br />
<br />
SELECT *, <br />
WeekStart(6,TransactionDate) As WeekStarts,<br />
Format(RoundToZero(TransactionDate+1,28)-1,"yyyy-mm-dd") AS RangeStarts<br />
FROM Transactions;<br />
<br />
This might not tally with the origin of your particular 28 day periods, however, so you might have to offset the range starting date further, e.g. to offset by 3 weeks:<br />
<br />
SELECT *, <br />
WeekStart(6,TransactionDate) As WeekStarts,<br />
Format(RoundToZero(TransactionDate+22,28)-22,"yyyy-mm-dd") AS RangeStarts<br />
FROM Transactions;<br />
<br />
I've used the ISO standard of YYYY-MM-DD for the range starting date format here, but you can of course use any date format you wish.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Mail Merge Preview is Blank - labels</h2>
                    <p>I'm using the most current Word and an excel sheet.&nbsp; I'm attempting to make address labels. I've followed all the steps but my address block preview is blank and when I print it shows &lt;&lt;name&gt;&gt; instead of the actual names throughout the label.</p>
<p>Why hasn't the names merged from the excel list to the labels? I think the hiccup is after I chose my list and it says Select Table. there is only one table to chose from. Could this prevent the merge?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a click I'm missing to make the excel sheet accessible?</p>

            Your description suggests all you've saved is a preview of the merge; if you re-open the document and get the mailmerge prompt (as your post suggests), that confirms this to be so. Moreover, if you answer 'No' to that prompt, you disconnect the mailmerge
 main document from the data source and be left with just the mergefields. You need to complete the merge via the Finish &amp; Merge button.

            I assume you are referring to Windows Mobile Device Center. WMDC is not compatible with XP. You must use Activesync 4.5 to sync.

<h2>            Xbox One Gamesharing Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello there! Thank you for taking the time to offer your insights and opinions onto my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently got an Xbox One, and my brother and I have decided to gameshare. We did all the steps correctly (using the others profile and setting it to home xbox), but the games I am downloading &nbsp;say that I do not have the rights to play it, and that I must
 repurchase it. If anyone knows the solution feel free to PM VeXa Soul on xb1 or comment on this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(P.S#1: the game isnt fully downloaded yet, but it still pops that message up)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(P.S#2: I'm not sure I'm even in the right place to be asking this question.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The website told me to post my questions on this forum even though the categories dont seem xbox related.</p>

<p><font>Nokia N810 was a superior product that is out of production.&nbsp; It provided multi tasking, video conferencing, and internet in real time.&nbsp; Its sturdy built, and wide screen superior for a Mobile Internet Device.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The slide out keyboard provided superior input experience for people with medium to large fingers. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The only problem had been the learning curve for people who did not know anything about connecting to the internet wirelessly. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Although there is newer technology, the Nokia N810 price is increasing, due to demand and scarcity.&nbsp; The Nokia N810 allows mobility, and is cost effective.&nbsp; It provides a niche market for Wireless N Routers, and gadgets which allows users&nbsp;

<h2>            Word 2016 for Mac &#40;v16.9.1&#41; Spell Checker issues - errors not highlighted in main doc when running the spell check</h2>
                    <p>Is anyone else having this issue with Spell Check in Word 2016 for mac:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) Click the "Spelling &amp; Grammar" button on the 'Review' tab to check spelling</p>
<p>(2) In the Spelling and Grammar Dialog errors appear in red (as they did in Word 2011) and you can ignore or change them etc</p>
<p>(3) HOWEVER in the actual document the spelling error is NOT highlighted? In Word 2011 the error is highlighted in the actual document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it just me or are other people having this same behaviour?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, this is a separate feature to "Check spelling as you type" (and unticking 'Hide spelling errors') which creates the red squiggly line under mistakes. No, this is a different feature that under Word 2011 worked in conjunction with the Check Spelling
 and Grammar dialog box to highlight the mistakes in the actual document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a number or reasons we don't have "Check spelling as you type" turned on, so the highlight system was very important for us to see the mistakes in the main text when we do a spell check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If other people are having this issue I'll log a bug with Microsoft? Any thought?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks, Lee</p>

<h2>            Linking Excel Data to Word</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having trouble with preserving a desired format when linking data between excel and word. It is not a chart which is all I have been able to fine help on, it is just regular text. I am having trouble with the formatting because whenever I "copy" from
 excel&nbsp;and&nbsp;"link and merge formatting" to word it forces paragraphs above and below the paste. This can be&nbsp;fixed and it looks fine&nbsp;once it is fixed, however when the link is updated the formatting returns to the original formatting so it would have to be fixed
 again which takes&nbsp;away the effectiveness of linking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Paste Special&gt;Paste Link method has a number of paste formats.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>The RTF and HTML formats both insert the content as a formatted table, with a paragraph-break before. Since tables must be followed by an ordinary paragraph, any paragraph break at the insertion point is preserved.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>The Picture and Workbook paste formats do the best job of preserving the source formatting and both can be inserted in-line with whatever content is already present in the document.</div>

            <p>Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response, in other words does this mean that the only way to paste and link without getting a paragraph break&nbsp;does not allow you to merge the formatting (font and size) since they are both taken straight from the excel document like a picture?</p>
<p>

            If you're pasting a single cell, the RTF or HTML paste formats should work just fine. For multiple cells pasted as a group, though, if the aim is to preserve the format and not get the unwanted paragraph break(s), the best option&nbsp;is to use the Picture&nbsp;or
 Workbook paste format.

            <p>In the word that I am using it forces a paragraph break when pasting a single cell as well. It only does not do that when it is pasted in picture or workbook format, regardless of the number of cells copied.</p>

<h2>            Folder being created by Outlook</h2>
                    
<p>Outlook 2013 with WIndows 7.</p>
<p>Outlook is creating a new folder in my emails with the title of an email address I have not used in four years and have no access to. &nbsp;I delete the folder, but it reappears next login. &nbsp;It creates a subfolder called Inbox.</p>
<p>Checked settings and I am definitely not trying to retrieve mail from any server other than my Hotmail address which I am using Outlook for.</p>
<p>This just started a week ago, I haven't made any changes to my system which would have triggered this.</p>
<p>It's very strange. &nbsp;Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>From your description, I know the issue occurred while you only use the Hotmail account only in your Outlook 2013. Please correct me if the situation is misunderstood.</p>
<p>If it is the case, I suggest you troubleshoot the issue via the following aspects:<br />
1.&nbsp;Go to ‚ÄúFILE‚Äù&gt; ‚ÄúAccount Settings‚Äù&gt; ‚ÄúEmail‚Äù&gt; check whether there is the strange email address (folder created in your Outlook 2013).<br />
2.&nbsp;Go to ‚ÄúFILE‚Äù&gt; ‚ÄúAccount Settings‚Äù&gt; ‚ÄúEmail‚Äù&gt; double click your Hotmail address (if there is only your Hotmail address)&gt; ‚Äúmore settings‚Äù&gt; ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù&gt; check whether there is the strange email address.<br />
3.&nbsp;Delete the strange folder and create a new Outlook profile.<br />
4.&nbsp;Configure your Hotmail account in another PC. This step is to isolate whether the issue is related to the Outlook client.</p>
<p>In addition, upload a screenshot about the strange folder in your Outlook 2013 for analysis if the issue persists. To upload a screenshot: Click "Use rich formatting"&gt; "Insert Media".</p>
<p>We are looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

<p>thanks for replying, i didn't see that anyone had replied.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;only my hotmail address appears in this tab (type is exchange activesync)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;there is not a 'more settings' option anywhere.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;n/a</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;i'm using hotmail on my windows 10 laptop, though it doesn't appear to work well with the mail app. &nbsp;using owa instead. &nbsp;also use mail on my iphone and ipad, all with hotmail. &nbsp;everything is sync'ed so the odd folder appears everywhere.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=75070a6b-d7a1-4764-a7b2-2432138e028a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d75070a6b-d7a1-4764-a7b2-2432138e028a" /></a></p>
<p>i'll assume this upload works and you can see the second email address below the hotmail one. &nbsp;this address does not appear in the account setup area anywhere.</p>

<p>hi tim,</p>
<p>to protect your privacy, i have modified your screenshot.</p>
<p>please check if you have created any <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-alias-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
alia account</a> for your hotmail account and set up a separate inbox folder for your alia.</p>

<p>if not, does the folder show in your hotmail web client and whether the email address&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** exists? i‚Äôd like to confirm if the two email addresses have any connection, and then do further analysis.</p>

<p>Thank you for the suggestions.</p>
<p>I checked my microsoft account and this is not an alias. &nbsp;It IS a previous email address I used. &nbsp;Eastlink is an internet service provider, but I have not been a subscriber for years, and this just started recently.</p>
<p>I would have had this address linked to the client previously so I could use one client for all my mail, but as I say, I removed it about 3 years ago and this problem only started recently.</p>
<p>It's not harming anything (as far as I know), but I'm very curious about how this is occurring and would like to remedy.</p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>I‚Äôd like to know if you can delete this folder directly since it‚Äôs no use.</p>
<p>If not, I suggest you involve Hotmail server or Eastlink server for further troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<p>I can delete it, and the next time i open the program it reappears.</p>
<p>How is the program possibly contacting the Eastlink server if that's not set up in the program?</p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>The issue is a little odd. According to my experience, the root cause of the issue is related to the Hotmail account or Eastlink server instead of the Outlook client. It might be a backend related issue. To resolve this issue, I suggest you contact the
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum">Outlook.com/Hotmail.com
</a>or Eastlink server technical support engineer.</p>
<p>Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Toby</p>

<p>Umm, so... funny story. &nbsp;I recently got a new laptop and I have been using OWA for mail and so I checked my settings on that for accounts, and for some reason it had the eastlink account in there. &nbsp;I guess it's been that many years since I used Outlook on
 the web. &nbsp;My desktop and ipads were all synced so it was creating the folder on those as well.</p>
<p>Issue resolved, sorry it turned out to be something that stupid....</p>

</p><p>There is no server issue or errors. It just stopped receiving emails. I tried logging in with various different devices and apps but the problem is all the same. My email does not receive incoming emails anymore. We know for sure that it just stopped receiving
 emails because we tried with 2 other employees' emails.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are prompted that the email server is not responding in Outlook, it could mean that your email account info is outdated, or that there is a server issue with the your email service. May we know if you are able to view and receive your email messages
 when you access your email through your email provider's website, i.e. Gmail?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

I'm having the same issue with my Outlook e-mail as well, actually.&nbsp; I've waited nearly 24 hours, and am still receiving the same message whenever I try to add the account.&nbsp; Adding the account via my local installation of Outlook 2013 allows me to access the
 mail, but it cannot be moved over to my Outlook account.

            I also have this problem. I was recently doing some maintenance on one of the multiple POP email accounts I set up in @live.com. I deleted one of the accounts and re-added it but now one of the other email accounts that were previously set up is not listed
 in my "other email accounts". I tried adding that account again but I get the same message as the others in this post. How can I re-add the missing account?<br />

            Problem solved. Apparently enough time has expired so I was able to re-add the account. I still don't know how it got deleted in the first place. I'm not very impressed with this new outlook mail!<br />
