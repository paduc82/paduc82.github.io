<h2>            Start menu pops up without user action&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am finding that in 10074, the Start menu pops up at odd times without my requesting it.&nbsp; It will often come up when I resume my laptop from sleep.&nbsp; But not always.&nbsp; And I have seen it come up at other random times.&nbsp; I don't recall it ever coming up when
 the system was idle... it is always coincident with some user action.&nbsp; Just not as a result of clicking the Start button.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So.... is this a bug or is this by design?&nbsp; And yes, I have submitted feedback.&nbsp;

            <p>I did look in feedback and found several references but they did not seem to be exactly the same scenario.&nbsp; It is one of those hard to search for items, though..... how would someone describe it in just a couple words?&nbsp; The search term "start menu" with
 or without additional search terms brings up lots of spurious hits.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you saying that on 10074, you NEVER see the Start menu unless you click the Start button?&nbsp; Odd if true.&nbsp; I would say that once out of every ten sleep/wake cycles, the machine wakes up with the Start menu showing.&nbsp; And no, the Windows button on this laptop
 is not located where I would hit it accidentally.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Interesting.&nbsp; I have also noticed that sometimes when I click an icon on the taskbar to open the application, the icon "clicks" but nothing happens.&nbsp; Usually on the next click, the application responds. I wonder if this is related to the Start menu thing.....
 spurious clicks vs. ignored clicks.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that this installation was a clean install from ISO to a formatted partition, so there isn't any sort of unsuccessful upgrade issue going on.&nbsp;

            I have noticed some odd Start menu behaviour when launching games from Steam. I launch Steam and then click 'Play' on one of the games in the library, the game loads and then the Start menu search box will open and the game will minimise to the Taskbar.
 This is happening since the update to 10074

<p>Yes, KB3061161 is installed.&nbsp; It was installed on April 29th.... several days BEFORE I started this thread.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have not seen the Start menu appear on its own for maybe a week, so something has changed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other behavior I reported where it takes more than one click on an item on the task bar before it responds has not been resolved.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see how the suggestion from Sharath Srinivasa that you linked has any bearing on this since it describes the OPPOSITE start menu behavior.&nbsp;

            I'm not getting my verification code. What do I do?
<br />There are a number of possible explanations for why verification codes don't always arrive. Read through the list of the most common causes, and see if any of them apply to you.
<br />
<br />Does your phone block calls or texts from unknown numbers?
<br />If so, change your phone settings then choose I don't have a code. We'll send another verification code.
<br />
<br />Did your email send your verification code to your junk folder? 
<br />
<br />Check your junk email folder for a message from a Microsoft account, and use the code sent to you. Valid verification codes come from an @accountprotection.microsoft.com email address.
<br />
<br />Mark @accountprotection.microsoft.com as a trusted sender to receive your verification code in your inbox.
<br />
<br />Is your phone number or email address entered correctly?
<br />To keep your information safe when you're signing in, we only show you the last two digits of your phone number or the first two characters of your email address.
<br />
<br />To see if your security info is correct:
<br />
<br />Sign in to your Security basics page with your Microsoft account.
<br />Select Update info.
<br />Choose a method that you know works, or choose I don't have any of these to replace your security info.
<br />Does your alternate email address end in @outlook.com, @hotmail.com, @live.com, or @msn.com?
<br />If so, you're using one Microsoft account to verify another Microsoft account. This can make it tricky to keep track of which one you're signed in to. When you sign in to the second account (to get the code sent to that email), most browsers automatically sign you out of the first account (the one that's actually requesting the code).
<br />
<br />To get your verification code:
<br />
<br />Using a browser in privacy mode, sign in with the first account. This lets you stay signed in to both accounts at the same time.
<br />When you're prompted to enter the verification code that was sent to your alternate email address, don't close the browser window.
<br />Open a new window in privacy mode. Ctrl + Shift + P is the shortcut for InPrivate Browsing in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. If you're using a different browser, check that browser's help for info about privacy mode.
<br />In the new window, sign in to your alternate email account and look for the message from the Microsoft account team. Copy or write down the verification code from the message.
<br />Return to the window that is asking you for the verification code. Enter the code and follow the instructions.

            I'm not even sure how you ever got that to work. I've never heard of that before.

Of course, the Fill Down command is available as a menu item, but I've always found it most convenient to assign the

Anyhow, you can set the Fill Down command to work with any keystroke combination you want in the<span style="font-weight: bold"> Customize Toolbars and Menus</span> dialog:<br />
<br />

</li></ul>
<br />
Sorry that I can't tell you how to make the double-click work. I guess there might be a way to write a macro using mouse actions for something like that, but as far as I know, there's no way to assign mouse actions to Edit functions in the normal user-definable
 interface features in Excel. <br />

<h2>            One Note Crashes every time I open it now &#40;has worked previously&#41; Microsoft Surface Pro 3, Office 2013, Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><span>Hi, My OneNote has begun to crash every time I open the program. &nbsp;Please help!!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are some of the facts and troubleshooting I have done to-date:</span></p>
<p><span>Background:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Originally loaded Microsoft office 2013 and OneNote as one of the programs with NO issues</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;Microsoft Surface Pro 3, Office 2013, Windows 8 when I first loaded-- &nbsp;issues began while still in Windows 8<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>3. I frequently use the clip feature of onenote of screen clipping using the double click of my pen to capture pics &amp; pieces of docs (again, no prior issues
 and did this all the time</span></p>
<p><span>4. &nbsp;I have discovered that I have 2 instances of one note on my Microsoft surface pro (It took as while to identify this) &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. &nbsp;When I single click on my pen (the stylus) it opens one instance of it</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b. When I click on the OneNote icon in windows8 main page it was bringing up another OneNote location &nbsp;(likely a user error, but has caused a lot of frustration
 and I can't find files to merge or even to cut and past</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Description of issue when it started out of the blue:</span></p>
<p><span>1. I open onenote and after several seconds to 30 sec it crashes</span></p>
<p><span>2. &nbsp;a pop-up message appears saying "One Note has stopped working" and there is a purple line that is timing until that closes</span></p>
<p><span>2. that window is replaced with a window that says "One Note is restarting" and it restarts</span></p>
<p><span>3. after multiple cycles of this happening, a final message comes up saying "Microsfot OneNote has stopped working. &nbsp;A problem caused the program to stop working
 correctly. &nbsp;Windowsw will close the program and notify you if a soloution is available. &nbsp;There is a debug and close program button, but it always seems to close before I can try to run a debug.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Attempted troubleshooting using these microsoft help strings and blogs that have not yet helped my situation:</span></p>
<p><span>1. &nbsp;I tried to repair microsoft office 2013</span></p>
<p><span>2. &nbsp;when #1 didn't fix the problem, I did a reinstall of the programs</span></p>
<p><span>3. &nbsp;that still didn't fix the problem and I changed the access to microsoft one note to go in as an admin (working with an EE computer guy, he suggested that
 this sometimes bypasses some issues that come up.</span></p>
<p><span>4. &nbsp;#3 improved the situation as I could open OneNote for longer periods of time before the crashes.&nbsp; I could actually somewhat use onenote, but it still would
 and does crash</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp; I recently upgraded hoping that some updates in Windows could help—I have not seen a noticeable difference in improvement nor any additional issues.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please help!</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks, Leslie Anne</span></p>

<h2>            How can I move userforms and macros from one Excel 2010 workbook to another&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have created a series of userforms and a macro in one Excel 2010 workbook using some test data.
</p>
<p>I wanted to use the (now) working macro and forms with live data, however when I open a new blank workbook and click on the macro icon in the QAT Excel opens my testing workbook, and the macro and useforms only operate within the old testing workbook!</p>
<p>What is the process for moving the forms and the macro to another workbook with a different xls or xlsx filename?</p>

            You can only store macros in a macro enabled workbook, so that lets out xlsx format (use xlsm).<br />
<br />
Open the two workbooks, Open the VBA Editor (ALT+F11).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;If it is not displayed already, display the Project Explorer window (View &gt; Project Explorer or CTRL+R), then locate the module(s) and Forms that you want to copy in that window and drag them from one project to the other.<br />
<br />
As for the viability of the macros for use in the other workbook, that would depend on what they do. We can but guess.<br />

            <p>Thanks Graham,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will give your suggestion a try when I get my laptop with the Excel 2010 system back tomorrow. By the way the macros will still operate fine&nbsp;- I didn't want to risk screwing up my live data hence I used a test workbook (different file name) with identical
 worksheet names and data placement, but now I am happy with the code I would like to migrate it to the live environment - a sound&nbsp;way of working I believe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime I was interested in your comment about XLSM and only being able to store macros in this file format. The reason&nbsp;I say this is I actually developed the macros and user forms in Excel 2007 and I've always used XLS as far as I can remember.
 The macro works fine in my test data worksheet (XLS file type), and I can edit the code, modify it and store it all in an XLS file.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know what is the real impact of the different file types (XLS and XLSM at least), or are they really&nbsp;only cosmetic and useful perhaps as a reminder?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Yes you can (continue to) save macros to the "old" XLS" format. Graham meant that you cannot save macros in the new default XLSX format. In the new formats you have to explicitly select the XLSM file type if you want to save macros.<br />
<br />
The old, XLS, file type is a "binary" format.&nbsp; Think of it (very) loosely as being similar to a compiled program. The contents cannot be easily read using simple tools like notepad.&nbsp; The new formats, XLSX and XLSM, are "XML based". That means they are primarily
 text based. If you change the file extension to ZIP, ie by simply adding .ZIP to the end of the file name, you can explore the underlying structure of the file. Most of the elements are text based so they can be read by simple programs like notepad.<br />

            <p>Thanks Rohn, I see what you mean. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Graham,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I copied my data from the old XLS file into a new workbook and then did as you suggested by draging and droping the 4 forms and 1 module, however I still did not see any macro after I had saved this new worksheet as an XLSM file type. So I went back into
 it and discovered that I had some code in one of the sheets - this was the code that activated/displayed the first form - I needed to copy and paste this from the old&nbsp;workbook/sheet into the new workbook/sheet and then - lo and behold - when&nbsp;I go into macros
 I see my macro and it all works like a treat. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it looks like one needs to copy the forms, modules and also any code in the sheets - I admit I'm no expert in all this stuff so maybe your earlier feedback implied what I just said or maybe I have some strange code due to my ignorance of how to do these
 things. Anyway thanks for your help.</p>

            ActiveSync 4.5 works fine with XP machines running SP3.&nbsp; If you are having problems, there is something else going on with your ActiveSync connection.&nbsp; The information you are seeing that refers to Activesync requirement SP2 is outdated and was never updated
 when SP3 was rolled out.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you should try deleting your existing ActiveSync connection and try setting it up again.<br />

            That's a good idea!&nbsp; I hope uninstalling the software fixes the problem for you.<br />
<br />
Just so you know.....I upgraded my XP computer with service pack 3 when it first came out (I think this was more than 1-1/2 years ago).&nbsp; All I had to do was delete the old partnership and set it up again and I've never had a problem syncing any of my windows

                    Hi, <br />
<br />
I am using Entourage for Mac 2008. <br />
Colleagues are trying to send me emails but are receiving&nbsp; an Error 550 message stating that my mail server is full. My mail host company which manage the server say that there is nothing in my mailbox which is confirmed when I look at the mail from online.
 Is there a quota of how many emails I can store in Entourage and if so, how can I increase the limit?<br />
<br />
My outbox is also extremely slow at the moment and will often overload. I can only send one email at a time, otherwise it jams up.<br />
<br />
Please help!<br />
<br />
Many thanks.<br />
Mel.<br />

            If your colleagues are receiving this message it indicates your Inbox is full. I'm not sure why your host is not seeing any emails in your Inbox. Have you logged into your account with your browser?<br />
<br />
If you do find messages in your Inbox....<br />
<br />
Move (not copy) messages from our Inbox to folders "On My Computer". This will move them off the server to free up space. The messages will still be available in their new location.<br />
<br />
To raise your limit you'll have to log into your account. Do you have a cPanel access? If yes, navigate to the Email Accounts section. Any account over the limit will show in red. To raise the quoat, click on "Change quota" and raise the limit.<br />
<br />
If all these fail, I suggest you test your account in a new Identity. Under Entourage in the Menu bar select "Switch Identity". Create a new Identity and enter your account.<br />
<br />
I suspect your Inbox is huge. This folder should be kept as clean as possible by moving the messages to a subfolder in your account or move them to "On My Computer" folder.<br />
<br />
It would help to know what type of account? (POP, IMAP, Exchange) and your host provider.<br />

<p>Can I connect&nbsp;external ODBC-compliant databases (Oracle or DB2)&nbsp;to a web database as linked tables and how?&nbsp;Can't find too much info on this matter. Can someone shred some lights on this?</p>

            Access 2010 can only use SharePoint running Access Services. You would have to use Access 2013, but then even that can only use SQL Server.

            <p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. Just want to clarify. Do you mean with Access 2010, I can&nbsp;connect to Access backends only and with Access 2013, I can connect to both Access &amp; SQL Server as backend and nothing else?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are&nbsp;there any write-ups or articles that you can point me to so I can do more research on it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>

<p>You can link to almost any kind of database if you can create an ODBC connection via a DSN file with any version of Access as long as the database is on your network. But an Access&nbsp;web database is different. You can only connect to a SQL database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A really good place to post this question is at The Access Developers forum &nbsp;<a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=accessdev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=accessdev</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know an expert on Access web databases by the name of Albert Kallal. He frequents that forum and can answer much better than I can.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Not recognizing Nokia Lumia 810</h2>
                    <p>Okay. . . Now its come to the point that everything I have tried just does not work. After several weeks searching in this community, I have not found a solution, So here is my problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My windows 8 laptop has not recognized my phone since the Lumia Amber update. I have only been able to transfer files using an SD Card, but I can not keep doing that. I have tried,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Resetting my laptop and my phone</p>
<p>-Using the original data cable and about 5 different ones</p>
<p>-removing my SD card</p>
<p>-cleaned the port on my phone and all the USB ports on my laptop</p>
<p>-using all 3 USB ports, without a USB hub</p>
<p>-connecting it to a Mac laptop and several other windows laptops, running from Xp to 7, and none of them recognize it</p>
<p>-Both my phone and Windows are up to date</p>
<p>-removing and re inserting the battery on my phone and my laptop</p>
<p>-EVERYTIME I open device manager, as I have been told to do before, under both "Portable Devices" and "Other Devices" it is not listed, no matter how many times I scan for hardware changes, nothing happens, and I say that because everyone keeps sending me
 to that link in Microsoft Support "Windows Phone 8 Is Not Detected By Your Computer" I can not even do all that stuff of updating the driver or uninstalling when it doesn't even show up</p>
<p>-I have even had to go to that <a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/</a>&nbsp;website to manually download the 'Windows Phone - Other hardware - WinUsb Device' and extracted and did everything I was told, yet nothing changed</p>
<p>- And I have even uninstalled and reinstalled the synchronization client, which in my case, would be the Windows Phone App</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And after all that, everytime I plug my phone, it charges my phone, but the little pop up of "installing driver" doesn't show up, File Explorer doesn't open, nothing shows up in "Device manager" and the Windows Phone App says I have to connect my phone.
 . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>please, someone help . . . I can no longer think of anything else to do </p>

<h2>            Cannot save any excel file on my mac</h2>
                    
<p>This is becoming increasing frustrating. &nbsp;I personally wish not to use Microsoft products due to all the bugs and hence why have used Mac only since 2008 - but we still use Office applications. &nbsp;Since this morning (all of a sudden) my excel has issues. &nbsp;I
 cannot save, edit or create any new file - it says - you have an issue and please contact admin for help this will be a "read only file".... but there is no body to contact... and when I try to save any document it says "you cannot save here you do not have
 permission". I can save word documents and send emails no problem - it seems to be just excel issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent 3hrs this morning searching online for fixes as others seem to have the issue - I tried signing in and out of office excel and no change. I rebooted many times and no change. &nbsp;I have lost work time and what is worse that this is the phone customer
 service and tech line. &nbsp;I rang Australian line and talked to an Indian... whom had trouble understanding my "Australian" english and took 20mins of my time explaining the issue. Then I was passed told he would pass the issue to the tech team and they would
 call me back within 1hr... that was 10hrs ago! &nbsp;So then I rang the US 24/7 (so called) hotline. I spent 10mins on hold, and then talked to a girl whom asked all the same questions that the Indian guy did and said she would put me straight through to tech support
 this time... She put me through... I waited for 5mins on hold and then it rang only to be told that no body was there now and please leave a message on their voice mail... A small pause... then it was told there is no room on this persons voice mail to leave
 a message....&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want a FIX for something I paying for monthly NOW and I don't want to be shuffled around to terrible phone service that simple wastes more of my time with a non existent tech team. &nbsp;I have a case number created which is: 1********5</p>

<p>I have tried calling your Australian hot line - talked to an Indian (yes Australia) whom could not understand my "English" and I spent 15mins explaining the issue. Then I was he would take it to tech support and they would call me back within an hour - no
 body did. &nbsp;I have now spent over 5hrs of my time trying to fix an issue that seems not fixable where I can suddenly NOT save, edit or create exc</p>

            Since NotePad is opening Word documents (or trying to), something is wrong with file associations. Do the following: Exit Word if it is running. Hold the Windows logo key as you press R; in the Run dialog box, type winword /r and press Enter (note the
 space before the slash). After the configuration has completed, try double-clicking Word document icons again. If it still doesn't work, take a look at

                    I want to sort my data first by Column J and then by Column I un my spreadsheet - I know how to do this manually. How do I get EXCEL to perform the sort automatically? New data in columns A to F, will cause the values in Columns I and J to change. I want
 to see the ranking automatically, when the data changes.

<h3> sheila-smith &#40;contractor&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Infopath 2013 and SharePoint Online - Ability to Turn OFF SP Ribbon</h2>
                    <p>Can someone please help me?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working in SharePoint Online and designing forms in InfoPath 2013. For some reason the functionality of File&gt;Form Options no longer has the ability to turn parts of the SP ribbon OFF. I need to be able to hide these buttons (SAVE and CLOSE) easily as
 I want to use the Submit button on my form in order to be able to email the form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f6d40f9-ae5b-498b-bbe0-4376b80755f6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f6d40f9-ae5b-498b-bbe0-4376b80755f6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I do not want to have to use any coding solutions or SP Designer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has the functionality perhaps moved to a different location of InfoPath?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help answer this question? Thank you so much.</p>

<p><span>The feature “to turn parts of the SP ribbon OFF” you mentioned exists in the InfoPath 2010. It has been removed from the InfoPath 2013 version.</span></p>

<p><span>1. When did the issue happen? What did you do before the issue happened?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Check if you have the active licenses with your account. Could you navigate to Settings&gt;Office 365&gt;Subscriptions and upload a screenshot of the page?</span></p>
<p><span>3. What error messages pops up in this issue? Could you list the steps about how you activate the PowerPoint 2016 for Mac application and upload some related screenshots about the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>Note: remove any private information before uploading the screenshot.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Check if you only can’t activate PowerPoint 2016 for Mac.</span></p>

<h2>            SharePoint Workflows</h2>
                    <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought SharePoint Oline automatically removed workflow history after 90 days; meaning entries/items 90 days older or older would no longer show in the workflow history list. But I see thousands of items which include entries from when the workflow was
 initially started (well over 90 days).</p>
<p>Thank you and please advise,</p>

            We are using 2013 Workflows. When I check the workflow settings (at the Site Collection level, list level and within SharePoint Designer) there is nothing I can change or check for how often the history is dumped. We use SharePoint Online. I checked the
 Admin Center and could not find anything either. But again, it's not dumping the history after 90 days for completed workflows. It still remains after 90 days.

<h2>            Saving sent message in Nokia Communication Centre</h2>
                    If you sent a message with the Nokia Communication Centre. Your sent message will not be saved. Therefore I do not know if it even is sent... Is it possible to save the sent messages?<br />
<br />
&gt; Nokia PC Suite version 7.0.8.2<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nokia Communication Centre version 1.0<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nokia 8600 Luna with Bluetooth connection...

<br />
One way is ...on your phone to have the acknowledgment for sent messages.

            Hi Cricfancy,<br />
<br />
First of all thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
I already marked the option "save sent messages" on my mobile phone, but it still won't save the messages I send with Nokia Communication Centre. Do you have another possibility or solution?

            The way I do this works, but is laborious and time consuming.<br />
<br />
I write the message in Communications Centre, then click SAVE instead of Send. It saves the message to the draft folder of the phone. I then go to that folder in the phone, edit the message, retype the name in the 'To' box, go to Options, scroll up 3 to 'Sending
 Options' and change 'Delivery Report' to yes, and 'Save Sent Message' to yes. Then I go back to the message and send it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I too hope there's a fix coming soon.

<p>just installed Communication Center for my Nokia 3500c and I do have the same issue. Sent messages are not copied anywhere and the deliver report doesn't show up either... I did many tests and all text messages are sent, but it'd indeed be better to have
 it copied in the sent item folder...</p>

<p>this is strange, when I send an SMS from the phone itself it gets copied to the Sent folder (as I enabled the option).</p>
<p>why is it not possible via the NCC? What do you mean by "sent via"?</p>

Windows users click here</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not locate a similar thread with this information. Here are the settings I have discovered to work when setting up your Comcast account in Outlook 2016 for Mac.<br />
<br />
1. Click <strong>Outlook</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences </strong>&gt; <strong>Accounts</strong>, click the '<strong>+</strong>' button &gt;
<strong>New Account</strong>.<br />
2. Type in your <strong>full Comcast email address</strong> and hit <strong>Continue</strong>.<br />
<br />
Type: <strong>IMAP </strong>(probably lists '<strong>POP</strong>' by default)<br />
Email Address: <strong>&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</strong><br />
Username: : <strong>&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</strong><br />
Password: <strong>&lt;Comcast account password&gt;</strong><br />
<br />
Incoming Server: <strong>imap.comcast.net</strong><br />
Port: <strong>993</strong><br />
Use SSL to connect (recommended): <strong>Check/select this option</strong><br />
<br />
Outgoing Server: <strong>smtp.comcast.net</strong><br />
Port: <strong>587</strong><br />
Use SSL to connect (recommended): <strong>Check/select this option</strong><br />
<br />
3. Click <strong>Add Account</strong><br />
4. Click <strong>Done</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this is helpful to fellow Mac users.</p>

            <p>There is very little we can do to help fix Starter, since it is running in a "virtual machine".&nbsp; Repairing is the first thing we can suggest, but it didn't work for you.&nbsp; Support for Starter is supposed to be provided by the computer builder, that is part
 of the contract they signed with MS when they agreed to install it. But most of them just point you at MS.&nbsp; It turns into an exercise in finger-pointing between MS and the builder.&nbsp; About the only other thing you can do to "fix" it is re-install WINDOWS from
 the refresh partition. Starter is included with all of the other factory installed "crapware".&nbsp; Of course that nukes all of you other installed applications and personal data files ....</p>

    <title>Problems with 1 Font in Word, Excel &#38; Powerpoint but NOT in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with 1 Font in Word, Excel &#38; Powerpoint but NOT in Outlook 2011. Why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I installed a special TrueType (PC) font with my signature made back in 1996 by a company no longer in business. The font works fine in Office 2013 for Windows running in Parallels 9 in my MacBook; the shortcut in Windows is Capital A</p>
<p>
</p><p>The information of this font by &nbsp;Font Explorer X Pro in in OS X is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Character Code 61505</p>
<p>Unicode: U+F041</p>
<p>Glyth ID:4</p>
<p>Keystroke:</p>
<p>Unicode Range: Private Use Area</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Font is installed, activated and validated with FontBook and there is no conflicts or duplicates.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The shortcut did not work in Mac native apps or Office 2011 for Mac, so after a few tips from smart people in the forums, I am able to type my signature in 4 different ways. I basically added the F041 to Favorites in Character Viewer and from there I can
 double click or drag &amp; drop to my document, or type a keyboard shortcut ("sig") &nbsp;which will type my signature in the document. Also, I can do it by changing keyboard to Unicode Hex and type Option Key + F041.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that these 4 methods only work in Mac native apps (Mail, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, TextEdit) AND MS Outlook 2011. Even in Adobe Photoshop works well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They DO NOT WORK in Word, Excel or Powerpoint. But it WORKS WELL in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have converted the font to TrueType, OpenType and back to TrueType. I have cleaned the system fonts cache. Nothing works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand there could be problems with fonts in MS Office for Mac, but if the font works well in Outlook, why it does not work well in Word?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion is welcome.</p>
<p>

<p>Problem solved John.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I got a new font working as intended from 1996, with "Capital A" thanks to Kurt Lang, at the Apple Forum.<br />
<br />
He offered to help, asked for my font and wrote me "Rather than trying to figure out how to fix that goofy font, I just copied the glyph into a new blank font, applied the font metrics from the original so they’d be the same, and saved it out as a new font.
 Much easier and faster...I created a new OpenType PostScript font for mediclips and assigned Unicode tags to it. It shouldn't have a problem with it. The glyph is sitting in the assigned spot for 'A". Kurt Lange.<br />
<br />
Now my font is much closer. Character Code 65, Unicode U+0041, Glyph ID 1, Keystroke Capital A, Unicode Range Basic Latin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand what you say about the Outlook text engine being simpler than the other 3 apps and being more "forgiving" of uncommon fonts but it is interesting that the same font has worked well in ALL apps of Windows Office from Office 95 to Office 2013.
 Maybe is different in Office for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thank you for all your valuable suggestions.<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />
<br />
BTW: Kurt Lang has an excellent paper in Font Management in OS X at&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Already answered your earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook is unrelated to the other three applications. &nbsp;Consequently it does not use the text rendering engine used by the others. &nbsp;Unlike the PC, the editor in Outlook is Outlook, not Word.</p>

</p><p>Consequently the text engine in Outlook can't do justification, kerning, ligatures and hanging punctuation. &nbsp;But its simpler rendering engine is more forgiving of uncommon fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry: Read my reply to you yesterday: your best option is to get someone to re-save that font as a TrueType. It only takes a few minutes if you have the software.</p>
