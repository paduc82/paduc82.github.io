    <title>KB2691442 Fails To Install on Windows 7 SP1, 64-bit, due to error code - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            KB2691442 Fails To Install on Windows 7 SP1, 64-bit, due to error code  80070057 &#40;July 13th, 2012&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Is anyone having the same problem with this update? I have a relatively freshly installed O.S. and see no reason (from my side) for this to happen. Still, something may have been affected/infected/changed/altered/deleted in the registry or file system that
 I am unaware of between the time I installed now. The&nbsp;security fix&nbsp;seems rather important as it identifies and patches a vulnerability allowing the remote execution of code. The fix&nbsp;was&nbsp;recently published&nbsp;on July 10th, 2012 (<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms12-048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms12-048</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;The
 error code description: "The parameter is incorrect" is unrevealing. I'm hoping Microsoft will be aware of, and able to fix this.</p>
<p>It may also be helpful to know that a second optional but recommended, seemingly unrelated update is also failing to install: KB2640148 (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2640148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2640148</a>). And it is throwing the
 same error code: 80070057.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            I am running Windows 7 on Inspiron One 2320 which is a touch screen pc, so when my desktop is down, my entire computer is down.&nbsp;When update KB2691442 failed to install, I had to ctrl/alt/delete to get to task manager, and restart from that screen.&nbsp; With
 F8 I was able to do system restore, kill my anti-virus software,&nbsp;find 11&nbsp;recent updates and install them one at a time, rebooting after each until I found KB2691442 caused my desktop to fail.&nbsp; So, I'm up and running, but without that update.&nbsp; Is there a workaround,
 or should I ignore that particular update?

            <p>Thank you Bubba, it's helpful to know that someone is having the exact same issue. I'm hoping this means that the problem is more common, and that Microsoft will issue a revised update that works. I've resigned to giving it another week or so to resolve
 itself (though I am also in the process of moving, so I don't have much time to troubleshoot).</p>
<p>If it's not a problem with the update, then it's a problem with our systems. I'm not sure where to start to identify what features our systems could have in common that would cause this error. Any ideas? I'd like to get more information on the specifics
 of the failure. Shouldn't there be a log somewhere (perhaps hidden)&nbsp;that is sent to Microsoft when an update fails?</p>
<p>If it's maleware, we should be able to pinpoint where in the process the update fails, and perhaps thereby reveal the damage caused by the maleware.</p>
<p>Srimadhwa's suggestions are generic troubleshooting suggetions. I've also tried them without success.</p>

            You might try the System Update Readiness Tool.&nbsp; Of course, get it&nbsp;from Microsoft.&nbsp; It will fix some errors and files in the update system.

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>ReactedLoki39,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can get an Xbox One from the USA, but you may run into issues with the power supply. You may need either some type of power converter, or a new power supply by itself. If there is a power issue I highly recommend getting the power supply and not
 the power converter as you can damage the console. When you setup your account, you will need to set it up for your region (India). You should not purchase Xbox Live gold from the USA as there is a good chance it won't even activate due to the different regions.
 Games are the same way. If you change the region on your account, or purchase USA content while you're in India there is a very good chance you'll run into issues and will end up with a game that is not playable. So I would suggest only buying games and DLC
 from your region's digital store.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Thanks hydro skillet</p>
<p>What if I activate Xbox live gold in USA only and then bring the console to India, will my subscription work? Also the DLC of halo is free with the console so and i have heard that DLC is region free so i guess it should work in India. I have currently set
 my region to USA and i will change it to India after going there.</p>
<p>Power will be a better option i guess because it will cost around only 20 dollars in India.</p>

<p>Hi there! </p>
<p>If your account is an Indian account you cannot activate a USA gold card on it. If you move your account to USA, then activate your account, you may lose gold when you move it back to India. If all of this is for the money, and saving a bit here an there
 in the long run it's not worth it I promise. See the link below as it states other things that can happen when changing the region on your account.

<p>Sounds like your HD is failing or has already failed... &nbsp;From what I know, you have 2 options.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Try reformatting it, you will lose everything, but all marketplace items can be redownloaded.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Buy a new HD, same result as option1, but more expensive.</p>
<p>I would try reformatting first if it were me in your situation...</p>

<p>Hey toadman11! Luckily reformatting the HDD does not void your warranty. I'm afraid it does sound like you need a replacement HDD though. You can order a replacement Xbox 360 Hard Drive from the Xbox Online Service Center at myservice.xbox.com! Note that
 you'll need to register your console first. Let us know how it goes or if you have any questions! :)</p>

 And I need this file on the machine&nbsp; Why would this be?

<p>Sorry it was my typo mistake, the file extension was not<strong> .dll</strong> but rather
<strong>.xll</strong> which was a Sage Payroll Intelligence Reporting file and the problem was caused by the Sage Payroll Intelligence Reporting excel add-in which was trying to launch one of the files with
<strong>.xll</strong> extension every time I was opening an excel file (even a new/blank file). I have disabled the add-in and the problem disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>before figuring the above out I have done the following: opened <strong>Default apps</strong>, then clicking on the
<strong>Reset to the Microsoft recommended defaults </strong>button thinking this was a default app problem, which has re-set all of the files so I needed to re-assign some of the most used files e.g. .pdf&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it's not a disaster, I chose the default programs now again as and when I launch unassigned program file. You can mark this as resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            Cannot move certain files to compressed &#40;zipped&#41; folders Windows 10</h2>
                    Sometimes certain files will not move into a zipped folder when I try to copy/paste them there. I get the file not found or no read permission error followed by a warning that I cannot access the zipped folder.&nbsp; I am an administrator on my computer, I
 have all permissions for the files in question (except special permissions, which is grayed out), and the files are not encrypted, locked, or anything like that. I have tried saving the files under different names, making a new file entirely, etc, but it still
 does not work.

            Did you try dragging and dropping the file onto a zip folder?
<br />
<br />Also, you could try downloading a third party compression utility such as 7-Zip then try opening the zip file then drag and drop your files into it.
<br />
<br />Download - 7-Zip

<h2>            Toshiba Canvio External Harddrive not working.</h2>
                    When I plug in my device, via USB, my computer (running Windows 7 Home) will install the driver, but will not allow me to access the device. In the Device Manager, it shows the harddrive, but doesn't not have a letter assigned, nor will it let me assign
 a letter. I have tried plugging it into other USB ports, uninstalling the driver and reinstalling, unstalling the USB port and reinstalling. When I connect the harddrive to my Dish DVR, the DVR recognizes it. When I connect the device to my computer, it will

That's because it is formatted with some file system your DVR understands.</p>

    <title>Bluetooth from Xbox controller stopped working on windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> remzawi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth from Xbox controller stopped working on windows 10</h2>
                    Hello ! I have an xbox one s controller, and until some time ago I was able to use it normally via bluetooth (I paired it and it connected automatically). However, it suddenly stopped working (but it still works in usb). I tried to connect it to an other
 device and it works perfectly so the problemdoesn't come from the controller. What's more, the device is constantly shown as paired but not connected in settings. If I try to uninstall the device (both from the settings and the devices manager), the driver
 is automatically reinstalled whenever i turn on bluetooth (or reboot with bluetooth on) (even if my controller is off and that there is no way for windows to detect it !) I've tried all solutions that I could find on the net without results. Windows, bluetooth
 driver andcontrollerareall up to date. I've tried multiple bluetooth drivers. I'm on windows 1809 but the problem appeared on windows 1803 (updating didn't solve the issue). Can someone help me ? Thanks.

            <p>Hi HugoCampas, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>I understand how it feels when you try receive error while trying to update the Apps and it doesn’t work properly as expected. I will be happy to help you with this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- What is the exact error message you receive when trying to update Netflix?</div>
<div>- Is the issue confined only with the specific Apps?</div>
<div>-What are the Apps you are trying to update and failed? </div>
<div>- Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> I would also suggest you to try to Reset the Windows Store and check if it helps.</div>
<div>
<p><span>a) Press <strong>Windows key + r</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>b) Type <strong>wsreset.exe</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong> Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter and check.<br />
Follow the steps to run the troubleshooter:<br />
a. Press<strong> Windows key + C </strong>on your keyboard to show the <strong>Charms
</strong>bar.<br />
b. Type <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>and click <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>
under Settings.<br />
c. Now type <strong>Windows update </strong>in the search option.<br />
d. Click on <strong>Windows Update troubleshooter </strong>to run the troubleshooter.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3: </strong>I would also suggest you to refer the article and check if it helps.</div>
<div><strong>What to do if you have problems with an app?</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</strong></a></div>
<div><strong>Method 4: Clean boot<br />
</strong>Perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.<br />
<br />
Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<p>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
<br />
c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.<br />
<br />
d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.<br />
<br />
e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.<br />
<br />
f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.<br />
<br />
g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2: Enable half of the services</strong><br />
a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.<br />
d. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</strong><br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items </strong><br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</strong>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 6: Resolve the problem</strong><br />
After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 7:</strong><br />
<br />
Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</p>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 5:</strong> Disable security software temporarily and check.<br />
Follow the steps to disable security software:<br />
a. Search for the <strong>security software </strong>installed in your computer in the
<strong>Windows 8 search </strong>option.<br />
b. Click on <strong>Settings </strong>tab.<br />
c. <strong>Uncheck </strong>the option to <strong>turn on security software.<br />
</strong>d. Click on <strong>Save changes </strong>button.<br />
e. After <strong>disabling security software</strong>, check if you are able to <strong>

<p><span><span>Welcome to the Skype Community Forum.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It is possible that the contact you're looking for does not have a Skype account. Please make sure to get their correct information
 such as Skype username, email address or phone number </span></span>they registered with.If there’s more than one matching result and you’re not sure which one is
 your friend, right click on one and select <strong>View Profile</strong>. It's like their Skype business card which contains all the details they've added – like a photo, city, country or phone number.</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you have any additional questions or concerns.

<p>Hi Rhiza_E</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. I can search the contact fine on the skype on my smart phone, so the contact details are correct. The Skype on the PC can't search for anything online when I click "Search Skype", only&nbsp;contacts I already added can be searched.</p>

    <title>Watercolor Effect On Fresh Paint on Picture - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dianamoon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Watercolor Effect On Fresh Paint on Picture</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure how to explain this but here goes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I open an image from my computer, or from Bing (it doesn't matter).&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Four options appear on the screen. I choose the one on the extreme left - I believe it is the oil painting option.</p>
<p>3. I used to simply click on the image and the FP palette would appear. Now it takes a bit of doing, but never mind, I manage to bring up the palette.</p>
<p>4. The default brush is the watercolor brush. I use this.</p>
<p>5. I cannot get the watercolor brush to show up on the image. It shows up on the canvas, which is in the "back" of the imported image. But it disappears when the brush hits the image.</p>
<p>6. If I switch to the oil painting tool, that works - on the image. But not the watercolor tool.</p>
<p>7. The pencil tool works.</p>
<p>8. The oil bar tool works.</p>
<p>9. If I erase a spot on the image, the watercolor tool will work over that - but not on the image itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is happening?</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 install problems on MacBook pro</h2>
                    I'm attempting to install windows 7 on macbook pro version 10.6.8 &nbsp;Snow Leopard. After installing the Windows 7 DVD and starting installation through boot camp assistant the computer restarts goes to a black screen and then has the numbers one over the
 number 2 and under that it states select CD ROM boot type . I can not type anything in. The keyboard either freezes or is not recognized. &nbsp;I'm not sure.

 Unfortunately, this security measure can sometimes mistakenly block nonthreatening programs, like GameGuard, causing Error 380 to appear.</p>
 on for better online protection. With GameGuard properly updated, Error 380 will not reoccur unless GameGuard releases a new patch that requires further updating. If a new patch is released for download, repeat these steps to update and remove Error 380 again.</p>

<h2>            Life is Strange episodes not downloading through game on 360.</h2>
                    
<p>I bought the Life is Strange Season Pass (I own Ep.1) and went into the in-game menu and tried downloading it through there but when I clicked on the download button nothing happened and now it just says downloading and it won't let me re-click it so it's
 now stuck 'downloading' but nothing is actually downloading.</p>
<p>I've deleted everything associated with the game, cleared the cache and re-downloaded everything and it is the same.</p>
<p>Any ideas how to fix it?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, it is possible for a person to log into multiple devices using a single account at the same time.
</p>
<p>

<h2>            Programa Programas Compatibilidad Aplicaci&#243;n Aplicaciones</h2>
                    Hola. Uso mucho para mi trabajo un programa mexicano que se llama Neodata y es el paquete de Precios Unitarios 2007. En windows vista funcionaba perfectamente pero en esta computadora nueva que compre no. Los errores son:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1- El programa usa un hardwere lock en USB para corroborar que es original y si no lo detecta al inicio manda un mensaje de que trabajará en modo visor. A pesar de que le pongo el hardwere lock, no lo detecta y no me permite trabajar en el.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2- Aunque fuera el caso que no tuviera yo el hardwere lock, el programa deberia abrir correctamente un archivo, solo que no me dejaria modificarlo, pero no es el caso; no lo abre correctamente. Por ejemplo, un presupuesto de obra que hce que era por 2,6
 millones de pesos, me arroja 276 millones, o sea que altera demasiado las cantidades.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Espero me apoyen porque es mi programa de trabajo de todos los dias. Ironicaente, estoy trabajando mejor con una compu viejita pentium IV con windows xp que con una nuevecita con windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
