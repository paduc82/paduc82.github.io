<h2>            How to open documents after MyPhone sync</h2>
                    MyPhone sync's both my Mobile OneNote notes and my Notes from WM6. The problem is once they are on my PC there is no way to view them. Notes (.pwi) are jiberish when I open them from any Office 2007 program and I can't open my OneNote (.1sp) notes from
 my OneNote 2007 application on my PC.&nbsp; OneNote says "Files from other applications cannot be opened".&nbsp; How do I open a .1sp file in OneNote 2007 and/or a .pwi file on my PC? Ideally associate the files with the native applications on my PC.&nbsp; It worked fine
 with Activesync since it had built in converters but that functionality went away with Vista and the new Sync Center and also seems to be lacking with MyPhone.<br />
<br />
Windows Vista Home Premium SP2<br />
Office 2007 w/Outlook &amp; OneNote and everything else<br />
<br />

            MyPhone application does not control how the OneNote files are stored and opened. It just syncs the OneNote files to the server and back to the client.
<br />
<br />
Since you have .1sp file which is OneNote Mobile you will need the OneNote mobile application to be installed on the PC you are trying to open the file.<br />
ActiveSync does this automatically, but in your Vista PC you need to have WMDC and when you cradle your device through USB, OneNote mobile will be installed. Check if has been installed in Programs/Features under ControlPanel. You should be able to open .1sp
 file now.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<h2>            Uncceptable changes to e-mail</h2>
                    <p>you loaded new software on my PC.&nbsp; You always says things like you are making it better.&nbsp; It is not better and is not efficient.&nbsp; Problems are:</p>
<p>1. increased the display size of screen and I do not seem to be able to reduce to a normal font size.</p>
<p>2. if display message and want to take no action, can no longer use escape to get back to list of messages.&nbsp; If in the other category, you have to hit inbox, then other and resume.&nbsp; Therefore I have have two actions when I used to use only one action.&nbsp; Therefore
 greatly inefficient.</p>
<p>3. I do not need you to tell me how may other messages I have, just display.</p>
<p>4. I found out how to get the date headers out.</p>
<p>5. My question is what makes you think you know better than I do what I want.&nbsp; &nbsp;You are mistaken.&nbsp; Not all change is good.</p>
<p>Do your developers have nothing more to do than dream up changes.&nbsp; Give me a break.&nbsp; Poor customer service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now please me a solution for items 1, 2, 3 above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I work with your Improved (laugh out loud) product, I am sure I will find other deficiencies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my screen is jumping sizing and I am touching nothing.&nbsp; Your software is terrible.</p>

            No one loaded new software on your PC. Outlook.com is a web site. It's not on your PC. It's on Microsoft's server.
<br />
<br />Yes, Microsoft changed the user experience for Outlook.com. My guess is that they wanted it to look similar to their mobile program. That's their right, since they own the software. It's your right to use a different service if you don't like the one Microsoft provides, but you can also tell them what you think by clicking the Help icon (the question mark) at the right end of the menu bar and choosing "Give feedback" in the menu that opens.
<br />
<br />I'm not all that enamored of the new interface, either, but there's nothing that can be done about it, other than to use a different service. Also, we're not Microsoft here. We're users like yourself who are mostly very familiar with Microsoft's products and can help you use it as best as it's possible, but sometimes, one cannot do what one wishes if the features are no longer available.
<br />
<br />For the font size, try reducing the zoom factor in your web browser.
<br />
<br />I can't reproduce the conditions you describe in 2). When I wish to take no action on a message, all I do is click the folder name to return to where I was. One click.
<br />
<br />Can you provide a screen shot of 3)? When I open the Inbox, it doesn't tell me how many messages I have, it just shows me the message list.
<br />
<br />For 4) are you asking how to suppress the date information? Do you have the Reading Pane at the bottom, the right, or off? Are you using conversation view or messages view?
<br />
<br />For 5), no matter what change is made, even if 99% of people love it, someone won't like it (not to say that most like the recent change; I have no idea what percent do and don't like it). Submit your feedback if you want Microsoft to know.

<br />1. increased the display size of screen and I do not seem to be able to reduce to a normal font size.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />When you changed the display size, do you mean the windows display % or the zoom level in the browser? As far as I know, you can't change the fonts, other than by changing the Zoom setting in the browser. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />2. if display message and want to take no action, can no longer use escape to get back to list of messages.  If in the other category, you have to hit inbox, then other and resume.  Therefore I have two actions when I used to use only one action.  Therefore greatly inefficient.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />If you go into settings, general, configuration, does changing the shortcuts work?  The supported shortcuts are in the screenshot - Esc should work. (It didn't work for me, but that could be user-error. :))

<h2>            OneNote 2016 to Office 365</h2>
                    <p>I recently received an update to Office 365 and it deleted my older version of OneNote that was on my laptop. I run Windows 10 and have for a couple of years and had both OneNote 2013 and Office 365 running on the computer. I have one large notebook I was
 using on the old version that will not open on the new version, I get an error code and it closes down when I attempt to convert. I also find I cannot simply add an older version of OneNote to my computer while still having Office 365 on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>what can I do?</p>

<p><span>Windows Defender should only be running in its Limited Periodic Scanning mode if McAfee is installed. If Defender is actually running with its real-time protection enabled, then you should either
 uninstall McAfee, and then reinstall it ‚Äì or else just uninstall it and let Windows Defender take over.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If we bring things up to date; and if we follow the best evidence we have, then Windows Defender is mostly likely better than any other free AV app ‚Äì and probably as good as anything out there:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And remember that the AV-Comparatives Real-World Protection Test is performed with the default settings for all of the AV apps that are tested ‚Äì so if you want to scale up that 100% protection

<h2>            10240 v 10525 what are we testing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Having nothing but problems with 10525, but think I've found why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10525 is not an upgrade from 10240 but a cut down version with changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I know that?????? Change the speech language in settings ( all you get is English (USA)),</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either give us a full version plus changes or nothing at all, how is this a test for putting things live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are having a laugh!!!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>here is part of the posted article&nbsp; and the above will give you the whole article</p>
We do have a few known issues with this build.
<p>Part of the fun of being a Windows Insider is getting to tinker with prerelease software before the rest of the world, but you should be very aware as an Insider that prerelease software will come with bugs and things that are incomplete. Make sure you know
 and accept what you‚Äôre opting in to when you join the program, and of course make sure to back up all of your personal data before you begin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile hotspot doesn‚Äôt work in this build. When sharing the Internet from your device with mobile broadband using Mobile Hotspot, it will fail to get a valid IP address from your device and will show no internet access.</li><li>An update to Movies &amp; TV application from the Store will be required to fix an issue with video playback.</li><li>Optional languages packs will not be available during the initial launch of this flight, it will be available later this week.</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>I thought there was something else I was missing, more info would help with some of the testing as at times it seems to be going backwards, just don't want to report on things that are already known about.</p>
<p>

                    I keep getting "An error occurred while downloading attachment" using yahoo mail with explorer 10 in windows 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;I only get this with the ones that have attachment and not ALL of them either.&nbsp; I can say about 10 to 15 out of 100 emails. I contacted yahoo
 and they are telling me its not their problem its with explorer and I need to contact Microsoft to get this error fixed.&nbsp; I also tried Firefox and I am getting the same error message. I have also deleted ALL cookies, temp files and history and got the same
 results. Anyone have a solution to this problem?

    <title>How to delete all endnote add in for Word&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lui.e  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to delete all endnote add in for Word&#63;</h2>
                    I downloaded EndNote and tried the free trial while I was writing my thesis. I was able to use the add in for Word. It was quite useful and I liked it. However, I didn't need it past thesis writing so I deleted it. I cannot seem to completely delete the
 add in, and as soon as I open Word, an error message for EndNote add in pops up.<br />
<br />
I have opened the template and add in window and there is one remaining add in that cannot be deleted. The "-" option is grayed out and unavailable. I even deleted my Office 365 and re-installed it, and the problem still persists.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to take it off completely?

<h2>            Office 365 ATP Safe Links detects our url&#47;domain accidentially as malicious</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we have the problem that for some reason the Office365 ATP Safe Links Feature classifies our Url as malicious.</p>
<p>As we have a SaaS company thats really a big problem because users are warned when they click on our welcome mails for example.</p>
<p>On top of that most emails from us are flagged as spam.</p>
<p>The problem occured 2 days ago. Nothing changed at our side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I already opened a ticket for that but no response till now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my questions:</p>
<p>-How can I remove our domain from the List of untrusted links globally (local whitelisting is no option of course)</p>
<p>-How can I get to know why our url is considered as malicious?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p><span>Hi Andreas Schr,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your PM. However, I can't get the email you provided since I haven't registered the url. Anyway, it is recommended that you provide the email (with the "malicious" url) as an .msg file in
 the PM if it is needed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, since the recipient side (Office 365 user) marked the email as spam, I suggest you contact the recipient side to add your domain account as his safe sender to see if it helps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>By the way, as you have opened a ticket, please provide the ticket number (Service Request number) in the PM so that we can go through the whole situation and help strike the engineer who is handling
 the case for moving forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Alan</span></p>

<br />If you intend sending that to a commercial printers to be printed, then 300dpi is the expected resolution by most printers
<br />
<br />What resolution do you need the resulting PDF file to be?

    <title>Nokia N900 and OVI OTA support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adomeij  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia N900 and OVI OTA support</h2>
                    
<p>From browsing the 'internet' (aka googling) I've found numrous topics in various forums complaining that OVI (Sync et al) don't suppot the Nokia N900.</p>
<p>I've just purchased a N900 and feel obligated to join those that complain.</p>
<p>The N900 is yet another Nokia phone that i have purcahsed after starting with a Nokia 2110 (in the pioneer days of GSM vs NMT).</p>
<p>And -- NO Nokia engineers --, I don't have an Outlook server that PC-Suite might be able to sync my phone with, what the h*ll do you think i bought a Linux-based phone for????</p>
<p>I keep finding myself owning 'the latest and greatest' from Nokia and always lacking support from such 'advanced' models.</p>
<p>So the the reason for this topic is simple :</p>
<p><strong>I want commitment from Nokia to support all the 'Symbian' -&gt;OVI OTA (over the air) support for my new n900, just as I've had for my Nokia 5800!! AND I WANT IT NOW.</strong></p>
<p>If Nokia is to chicken to commit to such suport -- publish the OVI specs for do-it-yourself versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect that the Maemo community can produce apps for OVI OTA in a jiffy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I'll even apologize in advance if the above mentioned specs already are publically available)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS</p>
<p>Somebody with the knowlwdge and yearnig might even start a facebook community with thesee demands, since it seems like the only thing to do these days to get (big) corporations to listen to thier (small) customers.</p>
<p>DS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PSS</p>
<p>Come on Nokia-- what's the problem???</p>

<p>im not sure what youre trying to say by ovi ota.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>updates are available 'ota'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ovi store works. you can just download stuff from it 'ota'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the maemo community does make apps, they just arent on the ovi store. if you want most of the other apps, just run the application manager on your phone and choose download. all the apps are there, if you want the development and testing apps, you'll have
 to add their catalogues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>with the recent qt support being released, its now up to developers to decide whether they want symbian apps to work on maemo as well. the main issue is that symbian and maemo are completely different aside from the new qt framework. that and most of the
 symbian apps run on java. maemo doesnt use java because java hasnt really been that great for a fairly long time. sure there are plenty of games for symbian, but from the ones ive tried, id rather stick to the few games and emulators we have on the n900.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>an ovi suite that supports the n900 is currently in the beta phase. it works fairly well for me. full release is a few weeks away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so from what i see, you have no real problems with the device. you just arent familiar with how to use it yet.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>Everything has been updated. I turned off my computer and now it's back to normal, but it's the second time I've had to do that recently and it is quite inconvenient because I use Skype for work.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have the latest version according to Skype and that is Skype for Mac Version 7.58 (501)</p>
<p>MacOS Sierra version 10.12.6</p>
<p>If I uninstall Skype will I lose my contacts? I have like 800 and they are mostly working contacts, so important not to lose them.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,</p>
<p>

    <title>Auto update date field is not being updated in Office Online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abisankasarkar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto update date field is not being updated in Office Online Application</h2>
                    
<p>I am presently having an issue with Office 365 online services in SharePoint Office 365 environment. I have a document management system in SharePoint Office 365 where I have MS Office 2013 and MS Office 2003 (MS Word, MS Excel and MS PowerPoint). All the
 documents have an auto update date field in the footer area as well as in the body of the text. When I open these files in different dates from my local machine the date field is showing the current system date perfectly. But if I open the files published
 in SharePoint using Office 365 Online applications (like Word Online, Excel Online, Power Point Online) the date fields are showing inconsistent behaviour. Sometimes the dates are being updated and shows the current system date, but most of the time the documents
 show an older date. But when I download the document on my local PC or Print them, the dates get updated properly with the current system date.</p>
<p>This is driving me crazy. I really need the auto update fields to be working correctly in Office Online. What am I missing? Could someone please help?</p>
<p>Abisanka</p>

<p>hi abisanka,<br />
<br />
based on my experience, when i click to view a word file that containing an <em>auto update date field</em> in sharepoint site, it will display the current date and time. however, when i edit it with word online, it will always remain the original when it‚Äôs
 inserted. <br />
considering the feature is not listed in the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office-online-service-description.aspx#bkmk_featureavailabilityo365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
office online service description</a>, it should be a normal behavior. for more advanced features, it‚Äôs recommended to use the
<strong>open in word</strong> command.<br />
<br />
according to your description, the dates are sometimes updates. to further look into the situation, please upload a screenshot that shows the date and time is updated when editing in office online.<br />
<br />
to upload a screenshot, click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> just under the textbox, then click this icon<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba8bd219-b20c-4042-8806-3300a8486d0e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba8bd219-b20c-4042-8806-3300a8486d0e" /></a>
 to insert images.<br />

<p>hi jiaxing,</p>
<p>i am aware that the <i>auto update date field</i> in word online retains its creation/first upload date when the document is opened using word online as you had mentioned.</p>
<p>this is not my concern as my users will not have the privilege to edit a document. so they will not face this issue. let me explain my problems in the steps below with screenshots.</p>
<p><b>step 1</b></p>
<p>user clicks on a document on <i>12<sup> </sup>october </i>2015 (system date) from my sharepoint document library. the document opens using word online in a new tab page. refer to the date field 6<sup>th</sup> october 2015. the date is not getting updated.
 expected date was <i>12 october 2015. refer to the screenshot below.</i></p>
<p><i><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6ace1320-314b-47e1-87ad-733189d87f0b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6ace1320-314b-47e1-87ad-733189d87f0b" /></a><br />
</i></p>
<p><b>step 2</b></p>
<p>though the user will not have privilege to do this but to check i tried the following steps. i opened the document in edit mode using
<i>edit document -&gt; edit in word online</i> option.</p>
<p>i could see the date field i had inserted in the document originally on 24<sup>
</sup>september 2015. as you had mentioned, this date when i had inserted retains the old date. but this is not my concern as the application users will not be able to do this step. please refer to the screen shot below.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ddca083-daec-4674-b7f5-f2199504372a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ddca083-daec-4674-b7f5-f2199504372a" /></a></p>
<p><b>step 3</b></p>
<p>once i had opened the document <i>edit document -&gt; edit in word online, </i>close the document edit mode and again open the document from the sharepoint document library as in step 1, the date gets updated automatically. refer to the same document below
 after being opened in edit mode then closed and then opened for view only. the date is updated to 12 october 2015.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58d9498c-a3ad-4075-ae01-04309a628587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58d9498c-a3ad-4075-ae01-04309a628587" /></a></p>
<p>my requirement is that, whenever a user opens a document from sharepoint document library in view mode using word online, this date field should always display the current system date.</p>
<p>furthermore if i print the document the print out has the current system date that is 12<sup>
</sup>october 2015 printed in it (despite an old date being shown in the view mode).</p>

<p>Hi Abisanka,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your detailed reply.<br />
<br />
After further looking into the issue, we find it‚Äôs an expected behavior that the date &amp; time displayed in view mode will only change after editing because the view mode is a preview of your last editing in Word Online, and the behavior happens in SharePoint
 Online and OneDrive for Business.<br />
<br />
When printing a document, it will get the time from your computer instead of the Internet. So it always displays the current time.<br />
<br />
Regarding the situation, you can submit your requirement via <a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273492-sites-and-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Thanks for your understanding.<br />

            <p>Here the cell in question is cell B9 which has a validation List.&nbsp; Once B9 is selected, the User must enter a value from the List.&nbsp; If the User tries to leave the cell without making a choice from the List, the Event macro issues a message and puts the User
 back on B9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Install the following Event macro in the worksheet code area:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dim Trap As Boolean<br />
Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
Dim B9 As Range<br />
Set B9 = Range("B9")<br />
If Trap Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Target.Address &lt;&gt; "$B$9" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If B9.Value = "" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "enter a value in B9"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B9.Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trap = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trap = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Target.Address = "$B$9" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trap = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End If<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Because it is worksheet code, it is very easy to install and automatic to use:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. right-click the tab name near the bottom of the Excel window<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. select View Code - this brings up a VBE window<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. paste the stuff in and close the VBE window</p>
<p>If you have any concerns, first try it on a trial worksheet.</p>
<p>If you save the workbook, the macro will be saved with it.</p>
<p><br />
To remove the macro:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. bring up the VBE windows as above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. clear the code out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. close the VBE window</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting this question. As I understand you are trying to export the distribution list into Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no option available to export the distribution list into Outlook. The contacts must be exported as a CSV file and then imported into Outlook. During exporting,&nbsp; distribution list will not exported as a group. Instead it will be exported as a single
 contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the suggestions by 'Diane' from the following link and check if this workaround helps:</p>

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the response, you would think Microsoft would have the same thing in outlook 2010 where you can grab a outlook item ......
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ended up doing it manually, one contact at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dianne's post at slipstick was helpful, I did some testing and was ale to copy names and emails from a csv. file and then add them to a distribution group -- so that was pretty kool.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but ... how do you export a distribution group into a csv fle, because when&nbsp;you export contacts into a csv file -- it does all the contacts, not just&nbsp;the distribution group......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but thanks for you help</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Outlook 2010, you can insert an Outlook item and send as an attachment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open a New mail message &gt; Click on Insert &gt; Outlook Item &gt; Choose the desired item and send it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you export a distribution list, it will be exported as a list of individual contacts. The workaround will be to send it as an Outlook attachment or the workaround suggested by 'Diane'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps you.</p>

<h2>            Lumia Denim available for HK Lumia 1520 but it won&#39;t update</h2>
                    
<p>I have an unlocked Lumia 1520 from Hong Kong and have been waiting for the Lumia Denim update. About a week ago the official Microsoft availability page started listing Denim as being available for the Hong Kong variant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en/mobile/support/software-update/wp8-software-update/wp8-availability-in-asia-pacific/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en/mobile/support/software-update/wp8-software-update/wp8-availability-in-asia-pacific/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naturally I went and checked phone update but when I check for updates it thinks none are available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And no, I have never even gone near preview for developers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was wondering why my phone thinks there is nothing available when Microsoft lists the update as being out for my country variant, unlocked 1520?</p>

    <title>Inactivate task feature not working as expected - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Inactivate task feature not working as expected</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I am using Project Pro 2013.&nbsp; I noticed that the inactivate task feature is not working for me as expected.&nbsp; When I inactivate the "Test correlation" task as shown in the attached images, the dependency of the following "Product testing" task to the
 "Test correlation" is not removed.&nbsp; Is this behavior expected?&nbsp; I believed that the inactivate task function would effectively remove all dependencies to other tasks, but this does not appear to be the case.</p>
<p>In my example below, "Product testing" does not move to 10/21 when the "Test correlation" is inactivated.&nbsp;
 Instead, the task only moves to 11/4, which is the start of the inactivated "Test correlation" task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If dependencies are retained, and only the durations of inactive tasks is removed, then the inactivate task is not a useful feature for me.</p>

            Hi Julie - Thanks for the response.&nbsp; I spent more time with a simple project to understand the effect of inactivating a task.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think that the behavior may have changed between Project 2010 and Project 2013 (but I no longer have Project 2010 to confirm).&nbsp;
 I believe in Project 2010, when a task was inactivated, the duration was set to zero
 changing the dependencies.&nbsp; Regards - Jeff

            <p>Jeff,</p>
<p>Pardon me for jumping in. I first looked at your post last night but without knowing your calendar and setting for "hours per day" it became to much of a guessing game to try and emulate what you show. Those pieces of data would be really helpful. I was
 grateful thought that you did show us there were no constraints on your tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, your memory of how this plays out in Project 2010 is not quite right. Duration is not set to zero and the dependencies are still intact although their effect is removed (see screenshot below).</p>
<p>

            Hi John - I saw a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwhEaPA1lUA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Jeff,</p>
<p>My example was a short form for Bill's video, so yes, I got the exact same thing as Bill's example with Project 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I don't have Project 2013 so I'll have to turn it back over to Julie for comments thereon. However, I suspect the behavior in Project 2010 is faulty and it was consequently fixed in Project 2013. Why? Because in the example, if Task C is driven
 by Task B and Task B is driven by Task A, if Task B is inactivated I would logically expect Task C to inherit the predecessor to Task B. In Project 2010, it does not, but it appears that in Project 2013 it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I would think that the way Project 2013 handles this scenario would be of more use to you than the way Project 2010 handles it but in your initial post you indicate that is not the case but I don't understand why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

            <p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your task Product testing has two predecessors: Receive Parts and Test Correlation both in a F to S relationship with Product testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I inactivate Test Correlation, Product Testing does not lose all predecessors - only the relationship to Test Correction it still has a F to S with Receive parts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In both Project 2010 (14.0.7173.5000) and Project 2013 (15.4589.1000) I see the exact same result. &nbsp;Product testing is scheduled after the finish of Receive parts &nbsp;or Oct 21 given your scenario. &nbsp;But that is because of the two predecessors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why it doesn't get scheduled for Oct 21 in your world, I don't know - hence my question about calendars and John's questions about constraints.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the simpler scenario A is linked to B and B is linked to C - all F to S. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In Project 2010:</p>
<p>When I inactivate B, Task C because it now has no predecessors moves back to the start date of the project.</p>
<p>In Project 2013:</p>
<p>When I inactivate B, Task C "inherits" the predecessor to B and is now scheduled to the finish date of A.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want Project 2013 to act like 2010, click the task you intend to make inactive, click the Unlink tasks command to remove all predecessors and successors to the selected task. &nbsp;Then inactivate.</p>

<p>What is the point of having the checkbox in the first place if you have to UNCHECK it
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is offering a "<em><strong>setting</strong></em>" which is not a "<em><strong>setting</strong></em>" it is a
 to take extra unnecessary steps.</p>
<p>The reason I put this post on the Microsoft Forum was to see if anyone at Microsoft would actually defend this silly design of offer to change it or explain some other way to
 make the <em><strong>setting</strong></em> an actual <em><strong>setting</strong></em>.</p>

            <p>I reported Arshad's reply as an abuse. He seems to have made you angry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't work for Microsoft and can't speak for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your observations are correct. There is no preference in Outlook that controls Spelling and Grammar. There is a forum specially devoted to feature requests. You can post a suggestion that Spelling and Grammar options be offered:</p>
<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook for Mac</a>
<p>
</p><p>A work-around would be to compose your email in Word's web layout view, then, in Word use File &gt; Share &gt; As HTML to bring the message into Word. Word lets you turn spelling and grammar off in its preferences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another work-around is to compose your email in any editor of your choice, then use copy and paste and paste into the message body of an email.</p>
