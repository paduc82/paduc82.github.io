<h2>            Outlook 2013 won&#39;t display &#42;new&#42; contacts, but search finds them</h2>
                    <p>Newly-built system with Windows 10 Pro (purchased) and Office 2013.&nbsp; Outlook 2013 data files were imported from the old system and all has seemed fine but...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two new contacts were added yesterday.&nbsp; They do not show up in the main People display in Outlook, and they do not show up in the window Address Book: Contacts but...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A "Search All Contact Items" search *does* find them.&nbsp; When addressing an email, "Check Names" with partial name of new contact filled in *does* find them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advice I've found online generally refers to earlier versions of Outlook - I can't follow it all the way through.&nbsp; The one thing I haven't tried is deleting and re-creating my Outlook profile... I have ~15 email addresses and dozens of rules, hope I don't
 have to do that!</p>

<p>
</p><p>#1 - how many contact folders do you have in your profile?</p>

            <p>Thanks Karl. &nbsp;There is one contacts folder referenced in my profile. &nbsp;It contains all of my pre-existing contacts, no problem, but I'm not sure where the data is located... is it in the .PST file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The C:\Users\Current User\Contacts folder on this built-from-scratch machine is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not use the default location for Outlook files... I have always used a folder "Outlook" in Documents, which is backed up daily. &nbsp;In building the new computer I simply copied the folder onto it, told Outlook to use the PST file in that folder, and everything
 seemed to fall into place. &nbsp;Until I added a new contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook insists on creating another folder "Outlook Files" in Documents, and if I forget when setting up an account to tell it to send email to my usual PST file it will create a file in that folder (pita!) and add it to Outlook's choices. &nbsp;However that
 folder is empty now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook, if I select Properties for My Contacts &gt; Contacts, the properties window shows Location as "\\Mark Current". &nbsp;That's not a folder on the computer, but it is the name of my main/current PST file. (Not the file name, but the name by which Outlook
 references it.) The Outlook Address Book tab in the Properties dialog shows that address book "Contacts" is selected to "Show this folder as an email address book"; the checkbox cannot be un-selected. &nbsp;The form will allow me to change the name and Apply and
 OK, but the name doesn't actually change, it remains the same when I return to the form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Address Books tab in the Account Settings dialog has one entry, Microsoft Outlook Address Book. &nbsp;If I indicate I want to change that, it shows the address book as "Contacts: Mark Current".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I tell you? &nbsp;Thanks for trying to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Thanks SGRPTL but the several other views selected following your advice did not contain the new contacts.)</p>

<p>
</p><p>#1 - What type (POP, Imap, Exchange) of email account is configured?</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Re: where your default contact folder is located is determined by the default data file</p>
<p>
</p><p>From OL menu --&gt; File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - If this involves a POP account - then there would have been no need to import anything - just needed to use the existing PST file</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/212fe545-5824-4c5e-8f73-2cbd50835cbc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/212fe545-5824-4c5e-8f73-2cbd50835cbc" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 - Contact folders are always stored in a data store either PST or OST depending on email account and configuration. Never contained on their own in a Windows folder like &lt;C:\Users\Current User\Contacts&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>#5 - Just to confirm since I'm getting a little lost with all of this - when you say the new contacts go missing - are you explicitly referring to that these contacts do not exist in the one
<strong>and only</strong> contact folder in your profile OR that these do not appear in the AddressBook? Are all the other contacts showing in the AddressBook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>#6 - The default contact folder would not have the option enabled to "Show as an email address book" since that's set by default and can't be changed</p>
<p>
</p><p>#7 - Just a sidenote - contacts that do not have a valid email address or fax# will not appear in the AB but would exist in the contact folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can find your contacts - they exist in a contact folder.</p>

<p>
</p><p>#2 Shows the actual physical location of my PST files (current and archives)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 That's what I've done; simply copied my *own* Outlook data folder (I keep it under Documents) containing all PST files from the old computer to the new computer. &nbsp;Then attached my current/active PST file to Outlook under Accounts &gt; Data Files and made
 it the default and restarted Outlook. &nbsp;Then removed Outlook's original default empty PST file from Accounts &gt; Data Files and later deleted the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 OK, thx, then my contacts are in the PST file mentioned in #3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#5 All of my hundreds of contacts appear just fine EXCEPT two new ones that were added after the new computer was up and running (and after #3 data file changes above). &nbsp;Those two do not appear in any of the regular Contacts views, and they do not appear
 in the Address Book if I open it. &nbsp;I have one and only one contacts folder / address book. HOWEVER if I do a Search in the Contacts view (by entering partial name in the Search box at upper right) or if I enter partial name and ask Outlook to complete an email
 address when creating an email message, Outlook finds the two new contacts and displays their information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#6 The default contact folder DOES have the checkbox enabled to "Show as an email address book" but it is grayed-out and cannot be changed. &nbsp;(The properties window where that checkbox appears *seems* to allow me to change the name of the address book but
 it doesn't get changed, it remains the same when I return to the properties window.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#7 The contacts do not appear in *either* contacts or address book. &nbsp;Neither has a fax # but at least one of them has a valid email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could this have anything to do with Windows 10 security? &nbsp;The new computer was built from scratch with new installations of all software, not restored from a backup (only user data files were restored). &nbsp;While Windows username and password are the same as
 used on the old computer, I know that under the covers Windows does not consider them to be the same identity. &nbsp;I've had no other trouble using software or my files, but wonder if this could be related to what I'm seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your patience and effort Karl.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Going to suggest that you create a NEW Outlook profile (new = starting from scratch - not copying an existing one and making changes to it) and set each POP account to point to the desired PST file when it gets configured. One item that was missing from
 your description in item #3 was changing the "delivery" location for each POP account (which may have simply been an oversight). At the end of this exercise,
<strong>there should only be one data file configured in the profile</strong> - you can worry about any other PST files afterwards. Your contacts should also show in the AddressBook. Once done, add a new contact and see if you're encountering the same problem.
 (Actually, I'd save some time and only configure on POP account for the sake of this test).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In terms of item #2 - purpose of that was to identify which folder tree in the Outlook Nav pane contains the "default contact folder"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would also suggest that you run ScanPST on your original PST file to exlcude the possibility of any underlying errors in the PST file (but honestly, doubt that this would be the cause of whatever is going on)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could this be W10 security related? If it is - it would be a new one on me since security has nothing to do with the saving of individual items within an Outlook pst file.</p>

    <title>Is it possible to create an html signature in the new outlook.com&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> old schoolfabrications  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to create an html signature in the new outlook.com&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My outlook.com (firefox) was updated with a new look earlier this week and I can no longer find the option to add a email signature using html. I can of course locate signature settings, but the options appear to have been streamlined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to update my signature using html in this new version of outlook.com, or alternatively a way to revert back to the older version temporarily so that I can update it that way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be most appreciated. </p>

            <p>Holding the Shift key does a 'Safe Launch' of the program. It bypasses any add-ins [e.g., EndNote &amp; customization] as well as the current Normal.dotm template &amp; Word .plist (preferences) file. That's why none of your macros were available... they're stored
 in your Normal.dotm template. Your result indicates only that the issue is caused by one of those 3 components, but does nothing to identify which one.</p>

</p><p>Your mention of the existence of macros throws yet another contender into the fray. It's entirely possible that one of them could be at fault. What are they designed to do? Are they newly created in this version of Office or were they brought forward from
 a prior version? Is there any other customization, such as Toolbars or menu modification?</p>

<p>Apps are made by other companies. When they make an app, you need to create a different version of it for each operating system. If an app doesn't exist for windows phone, it means that whoever makes that app has decided not to make a windows phone version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>app stores are marketplaces where companies publish their own apps - Microsoft can't force anyone to make an app for the windows store.</p>

<p>Not enough potential users is the main reason.</p>
<p>Some&nbsp;developers&nbsp;will refuse to support Microsoft platforms, regardless of how successful it may be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>summing this up: want a specific app? speak to whoever makes it. if companies don't see a demand, they will not make apps.</p>

<h3> joelnelson- &#91;o365&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive installation from &#34;My Software&#34; is still 2013 version</h2>
                    
<p>When will the OneDrive installation under "My Software" in Office 365 user settings be the 2016 version? As of April 11, 2016 it is still the 2013 version which cannot be installed alongside Office 2016.</p>
<p><br />
We provide Active Directory access, Exchange email and access to OneDrive for Business and Sharepoint (Essentials tier) to all contractors, but only provide Office software to full employees. Under the 2013 software, this was not a problem - they provided their
 own Office installation, and I supplemented it with the OneDrive for Business installation from the My Software page.&nbsp; But now we have a new contractor with 2016 software. He cannot install OneDrive for Business from the My Software page as instructed because
 it is still downloading the 2013 version which cannot install alongside 2016.</p>
<p>I see Microsoft is aware of an issue based on this KB article - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3098502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3098502</a> - but neither the automated fix or the 'do it myself' steps work.
</p>
<p>I opened a support ticket with Microsoft through the Admin Portal and was assigned a case with one Kireeti Ghanti (Avanade Inc) who is a real embarrassment to Microsoft as he did not read my ticket (which specifically named OneDrive for Business and Groove.exe)
 and proceeded to tell me the following:&nbsp; That "Essentials" users are now only allowed access to OneDrive for Business Next Gen Sync Client, not Sharepoint; that Essentials users are only permitted Edit/Publish access to SharePoint online and not document libraries;
 that in 2013 the GROOVE.EXE client was available for download but in 2016 Microsoft has chosen not to offer it except to Business Premium or Enterprise customers; and that it is necessary to uninstall Office 2016 and use Office 2013 in order to use GROOVE.EXE
 if not a ProPlus or Premium customer.&nbsp; While I understand that my experience with Kireeti Ghanti was an exceptionally bad anomaly with Microsoft Office 365 support (and can only hope this makes its way to his manager), I am not sure that Microsoft support
 will have any other solutions for me so am turning to the community.&nbsp; Has anyone found a workaround to get OneDrive for Business (groove.exe) to users who are not supplied full installations of Office 2016 by their administrators?&nbsp; It used to work via "My
 Software" but apparently no longer.</p>

<p>A new version, 1809, was released at the start of the month. Version 1803 is a little out of date, but not unreasonably, especially if you have all of the required for that version (indicated by the build number).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Home and Business 2019 should have no problem running on your computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the error message you cite is generic and not the one I would expect, the problem may be that you have a factory installed "free trial" of Office that is conflicting with your install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features.</p>
<p>Look through the list of installed programs to see if there is a copy of Office installed.</p>
<p>If there is, uninstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is not the problem, try turning on "Verbose Logging" to help find the problem.</p>

<p>“Verbose logging” is a setting that exposes more information during the installation process. It will capture “success”, “informational”, “warning” as well as “error” messages that provide us with clues to your problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can post the generated Logs in Onedrive and give a link to them to your technician if you need technical help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found a pattern in one verbose log file set that I have not yet had a chance to confirm in others, but you can give it a try.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The pattern is each log file is for a separate component. If you open the files from the start and jump to the bottom of each file you will see that they report successful install of a component.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There should be an odd number of log files, find the one in the very middle. It is also probably the largest. It is most likely to be the one reporting the error that caused the install to end and back out. All of the log files after that point will
 be reporting the uninstall of previously installed components in reverse order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is an example of the error message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>MSI (s) (48:2C) [18:15:25:059]: Product: Microsoft Office Single Image 2010 -- Installation operation failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSI (s) (48:2C) [18:15:25:059]: Windows Installer installed the product. Product Name: Microsoft Office Single Image 2010. Product Version: 14.0.4763.1000. Product Language: 0. Manufacturer: Microsoft Corporation. Installation success
 or error status: 1603.</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do a google search for “error status: 1603”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don’t recognize an error, upload the entire log file set to Onedrive.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing is, the “useful” part will be very small and very specific and you probably won’t recognize it. So posting extract may catch the problem, but often miss the important info, so it is best to give us access to everything
 captured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PS: remember to turn Verbose Logging OFF after you fix the problem. It will continue to generate “excess” logging files during all installations, including Windows updates.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do onetime verbose logging:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diagnosing When Setup Stops Responding<br />
<br />
At times, Office Setup stops responding (hangs), and you do not receive any error message. The best thing to do in this situation is to restart your computer, and run Office Setup again with complete verbose logging turned on (with one additional option). To
 do this, start Office Setup. To do so, follow these steps: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click Start, and then click Run.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the Open box, type the following command-line, and then click OK:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 0.4in">
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">path\Setup.exe /L*v! C:\Verboselog.txt</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that Path is the full path of your Office source location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enable Windows Installer logging yourself, open the registry with Regedit.exe and create the following path and keys:
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 0.4in">
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">Reg_SZ: Logging<br />
Value: voicewarmupx</p>
<p>The letters in the value field can be in any order. Each letter turns on a different logging mode. Each letter’s actual function is as follows for MSI version 1.1:
</p>
<p>v - Verbose output<br />
o - Out-of-disk-space messages<br />
I - Status messages<br />
c - Initial UI parameters<br />
e - All error messages<br />
w - Non-fatal warnings<br />
a - Start up of actions<br />
r - Action-specific records<br />
m - Out-of-memory or fatal exit information<br />
u - User requests<br />
p - Terminal properties<br />
+ - Append to existing file<br />
! - Flush each line to the log<br />
x - Extra debugging information. The “x” flag is available only on Windows Server 2003 and later operating systems, and on the MSI redistributable version 3.0, and on later versions of the MSI redistributable.<br />
<br />
”*” - Wildcard, log all information except for the v and the x option. To include the v and the x option, specify “/l*vx”.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note This should be used only for trouble shooting purposes and should not be left on because it will have adverse effects on system performance and disk space. Each time you use the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel, a new
 Msi*.log file is created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When looking through the MSI logs we will typically want to look for a value 3 entry in the logs. Windows installer returns codes during the install which will indicate if a particular function was successful or not.
</p>
<p>Value 1 = Success <br />
Value 2 = Cancel <br />
Value 3 = Error</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note: make sure to turn off verbose logging after you are done.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable verbose logging before collecting the log files.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click on Start -&gt; All Programs</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Accessories -&gt; RUN</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ClickToRun\OverRide /v LogLevel /t REG_DWORD /d 3</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click on OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now try to install Microsoft Office 2013 to get the error message so that the log files get created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide the complete error log present in the ‘Temp’ folder to help you better.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to access the ‘Temp’ folder. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click on Start -&gt; All Programs</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type %temp%<span>&nbsp; </span>-&gt; Click on OK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following are the log files that may be present in the %windir%\temp folder (c2r is for Click to Run):Bootstrapper*.log</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
Here are search results for 1809. You have to pick the one specific for your hardware:
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=windows%2010%201809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=windows%2010%201809</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Manually running update a couple of times should find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, look in update history to make sure you do not have any unsuccessful updates.</p>
<p>Second, don't be in a rush.&nbsp; Windows update also checks your hardware. If there is a known problem with your specific hardware the update will be blocked unless you explicitly download and install it from the catalog (which would not be a good idea ...).</p>

            It seems that you may have had a crash that has left lock files relating to some of your documents and templates. They are hidden files and need to be removed - see
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/what_to_do_when_word_crashes.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://www.gmayor.com/what_to_do_when_word_crashes.htm</font></a> &nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The message about the normal template is switchable, but I strongly recommend that you leave it as it is, because otherwise you may get unwanted changes to this template that can make things worse. Where a condition arises that results in a potential change
 to the normal template you get a warning when you close Word that you can accept or reject depending on what you have done that warrants the potential for change.<br />

<h2>            I can&#39;t use Morph Transition in PowerPoint 2016 Professional Plus</h2>
                    
<p>Hi! Before I updated my version of office, I was able to use the Morph Transition in PowerPoint 2016. When I updated it, the Morph transition is missing in the Transitions Option. I checked my previous presentations with this transition and the Morph works
 but it was still missing from the Transitions Option. My current Office version is 16.0.6868.2062 . Thank you. I need a reply ASAP.</p>

<p>Hi Shem,</p>
<p>According to the following article, the Morph transition is only available if you have an
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/buy/compare-microsoft-office-products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 subscription</a>:</p>

<p>In this case, may I confirm if you have an Office 365 subscription? If so, are you using the Office 2016 desktop application provided by the subscription? Note that Office 2016 Professional Plus is not an Office 365 subscription so that the feature may not
 be included.</p>

<h3> tyronetenniscoe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Product key</h2>
                    <p>So, I have received an office product key to re-instate my office 365, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the Microsoft account page and qued up my product key. </p>
<p>It did not recognize that I already have an installed version of office 365, and I was trying to save time by not having to go through the long tedious wait for Microsoft office 365 to install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heres the prob. It tells me that the key has already been used (which I only keyed in n hour ago) but the existing office 365 still asks me to "renew".</p>
<p>
</p><p>what up with that??? I still cannot use any of the apps from my existing installed office 365, so do I have to un install the old version and re install the new one with the product key they sent me???

            Sorry to say, but it sounds like you are still out of luck.
<br />
<br />If the "new" key says it has already been used, it is no good, it is "used up".
<br />
<br />If there was a conflict with the installed Office bundle, there would be a different message / problem.  Either you would get a message saying you have the wrong key, or (as has happened) you would see that your originally installed version is not re-activated.
<br />
<br />In theory, if you submit a new product key for the same Office 365 bundle, then you should not have to re-install.  You could try uninstall / re-install, but I have little expectation that it will fix this problem.  Hey, MS says that "click to run" installations of Office are supposed to be "immediately" usable ... 
<br />
<br />Just in case, go in to Control Panel &gt; Programs and features.  Look through the list of installed programs to confirm that you have only one copy of Office installed. 
<br />
<br />Bottom line, you are going to have to contact MS Support, again. Sorry ...

<p>&nbsp;When you sign in and get to the first page that says you need parental consent, you should be able to click on “skip” and go to your inbox. It gives you a date by which you need to respond to the age verification. In the meantime your account &nbsp;should not
 be blocked&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Hope you get this in time to get your exam details! It’s not as clear as it could be, but Microsoft have really screwed up on this one… My email account, according to them, was open years before I was born!&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;I called Microsoft support &nbsp;and spoke to someone who was either clueless or not remotely interested in addressing the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;When I pointed out that my account had been opened for 14 years, and according to their system I was three years old, the point seemed lost on them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I emailed them a picture of my driving license with the personal details blanked out other than date of birth. &nbsp;I refuse to divulge personal formation or credit card details &nbsp;to an organisation that has amended my date of birth with the apparent intent
 if either obtaining funds by distress or personal information, &nbsp;or both.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looks like were all in the same boat! Had hours on the phone yesterday - eventually sorted and then said I needed £ 399 worth of security on my laptop😱Said I’d think about it - popped out and within the hour “ parental consent” cane back. So...... I’ve
 set up a new outlook account and she has set it up so that all emails are diverted to the new account and when I’ve another TEN 🙄😤spare hours to let her access everything and hopefully when they finally acknowldge 3 copies of my passport - it may get unlocked!&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will do the “round robin” - here is my new email and only give the new one to really “nice” people!! How to dump your junk emails in one ( very longwinded ) step🤪. Good luck. Its been a nightmare hasnt it! 🙄</p>

<h2>            6110 Navigator accidentally cancels incoming calls when keyguard on</h2>
                    I love my new 6110 but it has an irritating behaviour that makes it almost useless!<br />
<br />
Even with the slide closed and Keyguard active, every incoming call gets cancelled when I take it out of the belt pouch. I must be bumping one of the function keys or something.<br />
<br />
I have searched the Settings and the manual but I can't find any way to make the external keys inactive when the slide is closed. If I can't fix this problem I am going to have to take it back and swap it for something else.

            same with my N95. I have posted a similar note without a response. It annoys me too. You can't pick up the phone (certainly take out of pocket) without sending call to voicemail. I would like to set the phone so the slide needs to be open!

            Yeah, I saw your post when I was searching for solutions to my problem.<br />
<br />
I took the phone to the dealer where I bought it. They are pretty cluey but they did not know any software solution.<br />
<br />
In the end I bought a two-part clear plastic cover. I don't know the proper name for it but it is a hard, protective case. one half clips onto the main part of the phone at the back, the other half clips on to the slide at the front. It is moulded to the shape
 of the phone with holes to operate all the keys, ports, etc. It is thick enough that now I don't brush the control keys when I take the phone out of the belt pouch. (Also protects the screen if I drop it or something.) So problem solved but not the way I would
 have liked.

            No, no, no!! It hasn't fixed the problem, just made it a little less.<br />
<br />
BUT... I HAVE discovered what is REALLY doing it.<br />
<br />
My belt pouch has a flap which is held closed by a strong MAGNET. swiping the front of the phone past this magnet turns on the screen's backlight. If a call is coming in, it also cancels the call!<br />
<br />
So, if I carry the phone with the screen towards my body (as the seller recommended, to avoid microwave radiation transmitting into my hip bone), then when I pull it out of the pouch, the screen swipes past the magnet sewn into the flap and cancels the call.<br />
<br />
It is even worse if I carry it with the screen outwards. Then the magnet on the closed flap is right against the screen. Just pulling the magnet away from the phone as the flap is opened is enough to cancel the call, even before I touch the phone to take it
 out of the pouch!!!<br />
<br />
Hmmm, time for a new pouch maybe.

<h2>            Is it possible to create a link to a local file in Onenote for Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    Whereas in OneNote 2016, it is possible to create link to a file, this feature seems to be absent in Onenote for Windows 10 (UWP). Also, the latter program doesn't seem able to open file links created in the former. Is there a workaround to this? Or is
 the feature intentionally absent?

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The feature to create a link in to a OneNote file directly is currently unavailable. However, you can create or get a link to your OneNote file by saving it to OneDrive. Once you have done this, right-click your OneNote file in OneDrive and then select
<strong>Get a link</strong>. It will give you a link to your file and you can click
<strong>Copy</strong> for you to get this information and to share this file. To do this, we recommend that you check this

<p>@udin: Most possible your memory card is not working. I have faced the problem before. Just backup your card, format it and paste everything back except Autorun.inf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>or Maybe you need to HACK your phone since many 3rd party softwares are unsigned, thats why it can't install.</p>

            One workaround for this, until Microsoft adds the Find Tags function to the iPad is to click Find Tags on the desktop version, then "create a summary page" of that todo list that comes up. This of course creates a page that you can store, perhaps, inside
 a "todo lists" notebook or something. Then sync up and you've got your list on the iPad.<br />

    <title>Unable to change primary alias of my account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smart192  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to change primary alias of my account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current primary account alias was originally provided by my internet service provider several years ago (It is a sympatico.ca address, supported by Bell Mail). I would like to switch my primary Microsoft account alias to an outlook.com address. However,
 after I created the new alias I wanted and went to my Manage Account Aliases page, it wouldn't let me switch to it. Under my current primary alias, there is the message "<span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">Your
 organization's policies prevent you from changing your primary alias.</span>"&nbsp;I am worried that if I switch internet service providers, I will lose all the emails and history that I have in this account. Is there a way for me to use the new outlook.com alias
 that I created and maintain all of my account history if I change ISPs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My ISP (Bell) uses Microsoft services, but I would rather have my email directly through Microsoft than through my ISP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>As this issue might affect other Sympatico (legacy accounts) or Bell (current accounts) email accounts associated with Microsoft accounts and/or XBL gamer tags, I'm providing the following update as it may help them resolve their problem if/when they contact
 Xbox Support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last reply omitted that the Support Team escalation agent had also mentioned contacting Xbox Support as well as Bell Support. Here's how that went last night:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Bell Support &amp; an Internet Technical rep indicated that the only thing that he can do to is to close the Sympatico email account which would automatically close the Microsoft account. I turned down that option last night as my XBL gamer tag was
 still associated with that account pair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Xbox Support and Shelley in consultation with her team identified two items that might be blocking me from moving my XBL GT:</p>
<ol>
<li>An unverified email account was included as a Security proof contact on the old Microsoft account.</li><li>There was a small balance remaining in my Microsoft currency.</li></ol>
<p>I removed the unverified email account on the web site &amp; reduced my Microsoft currency&nbsp;balance to $0.00 by purchasing an item on my Xbox 360. I was then able to successfully move my XBL GT to a new Microsoft Account on the Xbox 360 after these two changes
 had been made. After the XBL GT was moved to a new Microsoft account, I then successfully removed the old Microsoft account &amp; added the new one&nbsp;on my Xbox One.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'd like to publicly thank Shelley &amp; her team for identifying the blocking items and helping me to resolve them. Thanks also to anyone else who attempted to help me resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I currently still have my 360, I humbly request that Microsoft add a feature to ensure that migrating an XBL GT can also be done from an Xbox One and/or the web site.</p>
<p>

    <title>Missing Outbox in Outlook for Mac 2016. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danssmith1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Outbox in Outlook for Mac 2016.</h2>
                    My installation of Outlook 2016 for Mac formerly showed the Outbox when&nbsp; message could not be sent (e.g. attachment to large). Now I am getting the error alerts, but the Outbox does not appear anymore. How can I correct this? I have spent two useless chat
 sessions with Microsoft Customer Service.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>When I finally got to talk with Level 2 support we determined that it was a synch error, not&nbsp; a send error, so the Outbox was not involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as we could figure, two emails with oversized attachments made it in through the IMAP sever but could not be synched. It is possible that GoDaddy!, the host, either reduced the attachment threshold or started enforcing it between the time the messages
 were received and when the synch error was generated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that one of the messages had no subject line, the Spotlight would have been a waste of time as well. I could find the messages, but I could not clear the synch error until I understood what was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to say the the only use for Microsoft Customer Support is to force your way through Level 1 to Level 2. The Level 1 people are probably very nice and competent in their way, but all they do is ask repetitive questions, look up issues in a Microsoft
 experience base (or on-line, where I can find them too), or throw generic troubleshooting steps at a problem they do not understand. I wasted two hours on two days over 4 chat sessions before I finally got transferred to Level 2 and got some help (even then
 I had to wait by the phone 2 hours on a Saturday).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I would strongly advise against ever letting MS initiate remote access, especially the Level 1 people.&nbsp;</p>

            I have all of my email and favorites under and MSN Subscription which I do not want to renew. I would like to start an Office Outllook account with a new outlook email address. MSN said there was a way I could take my favorites under MSN and transfer them
 to a new Office outlook account. They said it was a lengthy procedure and something about saving them to my computer first and then transferring to outlook.com account.

    <title>Summarize a table in MS Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karl kelvin arcilla  say:</h3>
<h2>            Summarize a table in MS Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I need your expertise in Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I made a template for our working paper here in our company. I work for a financial institution. So we check if accounts opened by customers are complete with all the necessary documents. So I made column a as list of names of the account holder. then,
 for column b onwards, the required documents or information (e.g. name, address, birthdate, etc..) each column is for each requirement. I made a drop down so we will only input "OK" or "X"</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, is there a way I can summarize this. For example, customer's name is John Doe, how can I get all the column headers which is tagged as "X" for John Doe. and so on as well for the other accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            You can start the macro from any sheet. You need to enter the correct sheet name for the original data into the macro. I've marked the place. Then the macro will create a new sheet for the output.

<h2>            Outlook 2011 &#40;14.7.5&#41; on MacOS Sierra 10.12.5 keeps hanging and spinning wheel periodically freezing outlook</h2>
                    <p>It doesnt freeze on account synch. &nbsp;I've done nothing really but recently read KBs saying to upgrade office which i did and nothing changed. &nbsp; I put it in Offline mode and i dont have issues. &nbsp; It also appears that emails i look up in the deleted folder
 also sit and take time to redownload the content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 accounts from google via IMAP. &nbsp;i dont think it's a synch issue with exchange but putting it in offline the problem disappears. &nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated or if this is a known issue. &nbsp;I can't find anything other than upgrade (did it
 no bueno) and export and recreating my accounts.</p>

            Hi David,<br />
<br />
May I know you have try to use a different identity to determine whether it is the problem? If an identity is damaged, you need to create a new identity to troubleshoot this issue.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For your reference: &nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-identities-edc1a942-8242-46bd-8a9b-076553d5494d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Manage identities</a><br />
<br />
You may also refer to the article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/2409331/outlook-for-mac-2011-crashes-or-hangs-at-startup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook for Mac 2011 crashes or hangs at startup</a><br />
<br />
<em>Note: </em>If you have local data that is not present on the Cloud/Server. In that case, we recommend that you Back up/Export the email data before creating a new Outlook 2011 identity.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Shyamal
