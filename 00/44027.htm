<h2>            Omnis 7 core executable has stopped working&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    The message: "Omnis 7 core executable has stopped working" will just pop up.&nbsp; It says a problem has caused the program to stop working correctly.&nbsp; Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.&nbsp; We are never notified about anything.&nbsp;
 We are using a program networked between three computers.&nbsp; This happens on the laptop.&nbsp; The laptop was originally Vista and we changed it to Windows 7.&nbsp; This also happened when it was Vista.&nbsp; What is causing this?&nbsp; Would reinstalling Windows 7 help?

<p>Is the Omnis program meant to run on Windows Vista or Windows 7? Have you tried running the program in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
compatibility mode</a> for an earlier version of Windows?</p>
<p>Have you tried contacting the maker of the Omnis program about the problems you're having with the program?</p>

<p>OK - I manage a number of Surface Pros - mainly Surface Pro 3s and a few Surface Pro 2s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While it's great that Microsoft have now released a tool to update the TPM Firmware in the Surface Pro 3s, the Surface Pro 2s are still out in the cold and no sign that Microsoft intend to do anything about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The (possibly) good news however is that Infineon do seem to have released updated firmware via some other manufacturers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>At this point I have to add a HUGE caveat!&nbsp; The process I went through to update the TPM Firmware in a Surface Pro 2 (and I've only done 1 so far) is completely undocumented and I freely admit that I was taking a gamble - this is far from risk free!&nbsp;
 But, as far as I can see, it has worked fine on the one Surface Pro 2 I've tried so far.&nbsp; If you try anything similar, it is entirely at your own risk!&nbsp; Read all the notes / linked web pages and come to your own view whether the risk is worth it.&nbsp; No-one is
 going to make any promises or give any guarantees that this will work - and, at worst, it might brick the Surface Pro 2 completely!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note the following regarding the hardware / software of the Surface Pro 2 I was working on.&nbsp; Yours might not be the same.&nbsp; And note that, in any event, this really does only apply at all to
</strong><strong>Surface Pro 2s and not any other model.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface Pro 2, 128GB version, had Windows 10 Education x64 1709 installed and fully patched up to date.&nbsp; Battery fully charged.&nbsp; On mains power, with Type Cover keyboard.&nbsp; Connected to the internet via WiFi.&nbsp; No other hardware connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tpm.msc reported the TPM as IFX / version 4.32 / specification 1.2 - and as ready for use, but with the security vulnerability caveat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device Manager reported the TPM as 1.2 under Security Devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So this is what I did.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>N.B. I did a full restart of the Surface Pro 2 before I started and after EVERY step to try to reduce the risks - I'm not going to keep repeating that, so just take it as read.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Turn off Bitlocker if it is enabled and wait for decryption to complete fully - NOT just suspended - we're dealing with the TPM here, so every chance (actually certainty as far as I am aware) of losing the Bitlocker keys (but I did also have the Bitlocker
 recovery key saved in a file elsewhere just in case). </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Windows 10 1709 won't, by default, let you save the TPM Owner Password at all (IIRC this is standard behaviour from 1607 onwards), so you need to set a registry key to override that as you'll need the TPM Owner Password in order to update the firmware
 using this process.&nbsp; So run regedit to edit the registry to set <span>the </span>
<span>OSManagedAuthLevel value to 4 in the </span><span>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\TPM key - see links below and elsewhere on the web for details of this and the rationale for throwing away the TPM Owner Password whenever the TPM is cleared.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Run tpm.msc and use Clear TPM to clear the TPM - you have to reboot and press F12 at the boot screen.&nbsp; Then run tpm.msc again and wait / check that the TPM has been reinitialised fully and is ready for use.&nbsp; This should have stored a copy of the
 TPM Owner Password in the registry.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Download the SLB9656 / sp82407.exe file from the HP support site - firmware update to 4.34 - link below.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. Run the EXE to extract the files to somewhere on the C-drive.&nbsp; Locate the files and read the README thoroughly.&nbsp; Only when you have digested it and understood it, decide whether to proceed further.&nbsp; If you do decide to go ahead, I then simply ran
 the extracted EXE file</span> and followed the instructions.&nbsp; It's initial tests for compatibility all passed.&nbsp; And when I then proceeded it obtained the TPM Owner Password from the registry - if it can't get the password from there it will prompt you to either
 enter it manually or provide a file containing it - first time through I had to abort here as I didn't have either of these and restart the process after completing steps 2 and 3 above.&nbsp; The computer then asks for a restart.&nbsp; My Surface Pro 2 restarted but
 hung at the Surface boot logo - this didn't feel like good news, but I left it for a full half hour - it was then still at the Surface logo (no change - no spinning dots underneath it) - so I took the plunge with fingers firmly crossed and held down the power
 button to force a shutdown - waited a minute and again pressed the power button to boot it up - which it then did perfectly (BIG sigh of relief)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Run tpm.msc - check that the TPM initialises OK and reports as ready for use and without the security warning.&nbsp; The version should have updated to 4.34.&nbsp; The TPM should be unchanged in Device Manager.&nbsp; Note that this will have changed the TPM Owner Password,
 and the new one is now stored in the registry!</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Change the <span>OSManagedAuthLevel </span>value in the registry back to 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Run tpm.msc and Clear TPM again - to reset the TPM owner password and this time NOT save it in the registry - the advice elsewhere about not normally needing it is (IMHO) good - you really shouldn't ever need it except in rare circumstances such as going
 through this process.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>9. Run tpm.msc and again </span>check that the TPM initialises OK and reports as ready for use and without the security warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>10. Re-enable BitLocker as appropriate.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>With luck, you are now done!</p>

                    I have used Word 2003 for years and lately it just keeps crashing. I use Vista 32 and was not a problem earlier. I put in disk and did a repair but to no avail. Keeps restarting and crashing with nothing happening in between recovery and crash.<br />

<h2>            SUDDEN ICMP ERROR PLEASE HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Ok I'm not very computer literate, please don't answer with stuff saying about the DHCP and the blah blah because I don't understand, what i really would appreciate would be step by step answers to my problem pleaaaaaaaaase</p>
<p>Ok so for some reason last night i was disconnected from my xbox live, when i tried to reconnect the ICMP error message came up "Your console is not receiving icmp responses properly from your router or modem"</p>
<p>now I tried everything on the list, everything I've found on other sites and forums like changing the ip and doing manual, running initial set up, and god knows what except plug the router in to the xbox with the wire because it's just not possible with
 the layout of my house etc and nothing works</p>
<p>i'm really getting sick and tired of this, i use my xbox a lot for watching films and tv and stuff so it sucks balls that i can't connect to god *** xbox live</p>
<p>nothing i do seems to work i just need a simple answer if anyone can give me one. i don't want to format it cause that probably won't solve the problem and it'll delete all my save data. and my computer has also acknowledged that there is an ip conflict
 but even when i change the ip on the xbox manually it doesn't work</p>
<p>PLEEEEEEEEEASE HELLLLLP!</p>

<p>I as well have an ICMP error. Was working fine two days ago and then yesterday it went down. I paid no attention to it as on the website it said that there were some issues connecting to xbox live. But the situation was fixed but not for me. I've tried all
 the basics...restarting modem, router etc. Called xbox and road runner but still no solution.

<p>Hey there Pretty, welcome to the Forums! &nbsp;I am here to help and I promise not to tell you to try defragging your XYZ-log to initial configurations.
<br />
<br />
So first off, I'm guessing this is the guide you tried, right?&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/connecting/router-not-responding-icmp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox 360 ICMP Error | Xbox ICMP Error&nbsp;</a>. &nbsp;Please give it a shot if you haven't. &nbsp;Basically there is
<em>something</em> in how your console and your network are communicating. Since it started recently, I kind of have a feeling that your router/modem need an update. &nbsp;It might be worth calling your internet provider or the maker of the router to check in on
 that.<br />
<br />
Also, for that wired-to-modem test, if you could move the console just temporarily to check that out, at least it would help us narrow down the issue a bit.<br />
<br />
Other than that, can you fill out the info posted here?&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/t/155724.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">START HERE for connection troubleshooting!</a>&nbsp; We'll get you
 back online ASAP and we'll try to keep it low-jargon while we do it. :)</p>

<p>Just want you to know your not alone. I have tried everything called ISP all that nothing has fixed this was playing 3days ago and randomly got disconnected. All my PC's work fine and connect to the net and nothing in my router settings have changed and
 i have all the needed ports forwarded since a year now. &nbsp;3 days later still trying everything ICMP error. I can't believe this is our problem at this point aftering doing everything possible yet my pc works just fine</p>
<p>Did multiple packet tests with cmd and online and i am sending and receiving. Packets perfectly with no jitter yet i all of a sudden have icmp error witb Xbox.</p>

<p>Well its a d-link624 but as i said nothing was changed when i all of a sudden got icmp error and my three PC s each run from the same router and have no problem with the net. I also configured the router myself so nothing is using the same ip and everything
 is hardwired in, as well as ported correctly i even took the time to factory reset and reconfig everything and assign a new IP to the xbox. Believe me I've done everything, not trying to be rude. All i do knoe for a fact is this happen when i was alerted of
 a service alert. Just as pretty said and still have problems even tho it says everything is up. It's been 3 days and i have constantly be trying to solve this. I've literally done everything from trying my laptop with the xbox cable to reseting everything
 to calling people. And nothing </p>

            <p>I fully understand that you are frustrated. Currently it seems that several users are experiencing ICMP error with connectivity to Xbox LIVE. I do not think this is related to a DNS lookup, but could you try set your Xbox DNS settings to Google Public DNS as follows:<br /><br /></p>
<ol>
<li>Press the&nbsp;<strong>Guide</strong>&nbsp;button on your controller, go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>System Settings</strong>.</li>
<li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Network Settings</strong>.</li>
<li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Wired Network</strong>&nbsp;or the name of your wireless network, if you are prompted to do so.</li>
<li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Configure Network</strong>.</li>
<li>On the&nbsp;<strong>Basic Settings</strong>&nbsp;tab, select&nbsp;<strong>DNS Settings</strong>.</li>
<li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Manual</strong>.</li>
<li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Primary DNS Server</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter&nbsp;<strong>8.8.8.8</strong></li>
<li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Secondary DNS Server</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter&nbsp;<strong>8.8.4.4</strong></li>
<li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Done</strong>&nbsp;again.</li>
<li>Press the&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>&nbsp;button on your controller, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Test Xbox LIVE Connection</strong>.</li>
</ol>

</p><p>If it is a Dell &amp; asks for&nbsp;a service tag, that will be on a sticker under the computer. There will be much info for you at the site. Also, you can compare driver versions.</p>

            My question does it work or are you having issues? as that system will work with 64 bit with no issues. Right now it has a 32 bit system and 8Gig of installed memory but will only use less than 4 because of the 32 bit installed system.

<h2>            Minecraft on Windows 10 through Xbox Confusion</h2>
                    <p>My daughter wants to add the Decocraft mod. I've tried several times, but keep getting stuck/confused. So far, I have downloaded Forge, but do not see an option to choose that profile in her version of Minecraft. I've also tried downloading the launcher.
 When I try to sign in, it says username/password failed. When I created a new account, it then prompted me to buy Minecraft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get Decocraft for my daughter?</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear about this sign in issue. Are you able to correctly sign into the Xbox App for Windows 10 or account.xbox.com? This will help narrow the issue down to verification from the Minecraft servers as the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this also seems to be a specific in-game question, I suggest posting this same question over on the
<a href="https://www.minecraftforum.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Minecraft forums</a> to get feedback from players who have done this before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way to get a better answer is to ask <a href="https://twitter.com/mojangsupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mojang Support</a> directly.</p>

<h2>            My home xbox - Unable to save changes</h2>
                    I recently have been buying a lot of games, I wanted to go on my brothers xbox and gameshare my account so he could play with me. When I hit 'my home xbox' and 'set this console as home xbox' it says that it is Unable to save changes. I looked through
 a few posts and someone said that there possibly could be too many accounts on that xbox making it their home. Which turned out to be true. So i removed a lot of accounts home xbox that didnt have use. I got the xbox down to one account having it as its home
 xbox, then i went back to my account and tried to set it. Still came up with unable to save changes. I have tried restarting and unplugging and removing the account and re adding it. So far still unable to save changes. Any help is appreciated!

<p>Hi guys, new poster here, but think I've figured out how to solve this. Been having this issue myself and managed to fix it yesterday and also helped someone on twitter just now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to be some kind of sync issue I think.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try logging in to your microsoft account, and changing your name. This worked for me straight away. You may need to sign out of your xbox and back in again but hopefully it fixes it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if it works 👍👍</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am so confused right now, I recently updated my laptop to windows 10. When I was back on 8.1 my laptop was so slow and almost unusable. Once I had windows 10 my laptop was smooth running and I was so happy. I shut it off and haven't been on it until today...
 I opened it up and I was back on windows 8.1?! What?! unfortunately now the windows 10 offer is gone... and apparently so is Microsoft Live help. Really annoyed and frustrated. What has happened?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Season passes no longer are downloaded to the console, whenever the DLC become available they'll appear in the "Ready to Install" under "DOOM."</p>
<p>Try hard resetting the console, if it still doesn't want to launch give uninstalling and reinstalling the game a try,</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you get message when playing certain files?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The might have caused due to the change in the motherboard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Let`s check whether Windows Media DRM (Digital
 Rights Management) functions correctly on your computer. Please follow the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Download
 a sample media file and save it to your computer. Visit the following Microsoft Web site:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=166118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=166118</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span> This Windows Media DRM protected media file
 is a media file that requires Windows DRM and Zune DRM to be fully functional in order to play. This is to test Windows Media DRM and Zune DRM functionality and cannot resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 the downloaded file to play the media.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> If you are prompted to install a Windows Media Player component upgrade when you open the media file, click&nbsp;<strong>Upgrade</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">You cannot play a Windows Media DRM protected file or a Zune DRM protected file on a computer
 that is preconfigured with Windows 7</a> (This article may not be related to the exact issue but can be tried)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If this does not help, then let`s perform a SFC
 scan to check for system file corruptions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>,
<strong>All programs</strong> and then <strong>Accessories.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 Click&nbsp; <strong>Command Prompt</strong> and select <strong>Run as administrator.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Command Prompt window, type&nbsp; <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and then press Enter</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 any files require replacing SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Windows Vista DVD for this process to continue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message <strong>
Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>After
 the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></p>

<h3> steve mowery  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I define the pattern of a registry data&#63;  Specifically a string type &#40;reg_sz&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My operating system is Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; I am try to set the&nbsp;string value of a&nbsp;Windows registry entry to a specific pattern.</p>
<p>The name of the registry value is LogFilepath, type reg_sz.</p>
<p>the value must match the pattern:</p>
<p>((%[Ss][Yy][Ss][Tt][Ee][Mm][Rr][Oo][Oo][Tt]%)|(%[Ww][Ii]{Nn][Dd][Ii][Rr]%)|([C-Zc-z]:\\[Ww]][Ii]{Nn][Dd][Oo][Ww][Ss]))\\[Ss][Yy][Ss][Tt][Ee][Mm]32\\[Ll][Ll][Oo][Gg][Ff][Ii][Ll][Ee][Ss]\\[Ff][Ii][Rr][Ee][Ww][Aa][Ll][Ll]\\[^\.][^\\]*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried using the help,. but there is no mention of "pattern" in the registry help.&nbsp; "Formatting" only mentions the ability to save the registry in different formats. Can anybody help with the solution to this problem?</p>

            I suspect you are asking about regular expressions in some scripting language. This is a forum that deals with Windows security issues. A scripting forum would be a better place to post your query. Remember to state your scripting language!<br />

<p>Since the original post was confusing (to put it mildly) your best bet is to start your own post and explain your requirements in detail. Appending your question to this old potatoe is unlikely to get you much further.<br />

            <p>Actually,&nbsp;the original post is simply&nbsp;describing a registry setting analysis using XML pattern matching.&nbsp;&nbsp;The original&nbsp;poster must be running some type of program that is analyzing his registry to confirm&nbsp;if something is correct/valid/compliant/etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This process compares the string value of a registry setting&nbsp;to a pattern (defined in XML)&nbsp;in order to determine if it's compliant.&nbsp; If you look at the pattern, it's immediately clear that it's trying to determine if the value of that registry entry is similar
 to this:</p>
<p>%systemroot%|%windir%|C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Firewall\*</p>
<p>The part that requires knowledge of XML pattern matching is: &nbsp;[^\.][^\\]*</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ^ character is called a 'negative character group', which means that whatever follows CANNOT be present.&nbsp; In this specific example, the file path cannot include either a backslash or a double backslash after "...Firewall\".&nbsp; This is a way of saying that
 if there are any more subdirectories listed after the Firewall directory, then it won't match the pattern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The final answer to the original poster's question could be&nbsp;to set the string value in the registry to</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Firewall\logfilename.txt</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example of a value with a&nbsp;log file location that would fail the comparison is:</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Firewall\2017\logfilename.txt</p>
<p>This would fail because subdirectories are not allowed per the defined pattern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, per the pattern, any of the letters could be upper or lower case, and the drive letter C: could be anything between C and Z.</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen BCCode 19, recently removed Slui.exe, bad pool header</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I am running Windows 7 on my iMac partition.<br />
</p>
<p>2.93 Ghz intel core i7</p>
<p>8 GB 133 MHz DDR3 ram (4 2gig sticks)</p>
<p>ATI Radeon HD 5750 1024 MB</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I am primarily a mac user I have only limited knowledge of windows systems and their intricacies, I can get around but I am not a PC savant by any stretch of the imagination. I primarily am using the partition for gaming and have the ability to wipe and
 reinstall (though would REALLY hate to do so).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other information, upon updating my system I was prompted with the "windows is not genuine" box. I wasn't aware I needed to keep my code after install (mac user we don't have validation issues like this on updates) so I naturally googled what I could do
 to fix this issue and tried to uninstall my WAT and erase my Slui.exe. Well I tried to follow the tutorial but in CMD the SLMGR-REARM didn't work and there was no WAT to unistall. So I just erased the Slui.exe and I believe this is the root of my problem.
 I am unaware of how to fix it. Here is the error message I was able to get after restart. The only thing I read on the blue screen itself was "bad pool header"</p>
<p><br />

<p>I am currently in the process of trying to obtain the dump files, however as the blue screen happens at seemingly random intervals after startup regardless of what is running It may be difficult to get them. If you can think of a way to fix thing before
 I get those files (not sure how unless you have encountered this before) let me know, if not I will do my best to get you the dump files you need in the proper way.<br />
<br />
Thanks&nbsp;<br />

</p><p>
</p><p>*update 8pm 11/14/14* viewed the dump files and the issue seems to be with my tcpip.sys file. Not sure where to go from here with repairing it. My first thought would be to copy the driver from my other PC and replace the defunct one. Any issues with trying
 this?</p>

<h2>            3RD Party Wiz-bang Solve All Software</h2>
                    <p>I have&nbsp;<strong>2&nbsp;questions</strong>; my intent isn't meant to denigrate&nbsp;others products, but to possibly be educated by the people in this forum concerning others products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One very highly recommended computer Tune-up program, one recommended by Dell, PC&nbsp;Magazine (editors choice) ZD Net (editors choice), CNet (top product), USA Today,&nbsp;and others,&nbsp;that supposedly not only cleans your registry of what they call junk, also
<em>defrags</em> the registry at the next boot. It claims to fix hard drive errors, optimize memory, optimize your networking, or Internet Connection, and a host of other Oh wow! Gee-wiz stuff. Long story short, I had to reinstall my Operating System clean
 to repair what this, in my opinion,&nbsp;horrible product 'fixed,' Programs, mainstream relevant programs, no longer worked. My&nbsp;Internet connection was severely changed, and not for the better, and a host of other problems that were caused by, and&nbsp;directly related&nbsp;to
 using&nbsp;this program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know, ever since DOS was the only O.S. available, yes, I've just dated myself, the accepted consensus was 'never ever, never ever-ever touch the registry.'&nbsp;So,<strong> question 1</strong>- Still true today? Or is there a product that will do this
<em>safely</em>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now&nbsp;I've run across another product; an uninstaller, PerfectUninstaller to be exact, that claims to&nbsp;remove
<em>ALL</em> the orphaned files left over from using Add/Remove for a program uninstalled using Windows Control Panel.&nbsp;In doing this, unless I'm misinformed,&nbsp;it claims to clean the registry also.&nbsp;My gut feeling is to run away quickly, far away,&nbsp;from this program
 too...<strong>Question 2</strong>- others opinions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>(this site rawks!)</p>

            <p>Q1.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Registry cleaners will not improve performance, double the speed of a computer or any other spurious clams made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in the days of Windows 9x, it was important to control the
<strong>size </strong>of the registry, and for this purpose, Microsoft released their very own registry cleaner which only removed entries which were absolutely safe to remove.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUT, that was back in the days of Windows 9x.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows NT and all of the operating systems spawned from NT do not handle the registry in the same way as Windows 9x did. Windows NT and higher have a much larger limit to the size and they
 ignore orphaned entries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows 7 registry can grow to 2gb before the OS falls over, and even a well used system is unlikely to have a registry over 250mb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q2.. </p>

    <title>Cannot install Epson nx110 Printer Driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> micealc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install Epson nx110 Printer Driver</h2>
                    I recently purchased an Acer Aspire with Windows Vista Home Premium.&nbsp; About a month later I bought an Epson Stylus NX110.&nbsp; I first tried installing the drivers using the disk that came with the printer, following the directions.&nbsp; The installation wizard
 said the installation was completed successfully, but when I went to the printer control panel, the printer did not show up.&nbsp; The drivers showed up under Programs and Features, but no epson printer icon in the printer window of the control panel.&nbsp; I called
 Epson technical support and was directed to uninstall the drivers and&nbsp;download the driver directly from their website.&nbsp; The Scan driver downloaded and installed no problem.&nbsp; The printer driver
<a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/Supportdlsurvey.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;download=ftp://ftp.epson.com/drivers/epson12981.exe&amp;pn=Epson+Stylus+NX110&amp;pc=Epson+Stylus&lt;sup&gt;%26reg;&lt;/sup&gt;+Series&amp;ft=driver&amp;returnpage=/support/supDetail.jsp&amp;returnparams=%26infoType%3dDownloads%26oid%3d128284%26prodoid%3d63084353&amp;licenseoid=17774" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 begin installation but after unzipping the file, the printer utility setup window would stop responding.&nbsp; We created a new clean user account, disabled McAfee, and tried several other tactics, but ever time we tried to install this driver the program would
 stop responding in the same spot.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
When I plugged the usb into the computer so that vista could try itself, vista would find the driver and begin installation, but would say it encountered an error and suggested contacting epson.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
After an hour and a half on the phone with epson technical support, including a supervisor, they could not figure out the problem and said it may be a problem with Vista.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
After getting off the phone with them I went onto my XP laptop and downloaded the same driver (it is the same driver for xp and vista 32-bit) and installed it without a hitch.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Upon reading some of the other forums, I came across similar problems and tried one of the suggestions to run the command prompt C:\Windows\system32&gt;sfc/scannow.&nbsp; At the end it said "Windows Corruption Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some
 of them.&nbsp; Details are included in the CBS.log windir\logs\CBS\CBS.log.<br />
<br />
I don't know if these are unrelated problems, but I wanted to thoroughly explain the situation.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.

                    <p>Hello - I have a Surface 3 - this is the third one I have had. Was replaced twice By Microsoft Germany.</p>
<p>I have two questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) This time the unit was replaced in November 2015 - Do I not get 12 month warranty with a replaced unit? Im sure it was 12 months!</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Regardless of BIOS / UEFI settings, when booting from USB / SSD it only comes up with the the "Surface" splash screen (no loading animation), I have tested the bootable USB stick in another PC and it works (it is FAT32 on
<span>
<span>
GPT partition)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything else I can try to recover it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you.</p>

</p><p>We provide a post-service warranty for devices that have been serviced or replaced by our service center. The length of the warranty depends on whether the service was in-warranty or out-of-warranty:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-warranty service</strong>: If your Surface was serviced or replaced within the original warranty period, you receive either the balance of your original hardware warranty or 90 days, whichever is longer.
</li><li><strong>Out-of-warranty service</strong>: If your Surface was serviced out of the original warranty period, your replacement or serviced device will have a 90-day hardware warranty.
</li></ul>
<p>If you are using the two buttons to boot from USB properly and it does not boot, your only option is to talk to support about another replacement. If it has been replaced twice, ask for a supervisor and explain this and see if they will replace again as
 a good will gesture (it does not hurt to ask).</p>

            <p>Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.<br />

<h2>            Something I am wondering about the Collector Base</h2>
                    
<p>Will the Reapers try to take it back if we saved the base in ME 2 or rebuild it if we destroyed it?&nbsp; They will need to build more Reapers afterall and even though there are no more collectors they can always turn in a new species into collectors.</p>

<p>We dont know the collector vermin have been completely exterminated. They could have a base elsewhere. Hell, they could be at the heart of every galactic core for all we know.</p>
