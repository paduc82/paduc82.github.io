<h2>            Getting BlueScreen errors in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: dell xps l702x BSOD</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an annoying problem with my laptop and I hope you'll be able to help me.</p>
<p>I have an DELL XPS l702x laptop. The laptop was running on Win7, and before a couple of months I started getting BSOD errors (I think it was 0x000000124) every 5 minutes. I tried to format the hard drive and reinstall the OS, tried updating drivers, but
 this didn't help. After this I took the computer to a technician who tried to determine the problem, but after working on this for two days he also didn't succeed (this included testing the hard drives and the memory).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last thing I tried was installing Windows 10 Pro Technical Preview Build 9926 - I let it find and install all the drivers than the system found necessary&nbsp;and didn't install manually any other drivers that were listed on DELL website for this specific
 laptop (previous installations of Win7 were unable to locate and download necessary drivers, so I had to install them manually and probably one of them or a combination of a couple of installed drivers were causing the BSODS).</p>
<p>Surprisingly this worked! And the computer worked perfectly with Win10, until I had to update to build 10041.</p>
<p>Immediately after installing the update the computer started crushing again every 5-10 minutes. I noticed that in addition to changes in the windows itself, there was a new software installed after the update - "Dell Audio by Realtek".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recovered the computer to the previous windows version - Win 10 9926 and now it works again normally. The problem is that it requires to perform the update to build 10041 again and I guess this will return the BSODs problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you have any ideas for solving this problem.</p>
<p>If you are able to identify the faulty hardware/drivers, it would be the best, of cause.</p>
<p>May be it is possible to prevent windows from installing new drivers and to update the operating system only?</p>
<p>Or maybe it is possible to stay with the 9926 build, without the need to update it every other day and then recover to previous build? - I guess this goes against the idea of the technical preview version, but right now this is the only solution that keeps
 my laptop alive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!<br />
M.</p>

<h2>            F Secure causing E7 to restart during updates&#63;</h2>
                    My E7 on Symbian Anna, has since the update and in last 10 days started to suddenly restart - sometimes as many as 6 times during a short span of time. This happens on not on all days, and sometimes even when it is on standby.<br />
<br />
Today I happened to note that F Secure screen was coming after sudden restar and then back to restart again. Now it is stable and I saw that F secure was showing update to anti theft as of 28/9/11.So I am suspecting that may be F Secure causes the restart while
 updating.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?

<p>I would recommend uninstalling F Secure which isn't really needed anyway. There are very few Symbian viruses and none that cannot be easily avoided by taking simple precautions like not installing apps from unknown sources and not accepting bluetooth connections
 from unknown devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With regards to anti theft features, Symbian already has builtin security features such as Remore Locking etc which you will find in Settings&gt;Phone&gt;Phone management&gt;Security Settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the uninstall solves the problem then you have isolated the cause. If you think you reaklly need then you can always reinstall it afterwards.</p>

<h2>            Internal Network&#47;External Groups vs. External Network&#47;Internal Group</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just starting with Yammer and am a bit confused. I watched all the videos and read the Admin Guide but unfortunately still can't get a solid understanding. I hope someone here can clarify my confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>We would like to use Yammer for collaboration in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Internally in the company</li><li>Externally with clients
<ol>
<li>We do multiple projects for each client and would like to track each project separately</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li></ol>
<p>So far I tested....</p>
<p><strong>INTERNAL NETWORK</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Created an internal network
<ul>
<li>Created Internal Groups
<ul>
<li>Added company users to groups</li></ul>
</li><li>Created External Groups
<ul>
<li>Added company users to groups</li><li>Invited external users to the network
<ul>
<li>Added the external guest to the group</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p><strong>EXTERNAL NETWORK</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Created External Network</p>
</li><li>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Created Internal Groups (<strong>The only available option</strong>)</p>
</li><li>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Invited Guest to Network</p>
</li><li>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Added the guest to the group</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Since I can create an External Group inside an Internal Network and invite guests to the External Group, what is exactly the purpose of the External Network and how is it being used compared to External Group inside Internal Network?</li><li>Why does the External Network allow for Internal Groups only?</li><li>In terms of best practices, since we work on multiple projects per client, which of the following options is recommended?:
<ol>
<li>Create a network for each client and then create a group per project</li><li>Create one network for all clients and then create a group per client/project and name each group as "Client Name - Project Name"?</li><li>Is there another recommended option?</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<p>Besides the fact that Yammer allows for the creation of external groups and networks and invite external guests, it looks like a limited version of the functionality found in Teams. I am not sure of why there is a need for 2 separate tools but I'm sure I'm
 missing the big picture :)</p>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<p>On the mobile device (Android) we have 3 apps that seems to overlap: Yammer , Groups and Teams. Groups looks like overlapping with Teams and I wonder what is it used for?&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<li>Since I can create an External Group inside an Internal Network and invite guests to the External Group, what is exactly the purpose of the External Network and how is it being used compared to External Group inside Internal Network?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;Answer&gt; An External Network can have many groups</p>
<p>&lt;Answer&gt; An External Group is just one group within your Internal Network&lt;Answer&gt;So if you have many projects with one client, you could start an external network, with each project discussion inside one group.<br />
</p>
<p>&lt;Answer&gt; An External group is good for an internal discussion (eg Trade show 2017) and you invite a sub-contractor to be part of the discussion. Note that you cannot have public emails eg @hotmail.com inside a external group.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Why does the External Network allow for Internal Groups only?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;Answer&gt; An External network already allows outsiders to come in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In terms of best practices, since we work on multiple projects per client, which of the following options is recommended?:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a network for each client and then create a group per project</li><li>Create one network for all clients and then create a group per client/project and name each group as "Client Name - Project Name"?</li><li>Is there another recommended option?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;Answer&gt; Create a external network for that client and each group one project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Besides the fact that Yammer allows for the creation of external groups and networks and invite external guests, it looks like a limited version of the functionality found in Teams. I am not sure of why there is a need for 2 separate tools but I'm sure I'm
 missing the big picture :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;Answer&gt; There is a limit to the maximum users in teams. Also different look and feel. You pick the one that might suit you better. I would use teams when I have a tight knit group that I communicate with very often, I would use Yammer to reaching out to
 a wider audience via social communication style. Microsoft has moved away from one size fits all, and have now a chest of different apps that overlap in functionality that might appeal to different audiences.</p>

<p>Thank you for the elaborative reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>ok, it starts to make sense now....</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, Teams would really be&nbsp;the best fit for our needs, except it doesn't offer user management on the channel level but rather just on the Team's level.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to Yammer, if we create an external&nbsp;network per client, my concern is that the list may grow quite a bit and it will be hard to manage but I think this is still the best option.... worth a try</p>

<p>If you do multiple projects per client, an external network per client is really a good idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The network will be the go-to place for your interactions between your team and the clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't limit it just to projects. You can also use Yammer to have other interactions with your clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a mock up that we did for a advertising agency, we created a mockup between the agency and a media owner. Obviously there would be many projects between the agency and the media owner for various clients, but we are also aware of team building activities
 that existed between the agency people and the media owner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what we did was we did a External Yammer Network "Better together - AA Agency with BB Media"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within the Yammer network we had Project A, Project B, Project C groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However we also had Bowling Challenge, Year End party etc where the Agency and the Media company people interacted. There we posted photos, comments on the photos, with senior management participation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also remember Yammer has #topics which can further help classify different information. We like to use #solved and #unsolved #critical topics that can be flagged during meetings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Totally agree. I just realized I did not fully understand the full potential and design of Yammer.</p>
<p>It's intended to be the main communication&nbsp; vehicle between team members (intendedfnternal and external). As such, it could reduce, even eliminate, the use of emails.
<br />
I think I saw the light ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, now I'm starting to see all the possibilities and power it offers and it's quite encouraging.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for network per client we decided to follow this paradigm and yes, not only for projects but for all type of communication that can be grouped under single idea or name....</p>
<p>

<p>Well, I think I was getting excited&nbsp;a bit too soon. This isn't a ranting but more of sharing my point of view and the challenges we are facing with integrating Yammer into our process and project management/collaboration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As we started to create an external network per client and a group per project, we realized this may not be the most efficient way and there are much too many caveats that create more complexity rather than efficiency.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For starters, each network needs to be manually configured with our logo (for email invitations etc..), description and other properties. Unfortunately there is no way to customize a default template for creating new networks so there is allot of overhead
 associated with creating an external network for each client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, Our brand gets lost in the process because the Network name is all the users see and since we are using the client's name as the network name, there is no correlation to our company's brand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, the need to jump from one network to another (between clients) and then jumping around between groups (projects) makes this entire tool hard to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we are looking back again at creating external groups inside our internal network and invite our client's users as guests in the respective group. We name each external group as "ClientName - ProjectName".</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, this isn't the perfect solution for us either. The issue is that everything posted in the external group is visible to the client. There is no way of having an internal discussion that is hidden from the client. This forces us to create
 an internal group with the same name as the external group&nbsp;for internal discussions. Obviously this isn't a productive way to run a project and our team members have to constantly jump between the internal group and the external group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering, since Yammer is an implementation of social network, why doesn't it include the same "privacy" mechanism as in Facebook where the poster can select to which group the post is visible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thought, we've been using Basecamp for project management and collaboration for several years. In basecamp, when you create a new discussion (post) you can select the target audience for your post as well as&nbsp;simply check a box to make your post (and
 discussion) hidden from the client. Yet, the company members can see all threads on one page while the client only sees the threads visible to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yammer offers great collaboration for internal-to-internal &nbsp;and internal-to-external scenarios. however, the strong isolation/separation between internal and external&nbsp;is where it fails to deliver&nbsp;real collaboration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps Yammer was not designed for project management/collaboration and perhaps we are trying to squeeze out of it something that is simply not there and may never be there...
</p>
<p>If this is the case, that is pretty disappointing and I believe there is a serious miss of opportunity to make this tool much more powerful and more plausible to wider range of users and companies.
</p>
<p>

<p>For starters, each network needs to be manually configured with our logo (for email invitations etc..), description and other properties. Unfortunately there is no way to customize a default template for creating new networks so there is allot of overhead
 associated with creating an external network for each client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;Comment&gt; I am not sure of your project size and duration. Our project mobilization typically takes 1-2 weeks. Each client us unique, so we do create a masthead (which takes about 5-10 mins) but it goes in personalizing the network with the customer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b593177d-d918-44c6-82e7-88746dc9bdc6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b593177d-d918-44c6-82e7-88746dc9bdc6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, Our brand gets lost in the process because the Network name is all the users see and since we are using the client's name as the network name, there is no correlation to our company's brand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;Comment&gt; The masthead can help in the branding. Having a Yammer site to collaborate with the client is already a differentiation</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, the need to jump from one network to another (between clients) and then jumping around between groups (projects) makes this entire tool hard to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;Comment&gt; Again, not sure of the size and duration of your projects, and how many project one person has to handle. If you work with multiple projects with the same client the same time, then each project with the client can be a group within the special
 "You &amp; Client" Yammer External Network (See mockup example where an agency works on multiple imaginary Microsoft marketing projects)</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>One other tool within the O365 toolchest would be planner. External access is coming for planner so that might work for you as well.</p>

<p>Our typical project lasts between a few days to a few months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our team members works with multiple clients on multiple projects - not only with one client on multiple projects, hence the need to switch between networks (clients).</p>
<p>
Besides creating a custom banner for each network, we did everything you suggested
</p><p>
</p><p>But even if we "get used to" the creation of the network process, the other limitations that I mentioned, present a bigger challenge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The inability to have internal discussions alongside with open discussions in the same group is a limitation that creates big overhead as we need to switch from external groups to internal groups and duplicate posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: client posted a question in an external group. The question is then discussed internally in an internal group and then the final answer is communicated back to the client. To do this you have to create 2 groups for the same project - one internal
 and one external. Seems like a bit overkill when you have tens of concurrent projects going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How does your company handle this?<br />

<p>You could, potentially just as easily, click on the "wrong" group and post the "wrong" message. The mobile Yammer shows internal and external groups in the same list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tools that manages both levels in the same group can be configured to default all new threads to internal unless the poster select different visibility.</p>

<h2>            Need to know what version of windows originaly had my laptop hardware</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Last year I joined to Insider program. I made a mistake and install Windows 10 Enterprise in my laptop (I don't remember why). Since then, I had trouble to activate each build (because my laptop had another version&nbsp;of windows originally). I always used mitigation
 keys provided by Microsoft but now it doesn't work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have my key, which is in the laptop hardware (I used a software to find my key), and I want to execute a clean install to use my key and start over again without needing to use a mitigation key.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is that I don't remember what version originally had my laptop and I don't want to make the same mistake.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I find what version had my laptop originally? In the OEM page only says "Windows 8 64"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks everyone!!!</p>

<h3> vannersp  say:</h3>
<h2>            The field is too small to accept the amount of data...</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to run a <em>very </em>simple query but getting the error "The field is too small to accept the amount of data you attempted to add. Try inserting or pasting less data." The thing is
<strong>I am not inserting or pasting anything</strong>!&nbsp; The query is:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">SELECT ID </p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">FROM MyTable </p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">WHERE&nbsp;ATextField = 'ST002' AND&nbsp;AnIntegerField IS NULL;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get rid of the message by removing the IS NULL clause as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">SELECT ID </p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">FROM MyTable </p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">WHERE&nbsp;ATextField = 'ST002'</p>
<p>
</p><p>but this is not equivalent.&nbsp; I need to ensure I am getting results where AnIntegerField is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">only</span> Null.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message does not make sense and the SQL is quite legitimate except that MS Access has a problem with it.&nbsp; My guess is that it is a bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: AnIntegerField is part of a 3-field unique index that ignores nulls, and the field is not required.</p>

<p>3. It is part of a unique&nbsp;index that includes two other fields that are text:</p>
<p>&nbsp; CTRNo and CTRevNo.&nbsp; This index is unique, but ignores nulls.</p>
<p>4. Every record that I am querying has a Null value for ThemeID (by coincidence, but it could be significant if there is a bug in the SQL engine).</p>

            <p>One more thing I just discovered:</p>
<p>
</p><p>if I change ThemeID IS NULL to ISNULL(ThemeID) the query works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: while this is a viable work around, it still remains that there is a bug in the SQL engine that ought to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next step is: how do I bring this to Microsoft's attention?</p>

            <p>SQL Dialects have differences, but I think you are correct</p>
<p>
</p><p>fieldname IS Null should be correct syntax and it is syntax I have used before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, IsNull(fieldname) will evaluate to True if the value is Null. so the criteria will also work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will pass this along to see if this is actually a bug or not. But if it is, since there is a viable work around I doubt if it will be addressed.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> ryxxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            C5-00 can&#39;t update firmware</h2>
                    
<p>My C5 is at 031.022. SW update says update available (5111 KB), selecting it and 'start update' I get a brief 'processing' for approx 10 seconds then it stops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried *#0000# and options, check for updates but get server not responding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also tried latest OVI suite. It tells me I have 031.022 and that I have the latest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do I get an update?</p>

<p>Many thanks for your suggestion</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well I managed to get it to 32.010. Don't ask me how. I tried it again on the phone and it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However it still tells me I need an update (presumably 061.005) and does the same thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried what you suggested (v 2.6.6en) but it tells me I don't need an update. I've also tried v3 but this also says I don't need an update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why is the phone saying I need one but then I can't get it?</p>

<p>whether an update is available.. Availability depends on Product code / Region..also if the phone is Network locked, its possible only after the Operator's approval.. If update is available but you are not able to get the try different ways.. Thru' Nokia
 Software Updater (link in one of the posts above..), thru' OVI Suite</p>

<p>..or directly thru' your phone, by going to Software update menu..</p>
<p>If all these fail and you still WANT to update, you may try the Nokia Care...</p>

<p>If you are&nbsp;REALLY VERY KEEN to have an update.. check with Nokia Care.. Have read a few posts on this forum where users have mentioned that though there were indications of firmware update available for their product code.. they were unable to update thru'
 any of the possible methods.. In such case it was possible thru' Nokia Care..</p>
<p>..so not certain but still may be..if you are the lucky one..</p>

<p>Changelogs are considered proprietary information and are not published by Nokia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you see changelogs on third party sites, you may not repeat them here. Also bear in mind that portions of information in leaked changelogs may have inaccuracies introduced so that Nokia can identify the source of the leak and take action.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We use Excel online for numerous work documents to allow us to edit at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can scroll up and down fine with the laptop track pads but we can't scroll left and right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else come across this? Is there a fix?</p>

<p>I think I figured out the issue!!! When someone opens the online excel file via excel on their own computer - it freezes/locks the online browser from editing. &nbsp;If you try to open to excel on your machine it will call out why it's lock by whom is using...
 when everyone is editing from the browser, scroll both horizontal and vertical works fine!</p>

<h2>            Email Folder pane has disappeared</h2>
                    <p>When I open my email account now, the normal view has changed. </p>
<p>Normally there should be a&nbsp;list of folders displayed on the left panel and the contents of any selected folder would be on the right panel.</p>
<p>The left panel is blank?</p>
<p>If I reduced the panel size - the various icons are displayed: Mail, Calendar, Tasks etc
</p>
<p>There are options to view: All Folders, Sent Items and InBox</p>
<p>If I select All Folders - a pop up panel shows with all the Mail folder and subfolders, but it sits over the top of the main panel.</p>
<p>If I try and increase this panel size, it goes blank?</p>

            Hi HU,&nbsp;
<br />My name is Lucia. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting us.
<br />
<br />To help you not receive more emails from a specific sender Hadrian several ways
<br />
<br />1. Block a sender in outlook.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-a-mail-sender-b29fd867-cac9-40d8-aed1-659e06a706e4?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-...</a>
<br />
<br />Block or allow (junk email settings)
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-or-allow-junk-email-settings-48c9f6f7-2309-4f95-9a4d-de987e880e46?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Create an inbox rule to reject shipments from specific senders and so on
<br />avoid receiving more of these emails.
<br />
<br />Use inbox rules in Outlook.com
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/use-in...</a>

<br />
<br />I wish you help, let me know any questions

<p>Do not unsubscribe to mail you did not subscribe to. That just verifies your address is good and gets you on more spam lists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the messages are in the junk email folder there is nothing more to do - if they are in the Inbox, create a rule to delete mail with that subject.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi HU,
<br />Do you mean you are receiving bounces from an address? If it is always the same address, you account was compromised and there is a rule set to forward your mail to that address. Delete the rule or forwarding in Settings &gt; View all settings &gt; Rules and/ or Forward. Then Immediately change your password.

<div>Right-click a blank area of the bottom status bar and make sure that <i><u>O</u>vertype</i>&nbsp;is checked. It should be sixth from the bottom. This will put&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i>Insert/Overtype</i>&nbsp;status indicatror in the bottom status bar and you can click on it to toggle
 between editing modes.<br />
<br />
And of course, there is also the old standby of tapping&nbsp;<i>Ins</i>&nbsp;(i.e.&nbsp;<i>Insert</i>) key to toggle between

<p>Hello. &nbsp;I am a newcomer to the forum. &nbsp;I recently purchased a Verizon activated HTC Touch Pro 2 pocket pc phone. &nbsp;I noticed immediately that the transcriber function or block recognizer is not there. &nbsp;I really miss this functionality. &nbsp;Is there anyway to
 restore it in Windows 6.5? &nbsp;Are there any upgrades or downloads available?</p>

<p>Thanks for getting back Linley!&nbsp; I knew you would remember!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a caviat with this update that you should be aware of TechnoAttorney.&nbsp; On the installation instructions they have added this note:</p>
<p><em>Note: AP version control -&gt; The criterion will pass if the Touch Input for Pocket versions
<strong>is equal to Version 2.1 (Build 1920.2429), or lower</strong>.</em></p>
<p><em>To check the AP version : Press HOME then slide to Settings &gt; All Settings &gt; Personal &gt; Input &gt;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Tap the arrow to the right of the keyboard icon&nbsp;then tap About&gt; Touch Input for the Pocket PC Version</em></p>
<p>Sadly, my version does not meet that criteria</p>

<p><span><span>If that doesn't resolve the problem, then try the following two procedures in the order presented:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Troubleshooting and Internet Explorer’s (No Add-ons) Mode [Applies to IE7 &amp; IE8 in all OSS] - I realize trying to find the probem when actually in
 no add-ons mode might be difficult, but give it a shot.&nbsp; I think it's a special toolbar you downloaded that's causing this isssue (or some other add-on).&nbsp; Try enabling them one by one to see if one makes the problem occur - then you have the culprit.&nbsp; You
 may also have to try it in the mode you are in and one-by-one disable the add-ons until the problem goes away - restarting Windows after every change.<br />

<p><span>Resetting Internet Explorer's settings is not reversible. After a reset, all previous settings are lost and cannot be recovered.</span></p>

    <title>how to get windows 10 mobile public release on unsupported phones. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            how to get windows 10 mobile public release on unsupported phones.</h2>
                    <p>i have a Nokia Lumia 930, and i am getting the windows 10 <em>public</em> release. however, my friend has the lumia 1320, and he couldn't get the windows 10 update (which is strange because it has a dual core 1.7 GHz and 1 GB ram, which is faster then most
 windows 10 phones), so i installed the windows insider app for him and selected the
<em>Preview</em> Release (not fast or slow), because it is pretty close to what the public release gets except maybe off by a couple of days in certain updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>my question is though, if i leave the <em>preview</em> program will he still get the
<em>public</em> updates since he is on windows 10? or does he have to stay on the<em> preview</em> releases?</p>

</p><p>We understand that your friend would love to get Windows 10. However, if you leave Insider Program your phone will revert back to its original operating system. Since the model of the is still unavailable for the supported phones, it may takes sometime that
 you need to stay in Insider Program for Windows 10.</p>

<h3> bernadettecoogan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2007 Auto filter dissapearing on protected sheets shared workbook</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I have a spreadsheet which is being shared by multiple users. The sheet is protected and I have allowed autofilter to be used. I have dedicated a row which contains the autofilter arrows for each column. This seems to work fine most of the time.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the autofilter arrows seem to disappear now and again forcing me to set the autofilter back up. As the sheet is protected no one should be able to turn the autofilter on or off.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know why this is happening and how I can prevent it.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<h2>            Upgrading from Win 7 to Win 10</h2>
                    When I upgrade from Win 7 to Win 10 will it be a clean upgrade including a format that erases all existing files and programs?&nbsp; And can I go back to Win 7 at a later date?

<h3> may chee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype IM does not work on my Microsoft Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to connect my Skype to Microsoft Outlook 2013 (Desktop) so I can enjoy the IM features however I have not be able to. &nbsp;The funny thing is that I can use the Instant Messaging from my &nbsp;Hotmail Account (which is in my Microsoft Outlook as
 an Exchange Active Sync Account) so this is kind of driving me mad. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also logged in my Skype account from my Skype desktop application but I cannot see my Skype contacts in my Microsoft Outlook Contacts. In fact I have not got the choice to click the IM Icon neither the Call and Video Call icons. I have tried literally
 everything. What is what I am doing wrong? What is it?!!!&nbsp;I am not a happy girl so I am about to throw the towel in. I hope someone can help!!</p>

<p><span>If the issue is fixed in new profile, you may set the new profile as default and continue working with it.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click on Start, go to control panel</span></p>
<p><span>2. Mail icon, Show profile.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Highlight the new profile and click on always use this profile</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click ok.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it still fails, I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the Skype. Check if it helps fix the issue.</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try this:<br />
Copy that installation package to C:\ folder and start installation from there.<br />
<br />
if that did not help, check the digital signature of installation package (select that installation package &gt; right-click mouse button &gt; Properties &gt; Digital Signatures &gt; Details) -&gt; is that OK??<br />
<br />
If you can not find signature or it is not ok, download installation package again.
