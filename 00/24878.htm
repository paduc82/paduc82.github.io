            It sounds like the photos were in a format specific to that application. I just did a search "convert jpg.pt for Mac" and found several options.<br />
<br />
This forum is specific for help with Microsoft apps like Entourage, Messenger etc. For help with converting your Windows files for Mac is best asked on Apple Discussions.<br />

<h2>            Receiving e-mails from my own address</h2>
                    <p>I am asking this question again because I have read back previous answers but am still having the issue. If an answer goes to someone else as a private notification we are not privy to it. I am still receiving e-mails from my own address that are junk and
 need Microsoft to help fix this problem. I am also receiving e-mails that can't be blocked that will start with info . or admin..It is really an annoyance to have to deal with these daily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next issue is why when you block a junk e-mail from an insurance company or otherwise legitimate business does it still continue to come through? I have blocked Globe Life more times than I can count</p>

            <p>I have&nbsp;tried this but without success. Let me detail the nature of the problem.&nbsp;Office Home 2016 was preinstalled in my new windows 10 PC. Unfortunately I forgot to activate during "activation period". When I now try to activate I get the following error
 message "Account is not associated with Office product". I suspect the problem lies with my account settings which should be "View Only(Unlicensed), Microsoft Office Home &amp; Student 2016"&nbsp;rather than "View Only(Unlicensed), Microsoft Office 365" as currently
 shown.</p>
<p>If I am right how do I change my account settings ? or is there another solution ?</p>
<p>Can you come back with a detailed response rather than suggesting another line of support.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

            <p>If 2016 H&amp;S had been supplied preinstalled your PC maker/supplier would also have either supplied the key or had a method they detailed to activate and associate with an MS Account - its nothing to do with any account settings.</p>
<p>If a current Office Component shows 365 then its a 365 version and not Home &amp; Student 2016.</p>

            <p>Many thanks for your reply. Apps on desk top( Access, Excel, One&nbsp;Note, Outlook, Publisher, Power Point, Word) indeed supports your view that&nbsp;Office 365 version has been preinstalled&nbsp;on my PC. However, my PC purchase definitely includes a one off payment
 for 2016 H&amp;S(&nbsp;I specifically requested this package). Does this&nbsp;explain error message "account&nbsp;is not associated with&nbsp;Office product".
</p>
<p>How do I solve this ? Do I attempt to activate 365 version even though it is subscription based ?</p>
<p>Your views would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The problem has been solved. Unfortunately&nbsp;the booklet containing the Product key was initially overlooked. Once&nbsp;discovered&nbsp;I was able to use the Product key to activate Office Home &amp; Student 2016.</p>

    <title>windows 10 auto hide taskbar doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mpbarber329  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 auto hide taskbar doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; It seems that this is a chronic problem that has been going on for a long time and from what I can see on this forum, Microsoft has not been able to provide a satisfactory permanent solution.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; The suggestion of "right click and select properties" is hardly a solution since I would guess that every person who has this problem had to go through that process to get to the point that they found that it did not work............. As my children would
 say "DUH"!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; How is it possible that a company the size of Microsoft can not comprehend what it's costumers are telling them? And then, can't seem to provide a permanent solution to what in my opinion should be a very simple problem to resolve.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;The fact that there is this problem and that MS can't seem to provide a resolution is further evidence of the unnecessary complexity of their operating system that produces the never ending series of annoying little problems that take such an extraordinary
 amount of effort to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;SURELY THERE IS SOMEONE WITHIN THE MICROSOFT ORGANIZATION THAT HAS THE KNOWLEDGE AND WILLINGNESS TO&nbsp; PROVIDE A SOLUTION.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I am just a normal user...&nbsp; I selected the closest option I could from the drop downs on this site.........</p>

            Obviously, you don't understand the problem.&nbsp; Do you really believe all these people are having this problem because they don't understand how to hide the taskbar?&nbsp; There is a damn BUG (or, more likely,&nbsp;BUGS)&nbsp;in your software.&nbsp; For Christ's sake, quit
 avoiding the issue and FIX IT!!!!!!!&nbsp; This has been going on for at least 10 years!!!!!!

            I would think a person with your background that you would be able to fix the issue, as I don't have any issue with the taskbar on my 5 working systems suggest that you post in the Feedback Hub details about your system and just what is happening with
 your taskbar, remember people on here are not Microsoft employees just unpaid users who try to help others, &nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>How do I highlight current day column in calendar&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I highlight current day column in calendar&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>In the previous version of Outlook the current day of the week was highlighted - so when you looked at the overall work week it was easy to pick out which day it was - now its only the name of the day that is a different color. Is there a way back to changing
 the background color of the whole column or make it stand out in some other way?</p>

<p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>I understand that you want to make the current day stand out in the calendar view but not just the name of the day displays in a different color. There are no other ways to set it. Given the situation, I suggest you submit feedback to our relevant team via
 the link below if you want they include this feature to Outlook:</p>
<p><a href="http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273494-outlook-and-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273494-outlook-and-calendar</a></p>
<p>Many features have been designed or improved based on our customers’ valuable comments.</p>
<p>In addition, you can also post in our <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            UTH - UrgenTecHelp - Scammers</h2>
                    <p>Anybody who reads this, beware of calls from UTH saying that you have a computer virus or hacker attack on your computer. They will tell you that there's only about an hour left before your computer will stop functioning and they will tell you to spend a
 bad amount of money on "protection". They will not provide any proper protection, only some software to delete cookies which you can also do in your browser. They seem professional, but they most certainly are not. Tell them to shut up the moment they tell
 you what they wanna do. I accidentally fell for it the first time and almost a second time, but I watched what they were doing on my computer, which was absolutely nothing except change some appearance settings. I subsequently turned off my computer, turned
 it back on, denied them access and yelled at them thoroughly. My computer still works fine and doesn't have a single damn problem. Seriously, just tell them to shut up and ignore them afterwards. You cannot contact them back and I don't think I'll get my money
 back. Horrible people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>

            I resolved it finally after a long time with the help of a very patient Microsoft guy who had to remote access my computer for a while. Shame it took so long before someone agreed to help. Poor performance Microsoft but thumbs up to my saviour!

            You are better off copying music, videos, documents and pictures from the 620 to your PC and putting them on your new phone after it is setup with the 620 settings.

            <p>Yes, there is.&nbsp; On your existing phone, access settings-&gt;backup and ensure that all the options are turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tap on "apps + settings" in that settings screen and ensure that it's reporting a successful backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get your new phone, simply log in with the same Microsoft Account as your existing phone and your apps and settings will be copied across.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Music/Videos/Photos will remain on your OneDrive page, however but they're easy enough to copy back onto your phone if you need them.</p>

<h2>            Problems with Dumpster</h2>
                    <p>Suddenly a folder named "Dumpster" appeared when I turned on the computer this morning. &nbsp;It proceeded to fill up with both junk items and emails I wanted to save. &nbsp;I tried to allow a tech remotely fix this but she told me she couldn't disable Dumpster. &nbsp;I
 finally told her I'm abandoning Outlook to use Comcast's inferior but Dumpster-free email app.</p>
<p>

            Yes, same thing happened to me today. Dumpster filled with 14,000 emails. And, my junk folder filled up with 1000's of repeat emails. When I attempted to delete the items in junk, it just refilled with more emails. UGH

            <p>I contacted Microsoft about this. &nbsp;Apparently Dumpster is something new from them to retrieve deleted emails. I had a technician try to fix it and when she couldn't she brought in a Level 2 tech. &nbsp;When I found my patience wearing thin after a half hour I
 managed to get her to admit she hadn't encountered this before and I realized it would not be an easy fix. &nbsp;I canceled the session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully they will receive enough flak from this latest example of "bloatware" to either fix it or eliminate it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. &nbsp;Note that so far you are one of three people having the same issue.</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.<br />
<br />
As Windows 10 is a new operating system, the programs might not have got designed to work as usual. I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check if any third party program is causing the issue.
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Clean boot will </span>eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing
 a clean boot.<br />

<br />
Note: Follow </span><strong><span>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</span></strong><span>
 from article KB929135 to reset the computer to normal mode.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

            <p>Please apologize, I had not thought about that before I wrote the post. The FOR EACH loop that I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folder.Items(i).Move Outlook.Session.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderDeletedItems)<br />
&nbsp; Next</p>
<p>And for the value problem with G3, remove the formula and add this lines</p>
<p>&nbsp; 'Copy the part after the last blank inside Value<br />
&nbsp; Value = Mid$(Trim$(Value), InStrRev(Value, " ") + 1)<br />
&nbsp; 'Remove the ")" from the end<br />

    <title>Auto reply rule not sending to replyto address - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Auto reply rule not sending to replyto address</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a website that has a contact form, if a customer uses the form, the server sends me an email from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, the replyto address is set as *** Email address is removed for privacy *** by the website.&nbsp; So if I open the email and click reply, then it will send an email
 to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to streamline I set up a rule in outlook that will automatically reply to these emails from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with a specific template.</p>
<p>"Apply this rule after the message arrives</p>
<p>with XXX in the subject or body</p>
<p>reply using template.oft"</p>
<p>Unfortunately the rule seems to ignore the replyto address and sends an email to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** instead of *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I solve this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            Correct, it wont use the reply to address, which is a problem with website emails.  
<br />
<br />To reply to a reply to address using a rule, you need to use a run a script rule - as long as you can run macros, I have a script and instructions here: <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/developer/run-a-script-rule-autoreply-using-a-template/#replyto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/developer/run-a-scrip...</a>

<h2>            New to Windows 8 phone and OS</h2>
                    <p>Phone is a Samsung ATIV Neo.&nbsp; Our initial primary login was done for Xbox.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we change the primary login to my MS account, and not what my husband entered, without doing a total reset of the phone (we don't want to loose any data we have on the phone).&nbsp;
 Is it possible to enter my account as a secondary MS account and then delete the original account?&nbsp; This is a newbie question. :-)

Hi Bob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i open my workbook, the design mode&nbsp;is always greyed out (disabled), in my&nbsp;case I click the "Visual Basic" in the left most under Codes and the Design mode will turn in colored (enabled).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try it, does it work now?</p>

                    I had used Microsoft Money 2007 until aprox 2008. To this day, I have not been able to cancel the subscription, they have no record of me, but yet they continue to bill me monthly 6.95...how can I make it stop?!

            If they can't find a record of you, and this is a recurring payment, it may be worth it to go to your bank and have a stop payment placed on that.&nbsp; Or, one simple way is to close your account and open a new one, which is what I should have done when trying
 to cancel a much larger recurring payment that needed to stop.

<h2>            6120 radio not working&#63;</h2>
                    I've recently got a Nokia 6120 Classic, and the radio appears to be not working.<br />
<br />
I go to the visual radio app, manually tune it into a station (or acquire a list) and it doesn't work. It has a little yellow bar next to the station name, I don't know what this means!<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Isn't the little bar next to the frequency? That's just the design.<br />
However you need 3 premises to use the radio.<br />
1st connect a wired headset. It acts as antenna.<br />
2nd you need of course a radio signal<br />
3rd stupid Nokia developpers made it indispensable to have GSM network to listen to the radio. It would actually only be needed if you wanted additional information of the radio stations. But they didn't consider that most people don't want any "visual" radio.
 RDS would have been much better.

<p>Has anyone found the answer to this vexing question. The radio used to work - but after an upgrade it no lomger does.</p>
<p>I used to be able to manually tune it to a local FM radio station, and it worked fine. No all I get is static. No radio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously a lot of people are having this problem, judging by the number of views of the postings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Derek,<br />
<br />
For starters, you could run this highly recommended online scanner. Clear out your temp files, and Browser cache first to shorten scan time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ESET Online Scanner<br />
<a href="https://www.eset.com/us/home/online-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.eset.com/us/home/online-scanner/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a small app, and if anything's found, you'll need to let it restart your system.</p>
<p>AdwCleaner&nbsp;<a href="https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>MBAM i.e.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/premium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes Free Trial</a> is the best AntiMalware app. It'll give you 14 days of real-time protection. After which, it'll revert to an on-demand scanner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can install more than one antimalware app but only one can be used to provide real-time protection. Another good one is:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/superantispyware_free.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SUPERAntiSpyware&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Running those should give you a good idea if your system's free of malware. :)</p>

<h2>            How do You Print Territories in MapPoint 2010&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've looked everywhere for help: MapPoint Help, Microsoft FAQs, customer service, and microsoft support.&nbsp; I appreciate whatever help you can offer.</p>
<p>Is there a way to print selected territiories on MapPoint?&nbsp; I am trying to present what coverage I have in all the states.&nbsp; I would like to print out the states individually, so I will make them all territories and assign them a color.&nbsp; I'm doing this one
 state at a time so that the selected state stands out from the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now when I print the page has the state and surrounding areas, but the picture is small.&nbsp; i need the state to take up the full size of the paper, so&nbsp;I can present it.&nbsp; On the printer
 options I have selected "current map view" and "extend view to fit the page" but it still does not produced the results I want.&nbsp; Is there a way a to print the selected territory, full-sized and by itself?</p>

<p>Try dragging a selection rectangle around your territory (using the right mouse button).&nbsp; Leave the selection rectangle in place and go up to File &gt; Print and choose "Selected Map Area"</p>
<p>See if that gives you better results.</p>

<p>This helps a lot.&nbsp; Is there a way to "extend the image to fit the page" while still "selecting the map view"? I'm trying to print a full-size image of the territory.&nbsp; I'd like it to fill the entire page.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is possible that some conflict has occurred when you're setting up the view of the calendars in Outlook. For us to efficiently assist you, we would like to know if you're accessing your email account through the Outlook app or through a web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using the Outlook app, for isolation purposes, we recommend that you repair your Microsoft Outlook application by following the steps provided in this

<p>I'm having a similar issue. I sometimes&nbsp;have the Calendar open, with my two calendars overlaid. I'll be working on something else on a different monitor&nbsp;with Outlook in the background, and I'll see the calendars switch to side-by-side. I'm using the desktop
 program for Office Professional Plus 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the repair option, <del>but now I can't open Outlook because "Cannot display the selected folder or item." I figured this would just be an Outlook issue, so it wouldn't involve our IT staff, but now I guess I'll have to send in a helpdesk ticket.</del></p>
<p>
</p><p>False alarm. The repair might have broken my pinned icon on the taskbar, but I got it to work by finding Outlook in my list of programs. I've now unpinned and repinned Outlook, and it opens correctly now. I'll keep an eye on my calendars&nbsp;to see if I still
 have the issue with the overlay not persisting. If it doesn't happen for a week or so, I guess I'll consider it fixed.</p>

            I'm aware of this happening to my account and others. The calendars I'm trying to keep in overlay view for the monthly format are shared calendars for our conference rooms. I'm not sure if that makes a difference.&nbsp; I do know two other folks can't get the
 overlay to stay either, but most folks here don't try to do that view, so I haven't heard any feedback from others. &nbsp;

<p>I will say the vertical side by side view will continue to stay and then I have to press all the arrows to overlay the 4 calendars on top of each other, so half of the view kinda stays, as those calendars remain check marked as calendars I want on the view,
 they just don't stay overlayed on top of each other so that all calendars are different colors on the same monthly calendar so that I can easily see who is free and plan meetings around it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for that information. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that's the case, we will be needing a screenshot of your calendar view before you leave your calendar tab and once you go back to it. A screenshot will help us determine what could be the cause of the issue.

            Based on the image provided above, there might be some corrupted data from the Outlook itself. Have you tried updating the Outlook app and try to repair it again to make sure that changes will take effect?

<h2>            Delete and repurpose email address as a Group</h2>
                    <p>On my current Exchange 2010 server we have an email address *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Now that we are moving to O365 I would like to create a Group called ABC with the subsequent email address *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Can I just delete the old account, and will it O365 allow
 the use of the old email address?</p>

<p>Hello Garren,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting your query here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, the Office 365 dosen't allow the duplicate names of the mailbox. So, in my opinion, it allows to use that email address after the older account is removed completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the above information helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rudy</p>
