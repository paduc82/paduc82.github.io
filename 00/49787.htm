    <title>Can I upgrade from Vista Home Premium 32bit to Windows 7 Professional - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> owlovethbl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I upgrade from Vista Home Premium 32bit to Windows 7 Professional 64bit&#63;</h2>
                    I basically wanted to triple-check the compatibility of my current laptop in terms of upgrading from Vista to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
As a student I can get windows 7 professional 64-bit for £30. At them moment I'm running a 32-bit version of vista home premium, and I wanted to confirm my laptop is up to running a 64-bit O/S, and also that upgrading from a 32bit version of Vista to a 64bit
 version of Windows 7 is possible.<br />
<br />
I have run the Windows 7 upgrade advisor, and it says that everything should be okay in terms of my hardware specifications.<br />
<br />
The results from the upgrade advisor 64 bit version:<br />
<br />
- <span>"Your graphics adapter supports the Windows Aero user interface"<br />
- CPU speed: 2.1GHz<br />
- 3.0GB of RAM (I know this to be 4GB but 32bit vista can't handle the truth)<br />
- 80.7GB free on C:<br />
<br />
The advisor does warn me that I'll have to do a clean install rather than an upgrade. I'm not worried about this, as I can save my files on an external hard drive.
<br />
<br />
All I want to know is, will I definitely be able to upgrade from Vista Home Premium 32bit, to Windows 7 Professional 64bit, with the upgrade kit here http://store.digitalriver.com/servlet/ControllerServlet?Action=DisplayHomePage&amp;Locale=en_GB&amp;SiteID=msshgb at
 the bottom of the page?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

            <em>http://www.microsoft.com/uk/education/studentoffer/ it says that an upgrade to Windows 7 Professional is possible with a clean install.<br />
<br />
</em>No doubt you qualify for the upgrade pricing to Windows 7 Professional from any edition of Windows XP or Vista (except Starter). What I was referring to was logical in place upgrade paths that will preserve your personal files, settings and installed applications.
<br />
<br />
<em>Are you sure that I can only upgrade my Vista Home Premium to Windows 7 Home Premium/Ultimate, and not to Windows 7 Professional?</em>
<br />
<br />
If you want Windows 7 Professional, no problem, but understand, an in place upgrade from Windows 7 Home Premium cannot be done, you will have to backup your personal files and settings first then do a clean install and reinstall all your applications and drivers
 necessary. <br />

            You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.<br />
<br />
Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.<br />
<br />
Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.<br />
<br />
http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/<br />
<br />
Upgrade paths:<br />
When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. In your case, you can upgrade to Windows 7 depending on edition and architecture of Windows Vista
 you have installed. If you are running a 32 bit version of Vista and want to upgrade to a 64 bit version (edition of Windows 7), you will have to a do clean install, this applies vice-versa.<br />
<br />
If you are running consumer editions of Windows Vista such as Home Basic or Premium, you can only upgrade to either Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate. Also, you can do downgrades, which means, if you are running Windows Vista Ultimate now, you cannot downgrade
 to Windows 7 Home Premium. You must do logical upgrades:<br />
<br />
Windows Vista Home Basic &gt; Windows 7 Home Basic, Premium or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Home Premium &gt; Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Business &gt; Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Enterprise &gt; Windows 7 Enterprise<br />
Windows Vista Ultimate &gt; Windows 7 Ultimate.

<h2>            How to Boot USB Drive in Secure Boot Mode &#40;UEFI&#41;</h2>
                    HP Notebook 15-f009wm<br />
OS: Windows 8.1 with Bing 32 bit<br />
<br />
Hello all,<br />
<br />
This is my problem:<br />
<br />
I can't get my USB drive to load while in Secure Boot mode and continue running into 'Boot Device Not Found. Please install an operating system on your hard disk' screen. The only method that works thus far is disabling Secure Boot mode and enabling Legacy
 Support. Here are the methods I have tried based on extensive research of various forums after several days:<br />
<br />
- Performed all the generic System Diagnostic tests (F2) + Memtest86 + sfc /scannow multiple times after every fresh install + physically checked HDD. Performed all HP recommendations:
<a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c01443463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c01443463</a><br />
<br />
- Did multiple fresh installs of Windows 8.1 with Bing (32 bit) erasing all partitions from hard drive every time (my system is designed for 64 but I only have access to a 32 ISO). Installed using Legacy Support (I understand you can't go back and enable Secure
 Boot and disable Legacy once it has been installed this way but due to lack of any other way of installing Windows, I have no choice).<br />
<br />
- Used 'Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool' to create ISO which automatically formats drive to NTFS; converted to FAT32 using 'AOEMI Partition Assistant' software (preserving all partitions/data) but it still won't read.<br />
<br />
- Used 'Rufus v. 2.11.995' software to create ISO as FAT32 under several different setting iterations:<br />
<br />
1. GPT partition scheme for UEFI (this presumably should be the most appropriate setting but it still did not work). End Format: FAT32<br />
2. GPT partition scheme for UEFI (once with Dual UEFI/BIOS mode enabled and once again with it disabled). End Format: FAT32<br />
3. MBR partition scheme for UEFI (enabled/disabled). End Format: FAT32<br />
4. MBR partition scheme for BIOS or UEFI-CSM (enabled/disabled). End Format: NTFS<br />
<br />
- Hard Reset.<br />
<br />
- Disabled Security Boot AND Legacy Support together.<br />
<br />
- Tried changing BIOS settings mid-insallation of Windows from Legacy to Secure Boot (right after first reboot).<br />
<br />
- Rearranged boot order under every possible configuration. Loaded default settings.<br />
<br />
- <span>With the <span>Internal Network Adapter Boot</span> disabled by default in BIOS while in Secure Boot mode, the flash drive won't even read in F9 Boot Manager. Once INAB is enabled, the flash drive is recognized and allows access to the files in the
 folder but none of the files will boot as the next screen that pops up every time states: "Selected boot image did not Authenticate. Press Enter to continue." and it just takes me right back to Boot Manager.</span><br />
<br />
I don't understand what the problem is. I'm using a FAT32 format designed for UEFI as well as GPT partition also best suited for UEFI. I've even created the ISO with both UEFI and BIOS compatibility for each iteration. I've arranged the boot order for USB Flash
 Drive to boot first. The ISO boots fine in Legacy. What am I missing here?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.

            <p><strong>SOLVED!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, thanks to another user from another site I had posted on, I received the answer I was looking for and am posting it here for anyone's future reference. The problem lies in the 32 bit version of Windows I had installed:<br />
<br />
<em>" 32bit is unable to boot on a UEFI GPT disk computer. Only 64bit will work."</em>
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn640535%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn640535(v=vs.85).aspx</a><br />
<br />
I downloaded a Windows 8.1 Single Language 64 bit ISO strictly as a test (as Microsoft doesn't make Bing version available (yet?) for download), used Rufus to set partition scheme to GPT for UEFI and file system as FAT32 and created the new image.
<br />
<br />
<strong>WARNING</strong>: <em>If your laptop came with Windows 8 or 8.1 with Bing you will not be able to install any other version of Windows 8 or 8.1 other than Bing. You might be able to use a generic key during setup to get it installed but your Windows
 will not be activated afterwards as your OEM key is integrated into your firmware and will not activate any other version of Windows 8 other than with Bing. Make sure you have secured either a recovery partition or ISO of this exact version before wiping off
 your hard drive. If you have used the correct Windows 8 with Bing ISO you will not be asked to enter a product key during setup but rather will be taken straight to the Terms &amp; Policy agreement page.</em><br />
<br />
Once I plugged in the flash drive, it booted right away into installation setup while in Secure Boot enabled / Legacy Support disabled mode. This was what I was trying to do all along.<br />
<br />
Regarding my other laptop with the Windows 10 experiencing the same problem: I was so preoccupied with fixing the Windows 8.1 laptop that I never bothered to reformat my flash drive to GPT and FAT32 and had mistakenly installed the correct 64 bit but as a NTFS
 file system. All I had to do was create a new image with the right settings (above) and sure enough Windows 10 recognized the flash drive immediately and I now have Win 10 installed with Secure Boot enabled / Legacy Support disabled.
<br />
<br />
Lesson learned: <br />
<br />
1. Download correct 64 bit ISO and don't settle on 32 bit even though the OS will still work for the most part.<br />
<br />
2. Format your flash drive as GPT partition and FAT32 using Rufus - Don't use Windows USB/DVD Download Tool as it automatically creates NTFS format without you being able to control its settings and it also doesn't provide you options on controlling the partition
 schemes. Rufus will save you a lot of time and running around.<br />
<br />
3. If installing a fresh Windows, boot the ISO with Secure Boot enabled/Legacy Support disabled otherwise you can't change it afterwards.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm having the same problems as Jake. I tried all the steps you suggested as well as making a local account like Jake did. Still, Edge is stuck, and doesn't load any webpages. Do you have any other suggestions?</p>

            Edge seems to have problems with certain sites; like Instagram.&nbsp; You drill down into the site and Edge, if not the PC, crashes.&nbsp; Leaving aside the arcane solutions being proffered by Microsoft support and such my solution is easy.&nbsp; Use a different browser.&nbsp;
 Mozilla/Firefox works for me, and quite frankly (no offense meant) is more reliable. &nbsp;

    <title>Printing only works for Administrator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benedikt berger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing only works for Administrator</h2>
                    <p>I have two users on a PC, an Administrator account and a local user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately printing only works for the Administrator account. The printer in use is the HP Officejet 4580.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can not be the issue / what I have tried so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>The local user account has access to use the printer.</li><li>The drivers are the newest directly from the HP website.</li><li>Granted full access rights to the TEMP directory</li><li>Tried to grant full access rights to /Windows/System32/spool (Windows prompts an error for some folders like /drivers even when the spool service is stopped).</li><li>Reinstalled the printer completely</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>What I have noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printing works if the application is run as Administrator&nbsp;</li><li>When setting to send prints directly to the printer without spooling then it works, but only until the PC is restarted. After restarting the PC all that is printed is a blank page.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried basically everything that can be found on the Internet to this topic and am hoping to find help here after nothing else helped.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Benedikt,<br />
<br />
This seems a bit odd.&nbsp; Do fill us in on this a bit further:<br />
<br />
1. Had the computer always had Windows 10 since you got it or was Windows 10 an Upgrade?<br />
2. When was the last time the regular users able to print using their log-ins?<br />
3. Is the issue true regardless which program the users use (Office, Notepad, WordPad etc.)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we would recommend running the <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_store/windows-apps-troubleshooter-run-the-troubleshooter/ff72e2de-e0c0-4122-ae9d-f5e174a29044">
Windows App troubleshooter</a>; this will scan your computer for errors and will attempt to correct them should any be found.<br />
<br />
We are keen on hearing back from you regarding this matter. </p>

            <p>Thank you very much for the reply, I appreciate it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The computer is rather new, it had originally Windows 7 installed though and was upgraded directly to Windows 10. The users have been created after, so to answer yoru second question, basically never so far has the regular users been able to print.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What I could try is to create another regular user and see if it works for that one.&nbsp;<br />
I will try that and the Windows App troubleshooter tomorrow or Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more ideas what I could try would be most welcome in the mean time...<br />

            <p>Hi Benedikt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also recommend that you look into downloading the "full feature" driver package for your printer.&nbsp; You may follow the trail described by our Microsoft Insider
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/cannot-print-after-upgrade-to-windows-10/5c3f4bda-e29d-4652-9928-2f22ccb8d174">
here</a>. Try the troubleshooter first and should that fail, then do the Full Feature driver package.</p>

            As it turns out there must have been some problem with the user account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've created a new local user account and everything worked fine for that account so I just transferred all the files etc. and deleted the other local user account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bit of work though and I do not know the reason behind this but at least it works now.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping me to resolve this issue.&nbsp;<br />

 go to update it.&nbsp; It updates everything yet the last update restarts the computer and is in a constant state of "updating" yet when I turn the computer off and on again, it starts up at 75%, goes to 81% and freezes.&nbsp; This has happened with two separate computers,
 I'm sending it to geek squad now and if they tell me there is hardware failure, someones is getting a lawsuit.&nbsp; This needs to stop.</p>

<p>Hi Solozoro,<br />
<br />
Windows Update issues are usually caused by corrupted Windows Update components, software conflicts, interruptions, or hardware failure. Have you tried the JamesKaruntzos' solution? What worked for him might work for you too. Otherwise, follow the troubleshooting
 below:<br />
<br />
<strong>SOLUTION 1 </strong>- As initial troubleshooting, run the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update troubleshooter</a></strong>, and then get back
 to us with any error codes/messages that it finds.<br />
<br />
<strong>SOLUTION 2 </strong>- Download and install the update manually.</p>
<ol>
<li>Take note of the update that fails to install.</li><li>Visit the <strong><a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Update Catalog</a></strong>, and then search for the update's KB number.</li><li>Download and run the downloaded file to install it.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SOLUTION 3</strong> - Delete the Software Distribution folder. This folder is used to store temporary Windows Update files.<br />
<em><strong>Important</strong></em>: The only time that it is recommended to modify or make changes to the said folder is when Windows Update issues needs to be addressed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Temporarily stop the Windows Update Service (<strong>wuauserv</strong>) and Background Intelligent Transfer Service (<strong>BITS</strong>) through elevated Command Prompt. Press
<strong>Windows+X</strong>, select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>, and then enter the following commands:<br />
<strong>net stop wuauserv</strong><br />
<strong>net stop bits</strong></li><li>Navigate to <strong>C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution</strong>, press <strong>Ctrl+A</strong> to
<strong>Select All</strong> of the folder's contents, and then press <strong>Delete</strong>. Also delete the folder itself.<br />
<em><strong>Note</strong></em>: If you are unable to delete some of the files, restart the PC. After restarting, run the above commands again.</li><li>After you have emptied the Software Distribution folder, start wuauserv and BITS again by entering the following commands in elevated Command Prompt:<br />
<strong>net start wuauserv</strong><br />
<strong>net start bits</strong><br />
</li></ol>
<p><br />
Let us know how it turns out.</p>

<p>Dead by Daylight</p>
<p>Dark souls 3</p>
<p>Tom clancy's Rainbow six siege</p>
<p>Duelyst</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;this is 4 out of 7-8 games that i have tried opening, the others worked fine. Also they all seem to crash a specific amount of time after i open them, so im pretty sure it isn't something in the game files triggering the crashes.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Programs that dont work:</p>
<p>Scptoolkit (makes a ps3 controller work on a pc)</p>
<p>And f4se script extender (an important mod for fallout 4)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following:</p>
<p>Reinstalled games</p>
<p>Disabled the xbox dvr</p>
<p>scanned my pc for virus/corupted files</p>
<p>updatet, all drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now completely lost and dont know what to do so please help if you can.</p>

<p>Hi Christoffer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a tool that repairs your computer from Windows Update errors. The <strong>
<span>DISM or System Update Readiness tool</span></strong> can repair and troubleshoot corrupted files generated during the update to make your computer run normally again. This means that it is imperative to restore
 the important components of Windows. Visit this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to learn how to execute the
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DISM tool (Deployment Image Servicing and Management)</span></strong>. Before you proceed, we suggest that you back up your data just in case you lose any of your files while troubleshooting the issue. Also, update your display
 and graphic drivers since Windows Update sometimes resets devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you can play those games again after performing the troubleshooting steps above.</p>

<p>Would it fix my problem if i went back to the older version of windows?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 - 100&#37; Disk Usage in Device Manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chester armstrong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - 100&#37; Disk Usage in Device Manager</h2>
                    <p>A concerning issue I am currently facing with my PC is the disk usage, where my PC is best described as lethargic during start up, and less commonly but evidently unresponsive afterwards. Upon checking the task manager, it informs me the disk usage is at
 100% - so obviously something is draining this feature. What isn't so obvious is what is causing this, despite the task manager alerting me to the numerous software which is causing it. I&nbsp;<em>end the task</em> for the notable issues, and the 100% warning still
 remains.&nbsp;This has happened to me over a year ago, and I did a restore and wiped everything. This fixed the issue for me&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">temporarily</span>, and the 100% disk usage came back to me within a few weeks. At the moment I
 have 1.2TB of the 1.81TB SSHD space free, and my computer specs are below (I don't know if this will be useful).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/24e2a6f2-8df8-4416-bd42-fccd5ccc07ab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/24e2a6f2-8df8-4416-bd42-fccd5ccc07ab" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched online and I have found a guide which I have linked <a href="https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fix-100-disk-usage-in-task-manager-improve-pc-performance-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. I have completed each and every step that the guide asks me, and I keep running into this 100% disk usage. For a run down, I have:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Disabled Windows Search</li><li>Disabled Super Fetch</li><li>Performed a Disk Check (Took 8 hours, did nothing!)</li><li>Reset Virtual Memory</li><li>Changed the settings in Google and Skype</li><li>Fix the "StorAHCI.sys driver"</li><li>Updated device drivers</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>At this moment, I am stumped into what to try next. I am reluctant to restore everything off my machine again, as the issue came back to me within a few weeks. Any tips and suggestions would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
Chester</p>

<p>Hi Chester,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Task Manager shows the disk to be at 100% utilization despite a light or no workload, and the system may experience lag or become unresponsive.

<p>I did the suggested method above but unfortunately to no avail. So I decided to do a factory reset, and get everything off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I did the initial set up, I found that the disk usage is still 100%, noting "SuperFetch" was the notable culprit. So I disabled and rebooted, and still 100%. This time noting the
<strong>OneDrive</strong> - so I uninstalled that, and rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now its fine! Whether OneDrive was the original culprit I will never know, but for now, its fine. I've noticed it hover to 40%, but now its between 0-5% so this will hopefully resume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for reference, when should I be worried about the disk usage. 100% obvious, but is 40% safe to run at for long periods?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It's just noted down under the system. I have followed all the procedures recommended to be, and I am still suffering with disk usage. Microsoft's recommended suggestion is simply not working for me, despite seeing it work for other people. Windows 10 is
 freshly installed, there's barely any applications on there! The only custom applications downloaded are 'steam', 'chrome' and 'origin'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you recommend?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi MS Support Team,</p>
<p>I am also using windows 10 on a laptop. I started facing this issue 3-4 weeks ago... Windows became slow and unresponsive. I have followed instruction and guidance on the web to implement following fix</p>
<p>1. Disable windows search</p>
<p>2. Disable Superfetch</p>
<p>3. Change google chrome setting</p>
<p>This has brought down the disc usage from 100% to 93% though doesn't fully resolve the issue. With just a browser running, the Memory is at 70% and Disk usage is at 93%. CPU usage is only 10%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure about the source of this issue, but will definitely need MS support to resolve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>Balajee S</p>

            ривет  Юрий, мне жаль, что это мошенничество, эти ключи продукта Windows 10 не являются подлинными, они будут работать некоторое время, а затем сбой. , ,
<br />
<br />Через пару месяцев ваш компьютер снова потребует активации, поэтому, в то время как цена дешевая, она будет стоить больше в будущем

            Они являются подлинными ключами продукта Microsoft, они фактически являются розничными лицензиями, но предназначены для определенного канала продукта либо Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN), либо TechNet для ИТ-специалистов, которые платят абонентскую плату. Основная цель - для целей оценки. Самое замечательное в них, в отличие от пробного программного обеспечения Microsoft, ключей MSDN или TechNet, не заканчивается. Поскольку соглашение, согласно которому предоставляется подписка, является единой лицензией, ни одно программное обеспечение не должно распространяться вне

<br />В вашем случае, что, вероятно, произошло, вы купили лицензионный ключ MSDN, который имеет до 10 активаций, в отличие от полностью упакованных розничных лицензий, которые имеют только 1 активацию. Человек, который продал его вам, вероятно, продал его 10 другим лицам. Где-то в пути один из этих людей мог установить его на вторую систему, активировав его, поскольку он прошел через 10 порогов активации, Microsoft обнаружила, что его злоупотребляют и блокируют ключ от дальнейшего использования.

<h2>            Unable to hear or talk to people in party chat, and am unable to message people on xbox or smartglass</h2>
                    
<p>I had my account suspended, and I was unable to submit a case review. I honestly have no idea why I was suspended, but it doesn't really matter. The suspension is over and for some reason I am still unable to talk to people in a party. I am able to receive
 all types of messages and invites, but for some reason I am still unable to send messages or communicate in partys.</p>

<p>When I send a message on xbox or on smartglass it shows that it has gone through like normal.... No error message. The message doesn't actually reach the person I send it to for some reason. The suspension said I was banned from communications until July
 5th, 11:56 p.m (utc). I don't know why in the world they use UTC, but that means it was over at 7:56 p.m. (est) for me yesterday. At that point I was able to play games that I was previously unable to play because of the ban, but everything else still wasn't
 working even though the ban was over.</p>

<strong>[Mod Removed - Profanity]</strong> but yet some how when I said the word
<strong>[Mod Removed - Profanity]</strong> because I overreacted and got mad I got immediately banned I do deserve the ban but yet somehow you guys wont take immediate action to that too? Not complaining just wondering why he wouldnt get banned too

<h2>            Japanese IME predictive pop up in Top Left corner of the screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night I went to bed while Windows was getting updated. However, this morning when restarting windows as usual, after the update, I discovered that when typing in Japanese with the Japanese IME keyboard that I have been using for ages, it started behaving
 in a way in which I had to, literally, stop using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normal behaviour: when typing with the Japanee IME keyboard, the predictive options appear right below the text input.</p>
<p>Weird behaviour: when doing the same, the predictive popup options appear in a window located in the TOP LEFT position of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just can't get used to it because I started feeling dizzy moving my eyes over and over again from the text input to the corner of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling and installing again the keyboard. No changes.</p>
<p>I decided disabling text prediction, but still, when I push space key twice to select another kanji, the options available appear again in the top left corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to handle this situation?</p>
<p>I type in Japanese on a daily basics because I have to, and now I am stuck using Google translate service to type whatever with their japanese keyboard tool and then copying and pasting to the place when I need that text to be. It is REALLY troublesome and
 slow. And of course using instant messaging with my partner seems impossible and now I have to use English with him just because this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help &gt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi Laura,</p>

<p>I don't understand the relation between Japanese IME keyboard and drivers. I am not talking about a real keyboard, like physical keyboard, I am talking about the "software" available in windows to type in Japanese. That is just software.</p>
<p>Also, the popup window showing predictive text is related to software as well, the operating system determines where to show the pop up when the Japanese IME software tries to show that popup. And it determines to show it far from the text field. Again how
 is that related to drivers.</p>

<p>This happens when you use some software (like MS Word) and you activate IME while it is open.</p>
<p>

            Of course it happens when using some software and activating IME! IME needs to be activated to work at all!

<h2>            Cannot stream radio anymore...</h2>
                    
<p>I am using Vista 32 Home Premium<br />
Internet Explorer 8<br />
<br />
All of a sudden I can't stream radio anymore.&nbsp; Some station's players just load the pages, and I'll see the status as such (in quick succession)&nbsp; Connecting to Media...&nbsp; Opening Media... Ready<br />
Nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Another station gives me a popup window that says:&nbsp; 'We're sorry, but this media appears to be unavailable, would you like to reconnect?'<br />
I go to my wife's computer and everything is fine.<br />
<br />
These are the solutions I've tried so far with no success:<br />
<br />
I went to WMP Options, Network tab, and all the options are check (RTSP/UDP, RTSP/TCP, HTTP).&nbsp; Allow player to receive muli-cast streams also checked.<br />
I went to file types to make sure WMP is default player for MMS.&nbsp; Still no results.<br />
I tried running IE (no add-ons), same result.<br />
I tried registering the wmsdkns.xml file in the command prompt.&nbsp; It succesfully registered it, but same result.<br />
I tried DELETING the same file so WMP would re-create it.&nbsp; It did, but same result.<br />
<br />
I'm running out of patience.&nbsp; Please help!</p>

            Hi, I have been noticing a little erratic behavior on mine too.<br />
<br />
Try rebuilding the IP stack :<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search Box -&nbsp;&nbsp; commmand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
enter each of these individually and hit enter after each one.<br />
<br />
ipconfig /flushdns<br />
<br />
nbtstat -R<br />
<br />
nbtstat -RR<br />
<br />
netsh int reset all<br />
<br />
netsh int ip reset<br />
<br />
netsh winsock <br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
Also try another player <br />
<br />
Winamp - free<br />
<a href="http://www.winamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.winamp.com/</a><br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
VLC - free (needs no codec)<br />
<a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Also check System Maker and Device Maker's Site for newer network and/or wi-fi drivers.<br />
(Do not just Update Drivers in Device Manager as it only will find old certified ones and MS<br />
is far behind in certifying.)<br />
<span>
<p>Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers <br />

    <title>Worst Console War Ever &#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sr50 saibot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Worst Console War Ever &#33;</h2>
                    
<p>This is first new generation console launch war I've ever seen that leaves me feeling a little disgusted. One positive thing I have to say is that almost all the negativity and cheap shots are coming from the Sony/Playstation fans side which makes us Microsoft/Xbox
 fans much better people.</p>
<p>I have a couple of theories about what makes a Playstation fan so ignorant and immature, feel free to disagree as they are still just theories.</p>
<p>1st Theory, Repressed Resentment :</p>
<p>I think that Xbox has clearly and definitively won this current gen of console, Xbox did it better than Playstaion.... We Won. &nbsp;Now that both next gen consoles have been revealed and Sony wins on paper, the Sony fans got a wiff of implied victory and are
 coming out in force trying to make up for the loss of the current gen with about 7 years of repressed resentment for Microsoft and starting a hate and slander campaign across the entire internet (lol) disrespecting the Xbox One to extreme's like stalking Xbox's
 You Tube channel slandering and starting arguments, seriously how many Xbox 360 owners here (besides the one's that own both consoles) are even subscribed to You Tubes Playstation channel little lone are subscribed just for purpose to spread hate, the worst
 part of course is that &nbsp;Jack Tretton and his associates continue to take cheap shots at Microsoft in front of the world giving the Sony fan base a reason to think that the ignorant attitude is actually something that is cool and alright. Does that theory resonate
 with anyone?</p>
<p>2nd Theory, Playstation Social Deficiency :</p>
<p>I suspect that the Playstation Social Societies ability to identify with the gaming community is equivalent that of 8th grade school social where the boys and girls are on opposite sides hall to afraid to approach each other. The lack of Sony's subscription
 to online gaming hindered their ability to make communications such as Party Chat or even the fact that PS3 did not ship with a headset put most Playstation users in a social deficit when it comes to interacting with other gamer's in a mature fashion. The
 whole trolling is king attitude of the Playstayion user is tantamount to their inability to even accept a random chat invitation from another gamer little lone actually be able to process or generate a stimulating conversation without becoming a shy little
 school boy or girl to awkward to talk. They have some serious catching up to do when it comes to behaving like people and talking about games without suffering the immature attitude of an awkward social retard. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Did that resonate with
 anyone.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to rant.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I think the change of this Generation to the next is one of the worst by far. It's a little of what the OP stated but something far worst and sinister, it's called the Internet. Never before has such a Vocal Minority been given
 a platform to yell, scream, cry, rant and give verbal abuse to others.<br />
<br />
Yes the Internet was around prior but to no degree that the Gaming Community really existed or bothered with it. With all the past Generations it was simply people bought what they wanted. This is still going to be the same this Gen but die-hards are going
 to be trying their best everyday, day in and day out in regards to discredit anything that opposes their point of view.<br />
<br />
For myself, I'm just going to buy what I want and participate in the Communities I choose.</span></p>

<p>You seem to miss the disgruntled XBox owners in your MS/Sony scenario. I preordered a XB but I'm not at all enthusiastic about it because I see the console HW as below my expectation for a new console generation. Meaning, I don't think I get a good deal
 and I don't think I'm just a small minority. It has nothing to do with some relative minor or bigger performance delta with a PS4. I care for absolute performance for games I'm looking for with the MS gamepad.</p>

            Hi Rich
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button
<br />
<br />Expand the Network adapters section
<br />
<br />What network devices do you see listed there?
<br />
<br />
<br />What is the Make and exact Model No. of your laptop - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . . .

            Hi Rich
<br />
<br />On most Lenovo devices the Cellular connection is an optional paid-for extra. While the SIM card slow will exist on all models, the other component - an LTE card or chip may not exist on your particular model
<br />
<br />I don't see a WWAN device listed in your Device Manager, which indicates, either your model does not have cellular capabilities or the device is not installed correctly
<br />
<br />You should contact Lenovo support an find out if your model was supplied with an LTE chip or card . .

<h2>            Skype Personal Screen Sharing &#38; Snipping Tool - Snips have gray tint over images now</h2>
                    <p>Help!&nbsp; I use Skype (not the business version due to client restraints) but personal one regular for a weekly meeting that I take PM notes for and when I opened Skype today it had me completely reinstall it again (which it does almost everytime).&nbsp; With the
 new UI when my boss shares his screen with the team and I am taking snipping tool clips and pasting them into my notes they have a gray layer over them.&nbsp; Images that would normally be white or crisp are now gray overlay and look darker and cloudy.&nbsp; Any one
 have any solutions for this?</p>
