            1. You can not downgrade.
<br />2. You will have to remove existing installation.
<br />3, Install the old version from following link
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-history-for-Office-2016-for-Mac-700cab62-0d67-4f23-947b-3686cb1a8eb7#bkmk_current" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update...</a>
<br />You will have to install entire Office package not only Outlook.

<p>Hi kaprabbu,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post and welcome to the forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you are using your mobile data to access the internet your operator may have restricted the use strictly to browsing. Operators may do this if they want to prevent people from using too much bandwidth and using the mobile connection as their primary
 access to the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the connection is working without any problems, it's likely that there is nothing wrong with your Nokia device. Your operator may have changed their policy recently and this why you have not had the problem before. So, we recommend that you contact your
 operator on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Puigchild</p>

    <title>How to raise old-style footnote numbers in the text&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> galahad72  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to raise old-style footnote numbers in the text&#63;</h2>
                    Word 2013 has a remarkably precise, reliable and comprehensive Advanced Find and Replace engine. Word doesn't allow my font,* which has both Lining and Old Style number forms, to use the latter as footnote indicators. I want the indicators to be Old Style
 numbers because that style is used everywhere else in the document, including the footnote numbers when they're used with the footnotes. This is despite the menu choice being made. In other contexts they're allowed.&nbsp;Yet Word will allow a "Replace All" of the
 Lining numbers by Old Style numbers, and it happens almost instantly.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But there's a problem. The Old Style numbers are situated lower than Lining numbers used as footnote indicators in the text. They're much harder to find, since they're both smaller to begin with and aren't nearly as high as letter ascenders and quote marks,
 whereas Lining numbers are naturally larger and are positioned to overtop ascenders and quote marks.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to raise the height of footnote indicators? I'm excluding specifying a larger point size, or bolding them.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>_____</div>
<div>*It may just be my font. Microsoft's flagship font, Gabriola, behaves as expected in footnote references when Old Style numerals are turned on. They're also plenty high enough.</div>
                </div>

            It isn't necessary to use the Replace function at all. Just modify the Footnote Reference style, which is automatically applied to all the footnote indicators both in the text and in the footnotes.<br />
<br />
Press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S to open the Styles pane on the right. If you don't see a lengthy list of style names, click the Options link at the bottom and choose to show all styles. Locate the Footnote Reference style, right-click it, and choose Modify.<br />
<br />
In the Modify Style dialog, click the "New documents based on this template" option. Then click the Format button at the bottom left and choose Font.<br />
<br />
In the Font dialog, go to the Advanced tab. After choosing Old-style in the Number Forms box, go near the top of the dialog and set the Position boxes to Raised by 2 pt (or 3 pt or whatever looks good). OK both dialogs.<br />
<br />
Your numbers should now all be Old-style and raised.<br />

            <p>Footnote Reference is a character style, so if you select a footnote reference mark and clear formatting (Ctrl+Spacebar), it will be reset. But you can easily reapply the Footnote Reference style (after defining it to your preferences).</p>

<h2>            Zune Software Doesn&#39;t allow 99&#37; of my music to sync with my Windows 7 Phone</h2>
                    I've been trying for the last 3 hours to get my Zune software to sync my music which I had no trouble playing/syncing with my Apple iPhone earlier today. I bought a HTC Windows 7 Phone and sold my iPhone , give it a try I said. BIG MISTAKE. I can't add
 99% of my music downloaded from any source/ripped from anywhere. I've downloaded music from SounCloud , the artists very websites, I've even used music my friend ripped for me. Randomly it seems to pick the ones it wants to add , not play , or make playlists
 of NO SIR. I can play them just fine add them to playlists just fine. But try or attempt to have them added to my collection by adding the folder in which they are contained, NO SIR. They will play all day, when I try to drag and drop them apparently they
 are invalid file types, but they seem to be valid enough to be made into unsyncable playlists or played through my speakers. But in no way shape or form can I add them to my phone. I've grown weary of searching and searching and searching for answers. One
 person suggested to change the tags in each song. Sorry but I don't feel like spending another 3 hours changing EVERY SINGLE TAG on EVERY SINGLE SONG it doesn't want to sync or considers an invalid file. Considering iTunes and VLC both disagree, being also
 that out of the thousands of songs only 29 seem to be VALID, ironically some of which downloaded through unknown means. Windows Phone is apt though, because it's about to go through one pretty soon and an old iPhone 3GS will take it's place.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is all I get when I attempt to sync my music. &nbsp;And the last picture is what I get when I click on WEBHELP. Wonderful broken links on a very needed help link. A round of applause to all those involved in this train wreck you call software.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Zune does not recognize some songs. Here is a weird thing. I get all my music from Nokia Music. I pay for it and everything. The songs are bought on my 820. Then, I transfer them to my PC. It works fine on every player I have on PC. It plays on every droid
 phone I have thrown those music into. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Oddly enough, my 510 cannot get any of this music. Zune won't recognize any music that I have bought from Nokia Music.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My guess is Nokia Music uses some insane DRM which all players don't care for&nbsp;except Zune. Pretty weird eh?
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On a side note. I hope you did not pay too much money on your HTC Titan II. windows phone 7 is somewhere between retired and semi-retired. The amount of support it gets is going to reduce with each passing week.

            60$ Too much? Yeah I think the Salvation Army is going to end up getting it. Make some little boy very happy this Christmas.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Yes very insane, it's making me go crazy. I was hoping it would open a new world free of Apple **** and brighten my horizon as to what I can use for a music player/all around phone. Without all the Apple/Android shortfalls/bloatware/Unclean looking UI
 . Eventually maybe buying a Windows 8 Phone. -_- nope! On my side note, they should really look into updating Zune Software, it seems to be the crux of a lot of issues with a seemingly straight forward phone OS.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>UPDATE: I got it working, Apparently having my music backed up on USB Drives/MicroSDHC cards seems to perplex ZUNE Software, into a frenzied "WhatThF" . After copying over ALL my music from various sources to THIS computers HDD it seems to be working fine.
 Which is great except now I have to go back and erase all of this **** because I don't need 3 copies of my music clogging up the family computer. I'm glad I'm not trying to use it as my main music player as that would be 10x the size of my "contemporary" music
 collection and obviously wouldn't fit on my HTC Titan of 16gb with no MicroSDHC slot (huh?!) The Silver lining , it's going faster than any sync on my iPhone has ever gone but EVERY now and again it will say it fails to make "A internet connection on my Phone"?
 Something to that effect, I have my phone on airplane mode and I don't get 3G in my area anyways, (But why should that even matter) ? Another WTF to add to the ZUNE bin. It should have been easy, using a windows computer and a windows phone. Not a mac in the
 house all USB and SD cards formatted to Fat32 , nothing special about it. MP3 all of them , nothing unique about them, apparently. Except they weren't on this HDD , if I had the patience I would test my portable HDD and see if the same issues are preset. Maybe
 another day today I'm glad I don't have to have 2 devices in my pocket and just one very large bulky one -_- , screen size is nice though. Can't complain.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your help Entegy </div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>PS . Computer still asks to install Zune software every time I connect the phone up even though it's been installed since yesterday. Jesus Christmas. -_- non issue though, thankfully synced just fine.</div>

            Sorry you had so much trouble. I used Zune for two years and never had an issue with it. In fact, I quite miss it.<br />
<br />
Windows Phone 8 doesn't use the Zune software at all and any media player can be used to sync with a WP8 device. Or you can just copy/paste files manually to the phone.<br />

<h2>            can&#39;t connect to store because of Family settings</h2>
                    so, today I bought Microsoft Lumia 640 and I tried to download an app but there was a problem cause it asked me to install "My Family" on Outlook settings. I searched about it and I found the steps for how to install Family (https://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/apps/set-up-my-family-for-windows-phone).
 I followed the steps and I managed to add me and delete me from the section, but again store did not worked. Then I figured out that by mistake the birth date was wrong (1998 instead of 1988), so I changed it, I synced the account on mobile and reset it but
 still nothing. So now what can I do? Please help!!!

    <title>Critical Error prior to system crash build 10130 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a1jungle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Critical Error prior to system crash build 10130</h2>
                    <p>I got a warning message that popped up concerning running out of virtual memory and to shut down some or all my programs or windows would shut down programs for me. I use iobit to monitor my cpu and RAM. I cleaned/defragged my RAM and it showed 48% usage
 and my cpu was running at about 3%. I had the following programs running at the time other than the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firefox with two tabs open.</p>
<p>IE 11 with three tabs open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next time I clicked my mouse on a program, my screen went black with just my GUI pointer visible and totally responsive in movement only. The rest of the screen was black. No response from keyboard or clicking with mouse. Ctrl + Alt + Del had no discernible
 effect. WIN + D, same thing. In fact, no keyboard or GUI interfacing would do anything but have the pointer move around the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After hard shutdown, and reboot, I checked the event log. Below is a screenshot of the event.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This has happened to me at least 6 times since build 10130 was installed. I sure hope it gets fixed soon.</p>

            Cleaning/defragging ram programs are snake oil and actually cause more problems than nowt. How much actual HD space left? That is the real problem, using virtual ram isn't going to fix anything if your actual HD space is to low.

<p>My actual available HDD is 275 Gb's on a 750 Gb system. This available space is taking into account any space already used by programs and virtual ram. Hence, when I say available, I truly mean that it is available space for whatever I choose to install
 on it. It is also on a regularly scheduled defrag on the HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more thoughts are welcome. I have been using consumer PC's since I had no HDD and loaded DOS from 5.25"flopies. Which by the way prior to build 10120, was the last time I had problems with low memory either physical or virtual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This never occurred no matter how many programs I was running when this machine was on Windows 7 and using the same physical and virtual memory settings, 8 Gb's DDR3 and 13 Gb's virtual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have posed this question before with no tangible answer so I will pose it again. Just how much memory does W10 take to run?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If 275 Gb's of free HDD, 8 Gb's of DDR3, and 13 Gb's or virtual RAM is not enough, just what is it going to take?</p>

<p>I only have one HDD and it is partioned for only one operating system. Other than programs installed, the only thing using up anything is the virtual RAM. So again, I will ask, just what is it going to take? 1 TB of virtual space in order to run W10? How
 come it was never a problem with the same system configuration and programs installed in W7, running as many programs as I liked, that I never once ran into running out of memory, either virtual and or physical?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that changed between then and now is the OS.</p>

</p><p>Well I got my answer for my 64 bit OS. According to MS, I need 2 Gb's or RAM and 20 Gb's of free HDD space. It did
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOT specify that you need </span>
</strong><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ANY virtual RAM at all for "paging".
</span></strong></p>
<p>With that being said, I have increased my virtual RAM (though I don't think it will make any diff what so ever) to 20 Gb's from 13 Gb's. And oh yes, since people must think I am stupid, I did restart my laptop after I changed the virtual memory. I can't
 think of any program on a PC of any kind that would require nearly 30 Gb's of combined RAM in order to not run out of memory of any kind.
</p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a8c3216-f24b-45b0-969d-cbe47438579a" />
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So according to MS, I more than exceed the minimum requirements. I still insist that 20 Gb's of virtual paging memory is waaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy to excessive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows does hover recommend how much virtual memory should be used via the advanced systems tab in control panel. I guess I will have to spell that out as well since I have to spell out everything else for some people, it says I only need 16 MB (min) and
 1908 MB recommended. I have 20,000 MB allocated. HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.</p>

                    I have just completed a 28-page booklet on Publisher 2010 and after saving it unto a CD I can't read the format. Instructions tell me to SAVE AS and then click on OTHER FORMATS. In the folders list, select a location or the media on hich I want to save
 it. My problem is that I have no idea where to find OTHER FORMATS in the SAVE AS window.&nbsp;

            <p>I don't think you should ever try saving directly to a CD. Save to your local hard drive and then burn a copy of the file to the CD. Then if you want to open that file again, copy it to your hard drive and open from there. In general do not save to or open
 from removable media.</p>

            <blockquote>I have just completed a 28-page booklet on Publisher 2010 and after saving it unto a CD I can't read the format. Instructions tell me to SAVE AS and then click on OTHER FORMATS. In the folders list, select a location or the
 media on hich I want to save it. My problem is that I have no idea where to find OTHER FORMATS in the SAVE AS window.&nbsp;
</blockquote>
=====================================================<br />
OK...if I understand correctly...the publication is already saved on the CD?<br />
<br />
If you wish to re-open the publication in Publisher...right click the .pub file<br />
on the CD and from the menu...choose...Open With / Microsoft Office <br />
Publisher.<br />
<br />
If you wish to open the publication in any program other than Publisher...<br />
it would have to be saved in a different format while still open in Publisher.<br />
<br />
For example...the entire publication could be saved as a .pdf file or each <br />
individual page could be saved as a picture in an image format like .jpg.<br />
<br />
If you wish to do further editing&nbsp;to the publication you will have to copy it <br />
back to your hard drive. Or you could&nbsp;create a new&nbsp;version of the publication <br />
by&nbsp;saving it to a folder on your hard drive and giving it a new name.

    <title>Can&#39;t access restored mailbox... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t access restored mailbox...</h2>
                    
<p>I restored an Office 365 user in order to archive the email box. I used the "Restore User" from the deleted user list in the Office 365 Admin Center. The user now appears in the Active User list and I have purchased an additional license and assigned it
 to the user for the archiving. In addition, the user's mailbox now appears in the list of mailboxes in the Office 365 Exchange Admin tool. However, when I click on the user in the Office 365 Admin Center, it says the user doesn't have an Exchange Mailbox,
 and if I select Edit, all of the information regarding email also says the user doesn't have an Exchange mailbox. If I try to access the mailbox via Outlook, it says the mailbox folders cannot be accessed.</p>
<p>So I used the "Restore User" function in the Office 365 Admin Center to restore the user and the mailbox (as instructed to do so in the Office 365 Exchange Admin tool), however it appears that the restored user is not linked to the restored mailbox. Is there
 some PowerShell magic to clean this up?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>WRK</p>

<p>I tried accessing the restored user account via OWA and received the following:</p>
<p>You need a license to use Office 365</p>
<p>Ask your admin to assign the correct license so we can get you on your way.</p>
<p>I went back to the user details in Office 365 admin center and removed the license, waited a few minutes, and then added it back. Now I have access to the restored mailbox via both OWA and Exchange. Once I archive the mailbox contents, I will delete the
 user again.</p>

            What should be one of the simplest ways at this point is:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Open the Cover Letter</li><li>Go to the very end (<span style="font-weight: bold">Command+End</span>)</li><li>Go to <span style="font-weight: bold">Insert&gt; Break&gt; Section Break (<span style="font-style: italic">Next Page</span>)</span></li><li>Go to <span style="font-weight: bold">Insert&gt; File</span></li><li>Select &amp; insert the resume document</li></ol>
<br />
As an alternative, you can generate each file as a separate PDF then:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Open the cover letter PDF in <span style="font-weight: bold">Preview.app</span></li><li>Display Preview's <span style="font-weight: bold">Sidebar</span></li><li>Locate the resume PDF file in <span style="font-weight: bold">Finder</span></li><li>Drag the resume PDF to Preview's Sidebar</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Save As</span> to a separate new PDF &amp; send that</li></ol>
<br />
IMO the latter is preferable - I avoid providing prospective employers with a document they can readily modify to suit their own agendas... Maybe I'm paranoid, but when you find that the owner's second cousin's high school dropout nephew got the job because
 he was "better qualified" perhaps you'll see it my way :-)<br />

<p>So it is a slow, careful, methodical rollout to verify that those that are installing are doing fine. Smaller areas are currently rolling out and as time goes on larger areas will get their update. Be patient, it will come!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as an FYI, my 950XL has the same as yours and I am waiting as well. It will come!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Still works (not) this way in Access 2016. I have a main form with two subforms, both linked to the main form. The forms use macros for editing, et.al. &nbsp;Everything including macros worked fine until I dropped it (them) into a Navigation form. Now the macros
 can't find the data item controls in the subforms. In the Builder the subforms appear with Report icons like the example above. I tried deleting and re-adding one of the subforms from within the Navigation form then drilling down to the data item controls
 in Builder. Same result. No go. Apparently Access thinks the subforms are reports.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer - urls in bar after &#34;delete history&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I'm a little confused about working of "delete history" button in Internet Explorer for Windows Phone.</p>
<p>When you do something like this:</p>
<p>1. Visit page X by entering url</p>
<p>2. Visit page Y by entering url</p>
<p>3. Go to settings, choose "delete history"</p>
<p>4. Leave IE by pressing Start button</p>
<p>5. Launch IE again -&gt; you will see page Y</p>
<p>6. When you press Back button you can still navigate to page X which&nbsp;<strong>should&nbsp;</strong>be deleted from history</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two ways to delete history of urls is to:</p>
<p>1. Open new tab and close the other one</p>
<p>2. Press back button as many times as many urls is in history</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's very annoying for me.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Are you sure? Try doing point by point my procedure in private tab - it works the same way. Backstack of urls is not cleared, you can quit IE, restart app and press back button to see previous visited pages.</p>

<p>You say that you emailed it to yourself. Did you get the email? What about looking in the Sent items of your email. If if it didn't show up in your Inbox, it might be in your Sent items or Outbox. Did you email it before you saved it or after you saved it?
 If you emailed it before you saved it, it would have sent the last version that was saved.</p>

<h2>            Unable to send email to specific domain</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We just migrated our email server to&nbsp;Windows Live Domain. Our domain &lt;nusantara-mini.co.id&gt; was once hosted on our private email server. Our domains &lt;nusantara-mini.co.id&gt; and &lt;nas.co.id&gt; was once hosted on the same server.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that we migrate our &lt;nusantara-mini.co.id&gt; domian to Microsoft, users from &lt;nusantara-mini.co.id&gt; are not able to send email to &lt;nas.co.id&gt;, and vice versa. However, sending to other accounts such as Gmail, Yahoo is fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there anything from the Microsoft side that I should do to resolve this issue? Please help!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Listed below are the possible reasons why you can't send emails to specific domain.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Domain has been blocked - contact the domain admin of ah.org. They may have changed some settings in their domain's system that's why you are having problems sending emails.</span>
</li><li><span>You've type the wrong characters.</span> </li><li><span>Browser security and privacy settings - </span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>reset Internet Explorer</span></strong></a></span><span> on its default settings.</span>
</li><li><span>Delivery failure or Delay notification.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>It would be very helpful if you could post the full message header of the bounce message that you received so we can provide you the appropriate resolution.

<p>Hey guys this is my first post here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently bought a nokia n96 from shanghai, china. Ofcourse, all the features are good but i didnt realize that it doesnt have 3G or wifi. I am an Indian and right now, I'm in shanghai on vacation. I will be taking my N96 back to india where there are no
 restrictions on 3G (although its available on only 1 network afaik).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to activate the wifi and 3G on my rm 297 N96 through some software update or something? Or there is no wifi hardware component itself in the mobile?</p>

            The hardware istelf is absent from the phones intended for the Chinese market. No amount of software changing will bring back that feature, I'm afraid.

<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I have "Office for Mac 2011," I can not find "Learning Essentials" or other Math or Chemistry Add-In that will run on my MacBook Pro with Snow Leopard and Lion OS. I would like to use the Learning Essentials on my Office 2011.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Are there any versions that exist for using on Mac?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help.</div>

            This is one of those times where I really have to bite my tongue, because I want to lash out the stupidity of ignoring Mac users on the part of Microsoft Education. Every school has a Microsoft Representative. I urge you to contact your representative
 and explain to that representative that you are a customer and that you use Microsoft products - on your Mac.<br />
<br />
That said, Microsoft Learning Essentials apparently hasn't been updated since 2005. The link you provided seems to be the current install link. I tried to install into Office 2010 for Windows in Windows 7, but the installer refused because the latest supported
 version is Office 2007.<br />
<br />
If you know someone with Windows and they have installed these tools, the templates and add-ins should work in Office 2011 by and large. But from the looks of this product, it comes with loads of Windows-only junk that was made without customers like you and
 me in mind.<br />

<h2>            Messages Not Sending On Skype</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I've been having issues with the Skype app for windows 10. Every time I send a message it just says sending and no matter how long I wait it never sends.This is happening to my PC and my laptop. Their both running Windows 10 Pro. If anyone knows how to fix
 this please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I have exactly the same problem and notice as Padraig. </p>
<p>My version of Skype is Skype 12.1803.279.0 ; of windows is&nbsp;Version 1709 (OS Build 16299.192) ; of the processor is Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU Q 720 1.60GHz</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, from Europe, I tried to send .PDF files, less than 1MB, by using the file-send icon and or by dragging the file to the message-sending panel, and they were marked File Sent, but not actually received by the other person (in USA), and a blue square
 with a X on it appeared next to each file. A notice said "The content of this message is unsupported."</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the same Skype session where my outgoing messages and files were not received by the other person, I received her messages without a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help, anyone!?</p>

<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently there&nbsp;was a known&nbsp;issue about sending instant messages, however this has been resolved already. If you're still experiencing the issue, try signing out and signing in to Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above information does not work, please do not hesitate to reply to this post.<br />
Thank you!</p>

<p>I have had this problem since lunchtime today.&nbsp; Signing out and back in is not solving it.&nbsp; I can see and hear my friend but when I type, there is just the blue arrow going around and around in a circle.&nbsp; We have both logged out and back in several times
 - but it is still the same.&nbsp; Frustrating</p>

            I've been having this problem for a while now. And I have the same problem with the app on my phone.<br />
<br />
Messages are just stuck in sending and once in a while they just send all at once. I really cant figure it out and it's getting frustrating.&nbsp;

            Yes, annoying.&nbsp; Somebody please resolve this problem.&nbsp; It's ruining the Skype experience.&nbsp; For two persons to get to agree on a Skype conversation they now have to use email, which is not seen instantaneously, and is thus a poor substitute for instant
 messaging.<br />

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using the Office Insider channel for some of our laptops on site. We have the 365 Click-To-Run installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that the 'Right click' &gt; 'Send to' &gt; 'Mail recipient' is not working while Outlook is running. It returns the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"This action is not supported while an older version of outlook is running"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The default email is set to Outlook. It works fine if we close Outlook first and try the function. There are no other versions of Office installed. I have moved back to the Semi Annual channel and the function works as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else noticed this? We'd like to keep using the Insider build.</p>

</p><p>Seems that we were not on the latest build. 1809 resolved the issue, but should Office Insider not update by itself?</p>

<p>If you have Auto Update enabled in your update settings it should update by itself. It is possible to have that setting turned off. You should be able to check that in the same place you checked for updates.</p>
