            1. jimmy already answered<br />
<br />
2. Go to Music Player&gt;All Songs&gt;Highlight Song&gt;Options. There should be options there for send, delete, mark/unmark<br />
<br />
3. Check settings. But if you are referring to a 2MP digital camera, as in an actual camera not a phone camera, such devices have sensors which are larger than the ones on phones. Basically a 3.2mp quality digital camera would usually have a better result than
 ANY 5mp phone camera.<br />
<br />
4. What error message are you receiving?<br />
<br />
5. Degrading touch sensitivity? care to elaborate? The thing is a resistive screen. Basically its as sensitive as how hard you tap it. Or maybe its just loading/lagging?<br />
<br />
6. If the themes are firmware embedded they cannot be un-installed

<p>i really agree with you, i have been using nokia phones since i was 12 year old i bought too many nokia phones and at that time nokia was the best , but recently i was shocked when i bought c5-03 i thought it would be good enough to compare it to other phones
 companies like samsung and iphone but it can't even be compared because its so bad, im going to list the bad things that i noticed and i hope nokia would do&nbsp;upgrade for this phone, i mean real&nbsp;upgrade like changing the whole system to better one, and im using
 the lastest update and it still bad.</p>
<p>the bad things below are the things i hate about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1- camera <span><span>Quality</span></span> is very bad, my old nokia phone that has only 2 mega pixel take better
<span><span>Quality</span></span> pictures.</p>
<p>2- the touch speed is very bad and not sensitive, i was not know that it has resistive touchscreen when i bought it i thought all touch phones comes the same</p>
<p>3- when you view photo and zoom in it takes forever to zoom, other phones doesn't even loading.</p>
<p>4- when you open program or game it takes long time to open.</p>
<p>5- the&nbsp;symbian is borning compared to andorid , i think they should work on their OS or use andorid instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>after all it's slow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is there soultion for these things? i hope so and i hope that nokia can allow us to install android on our nokia phones</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my next phone will not probably be nokia as i saw very cheaper phones comes with android and capacitive touchscreen.</p>

<h2>            Incompatibility Issue with Visio 2010 vs Visio 2007 &#38; Visio 2003 &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I believe I have encountered an incompatibility issue in the use of the Duplicate command in VBA Code (I believe I have seen this also in the drop down menu) too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I old VBA Code From Visio 2003 also works with Visio 2007 duplicate a shape that I use to store text.&nbsp; The issue is when then shape is empty (no text or empty text), the duplicate command will not work.&nbsp;&nbsp; It does work in Visio 2003 and Visio 2007, but in
 Visio 2010 is not allow or don't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone also experience this issue too ???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason for me to duplicate this shape is to allow my users to select it and add their data into this text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen this happen in Win 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            Ah yes, I see it, in your diagram it is shape sheet.5<br />
When you select it via the Drawing Explorer then do a Control-D nothing happens, and the Duplicate option on the Pate menu is greyed out.<br />
Works fine in Visio 2003 and 2007.<br />
Looks like a bug.<br />

    <title>Setting up code to run all rules when a category is selected for an - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sriley121991  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting up code to run all rules when a category is selected for an email.</h2>
                    Currently I have one folder set up for everyone of my clients, as I have so many and like to keep their emails separated. It gets rather time consuming trying to sort the emails manually, so I tried to set up rules that would assign them automatically
 when they came in. That work but I ended up missing emails that came in, as I received no desktop alert or icon indicating I had a new message. So now I am trying to set it up so that whenever outlook recognizes that a category has been chosen, it will check
 all the rules I have set up. That way it will assign the correct message to the correct folder. I imagine I'm looking at some VBA code or something to that effect, I just don't know enough VB to write it myself.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>An example of what I am talking about:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a folder set up for Bob. A message from Bob comes in to my inbox, I resolve the issue, then assign the category "Finished". Outlook recognizes that a category has been selected, and runs all available rules. A rule is set up that says "If this message
 is from Bob, and has the category 'Finished', move it to the folder 'Bob'", and so my message would then get moved to the folder "Bob" and out of my inbox, saving me mass amounts of annoying dragging and dropping to various folders.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.</div>
                </div>

            Yeah I looked at your code previously when I was trying to solve this on my own, and from what I can tell, this is set up so that if a specific category is selected, it will move it to the designated folder, i.e. category Finished moves all messages with
 the category Finished, to the "Finished" folder. That won't work in my case, as I want to keep every customer's messages separate, i.e. Bob's message gets assigned the category Finished, and gets moved in to the Bob folder, while Jack's message gets assigned
 the category Finished, and gets moved to the Jack folder.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>As far as looping Application.Session.DefautStore.GetRules, if I understand correctly that would loop this same process, for each different rule (which I believe is what I'm trying to do), but I'm not sure where in the code I would put that.</div>

            <div>Here is my code. I just copy and pasted from the example you gave me in to the Module "ThisOutlookSession" and its not working the way I thought it should. The category I'm using is called "Finished", and I have set up a rule that says, "If message is
 from Talkswitch Voicemail, and is assigned to the category Finished, move it to the folder Voicemail." I then went and assigned the category Finished to a email that matched my rule and it still didn't do anything.</div>

            I did as requested. Just changed it to "Finished" which is the category that I want this to work for in the first place, but it still isn't doing any thing. I pasted the code to the module ThisOutlookSession. Do I need to set up some sort of macro?

            I assume in the Trust Center you are referring to the macro security settings, in which case VBA should be executed. I did a restart for my Outlook, and now when I set a category, it looks like it is processing something, and I have rules set up for my
 emails, but it still isn't processing the rule.&nbsp;

            I did get all the rule names. Then I did another test, this time using a different category in my rule than the category I'm using to initiate the run, and it went through. So it seems to me that it uses the category change as the trigger, but doesn't
 register that the category is set until after the rule has run.

<p>Having the same problem. Many users in our company with this problem. It's getting worse every day. More people, more delay. It has been going on for weeks now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep seeing other people with this problem and Skype says stuff on heartbeat that says it is resolved, but it very clearly is NOT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now having to physically stand up and walk to other people's desks in the office to tell them things. We've got a few hundred orders to deal with today and we're ultra-busy, so the phone system is typically tied up - often with people who need specific
 information that I'm trying to send by SKYPE!</p>

    <title>3rd party hosted Exchange migration to Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            3rd party hosted Exchange migration to Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been with a company who provide a hosted exchange solution for my office, of which provide a terrible service! We have made the right decision to move over to office 365, 2 licences are purchased already.</p>
<p>The domain name is currently being transfered out of them and we are planning on today telling them we are leaving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, please bear with me on this and i'll need as much guidance as i possibly can get.</p>
<p>What is the best migration process? We only have 1 outlook profile and that has 5 email addresses all going to seperate folders, created by rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current provider seem to be using a hosting package which we've had for years that we use to edit our website, they've added plenty of records on the DNS there so i presume its being routed through them? (eHosting)</p>
<p>I just need to ensure that this runs as smoothly as one would hope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've taken backups of the emails on my local machines, onto an external hard drive and into outlook already.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Mehdi,</p>
<p>Since you only have 1 Outlook profile, the most convenient way is to move the mailbox items via PST files. After creating users in Office 365 and set up the email accounts in Outlook clients, you can import PST files exported from different folders into
 the relative accounts. Then the items will be synced to Office 365.</p>
<p>About the DNS record, you can point them to Office 365 after the import job is done. You should have a domain.onmicrosoft.com suffix at this moment. Users can be created using this domain first. And when you decide to stop the email services of the hosted
 Exchange, verify the custom domain in Office 365 and add DNS records. Then change the users’ ID and email address to use the custom domain.</p>
<p>Here are some article for your reference:<br />

<h3> catvlerk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accidentally marked email as &#34;unwanted&#34;&#59; Junk options do not work.</h2>
                    <p>So Microsoft have decided to add yet ANOTHER spam folder to Outlook called "Unwanted".
</p>
<p>This one mysteriously popped up in July 2017 sometime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accidentally marked an email as "Unwanted".&nbsp;</p>
<p>I immediately went into my Junk E-Email options and marked this sender as 'safe sender' AND 'safe recipient' AND 'safe domain' (it's inside my own organisation). I see this is also the popular answer to other people that have had the same issue.</p>
<p><strong>Dear folks, that does not work</strong>. </p>
<p>Junk E-mail and Unwanted emails filter and function very differently - managing your Junk options is not the same as managing Unwanted options. Yet there are no (obvious) ways to manage Unwanted Mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Could someone at Microsoft</strong> please advise how to resolve this issue? I feel that you executed an update without the appropriate tools to sort out this new and unique problem.</p>

<p>
</p><p>https://exchangeitup.blogspot.co.za/2014/10/exchange-2010-extra-junk-or-unwanted.html?showComment=1502441632420#c695519899924115365&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to be happening at the Smartphone level and is not within the account or sync settings.<br />
</p>
<p>In addition if you delete the "Unwanted" folder it will be recreated once the phone syncs and only moves the email from the users email domain.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Junk Email Folder Always Empty</h2>
                    My junk email folder no longer displays mail deemed as junk.&nbsp; I checked my level of protection and it is set at "no automatic filtering."&nbsp; I am missing important emails that apparently are disappearing that I know have been sent to me, even from addresses
 that have come through in the past.

<h2>            Moving Custom Domain From Outlook.com To Offfice 365</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp; We are a nonprofit organization that has a rather large custom domain in Outlook.com.&nbsp; The domain is soroptimist.net.&nbsp; We have already started the process to migrate to Office 365.&nbsp; My question is, if we decide to move the current domain to Office
 365 will we still be able to log into the old accounts on Outlook.com to see the existing email, etc?&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that once I switch the DNS/MX records at my domain registrar, all new email will then go to the accounts we have set up in Office 365.&nbsp; I just
 want to know if the users will still be able to log into Outlook.com top access the existing/old data that would remain there.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you're wondering if your users can still access their emails in Outlook.com after migrating to Office 365. It would be best to get in touch with our Office 365 support team for questions regarding domain migration and options on what to
 do before and after migration. You can reach the Office 365 support through <strong>

<p>
</p><p>1-No.&nbsp; If you move the MX records outlook.com will not receive email</p>
<p>2-Not an easy one.&nbsp; They can install windows live mail (a free email client), sync it to outlook.com, and a local copy would be created on their HD.&nbsp; then when they migrate to 365 they can export it from WLM and import it into 365</p>
<p>3-What will happen depends on what you do.&nbsp; You can either maintain the curent individual outlook.com accounts (but not be able to administer them) or migrate to 365 or your ISP</p>

</p><p>I totally understand that the custom domain (soroptimist.net) accounts currently on Outlook.com will no longer receive email once the MX records are changed.&nbsp; My question is, will we still be able to log into the old accounts through Outlook.com to at least
 view the old email if needed????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Scott</p>

<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to answer your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Email accounts can still be accessed when signing into them at <a href="http://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.outlook.com</a> with their emails intact. However, listed domains in the Admin panel will be removed, and all users who will log in to domains.live.com will be directed back to the home page of Windows Live Admin Center as part of the decommission process.
 The change that will be made to the MX record can affect the server that will host the domain thus users will not receive emails via Outlook.com anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other questions or clarifications, please let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>RoseKatrina, can I confirm that after the MX record has been changed out of Outlook.com, Outlook.com will still give access to old emails in the individual accounts of each user in the old domain? &nbsp;In other words, the Microsoft account of each person is
 still valid and will continue to function?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand that new mail received by the domain will be routed to the new value of the MX record, and will never be seen in Outlook.com again. &nbsp;But what if a user tries to send out a mail while in Outlook.com?</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting your questions here. Let me answer your concern one by one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>"Can I confirm that after the MX record has been changed out of Outlook.com, Outlook.com will still give access to old emails in the individual accounts of each user in the old domain? &nbsp;In other words,
 the Microsoft account of each person is still valid and will continue to function?"</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Yes, domain users can still access their old emails.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>"</em></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>I can understand that new mail received by the domain will be routed to the new value of the MX record, and will never be seen

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As what my colleague says, as long as there are no changes made on the MX record, you will be able to receive emails. The emails that were sent to you while you are in Outlook.com and it happened that
 you have changed your MX record will still be intact on your account. It's just that, you can no longer received emails to the old MX record.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Office 365 subscription and am a Windows Insider (fast) who has Word 2016 downloaded on my mac [version 16.12 (180410)], but I cannot get Resume Assistant to work on my computer. The icon is present on my review tab, but it appears dimmed. The
 information I have found online tells me to go to File &gt; Options, but there is no "options" section of the File tab on my mac. How do I get to the settings to select the&nbsp;<strong>Show LinkedIn features in my Office applications</strong> on my mac?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Andrew</p>

            <p>Hi Muhammad,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 11 is the default version that can be used on Windows 8.1 RT or any platform of Windows 8.1 operating system. It’s not possible to downgrade the version to Internet Explorer 10. It has different enhanced features as compared to Internet
 Explorer 10 used on previous operating system (Windows 8 and Windows RT). Rather than going back, we can easily setup Internet Explorer 10 browser mode on Internet Explorer 11.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Which is the software that you are trying to download or access online using Internet Explorer? Is this issue specific to a particular software or website?</li><li>Is it the Modern or the Desktop version of Internet Explorer that you are using to do so?</li><li>Do you receive an error message? If yes, what is the exact error message that you receive?</li></ol>
<p>If you were successfully able to download or access the software on Internet Explorer 10, check if the issue still persist when you change the browser mode to Internet Explorer 10. Follow the steps:</p>
<p>Open Internet Explorer on the desktop.</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <b>F12 </b>key to open <b>developer tools</b> options at the bottom of the screen.</li><li>Press<b> Ctrl+8</b> key to open <b>Emulation </b>on the menu list.</li><li>Across <b>User agent string</b> option, choose Internet Explorer 10 from the drop down list.</li><li>Press <b>Ctrl+P</b> to unpin the Developer tools and minimize the window to continue work on the same browser mode. Once, you close the developer tools window or the browser, the mode changes to default Internet Explorer 11 mode.
</li></ul>
<p>For further reference, you can also add the website to compatibility view list and check if it resolves the issue. Refer to the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to do so. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do let us know if the issue still persists. </p>

<p>Hello Antoine and Brian,</p>
<p>unfortunately, it seems that Irish and French skype numbers can't be set as caller ID.</p>
<p>according to <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a>, only skype numbers from these countries can be used for Caller ID:</p>
<ul>
<li>USA</li><li>UK</li><li>Chile</li><li>Denmark</li><li>Estonia</li><li>Poland</li><li>Sweden</li><li>Switzerland</li></ul>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>

<p>Hi Antoine,</p>
<p>although we are trying to constantly improve our offered services, this is a legal/contract issue and those are more difficult to solve. There might be soon some way how to set Irish skype number as caller ID, but I wouldn't expect it any time soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now I would recommend getting UK number, if you don't need precisely Irish. UK skype number can be used as caller ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for understanding and I hope this will solve your problem,</p>
<p>Michal</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You have to modify this line:</p>
<p>&nbsp;.TextFileColumnDataTypes = Array(1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)</p>
<p>Identify the number of the column that shows the policy number and then modify its type to 2 (text).</p>
<p>e.g.: If the policy numbers are shown in column 5, then, modify the above line to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;.TextFileColumnDataTypes = Array(1, 3, 1, 1, <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">2</span></strong>, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1).</p>

<p>I believe you are describing the Timeline view that is available in Project 2010 and 2013.&nbsp; To answer your question, yes, it is possible to create multiple Timeline views for a single project.&nbsp; In fact, I blogged about how to do this at the following blog
 site:</p>

<p>To answer your question, no, it is not possible to create a Timeline view that spans only a specific time period.&nbsp; This is one of the main limitations of the Timeline view.&nbsp; The best you can do is to create your Timeline view, zoom in as necessary, and then
 scroll to the date you want to see in the view.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And by the way, you are more than welcome for the help, my friend!&nbsp; :)</p>

            I am assuming by page, you meant worksheet. 
<br />
<br />Put following formula in Sheet2 assuming A1 of Sheet1 contains the date required date
<br />=Sheet1!$A$1+1
<br />A more robust construction would be
<br />=IF(Sheet1!$A$1="","",Sheet1!$A$1+1)
<br />
<br />Now, for every other sheet, you need to increment by one. Hence, on Sheet3, it would be
<br />=IF(Sheet1!$A$1="","",Sheet1!$A$1+2)
<br />On Sheet4, it would be
<br />=IF(Sheet1!$A$1="","",Sheet1!$A$1+3)

<p>For Example: In D3 on Tab 1, I have Tuesday, January 1, 2019 ... what I would like to do is auto fill D3 on Tab 2 with Wednesday, January 2, 2019, in D3 on Tab 3 I would like to auto fill Thursday, January 3, 2019, etc. Not sure if I'm wording it right though.</p>

<p>Either of the other replies will do what you want assuming you already have 31 worksheets in place and want to select each in turn and enter the incremented formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more question. . . .do you have data and/or formula on the existing sheet you wanted copied?</p>
