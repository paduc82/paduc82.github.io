<p>That's all you see? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Does it really look something like this:</p>
<p><span>***STOP: 0x000000EA (0x81997AD8, 0xFFB0E108, 0xF969BCBC, 0x00000001)</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>What does the rest of your message look like (those are clues).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>That looks like an nvidia file, but is that all it says - nv4_disp with no extension? &nbsp;Does it really say nv4_disp.dll or something else?</span></span></span></p>
<p>Do you have nvidia video components and do you recall updating anything in that area lately? &nbsp;New drivers, new anything?</p>
<p>Fill in the blank: &nbsp;My system was working fine until ___________________.</p>
<p>Next time you boot, from the F8 boot options menu, choose:</p>
<p>Last known good configuration</p>
<p>That is the configuration XP saved the last time it booted successfully, so if you can boot there, you can undo/fix the other problem. &nbsp;If you installed a new video driver, you can roll it back and get the correct driver.</p>
<p>I have read that sometimes suspicious RAM comes into play with this error (maybe), so you can test your RAM like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run a test of your RAM with memtest86+ (I know it is boring and will cost you a CD).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memtest86+ is a more up to date version of the old memtest86 program and they are not the same.</p>
<p>The memtest86+ will not run under Windows, so you will need to download the ISO file and create a bootable CD, boot on that and then run the memtest86+ program. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If even a single error is reported that is a failure and should make you suspicious of your RAM.</p>
<p>If you have multiple sticks of RAM you may need to run the test on them one at a time and change them out to isolate the failure to a particular single stick.</p>
<p>Always keep at least the first bank of RAM occupied so the test will find something to do and there is enough to boot your system.</p>
<p>Sometimes, reseating the RAM in the slots will relieve the error but a failure is still cause for suspicion.</p>
<p>The file and instructions are here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a></p>
<p>Here is a link that shows you have to create and use the memtest86+ CD:</p>

<p>If someone says to run memtest86, you can tell them to go pound sand and that you know memtest86+ supercedes memtest86 and here's why: &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Internet running slow only on my Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mister woodie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet running slow only on my Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Hey fellow Xbox users, recently I have been experiencing a drastically slower internet connection only through my Xbox one. My PC and my 360 are working just fine and I get reliable speeds with those. But I go to check my detailed network statistics on my
 Xbox one and sometimes my download speeds have been extremely low, and I'm talking like less than the preferred 3mb/s. Now my internet speed through my ISP is 30mb/s. So I'm wondering why it's really only affecting my Xbox one. Obviously, my Xbox One is connected
 wirelessly so yes it won't be as fast as my PC which is connected through Ethernet, but I can't seem to figure out the problem. Now&nbsp;when I do look at the detailed network statistics does my download speed read what I am currently using or what the actual power
 of my internet download speed is? Because I have seen it&nbsp;fluctuate&nbsp;Maybe I have to mess with my DNS settings or maybe my ISP is limiting my bandwidth, but if was my ISP why would my other devices be working fine? I feel like it started a few days ago when
 I downloaded an update for Dragonball Xenoverse, it seems ever since then I am running into these problems. Now&nbsp;I'm not saying that&nbsp;the said update caused the problem, but it just seems weird that&nbsp;I feel like it&nbsp;started after&nbsp;downloading it. &nbsp;Also, I can now
 not connect to Netflix through my Xbox One and I go to check the connection through Netflix and it says everything is fine connection wise, but I still says it runs into an error. But, Netflix works fine on my 360 and I've even tried it on a different 360
 through my connection and it works flawlessly. I've tried everything from hard resetting multiple times to changing to energy saving mode. Nothing has really helped. I'm no technical guru whens it comes to DNS setting sand IP address, so maybe my issue is
 there. Any help is greatly appreciated</p>

<h2>            Why does my Surface keep turning off and on&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I just got this. And for some reason when it zooms in, by itself, it turns off. I don't know why. the screen turns black. When I touch it it turns on, but when I'm not it just turns black again. so I have to press the power button to turn it back to normal.
 this is a problem.</p>

                    <p>There's an issue with Crysis 2 on XB1 BC where the game will reset the progress you made from the xbox 360. Others have said they never have played on XB1 in the levels still reset. But this seems to have happen when it was made BC on XB1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what the issue is but it needs to get fixed. I can't get the multiplayer achievements because it keeps resetting my level............................</p>
<p>
</p><p>I boosted for about 4 hours in went from level 21 to level 32 and took a break and went back to the game my level was back to level 21
<strong>[Mod Removed – Profanity]</strong>.............................................................</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Pizzapie!</p>
<p>Can you give us a few more clarifying details about the situation? I understand you are playing Crysis 2 on Xbox One's Backwards Compatibility and you leveled up your multiplayer rank but it reverted back to the previous rank? Is this progress that you picked
 up from the Cloud Saved Games from an Xbox 360? Please give us a little more information. If you are unable to level up or make progress on your accounts ranking check out
<a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Crysis-Games/bd-p/Crysis-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
EA's Crysis Forums</a>&nbsp;and let them know what's going on and if its a known issue for their game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>Looking forward to you're reply</p>

    <title>.docx filetypes can not be associated with LibreOffice from MS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            .docx filetypes can not be associated with LibreOffice from MS Store&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My Surface Pro 4 has a little space left in the hard drive and so I replaced some of the installed programs with apps from MS app Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is, although I like LibreOffice to open and edit all .docx files, unfortunately, it doesn't come as an option when setting default apps making it impossible to associate .docx files with the app.</p>
<p>

</p><p>The Libre Office app from the store appears to be an unofficial repackage, and not the full suite from the Libre Office developers, I would be concerned that this may have gimped functionality and recommend deleting this and installing the official suite
 from&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Right click a document, in the menu at the bottom is<strong> properties </strong>
setting, select <strong>change</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If LibreOffice isn't there you will have to navigate to the executable using the '<strong>browse</strong>' function offered. The LibreOffice directory containing the executable can be found at<strong> C:/ProgramFiles(x86)</strong> or<strong> C:/ProgramFiles</strong>,
 (unless you installed it elsewhere specifically during install). Find the <strong>
libreOffice.exe</strong> and select that as the default application to open the docx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can also probablyassociate the docx with LibreOffice in LibreOffice settings, I don't have it installed so I can only point you to this web article that sets it all out.</p>

<p>I don't think you read the issue properly.</p>

</p><p>I downloaded the app from Microsoft Store thus it's impossible to find it inside the directories you mentioned.</p>

<p>First, uninstall that "app" and go to http://www.libreoffice.org and download the full program.&nbsp; While on the download page, at the top, there is a "Help" file you will need to download as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will also need to install JAVA to run along with it (http://www.java.com) and you will see a warning regarding Windows 10 and the Edge browser but ignore it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installation, the system will still default to Microsoft Office (if you have it installed) for the file associations.&nbsp; Find a ".docx" file on your computer and right click on it and tell it to open with LibreOffice and there should be a tag you can
 set to set it as default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may still have issues with that even after changing it.&nbsp; Under Settings in Windows 10, you can look around for "Default Apps" and select LibreOffice instead of Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can be difficult to change file associations in Windows 10 but eventually works.</p>

            Oh, by the way, the remove the "App", right click on the menu for a text menu and select "Apps &amp; Features".&nbsp; You can remove it from there.&nbsp; For file associations; that is located under Settings/System/Apps and at the bottom of the right side panel, you
 can select the associations for apps not listed.

</p><p>Web apps from the store are conveniently (sarcasm) installed into a hidden folder, something like</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\program files\%WindowsApps%</p>
<p>
</p><p>note the directory specified inside %dir%, a hidden directory (even setting files explorer to show 'hidden files' does not allow access without UAC intervention.</p>

</p><p>This makes if tough to navigate inside wizards.</p>

</p><p>As far as Libre Office being 'heavier' I have run this on a 10 year old Thinkpad with a mere 8GB Ram and rudimentary Graphics chip and it runs like a charm, if the suite is too big for disk space you can choose which applications to want or not want during
 the install.</p>

<p>Hey domcarter</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm so sorry you got it that way, I didn't intend to offend you! I really appreciate yours and any other guy's time to help me out but definitely, I didn't intend to be an a**hole.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The directory (<span>C:\Windows\program files\%WindowsApps%</span>) you provided me with was the key to solve the issue without having to download the suite. All I needed was to change the ownership (and permissions) of "C:\Program
 Files\WindowsApps\42109FactoriaDatacenter.LibreOffice_6.2.2.0_neutral__zaf1c6h4vqsbt\VFS\ProgramFilesX64\LibreOffice\program" directory and then "look for another app on this PC" pointing to the same directory where the executables are contained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine is a Surface Pro 4 that comes with 4GB RAM and 116GB physical memory.
</p>
<p>Thanx to the Microsoft Store apps, I managed to save more than 30GB for my hard disk because I did the same for about 20 apps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus, this issue can be a very useful future reference for other people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm so very happy with the result!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Love &amp; Peace</p>

            <p>:) - this could be either very simple to fix - or a royal PITA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's start with the usual suspects....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Please run a full CHKDSK and SFC scan....</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Click on Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories</p>
<p>
Right-click on the Command Prompt entry</p>
<p>
Select Run as Administrator and accept the UAC prompt - the Elevated Command Prompt window should pop up.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
At the Command prompt, type</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
and hit the Enter key.</p>
<p>
You will be told that the drive is locked, </p>
<p>
and the CHKDSK will run at he next boot - hit the Y key, press Enter, and then reboot.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The CHKDSK will take a few hours depending on the size of the drive, so be patient!</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
After the CHKDSK has run, Windows should boot normally (possibly after a second auto-reboot) -
</p>
<p>
then run the SFC.</p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<p>
Click on Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories</p>
<p>
Right-click on the Command Prompt entry</p>
<p>
Select Run as Administrator and accept the UAC prompt - the Elevated Command Prompt window should pop up.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
At the Command prompt, type</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
and hit the Enter key</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Wait for the scan to finish - make a note of any error messages - and then reboot.</p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Copy the
</span><span style="font-style: italic">CBS.log</span><span> file created (C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log) to your desktop (you can't manipulate it directly) and then compress the copy and upload it to your SkyDrive
 Public folder (</span><a href="http://skydrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://skydrive.live.com</a><span> ) and post a link to it so that I can take a look.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
Post a new MGADiag report with details of any error messages encountered. </p>

<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p><i>....... If the System Update Readiness Tool (<b>CheckSUR</b>) do<span><span>ə</span></span>sn't correct the problem, you'll need to repair Windows. .....</i>
</p>
<p>The manufacturer was required to provide a way for you to reinstall Windows. </p>
<p>If a set of disks didn't come with the computer, there will be a hidd<span><span>ə</span></span>n Recovery partition (not to be confused with System Restore) you can use to do the job.

<p>Contact the manufacturer's tech support staff or post in their community support forums for assistance.</p>

<h2>            Errors installing Japanese keyboard</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to install the Japanese keyboard in Windows 10 and I am having errors. I am following the instructions found here:</p>
<p>https://www.coscom.co.jp/learnjapanese801/msime_win10_en1.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the keyboard pack installed, and the change keyboards menu shows up, but I am not able to change character types under the Japanese keyboard. It just stays on "A" no matter what I do. Keyboard shortcuts don't work, right clicking and changing in that
 menu doesn't work. Restarting the computer doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Potential clue: when I go into language options in the control panel under Japanese, and I try to open options for Microsoft IME, the options window crashes immediately.</p>

            I already did this, the issue is that I cannot change text input mode after the keyboard is installed. It sticks on "A" mode and doesn't let me input hiragana, etc. IME settings also will not load.

            Hi Alden, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />It sounds like your computer has been infected with malware, so I'd recommend scanning your PC with the following apps which should help remove the infection:
<br />
<br />Eset scanner:
<br /><a href="https://www.eset.com/us/home/online-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.eset.com/us/home/online-scanner/</a>
<br />
<br />Malwarebytes:
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/</a>
<br />
<br />After you've run scans with those apps and removed the threats, your PC should be clean again.
<br />
<br />Please let me know how you go! Thanks!

<h2>            Xbox One console getting warm &#40;when off&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>For some reason, my Xbox One console seems to get a bit warm around the ventilation area at the top
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">even though I have turned the console off</span> and left it that way the whole day? Surely this isn't normal? Does anyone have any insight to this?<br />

    <title>No Longer Have Administrator Privileges with Choosing Update Settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sedaryac  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Longer Have Administrator Privileges with Choosing Update Settings with Administrator Account</h2>
                    Even though I set up my computer, under the Administrator Account to Automatically Download and Install Updates, I notice it is set for me having to actually check and download them AND I CANNOT CHANGE THE SETTING.&nbsp; Downloads are no longer working.&nbsp; I
 did do a Troubleshoot the other day and noticed, when I checked "Installed Downloads" that they had all worked.&nbsp; Before I was getting FAILED statuses.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
However, today when I manually check for Downloads, I am told up front that the action has FAILED. &nbsp; When I Troubleshoot, the results tell me I need to "Try troubleshooting as an Administrator."&nbsp;&nbsp; I am in the Administrator account!&nbsp;&nbsp; Troubleshooted again and
 it told me it was a Group Policy issue.&nbsp; Went to Local Group Policy Editor, Local Computer Policy, Windows Settings, Local Policies, Security Options:&nbsp; Policy:&nbsp; Accounts: Administrator account status:&nbsp; Disabled.&nbsp;&nbsp; Double-clicked.&nbsp; Changed to Enabled from Disabled.&nbsp;
 Applied.&nbsp; Saved.<br />
<br />
However, I am getting the exact same message as before on Windows Update, "Change update settings."&nbsp; I am not listed as having Administrator privileges so far as determining Windows Update settings. &nbsp; Did this occur the first week I was up and running when
 DELL Support live tied into this computer?&nbsp; i.e. Was this a remote change --- or is this an inherent flaw in Windows 8 Pro?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I am NOT tech savvy.&nbsp; I learn as I go.&nbsp; Please be specific in the exact steps I should take to remedy this situation.&nbsp; Thank you in advance for your qualified help.<br />

            <p>Hi, <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for the post.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears that you get error Try troubleshooting as an Administrator when you try to download the Windows updates. You have logged in as an Administrator user.
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me ask you few questions.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Do you get this error with any particular Windows Update KB number?<br />
2) Do you have any other Administrator account on your computer? If yes then do you face this issue with that account too?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check the error code in Update history and write back to us with the exact error code. Follow the steps given below to see update history.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press <strong>Windows</strong> Key + <strong>X </strong>key on Desktop.<br />
b) Select <strong>Control</strong> <strong>Panel</strong>.<br />
c) Select <strong>Windows</strong> <strong>Update</strong>.<br />
d) On the left had side select <strong>View Windows Update history.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run as admin option when a specific program is running is different than administrator of the computer as it is only specific to the program and this option is enabled if the program requires elevation even though&nbsp;you are the admin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can get this error when you do not have enough privilege to make changes to settings. I have few troubleshooting methods to suggest. Follow the troubleshooting given here.

Thank you so very much for your reply and help.&nbsp; I am sorry it has taken me so long to respond.&nbsp; Please accept my apologies.&nbsp; Some of the things you suggested, I had already done and some, quite frankly, I did not know how to do!<br />
This is a very strange situation.&nbsp; I am used to XP and being able to change my Update settings and have them remain as set.&nbsp; I am reading Win7 forums and this seems to be a problem starting with 7 - sometimes involving malware.&nbsp; This is a new computer (less
 than 2mo old) and nothing is on it that I did not purchase.&nbsp; KIS, Sandboxie, Firefox, all used.&nbsp; I do have AOL Software and a US Robotics exterior modem as backup to save on Wireless data usage. (AOL cannot be opened Sandboxed but I use Firefox on the side.)
 Besides KIS, I also ran WD on this computer and later will try more in-depth pro AV since, when I did a System Restore to the very earliest point [Show more restore points], I had full control of choices --- which stayed as is for awhile and then reverted
 back to me having lack of control over the settings.<br />
MEANWHILE, THIS (below) IS WHAT I DID TO GET DOWNLOADS TO WORK AS DESIRED.&nbsp; (I do not know what I am doing, I just started looking and clicking.)<br />
From Local Administrator Account:&nbsp; Settings [Charms Bar] &gt; Search: Group Policy &gt; Edit Group Policy &gt; Local Group Policy Editor (window) &gt; Local Computer Policy &gt; Windows Settings &gt; Security Settings &gt; Local Policies &gt; Security Options:&nbsp; (Then to right-hand
 side of window): Administrator account status:&nbsp; Enable.<br />
Switched to Hidden Administrator.&nbsp; This STILL did not let me set the Update choices.&nbsp; The choice box was greyed out.&nbsp; So, I did this:&nbsp; Search: Group Policy &gt; Edit Group Policy &gt; Local Group Policy Editor (window) &gt; Local Computer Policy &gt; Computer Configuration
 &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Windows Update:&nbsp; (Then to the right-hand side of the window): Configure Automatic Updates:&nbsp; Configure Automatic Updates (new window):&nbsp; Enabled.&nbsp; Make Update choice to Download but let me chose when in Install.&nbsp;
 (Says it's for Vista, etc. but I had to do this in order to change it for Win8).&nbsp; So, it seems I may have done some of what you suggested without me knowing what I was doing or understanding what you were telling me to do?!<br />
Signed out of Hidden Administrator and, under Local Administrator, hid the built-in Administrator account again.<br />
Next, Settings (charms bar) &gt; Change PC Settings &gt; Devices:&nbsp; Download over metered connections:&nbsp; ON.<br />
I was then able to Download all Updates ---- but they automatically started to Install THEMSELVES which was NOT my option.&nbsp; So far today - after all the updates and installation of such - my Update Selection is staying the same and I am able to choose it from
 my Local Administrator Account.&nbsp; Maybe the issue is completely fixed and resolved.
<br />
I am enjoying the ease of Windows 8 but, with this quirk which has wasted huge amounts of my time and taken me away from what I should be doing instead [I can't afford an IT person and I am not one!], it is a disappointment to me in this particular area.&nbsp; But
 overall I like it.<br />
<br />
4/20/2013 UPDATE:&nbsp; Kaspersky Internet Security is changing this setting.&nbsp; Reference: forum.kaspersky.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is nothing else.<br />

Switched to Hidden Administrator.&nbsp; This STILL did not let me set the Update choices.&nbsp; The choice box was greyed out.&nbsp; So, I did this:&nbsp; Search: Group Policy &gt; Edit Group Policy &gt; Local Group Policy Editor (window) &gt; Local Computer Policy &gt; Computer Configuration
 &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Windows Update:&nbsp; (Then to the right-hand side of the window): Configure Automatic Updates:&nbsp; Configure Automatic Updates (new window):&nbsp; Enabled.&nbsp; Make Update choice to Download but let me chose when in Install.&nbsp;
 (Says it's for Vista, etc. but I had to do this in order to change it for Win8).&nbsp; So, it seems I may have done some of what you suggested without me knowing what I was doing or understanding what you were telling me to do?!<br />
Signed out of Hidden Administrator and, under Local Administrator, hid the built-in Administrator account again.<br />
Next, Settings (charms bar) &gt; Change PC Settings &gt; Devices:&nbsp; Download over metered connections:&nbsp; ON.<br />
I was then able to Download all Updates ---- but they automatically started to Install THEMSELVES which was NOT my option.&nbsp; So far today - after all the updates and installation of such - my Update Selection is staying the same and I am able to choose it from
 my Local Administrator Account.&nbsp; Maybe the issue is completely fixed and resolved.
<br />
I am enjoying the ease of Windows 8 but, with this quirk which has wasted huge amounts of my time and taken me away from what I should be doing instead [I can't afford an IT person and I am not one!], it is a disappointment to me in this particular area.&nbsp; But
 overall I like it.<br />
<br />
4/20/2013 UPDATE:&nbsp; Kaspersky Internet Security is changing this setting.&nbsp; Reference: forum.kaspersky.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is nothing else.<br />
<br />
I have a similar unresolved problem having tried the same fixes as SedaryAC. Can someone explain in what way Kaspersky Internet Security is changing this setting?<br />
I have Kaspersky on my PC and wonder if that is my problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            Roger PBurt, I have come to appreciate the KIS safeguard and live with it.&nbsp; Even now I am quite happily doing MS Updates.&nbsp; Just go into Control Panel on "Download Tuesday" (or the next day, etc.) and then System Security and Check For Updates.&nbsp;&nbsp; Works
 great.&nbsp; <br />
As to HOW they control this, that is above my level so I cannot even begin to undo their inner AV bowels.<br />
This is my first experience using Kaspersky.&nbsp; I'd used Norton before but that let in boogers.<br />
<br />
Some of my initial problems so far as failed updates (as listed in my original posting) were coming from MS and their new operating system.&nbsp; Apparently all those bugs have been fixed.<br />

Thanks,<br />
<br />
I do seem to be administrator except for the updates which I have to check for. I am the only one who uses this PC.<br />
<br />
I did consider a Refresh bit worry it may compound things. On Thursday we are supposed to be getting an upgrade to Windows 8.1 so I don't want to jeopardise anything. I'm not all that tech savvy and find some of the tech advice difficult to follow.
<br />
<br />
Anyway thanks again for replying..<br />

            You're fine.&nbsp; You don't need to Restore.<br />
To do Updates manually, point your mouse cursor to the bottom right corner of the Windows 8 screen.&nbsp; The closest symbol to appear on the right will look like a little gear.&nbsp; That is SETTINGS, click on it.&nbsp;
<br />
Next, in the list that appears, click on CONTROL PANEL.&nbsp; In the window which pops up, click on SYSTEM AND SECURITY.&nbsp;
<br />
Next, where it says WINDOWS UPDATE, click "Check for updates".&nbsp; A new window will appear which says "Windows Update".&nbsp;
<br />
Under the "Download and install updates" you can click on "<i>x-amount</i> of important updates are available".&nbsp;&nbsp; A new window will open.<br />
Check the ones or all -- with all chosen if there is a [check mark] by NAME --- that you want to download and then, at the bottom of that window, click on [Install]<br />
Usually it's every second Tuesday of the month that MicroSoft releases new updates but, as you are signing off your computer, on the choice-of-users screen, Windows 8 will tell you if new updates exist down in the bottom right hand corner.<br />

            Hi Jim,
<br />
<br />You can report phishing e-mails through here: <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/report-phishing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.us-cert.gov/report-phishing</a>
<br />
<br />This will take you to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team's site, and from there you can see the e-mails for that purpose of reporting phishing e-mails.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has an article on how to deal with phishing e-mails, too: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.

            You may have a corrupt system font. I suggest using the SFC utility to repair all your system files at once. Reading the CBS.log can help you identify the problem font, and remove or replace&nbsp;it, if SFC fails to fix it.<br />
<br />
<p>To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps: </p>
<p>1.Click <b>Start</b>, and then type <b><i>cmd</i></b> in the <b>Start Search</b> box.</p>
<p>2. Right-click <b><i>cmd</i></b> in the <b>Programs</b> list, and then click <b>
Run as administrator</b>. </p>
<p>3.If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<b>Continue</b></p>
<p>4.At the command prompt, type the following line, and then press ENTER: <strong>
sfc&nbsp; &nbsp;/scannow</strong></p>

<h2>            Delete card reader drivers and re-install them</h2>
                    My Windows 7 64 stopped recognizing my usb card reader which is connected to the motherboard. I tried to use another usb card reader plugged into a usb port and that reader did not work, but it will work with another computer. I can plug any other device
 in the usb port and they will work. How do I delete the driver for the card readers and re-install it.

            Hi Mike, <br />
<br />
Okay, I've done some reasearch for you by simply going to the Sony support site here: http://sony.storagesupport.com/product/36#faq<br />
<br />
Is that one of your card readers?<br />
<br />
It lists a bunch of different options you can try for troubleshooting this individual device, and I suspect you have the ability to search that site for your other model card reader.
<br />
<br />
However, since it sounds like the only issues you are having are with Sony products, and both of these products do not require additional drivers (info from the link above) then I would suggest updating your current Windows drivers.
<br />
<br />
To do this, click the Start button in the bottom left hand corner of your desktop. Then search for Windows Update and run it. Hopefully this will clear up the issue.
<br />
<br />
One last thing you can try, again coming directly from the Sony support site, is using the software that came with the device. I would suggest reading the entire support page for your products as it may offer some useful information, especially in the Windows
 Update does not do the trick. <br />

<p>Hey Melodie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out! If you are not getting the permission request on your email you can try changing the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4026796/microsoft-account-change-childs-xbox-privacy-online-safety-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
restrictions</a> on your child account. You can also change them from the Xbox by doing the following:</p>
<p>1. Sign in to he parent account</p>
<p>2. Settings&gt;Account&gt;Family</p>
<p>3. Select the child account&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Privacy and online safety</p>
<p>5. Custom&gt;Buy and Download</p>
<p>6. Simply disable the "ask to buy" option</p>
<p>This will allow the child account to make purchases without asking for permission. We do recommend you enable it once the purchase goes through.</p>

<p>The Xbox One will also feature the ability to Skype a friend to ask them for help on a game and then allow them to take over gameplay. The feature is designed to allow players to help one another get through sections of a game when they're stuck.</p>
<p>In a demonstration of the feature, a source told us that a message popped up on their screen asking if it was OK if the player they were Skyping with could take over the game. Once the friend took over, the first player was able to watch them play the game.
 Either player could end the remote play with a button push.</p>
<p>While the feature is already fully functional, the details of its use aren't completely locked in yet. It's not clear, for instance, how long a person can remotely play or if they need to also own the game they are helping their friend play through.</p>
<p>While the demonstration our source saw used a local hardwired connection between consoles, Microsoft officials say they aren't worried about latency issues. It is also unclear what technology will be used to power the remote play.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We've reached out to Microsoft for comment on these two unannounced Xbox One features and will update the story when they respond.[/quote]<br />

<p>This is absurd idea i ever heard . I don't know why a lot of gamer in this gen like it. So you get a console and games for your friends to use it and play for you. The gaming industry is getting worst every day. I can't wait to read gamers bragging for achievements
 they maybe didn't unlock for themselves (if the feature do unlock GS).</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We understand your concern and will certainly assist you to solve it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please answer the below questions for better understanding of the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
2. Do you receive any error message related to the issue?<br />
3. Are you using a Local account or a Microsoft account?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please be advised that such issue can occur due to some of the Windows 10 store related components either going missing or corrupt. Please follow the below methods to troubleshoot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Check Screen Resolution and enable the UAC</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1: Check the screen resolution.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We would like to inform you that you need at least 1024 X 768 screen resolution for Metro apps to work. The Windows apps will not work in screen resolution less than 1024 X 768. To snap apps, you need a screen resolution of at least 1366 x 768.&nbsp; Make sure
 that the screen resolution meets these requirements. You can check this by:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a) Right-click the mouse from the desktop interface and select “Screen Resolution” from the menu.<br />
b) Check the screen resolution shown there. It should be at least 1024 X 768.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Also, make sure the User Account Control (UAC) is enabled in the computer. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2: Enable the User Account Control.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To enable the User Account Control on the computer follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. Press “Windows Logo” + “S” keys on the keyboard, type “Account Control” in the search bar and press “Enter”.<br />
b. In the “User Account Control Settings” window, move the slider to the default settings and click “OK”.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue persists, please follow the below method.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: Run the windows store app troubleshooter.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please follow the link to run the app troubleshooter which is used to solve any app related issue.<br />
<strong>&nbsp;<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</span></strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue persists, please follow the below method.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: Clear the windows store cache.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please follow the below steps to clear the store cache.</div>
<div>1.&nbsp; Press windows key + R key and open the Run dialog box.<br />
2. In there, type “Wsreset.exe” and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue persists, please refer to the below method.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3: SFC scan and clean boot.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 1: SFC scan</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. Follow the below steps to perform an SFC scan.<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After doing a SFC scan, please perform a clean boot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2: Clean boot.</strong></div>
<div>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Thank you for the update.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please try the below method to troubleshoot your issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: DISM scan.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) is a new command line tool that you can use to service a Windows image or prepare a Windows PE image. The DISM tool replaces the Package Manager (pkgmgr.exe), PEimg, and Intlcfg tools. DISM consolidates
 the functionality found in those three tools, as well as delivers new functionality to improve the experience of offline servicing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please follow the given steps to run a DISM scan:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Press Windows + x on your keyboard.</div>
<div>2) Select Command prompt (Admin) to open Administrator Command prompt.</div>
<div>3) In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth </strong></div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue persists, please opt for the below method.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: Create a new account.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There might be a probability that your account might have been corrupted so please try to create a new account and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Type Settings on the search bar.<br />
2. Click on Accounts.<br />
3. Go to Family and Other users, in that click on Add someone else to PC.<br />
4. In there click on Microsoft Account if you want to create an MS account or else click on Local Account.<br />
5. There give a name to the account and provide password if you want.</div>

 headset then checked the dont show this message again. I found out a couple of days later that when i had my headphones plugged in, my mic wouldn't work. How can I find the dialog box and uncheck it?
