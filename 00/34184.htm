                    How do I set up time limits on windows 10 for someone young who has a local account on the PC and no e-mail.&nbsp; Please do not say 'the same as window 8' and then attach a link as I do not believe this to be the case.

            Hi  B.Cleary
<br />
<br />Some users are reporting issues with the December update causing issues. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the December update
<br />
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />The update will try to install again, so use the following to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + F
<br />This will open Feedback app, submit your report regarding the issue.
<br />
<br />Hopefully, the next Cumulative Update will resolve the problem.       
        </p>

            Please try these steps and check after each step. If these don't work, let me know. I will provide further troubleshooting steps.
<br />
<br />1. Run Audio / Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; 
<br />A. Playing Audio &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />B. Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />2. Take actions related to Audio Driver 
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices &gt; Sound, Video &amp; game controllers &gt; Right Click on the entry below (if more than one, then you will have to repeat the steps for all) &gt; Properties &gt; Driver Tab &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Roll Back -  If Roll back driver is enabled, roll it back
<br />
<br />B. Update - Update driver
<br />
<br />C. Download and reinstall the driver from computer manufacturer's website - If you face issue, let me know your computer make and model?
<br />
<br />3. Check Speaker / headphone is not disabled and is set as default
<br />
<br />Type Sound in Windows Start Seach box &gt; Click Sound &gt; Under Playback tab, right click on an empty space and select, Show disconnected devices and Show disabled devices &gt; Select Speaker and click on Properties and make sure that it is is enabled &gt; You may also check if the Speaker that you are using is set as default.
<br />
<br />4. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Guided Walk though - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />There are three other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>

<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>

<p>Thank you for the response. I was unable to complete Step 1.B, no hardware and device troubleshooter was present in the troubleshooter menu. Have taken all actions for Step 2 previously with no success. As i have just got this computer i have not made a
 restore point. i have tried rolling back the update from windows with no success on solving the issue.&nbsp; Have attempted a reset of windows 10 but fails with the error"something went wrong unable to reset. No changes were made".</p>

            <p>No I don't want to disable the sounds in general. </p>
<p>I try to find whats causing the behavior of triggering the sound and resolve it.</p>
<p>My guess is the problem occurs because of combination from the windows lock and the nvidia graphics control.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking through the windows event viewer but I don't know really what to look for.
</p>
<p>Another thought was disabling the standard sounds to identify whats actually triggering the sound.

                    <p>Hey guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have the following problem:</p>
<p>I have an i7 2600 with (2x) GTX 580 (Basically GTX580 SLI)&nbsp;</p>
<p>running on Windows 10 64 Bit Build 10586.</p>
<p>My Nvidia Drivers are the latest, version 356.19</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GTX580 is a Fermi card and it supports DX12</p>
<p>Now the Nvidia Control Panel says DirectX Runtime is version 12</p>
<p>But using DXDiag, it says I have DirectX 11.3</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result I can't install Forza 6 APEX either :(&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS Windows Update says I'm fully up to date, I have also tried resetting W/Update and the same happens</p>
<p>I've also done a clean install of my graphics driver and even disabled SLI to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the data from DXDiag and NVCpl...</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on Windows 10 (November 2015) (Build 10586) which is supposed to have DX12 built in. There is no stand alone installer for DX12 on Windows 10, I have also used that installer to make sure older versions are installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again running DXDIAG tells me I have DX11.2 not DX12 - even though I was on the latest Nvidia driver for my GTX580 (which supports DX12 on Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me how I can fix this glitch, it's still the same even today.</p>
<p>

    <title>window placed partially off-screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            window placed partially off-screen</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
<br />
Especially when connecting and disconnecting monitors or using remote desktop, it happens that a certain window is placed with its top (the bar) outside of the actual screen (desktop). I the user tries to do that , it is not allowed, but sometimes Windows does
 it (when reopening a program and such..)<br />
<br />
There is an example in the attached screenshot (the Firefox window being off the top of the screen).<br />
<br />
Is there some hidden system setting to prevent ever placing application windows outside the screen?<br />
(I mean the same restrictions that apply when moving a window by user: it can be partially off screen, just a part of the window bar must always be on screen)<br />
<br />
I such situation, one can not see the top part of the window content or the menus, toolbar and also not the window bar, so it can not be dragged back into the desktop.<br />
<br />
In years of using Windows I learned how to get out of such situation, but I would rather see it never happen.<br />
Especially when it happens to a friend and I have to explain over phone how to resolve the situation...<br />
<br />
So is there a permanent solution?<br />
<br />
(currently I use Windows 7)<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
David<br />
<br />
PS: Hmm, there is no option to attach files. I'll upload it somewhere and post the URL here.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Hi Oscar</p>
<p>
</p><p>The capability to change the <strong>Fn</strong> Key functions depends on the <strong>
Laptop manufacturer</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen some <strong>Dell</strong> computers that had a component named <strong>
Function Key Row</strong> in the <strong>Control Panel</strong> / <strong>Windows Mobility Center.</strong>&nbsp;This allowed you to make limited changes to some of the Function keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not find anything similar, check with the Laptop manufacturer.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Operating System Not Found&#34;- Acer Laptop </h2>
                    
Blue Screen Appears then says "Operating System Not Found" - Acer Laptop
<div>
<div>
<blockquote>I dont remember doing anything wrong on my computer then browsing youtube, the web, messenger, watching videos and doing my homework on word.<br />
<br />
My acer has 500 GB HDD and 4 GB memory. <br />
All of the sudden while I was working, my computer starts being slow<br />
and not responding to my actions quickly, then becomes frozen. After that the <br />
blue screen of death appears. So I press the power then restart it again. <br />
Then a whole bunch of message appears , finishes it with " Operating System Not<br />
Found". <br />
So I tried to goto Bios and putted the Hard drive to boot first and make sure the<br />
network wasn't. After that I used my recovery CD from Desktop to check if I can <br />
reinstall windows but then when it asks to choose a drive to format or to install windows on to , it says no harddrive cant be found. So I can't even reinstall windows. I called Acer and they said they will send a CD, but I want to know if there is any other
 way because I dont want to wait 10 -15 days for the CD. Has anyone had this problem and found a way to solve it please help me out.!</blockquote>

            You might have a dead hard disk. Booting the machine with one of these boot CDs will tell you:<br />
<ul>
<li>A Windows 7 installation DVD. </li><li>A Windows 7 Repair CD (the one that the initial installation process prompted you to burn)</li><li>An Ubuntu CD (http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/). Note that downloading the Ubuntu CD image of 720 MBytes can take a long time.</li></ul>

<p>Grunds√§tzlich gilt bei MS bei nicht eingel√∂sten Lastschriften:</p>
<p>Nicht manuell √ºberweisen - das System im Hause MS kann das ganze nicht zuweisen.</p>
<p>Man kann das Konto nicht ausgleichen mit Prepaid Codes oder √§hnlichem.</p>
<p>Bei sowas kann nur der Telefonsupport helfen.</p>
<p>Ein Anruf gen√ºgt.</p>
<p>Die werden eine erneute Abbuchung sofort ins System eintragen und sollte dann reibungslos abgebucht werden.</p>
<p>Sollte man in der zwischenzeit nicht auf Live zugreifen k√∂nnen wird sp√§testens 5 Min nach dem Anruf wieder freigeschaltet.</p>
<p>oder in kurz: Support anrufen</p>

                    <p>For the last year me and a couple of my friend who live close to me have had trouble joining each other lobbies when we are playing certain games. Sure there are a few games that work such as overwatch and fortnite but games like Minecraft, dead by daylight, watch dogs 2, black ops 3, every time we attempt to join it will pop up with a message saying "lobby not found" but then I will play with a friend who lives across the country and no issues at all. Also to note I can join my friends if someone from another state hosts the game.</p>

                    <p>I have two computers running windows 10 that every so often complain of low memory and have to be shut down and be rebooted to work again. They will be running fine with the following programs running (mozilla firefox, MS Access, MS Word, MS Excel, Datapower
 reader). They never had a problem on Windows 7 but since upgrading to 10 they keep showing this same problem. I have added additional memory and that has made no difference. I have checked all software is up to date, have checked for viruses/malware but still
 can't find the problem causing the overload on memory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Samantha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "low on memory" notification may show if there are programs or applications that take up too much of your PC's RAM. We'd like to know more about you issue by answering the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did the issue start?</li><li>Aside from upgrading to Windows 10, were there other changes made to your PC prior to the issue?</li><li>What is the current RAM of your PC?</li><li>Did you add RAM or storage to your PC?</li><li>Aside from the troubleshooting steps you've mentioned, is there any other troubleshooting you've done?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>1) I think it started just after upgrading from windows 7 to 10</p>
<p>2) I don't recall any other changes</p>
<p>3) current Ram is 8GB</p>
<p>4) Both machines had 4 GB I added another 4GB</p>
<p>5) I ran CCleaner and used it to clear logs, temp folders and fix registry issues. I also used the disc clean to remove the old windows version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) 1 machine runs AVG, the other is running windows defender.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 animations suddenly stop working&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 Pro on my laptop (Lenovo Ideapad 110). When I open something (calculator, calendar, start menu etc.) animation is working, but when I try to click on something OR move my mouse around fast, the animation disappears. I hope that someone
 will help. I'll also post photos of calculator and calendar situations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, Stefan.</p>

            Those instructions are correct, I tried it and confirmed it myself. 
<br />
<br />If its not working, then your display drivers might need to be reinstalled or updated. 
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.‚Äù 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />

            Hi.  I'm Greg, a volunteer and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />Was that a DVD you'd backed up in 2013?
<br />
<br />Driver DVD"s are dated almost as soon as they're pressed.  That's why we should always get our drivers from the PC or Device's Support Downloads webpage to be sure we have the latest.  
<br />
<br />Are there WIndows 10 drivers from the motherboard?  If not try Windows 8.1, 8 or 7 in that order.  
<br />
<br />Are you having problems with the drivers WIndows 10 wants?   Type Update in Start search to expedite Update installs to see if it gives you any newer Updates.  
<br />
<br />But the new version may have provided a driver that's inferior to the one already installed.  For this you can see all previously installed drivers for  various chipset elements that concern you by right clicking Start to open Device Manager, click on Device, then Driver tab, the Update Driver.  Choose Browse and then Let Me Pick to see the previously installed drivers to compare and try others to see if they work better.  This solved a problem for someone earlier today. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Yes, it is a backup from a DVD disc that came with my CPU. I was lazy enough to go through some boxes just to find it, so I took a shortcut. Nothing wrong with where the files come from, because everything still works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, it wasn't from 2013, it was from...maybe 2015. The computer I was using was a custom built system with old hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<p>MSI AM1i</p>
<p>Zotac Geforce GT 610 (Couldn't install the driver, but somehow that problem was fixed.)</p>
<p>AMD Athlon 5350 APU (That's the CPU.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you watched the YouTube video, you would know what happens when I try to open the Autorun for my motherboard drivers and programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I see four with the same name in Device manager. Not so sure if the system will actually run smooth without the CPU drivers. Are you saying that the new build of Windows 10 already had drivers for my CPU, just so I wouldn't have to install them myself?
 The CPU and GPU are /real/ old, so I figured the OS no longer supported the hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, there is driver compadibility with the CPU for Windows 10. Worked with older versions such as Windows 10 "Technical Prieview," maybe though the Aniversary update. Maybe stopped working with Redstone 3, or "Fall Creators Update."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only problem is I can't run the Autorun from my driver backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: The system is also running a fresh install of the OS itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will test this tomorrow. Thanks for the reply.</p>

            Again, I would go to the motherboard model's Support Downloads webpage to get the latest WIndows 10 drivers which most likely will be newer than an older driver disk.   Then compare the driver performance between those, the one's Windows Update may stil deliver, then ones v.1709 installed and if necessary even go back to an older driver stored in Dev Mgr.

            Hi, I just watched your video . . .
<br />
<br />The error you are getting is that setup must be run as Administrator. I don't see you trying to run the setup as Administrator in the video and the resulting error
<br />
<br />If you right click the executable and choose 'Run as Administrator' what error is then generated?
<br />
<br />If all else fails, you could try running the setup from a Command Prompt as Administrator:
<br />
<br />Click your Start button, type cmd, right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator
<br />
<br />Run the following command:
<br />(replace aUser with your login name)
<br />
<br />runas /profile /user:aUser ‚ÄúE:\Drivers\MSI Drivers\DVDSetup.exe‚Äù
<br />

</p><p>I did run the setup as Administrator, even though I didn't do it in the video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wouldn't have worked anyway. I even did the alternate solutions to running the setup as Admin. Just gives me the same message.</p>

<p>I looked on MSI's website and saw that some drivers haven't been updated since then, (or in a while, I should say) so it's rare that I will receive any support for my motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at Device Manager and saw that there were four or five CPU selections of the same name. I think it said something like, "AMD Athlon APU 5350 Processors" or something. I suppose the only difference is the version they run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Haven't had time to download the drivers after that because my internet doesn't work well from where my stuff is set up, and I had other things that needed to be taken care ASAP.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t change language after playing games</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 and since I upgraded I have problems after I finish playing games.</p>
<p>On my PC I am using 2 languages, English and Hebrew (main) and after I am playing video games it's getting stuck on Hebrew.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Games like:</p>
<p>Dishonored&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deus Ex Human Revuloution&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I finish playing this games and close them I can't change the language, it's just stuck, only way I can change it to English is via Caps Lock. Alt + Shift not working and not chaning it, and I also don't see the language select in the bottom toolbar.
 So every time I need to restart my PC to solve it, but there must be other way.</p>

<h2>            Race Driver GRID PC game is not working on my Windows 7.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have my PC with configuration as given below:</p>
<p>CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) 2 Duo E7500 with 2.93 GHz</p>
<p>RAM: 4GB DDR3 (2.83GB usable)</p>
<p>Video Card: Intel(R) 4 Series Express Chipset Family (1294MB VRAM)</p>
<p>OS: Windows 7 32-bit</p>
<p>DirectX: DirectX 11</p>
<p>HDD: 500GB</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, I downloaded the game from RG Mechanics via torrent client.I installed the game and opened the game. First, It prompted like it needs files like d3dx9_41.dll and OpenAL32.dll. I downloaded those files from internet through the website 'www.dll-files.com'
 and copied in game directory.Then I opened the game and it shows only the black screen. I even tried to re-install by disabling the anti-virus, copied .dll files into game directory and tried opening the game and still it shows the black screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would be very thankful if anyone will provide me a solution to this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Cloud saves are overwriting my local saves</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to copy a save from one computer (computer A), to another (computer B). The game in question is Resident Evil 7 (if it matters)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been able to locate the saves and copy them over to several friends computers (using the same version off the Microsoft Store), and all works fine for most people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, two people have run into an issue where, upon launching the game, their local saves are instantly overwritten with their cloud saves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some setting for Xbox Play Anywhere titles where cloud saves somehow prioritize over local saves? It's only happened to 2 people out of a test of about 10, so I'm assuming something just needs to be disabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cloud saves are enabled on all 10 systems. What happens for most people, is those new saves end up getting uploaded to the cloud and can then be used on their Xbox One version, as well. I'm stumped in trying to figure out why this keeps happening to only
 a few people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>About half the people testing this out have an Xbox One, and the other half doesn't. One person this issue happens to doesn't even have an Xbox One...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be wonderful!</p>
<p>
