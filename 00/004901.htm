<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c7dde253-07ec-4da8-aeef-299748f6f914" title="ThierryDehove">
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no option in the app to see your password. Therefore, it is important that you always know your password, or better yet take note of it. In case you have forgotten your password, you can do password reset.

    <title>Change an excel cell format based on multple differnt cells contents - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> splash1971  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change an excel cell format based on multple differnt cells contents</h2>
                    <p>This may be simpler than I am making it, but I am thoroughly frustrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an excel spreadsheet that automatically generates due dates for the 10 different steps of a project when I enter the overall due date of the project.&nbsp; Next to each of the due dates is an empty cell where the user enters the actual date the task is
 completed.&nbsp; Up to this point everything is working well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I need to have each of the actual completion date cells change color based on these criteria:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have one cell of the spreadsheet with the TODAY() formula and one with the NOW() formula to use to calculate the Red/Green/Yellow status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the cell is empty:</p>
<p>Red = past due</p>
<p>Green = On target</p>
<p>Yellow = 1 week or less until due date</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the cell has a date entered:</p>
<p>Red = completed after the due date</p>
<p>Green = completed on time</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is no due date in the adjacent cell the cell is blank and white.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried these formulas in the conditional formatting rules with limited results:</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Yellow =OR((AND($H4="0", $C$2&lt;$F4)),(AND($C$2&gt;$F4-38, $C$2&lt;$F4-31)))
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Red =OR((AND($H4="0", $C$2&gt;$g4)),($C$2&gt;$g4))
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Green =OR((AND($H4="0", $C$2&lt;$f4-30)),($C$2&lt;$f4-30))</font></font></font></p>

            <p>The test for the cell being empty looks wrong to me.<br />
An empty&nbsp;cell will be seen as being equal to 0 or to "" but not to "0"<br />
You seem to be testing for a difference of a month (-30) rather than a week as in the description.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have another go, and if you still get problems, describe the circumstances that don't work as you intended.</p>

            <p>You have restated the requirement, but the conditional formulas you posted originally do not address that requirement - firstly because the test for an empty cell is not correct, as I indicated before, and secondly because you seem to be testing for dates
 within a month rather than within a week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume that C2 contains the TODAY() formula.<br />
I am not clear on the relevance of the NOW() formula.</p>
<p>The formulas you posted, presumably for H4 are in some cases dependent on F4 and in some on G4 but you don't indicate the relationship between F4 and G4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I ignore your formulas and just work from the requirement as stated, for H4, I would think</p>
<p>White: =F4=""<br />
Red: =OR(H4&gt;G4,AND(H4=0,$C$2&gt;G4))<br />
Yellow: =AND(H4=0,$C$2-G4&gt;=7)<br />
Green: =H4&lt;=G4<br />
in each case, stopping when the condition is satisfied.</p>

    <title>Windows Phone 7 vs. WP8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> poit57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Phone 7 vs. WP8</h2>
                    <p>I am a Windows Phone 7 user -- a former AT&amp;T employee who was anticipating the OS long before it's launch and have&nbsp;used various&nbsp;WP7 devices since its launch. I have been following the news regarding the WP8 launch and corresponding WP 7.8 update to previous&nbsp;Windows
 Phone devices. As I understand it, the reason there is not a direct upgrade for WP7 devices to WP8 because the underlying architecture of the OS is completely different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has got me wondering:&nbsp;How difficult would it have been for the Windows Phone team to have created drivers for WP8 to support the hardware in WP7 devices and to call the new version of the software Windows Phone 8 regardless of the amount of features
 locked down by hardware limitations? Maybe I have been spoiled by the iPhone update mentality, but I didn't hear many complains&nbsp;when iPhone 3G, 3GS and iPhone 4 all were able to run iOS 4, even though&nbsp;the 3GS didn't support all the features of the new phone
 and the&nbsp;3G supported even fewer new features. I just think that marketing the phones this way have calmed a lot of the&nbsp;hysteria surrounding newer WP7 devices that were seemingly obsolete shortly after launch. Again, I'm not adept at programming and don't know
 how difficult it would have been to do this, I was just wondering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the very least, I think Windows Phone 7.8 should have been ready at the launch of WP8. As demonstrated by the iPhone users, the satisfaction of knowing their phone had been updated would far exceed any confusion that older hardware is not able to support
 every new feature that the operating system could offer.</p>

            <p>All very good questions, but I'm afraid we're just users like you are.&nbsp; We don't have any&nbsp;of those answers, nor do we have a pipeline into MS or the WPhone Development team.</p>
<p>I know a LOT of people are asking the same types of questions when they read what's going to be available in the MAJOR 7.8 update -- so far, not much....</p>
<p>As far as the iOS world -- remember that with iPhone, Apple has COMPLETE control of the entire development and infrastructure cycle -- down to the bios and drivers/hardware specs of EVERY (1) device which runs the phone o/s.&nbsp; MS is relying on 3rd party manufacturers,
 with their own agendas, so it's a bit harder to keep EVERYTHING working from version to version of the O/S.</p>

<h2>            Not Connected</h2>
                    
<p>I have installed Windows Mobile Device Center (V6.1) on my Vista Ultimate machine and cannot get my Pocket PC to connect to the computer. I set the device settings to Allow USB, Automatic, Allow Automatic device authentication,
 and Allow data connections. The new device found and installed messages have appeared, but still no connection. Ideas?</p>

<p>Found and fixed the problem on one computer. The problem was Windows Live OneCare and I found the solution&nbsp;in Windows Mobile Device Center's Troubleshooting Guide. Now I can't find the exact reference, which was very
 easy to follow. If I find it, I will report back.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The "dots" and "dingus" (aka "Paragraph Mark") are "non-printing character".&nbsp; They show you how Word is applying some types of formatting, like spaces and tabs.&nbsp; When you understand them, they can be VERY helpful in figuring out why Word is "doing something
 weird" to your text.&nbsp; This link explains the meaning behind the characters.&nbsp; Personally, I keep them turned on 99% of the time.</p>

Displaying non-printing characters can help you better understand the formatting and contents of your documents. What do all the different symbols displayed by Word really mean, though?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you authenticate to any of the Office 365 web apps, a session is established between your browser and the Office 365 web app you’re using. Sessions can expire when you're inactive, or
 when your authentication token expires for other reasons such as when your password has been reset. Each of the different web apps in Office 365 have different session timeouts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For editing in PowerPoint Online, the session timeout is set to 15 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,<br />

<h2>            How can I attach documents located on a SharePoint library to an email&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Office 365 account and I have hundreds of documents loaded on SharePoint using&nbsp;OneDrive for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows Phone 8.1 I was able to easily share documents contained in a SharePoint site / library attaching them to an email using the Office App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I do the same thing on Windows 10 Mobile?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open a new message in email and I try to attach a document, I get the following options:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a196e2a1-7c5e-49ba-8da8-95ef96135321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a196e2a1-7c5e-49ba-8da8-95ef96135321" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>No way to select a file on a SharePoint site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am comprehensively using Microsoft's technology for my business and I have to face up every day with new&nbsp;Microsoft's piece of software that do not work seamlessly&nbsp;with&nbsp;the other Microsoft's software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will this get to an end someday? Should we infer that Microsoft gave up its attempt to play a role in the&nbsp;mobile field, ad&nbsp;begin a migration to Android?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Zombied&#58;  Cannot launch Any Application including IE or any task requiring Administrative functions. Build 9926</h2>
                    <p>I started having some serious issues last week, and it seemed to start after updated Visual Studio 2013 to Update 4.&nbsp; I can't say definitively that this caused my issue, because I've restored from a Backup using ATI 2015, and eventually (after first restart)
 run into the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is I can run virtually no application (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook), IE, Task Manager, msconfig or, launch any program or control panel Item that requires administrative privileges.&nbsp; The Cortana icon has switched over to a Search Icon, and
 when I go to the control panel it says it cannot start up on this machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restored from a backup like I mentioned.&nbsp; On first boot up, everything appears back to normal.&nbsp; I then came back the following morning (machine stayed on overnight), and when I logged in came back to the issue.&nbsp; I noticed Windows Updates restarted the
 machine.&nbsp; Thinking I received a bad update, restored again, selecting a backup from Acronis even further back in time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then upon starting up again, I was OK again.&nbsp; This time I went to turn off Windows Updates.&nbsp; The choices in Windows 10 are a little non-obvious.&nbsp; But I was able to select an option that suggested I would be asked to manually schedule the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I thought perhaps I'd try immediately restarting without any updates.&nbsp; It turned out to have the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect it's some sort of issue with how closely the Microsoft Account is bound to the user.&nbsp; When I try to run task manager or open an elevated command prompt the it just sits there indefinitely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I'd try booting into safe mode with not luck:&nbsp; I received the rather ambiguous "A Hard Error has occurred" message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried booting directly to a command prompt to run "sfc /scannow" with no luck.&nbsp; It bails out almost immediately at 2% with a Windows Resource Error.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm restoring again now, with the hopes of creating a "new" administrator account before first restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like not only am I non-functional -- but almost every tool available for recovery or repair has failed me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yikes.&nbsp; I'd like to avoid a clean install if possible.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run into several forum related people running into similar issues, but none that have completely matched this scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jason</p>

</p><p>I suggest you to run Check Disk. If there is any issue regarding hardware then it will fix that. Refer the steps:</p>
<div>
<p>a.&nbsp;Click on <strong>Start</strong>, type Command prompt&nbsp;in the start search, right-click on&nbsp; Command Prompt and then click
<strong>Run as Administrator.</strong><br />
b.&nbsp;Type the following&nbsp; command: </p>
<p>chkdsk /r (there is a space between k and /)</p>

            <p>Thanks for your advice.&nbsp; Since the system would sit indefinitely on any request to Run As Administrator, I was not able to execute the command with elevated privileges.&nbsp; However, what I was able to do was restore again from the backup and create a second
 user ("test") with administrative privileges, log on as that user and run chkdsk.&nbsp; It didn't seem to find any problems with chkdsk.</p>

No, I don't want to have to choose each time.&nbsp; I want it to DEFAULT to xlsx type.&nbsp; Right now, it defaults to xls even if I have an xlsx sheet open and create a new sheet while I'm in the xlsx sheet.&nbsp; How do you change the defaults in Excel?&nbsp; The old version

The suggestion is to modify the <strong>default</strong> setting with File | <strong>
Options</strong> | Save tab ;-)

    <title>Recovery Partition problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonypsmythe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovery Partition problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I decided to dual boot my Windows 8.1 with Windows 10 Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how I went about it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First I went into admin and opened Disk Management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I shrunk my C: drive so that I had 100GB unallocated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I shut down my PC and booted up with the installer DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I installed win10 on the unallocated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it did what it had to do (getting devices ready, etc) and it started up in 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, at that point everything worked perfectly, I would power up and have the choice between 8.1 and 10 (and for some reason "Windows Rollback", which would (I think) try to reset the win10 to an earlier preview build, because the installer wasn't for 9926,
 but an earlier one). I did select the Windows Rollback once, but then it said "Restoring Windows to a previous version" or something like that, so I immediately shut the PC down (holding the power button). When I started up again, I selected windows 10. It
 then decided that the D drive needed repairing and it did so and everything was nice. Windows 8.1 was unaffected by Windows Rollback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, everything was nice until...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a while, my windows 10 partition was acting weird. "No problem," I thought, "I'll just delete it and start over."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, this is what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I booted up into Windows 8.1 and logged into the Administrator account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started Disk Management and deleted the D: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THEN I realized that there were TWO "Healthy (Recovery Partition)"s!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The photo below is of my current HD state <em>right now.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71cfec04-4f10-4254-b946-faecd81abc4c" /></p>
<p>One was 16.31GB, and the other one was 600MB!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and another thing that I should mention is that when I resized the C: partition prior to installing Windows 10, I set the "Enter the amount of space to shrink in MB" to 100,000MBs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which recovery partition is for Windows 10, and which for Windows 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Currently, when I boot up, I get the UEFI boot screen of "Which operating system do you want to boot in" and it gives me the option of Windows 8.1, and still that ominous "Windows Rollback".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really want to put Windows 10 back onto my PC, but I'm afraid to mess more stuff up (or at least make things more complicated).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, I've provided enough info for you guys to troubleshoot this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>====================================================</p>
<p>Another problem (and this might be related, or maybe not), is that when I go into admin in Windows 8.1 and try to create recovery media, it says that "We can't create a recovery drive on this PC", and that&nbsp;"Some required files are missing. To troubleshoot
 problem when your PC can't start, use your Windows installation disc or media".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this Acer E5 PC didn't come with recovery media, and it doesn't have the Product Key sticker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=====================================================================</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do for both problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a ton, Microsoft Community, you guys are the best!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tony</p>

            <p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. I suggest you to not delete the recovery partition. Just install the Windows 10 technical preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the link for Rollback, is to rollback to previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do keep us updated on the status of the installation. We will be glad to help.</p>

    <title>Disable userform combobox change event when arrow keys are used - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rich007a  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable userform combobox change event when arrow keys are used</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I have a userform with a series of comboboxes (style=fmStyleDropdownList).&nbsp; The results of the first combobox dictates what appears in the list in the second combobox and so on.</p>
<p>At present, I use the Combobox.Change event to set up the next combobox list, set focus to the next box, and open the dropdown (if there&nbsp;is more than one item in the list).</p>
<p>Here's my problem: if the user uses the keyboard rather than the mouse it all goes wrong.&nbsp; Alt+Down opens the dropdown in the first combo, but unlike when you float the mouse over items in the combobox dropdown list where the highlight moves but the combobox
 value does not change until the mouse is clicked, when the down arrow is pressed the combobox value changes immediately to the next item down in the list... and the change event fires!&nbsp; The dropdown is stil down, but the change event fires.</p>
<p>What I would like to do have happen is for the arrow keys to move the selection up and down the dropdown list, but&nbsp; not change the value of the combobox (and fire the change event) until the user hits enter or tab.</p>
<p>I have "Me.EnableEvents = False/True" and "If Me.EnableEvents Then..." used throughout to prevent change events firing when other comboboxes are changed by code, but can't think how to implement these to achieve the above.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>I guess what I'm really asking here is; is there a way using keydown events or similar to disable the change event when an arrow key is used to change the selection in an open dropdown of a combobox?</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
Rich</p>

            <p>You have to use a KeyDown event to trap when user press arrow up or down, and use a boolean variable to test if the Change event should fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insert the dim statement at the very top of the userform module (outside any sub) and then insert the KeyDown event and setup your change event as in mine example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dim ChangeNotOk As Boolean</p>
<p>Private Sub ComboBox1_Change()<br />
If ChangeNotOk Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ChangeNotOk = False </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'User pressed arrow up or arrow down<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'your current change event code</p>
<p>End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p><br />
Private Sub ComboBox1_KeyDown(ByVal KeyCode As MSForms.ReturnInteger, ByVal Shift As Integer)<br />
If KeyCode = 38 Or KeyCode = 40 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ChangeNotOk = True<br />
End If<br />
End Sub<br />

            <p>Hello DjLoOn3y,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you can't buy anything in your Windows phone's Store, although you can buy from the Xbox music app, and that the Wallet app crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case you can try to following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check which is your primary Microsoft on the phone. It would be the first Microsoft account listed in settings &gt; e-mail + account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log into this account here : <a href="https://login.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft account</a> and check that your payment instrument is up to date. You can also try to remove it, wait 24 hours and add it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your phone, go in settings &gt; e-mail + account &gt; tap and hold on the Microsoft account &gt; click on Sync.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try again to buy something in the Store. If this is still not working, you can try to soft reset the phone (this won't erase your data). To do a proper soft reset, press and hold Volume Down + Power buttons for 10-15 seconds until the phone vibrates and
 turns off on itself (/!\ please ignore the slide down menu).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a&nbsp;last resort , you can try a hard reset. Be careful though, this erases the phone's data, so make sure that it's all saved.</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />Very simple, but beyond the ability of Word Online. If you have access to Word on a desktop, you could save a template and use that with Word Online.
<br />You can download templates.

            Hi wadeoberg 
<br />
<br />On your Start Menu, 
<br />
<br />If you have Office installed on your PC, scroll down the alphabetical list to find M - Microsoft Office - Word, then drag Word from the Start Menu onto your Desktop to create a shortcut
<br />
<br />If your do not have Microsoft Office installed on your PC,  scroll down the alphabetical list to find W - Windows Accessories - Wordpad, then drag Wordpad  from the Start Menu onto your Desktop to create a shortcut

<br />
<br />Hello WadeOberg
<br />
<br />Not sure if you're asking about how to place a &lt;Word&gt; icon on your desktop or an icon for a simple editor that will allow you to do the above so will provide multiple options
<br />
<br />#1 - For Word --&gt; click on the Windows key --&gt; scroll down until you find Word --&gt; press the left mouse key and keep it pressed --&gt; drag it to your desktop
<br />
<br />#2 - If your looking for a simple text editor with no formatting fuctionality --&gt; enter &lt;NotePad&gt; in the search box (without the angle brackets) --&gt; select it and drag it to the desktop
<br />
<br />#3 - With a simple editor with formatting capabilities similar to &lt;Word&gt; --&gt; enter &lt;WordPad&gt; in the Search box and drag it to your desktop
<br />
<br />If the above doesn't address your question - please provide additional details.

<h2>            &#34;An error occurred while attempting to open the windows address book. Unable to find the WAB DLL&#34;</h2>
                    Hello, I am posting on behalf of a customer. <br />
<br />
The customer encountered the above error when trying to send an email using Outlook 2000. He has already called his ISP (Comcast) to make sure that all settings are correct.
<br />
He also has another question. 
<p>Is it possible for him to have emails coming in to Outlook and his wife who has a different email address use the same Ou</p>tlook as well?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            Error would only occur with a completely outdated version. Outlook 2000 IMO is not compatiblle with any existing operating systems and has not been for years.

<p>
</p><p>I have tried an older build 9218 I think it was, both as legacy and as EFI boot to install. Both builds get 30-33% then fail with missing file reports. No filename is given though, if i remember rightly the error code was 0x080070507 ... sorry i didnt write
 it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Linux is installing fine on the same box so i am pretty certain the error is not hardware failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated, I aint too keen on this Linux OS</p>

<p>Could be a corrupt .ISO download, try again using the steps listed below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A) Start by reading this Wiki article: 10 Tips before installing the latest Windows 10 build</p>

<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-10-tips-before-installing-the-latest/4fbec413-fed4-4a18-b1de-399a2d1e2a3a"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-10-tips-before-installing-the-latest/4fbec413-fed4-4a18-b1de-399a2d1e2a3a</span></span></strong></a></p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>B) If necessary, create your own installation media following the steps listed below. Note: Do not skip step #3 as your download should be verified that is not corrupt.</p>
</strong><p><strong>
</strong>
</p><p><strong>1)</strong> <strong>The .ISO file for the standard Windows 10 Tech. Preview build 9926 is now available. Download the appropriate ISO version.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>English (US) 64Bit download: </strong><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=522100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=522100</span></span></strong></a><strong>

<p>
<strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>2) After downloading the correct .iso file install HashCalc and validate the SHA1 hash value is correct.</strong></p><strong>
</strong>
<p>HashCalc: <a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>(Note: If the download is not corrupt, the value HashCalc returns will match the SHA1 value I posted, hash values are not case sensitive; Example: an upper case letter A is the same as a lower case letter a)</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Launch HashCalc and navigate to the location of the .iso file you downloaded.</p>
<p>(The default download location is: C:\Users\User account name\Downloads)</p>
<p>b) Remove all check marks from the list of HashCalc options except for SHA1.</p>
<p>c) Click the ‘Calculate’ button and wait for the SHA1 string of letters and number to be displayed.</p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>3) Next use ImgBurn (or Gear ISO) to create a bootable DVD.</strong></p><strong>
</strong>
<p>ImgBurn: <a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/imgburn.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>Note: When installing ImgBurn, choose the "Custom Installation (advanced)" option and remove the check mark(s) to eliminate unwanted options, including Optimizer Pro (I do not accept) which is not needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Burning ISO Images with ImgBurn article: <a href="http://neosmart.net/wiki/display/G/Burning+ISO+Images+with+ImgBurn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>(The steps are the same for Windows 7 or Windows 8), except you are not creating a Repair disc but a full installation DVD)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Always use high quality DVD+R media and the slowest burn speed (4x or 6x) if offered a choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Skip to step #4 to create a bootable Flash / Thumb drive.</p>

            Hi  356sc, if it is only Office applications that are printing blank pages, follow these steps to perform a full repair of your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the Online Repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation . . .       
        </p>

<h3> andre for directly  say:</h3>
<ul class="message-user-info-affiliations-list">
    </ul>
            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.
<br />
<br />
<br />If not...
<br />
<br />Please try the steps recommended below to uninstall printer software 
<br />
<br />Option 1: Run the Printer Troubleshooter - <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_printer10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_printer10</a>

<br />
<br />Option 2: Uninstall and Reinstall the Printer
<br />A. Uninstall the Printer
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features / Programs and Features
<br />Select your printer.
<br />Select Uninstall.
<br />
<br />Windows key+R, type control, hit Enter
<br />Open Devices and Printers.
<br />In the Devices and Printers window look for your Printer. If you see it listed, right-click on it and choose Delete or Remove Device
<br />
<br />Windows Key+R, type Cmd, hit Enter
<br />Type printui.exe /s &gt; OK.
<br />Click on Drivers tab.
<br />Look for Printer driver. If you see it click on it and click Remove at the bottom.
<br />Select OK.
<br />Select Apply and OK on the Print Server Properties windows.
<br />Close Devices and Printers.
<br />
<br />B. Install the Driver
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers
<br />Reinstall the Printer driver
<br />Reboot the computer

<h2>            Microsoft Band 2, wristband has worn&#47;cracked.</h2>
                    <p>I bought my Band 2 from the Microsoft Store (UK) online. Since then the wristband has worn/cracked on both sides of the device. I've been using black electrical tape to keep it together, but I'm of the view that a 199 GBP device should not be in this condition
 after 8 months of use.</p>

<h3> mrdoyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will T-mobile release the Windows Phone 8 GDR2 update to Nokia Lumia 810 users&#63;</h2>
                    I am aware T-Mobile, after about 5 months, placed the Nokia Lumia 810 under EOL, however, many sources have said older Lumia models, including the 810, would get the GDR2 update. How would T-mobile customers acquire the update if they no longer support
 it? What other carriers is the 810 available for? I'm really hoping to get the new update. And of course, this isn't the first time T-mobile has done this. They also prevented the Lumia 710 from being able to upgrade to 7.8. Just hoping there is a loophole
 to acquire the update, or something. Please, if anyone is going to answer this question, please be straight forward. No "official statement-like" answers that doesn't answer the question. Thank you.

            Windows Phone 7 updates were distributed by the Mobile Operator. Unlike them, Windows Phone 8 updates are given directly by Microsoft, so T-Mobile should not have any influence on them. I would contact the Windows Phone support to find out directly. I
 believe they have a chat support.<br />
