<h2>            Cannot open a rescued Word document.doc</h2>
                    Microsoft Word errored out and I was forced to save a document as&nbsp;rescued document.doc. &nbsp;However, when I try to open the doc, I get the message:&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Microsoft Word cannot open this file because it is an unsupported file type."
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I recover the contents?</div>
</div>
                </div>

            <div>I know this thread is old but I have been trying the get past the "Microsoft Word cannot open this file because it is an unsupported file type" error when opening standalone .asd files all day today as my home backup task makes copies of the asd files
 that Word creates every 5 minutes and pastes the copy .asd into a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;folder to assist recovery from accidental deletions. &nbsp;Call me&nbsp;paranoid&nbsp;:-)</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>The discovery I thought worth sharing is that I was able to successfully open .asd files with
<b>all the original formatting and text</b> and the file looked exactly like the last time it was saved. &nbsp;Previous to this discovery I kept getting the "......unsupported file type" error and the best i could do was recover the text using the text recovery
 or notepad options. &nbsp;The same .asd files that couldn't open before now open correctly in "Read Only" mode but have all the text and formatting saving you minutes or hours of formatting work!</div>
<div><br />
<div>So here it is: (it's so simply but it works)</div>
<div><br />
<div>The <b>first step is the most important</b> - this is what made it work!</div>
<div><br />
<div>(1) Place a copy the .asd file into the unsaved files folder. &nbsp;The location of this folder on my system is "C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\UnsavedFiles"&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>(2) Open Word and click on File - Recent</div>
<div><br />
<div>(3) Looking down the bottom of the screen you see a button/box titled "Recover Unsaved Documents"</div>
<div><br />
<div>(4) Click that button/box and open the .asd file you placed in the unsaved files folder in Step (1).</div>
<div><br />
<div>If it works then a smile returns to your face and all is forgiven. &nbsp;Blood pressure subsides and everyone is happy again. &nbsp;If it doesn't work then the .asd is possibly corrupt and try recovering just the text out of the file using all the suggestions on
 this thread and the internet. &nbsp;Good luck!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Last comment: Without doing the first step of placing the .asd file into the special folder I couldn't get past the error. &nbsp;I'm not an advanced Word problem solver just a person trying to make my back routine work. &nbsp;My environment is Windows 7 64-bit /
 &nbsp;Word 2010 32-bit.</div>

            Thanks Varun. &nbsp;None of those suggestions worked, but it gave me an idea.
<div><br />
<div>I opened WordPad. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>On File Open, I selected *.*, the *.doc and the document opened. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was able to then recover the text. &nbsp;</div>

            Hi Etienne,
<br />
<br />In Office 2010, save that file as an RTF file
<br />
<br />Click File - Save As - Change type of file to RTF (Rich Text Format)
<br />
<br />Then try opening that rtf file in Word 2016, does all the file content then appear?

            In Word 2016, switch to Draft view and see if all of the document is then visible.&nbsp; If it is, copy everything EXCEPT for the final paragraph mark in the document and paste it into a new, blank document and check if you can then see everything when in Print
 Layout View.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />See Doug Robbins' response. Follow his advice. Saving as RTF is a good compromise but does not retain all document content.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2016 and &#64;msn.com mail setup</h2>
                    I am attempting to setup my @msn.com email account under Outlook 2016 which I just purchased. &nbsp; When I attempt to launch Outlook for the first time it asks for my login credentials and I provide them. &nbsp; It is able to establish a network connection but
 goes into an endless waiting cycle on "searching for @msn.com settings". &nbsp; &nbsp; As a result I've also tried to use manual settings and this also fails but there are multiple suggestions about which servers addresses to use for @msn.com. &nbsp; &nbsp; Any suggestions on
 how to get my account working in Outlook? &nbsp; I can access it fine from outlook.com and on my iphone but it never works in Outlook 2016.

<h2>            Fonts missing in Microsoft Word 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I have a few fonts that don't show up in Word on my Mac (running 10.13) that do show up in every other application.&nbsp; The main one I'm concerned about is Garamond.&nbsp; I've tried removing the caches, restarting the computer to Safe Mode, and removing and re-adding
 the font.&nbsp; Nothing is working.&nbsp; Any other thoughts?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I contacted Support by chat on this, and after asking one or two questions, they immediately asked to take control of my computer.&nbsp; I won't do that for anything but the most extreme cases, and I found it very off-putting.&nbsp; There's nothing on
 there I wouldn't mind anyone seeing, per se, but I think over-reliance on remote tools is a security hazard.</p>

            Because of sandboxing concerns. Office 2016 Fonts is not repairable within FontBook.&nbsp;Each application has its own set of fonts, and they&nbsp;are in a sandboxed location only known to&nbsp;Microsoft. (I've spent Hours looking for them) I also find that in Word and
 PowerPoint I don't have Gramond. I do have the Pro version of Adobe Garamond&nbsp;available&nbsp;for all applications. I wish I could help.&nbsp;After I had to restore my system, I don't even have Home directory except for a stub. &nbsp;And I've had to either re-buy my applications
 or go to application&nbsp;websites and&nbsp;beg registration information.&nbsp;

<h2>            Access database is running very slow when trying to access a specific record.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Ok, we have an access database that was created in Access 2003 and is opened with 2007. The problem exists whether we open it with either version. We have a form that pulls records in a numerical sequence. When we specify a record to open that has
 had numerous entries on it, the database will open it but very very slowly.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I have compacted and repaired the database and immediately afterward the database runs like a top. But after other users on the network start accessing it, it bogs down again.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>I should mention that only few people have access to view all the different records, most people only have access to create new records. Newer records with no or few entries to them are not slow at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Can you please say what "specify a record to open" means?&nbsp; Can you give details of how this is done?&nbsp; Also, is the Record Source of this form a table or a query?&nbsp; If it is a query, can you copy/paste the SQL view of the query to your reply here?&nbsp; That may
 help us to understand what's going on.&nbsp; Also, does your form have any subforms?</p>
<p>Sorry, more questions than answers at the moment!</p>

<p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Band may not be getting any heart rate readings if it doesn't lock. This could be the reason why you get just dashes. It helps if you wait for about 2 minutes before you hit end to ensure you don't lose the heart rate lock. You might want to take a look
 on this <a href="https://forums.windowscentral.com/microsoft-band/357757-why-am-i-not-getting-2min-ending-heart-rate-after-gps-bike-ride.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Will my screen still be considered a touch screen?</p>

The gibberish does not show on the document in Word but only when I print it or produce a preview.<br />

I need to get this done as soon as I can as it is for somebody else.<br />

            Make sure you have Office fully updated (12.3.1 is the current level), but it's quite likely a printer issue. Check the mfr's site for an updated driver. Repair Disk Permissions &amp; restart your Mac.<br />

<h3> rjohnson0327  say:</h3>
<h2>            Include hidden worksheet data in a chart</h2>
                    
<p>I set up a group (outline) of columns within my spreadheet,&nbsp;where the source data is located for a chart I also have in the sheet, but&nbsp;I don't want to display this source data when I print the sheet, so I collapse the group.&nbsp; Problem is, the default is for
 the chart&nbsp;to then&nbsp;not display source data that is now hidden.&nbsp; I'm trying to change the setting so the chart will display hidden data.&nbsp; Please read the following Office 2007 Excel Help instructions relating to my questions, which are below the instructions:</p>
<p>"You can quickly include hidden worksheet data in a chart by changing the following option.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the chart in which you want to plot hidden worksheet data. </li><li>On the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Options</strong>. </li><li>On the <strong>Chart</strong> tab, under <strong>Active chart</strong>, clear the<strong>Plot visible cells only</strong> check box."
</li></ol>
<p>There is no Tools/Options menu!&nbsp; There is a Chart Tools menu, but nothing called Options underneath that.&nbsp; Why does Microsoft have instructions that are so completely wrong?&nbsp; In 2007 Excel, how do I get to the place where I can change the settings to allow
 a chart to display even when the data is hidden.&nbsp; I have already spent hours on this trying to figure it out!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; Help!!!!!</p>

Add the Close button to the Quick Access toolbar.&nbsp; That will close just the active document and leave the application running.

<h2>            Build 14942&#58;  sfc &#47;scannow &#38; DISM Uncorrectable Errors</h2>
                    <p>I've got a couple of pretty obvious problems with Build 14942 that most others don't seem to have:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_desktop/build-14942-start-button-and-notification-icon/734080d8-27f7-40f9-83ce-cea51b684986">Build 14942: Start Button and Notification Icon

 Reboot Twice (Thrice?)</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and the Feedback item:</p>
<p>
</p><p>feedback-hub:?contextid=88&amp;feedbackid=8fcaeb88-0ecb-45f9-b305-73e0bfa0fb36&amp;form=1&amp;src=2</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, seeing that they fixed sfc /scannow with this build, I ran it. &nbsp;It fully completed but found errors that it couldn't correct (this is immediately after I updated to it). &nbsp;So, I tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth,&nbsp;<br />
dism /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth, and<br />
dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth </p>
<p>
</p><p>The first two completed and told me there were errors that were correctable, but that last one failed saying that it couldn't correct the problem (this is from memory).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have an ISO for Build 14942, so can't run dism with the /source flag:</p>
<p>
</p><p>dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /source:WIM:X:\Sources\Install.wim:1 /LimitAccess</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is that if I wait for the next build, will the errors go away since the OS has been replaced? &nbsp;Or, will they carry over?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I know others had posted before about sfc /scannow being broken in the previous builds. &nbsp;Did anyone who missed it run it with this build? &nbsp;Did yours find any errors?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(edited to include links)</p>

            It was the same on my Desktop I also ran those just after the install because MS said that they were fixed. But I guess even though they completed they were unable to do the repairs needed. Maybe I will try them again in a few days to see if anything chances.

<p>Thanks. &nbsp;Unfortunately, one of my oh so clever processes upon getting a new build is to run Disk Cleanup -&gt; Cleanup System Files. &nbsp;So, it looks like I no longer have the install.esd. &nbsp;I could use my System Image Backup to restore the previous version, let
 it re-update, see if the problem persists, and create the ISO from there. &nbsp;But, just waiting for the next build and seeing if the problem gets fixed seems preferable (so far).&nbsp;</p>

<p>From what I see, it's better to stay away from sfc, unless you want to waste a lot of time wading through the logfile which is of little or no help for us non MS devs.</p>

            <p>I ran sfc /scannow just to see if it would work. &nbsp;It completed, but found corrupted files that it could not fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the 14942 ESD file and exported the Install.wim from it to a file with the compression level that works as a Repair source with DISM (compress:max). &nbsp;I had to run DISM on build 14393 (only to export the 14942 install.wim from the 14942 install.esd)
 because the DISM from 14942 is not working with Windows image tasks, such as /Apply-Image or /Export-Image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then ran DISM /online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:WIM:Install.wim:1 and it said that the restore operation completed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran sfc /scannow again and this time it found corrupt files and successfully repaired them. &nbsp;I then ran sfc /scannow the third time and it found no corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, besides 14942 DISM giving errors when Applying or Exporting Windows images, it worked to fix the Component store corruption and enabled sfc /scannow to also fix the corrupted files it found.</p>

<p>You used a 14393 image on 14942 for DISM and it worked? &nbsp;That's good to know. &nbsp;I was under the impression the entire build strings had to match.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Office 365 Teams&#47; Planner Connections</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have started to use Office 365 Teams to manage a project at my office.&nbsp; We have added in the Planner tab to our team pages, and have had great success monitoring our 'to do' through this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should those 'to do' items then appear on the Office 365 Planner tool, independent of the Team page?&nbsp; We were really hoping to be able to leverage the reports (monitoring unassigned, assigned, status of completion) through the Planner tool, but nothing is
 coming over as we had expected.&nbsp; We have tried different browsers, clearing cookies and cache, without success.&nbsp; We have found that the apps for iPhone do work a little differently, but still do not provide the translation of items as we expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if the functionality doesn't exist, and that is why we don't see things on both Office 365 tools?</p>
<p>Does the information not translate between the two?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight would be greatly appreciated, as we are hoping that we don't have to re-do all of this data management in another software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!<br />
Julia</p>

<p>Hi Julia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, yes, it is feasible to achieve it. However, the prerequisite is that you must create a new team from an existing Office 365 Group.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb4813cf-3547-4926-acfb-f34a938f5710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb4813cf-3547-4926-acfb-f34a938f5710" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>After create a new team, you can add planner tab via using an existing plan.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/006e19b6-378d-4338-886d-d24a10a42b1b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/006e19b6-378d-4338-886d-d24a10a42b1b" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>In this way, the <strong>Teams tab</strong> and <strong>Planner Tool</strong> will sync automatically.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it seems that this is the only way to achieve it. I hope it will help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still have any question, please let me know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards ,</p>

            Check your voice recognition settings. Those settings are not Cortana, just voice control of your computer. You don't need Cortana to use voice control of the computer. Cortana is more of a search option and I'm having trouble with getting her to respond
 on a desktop with headphones and mic. Voice Control works OK.

            It is working on my Surface Pro 1 and HP Pavilion dv6-2162nr. Both devices are using their integrated microphone. She does have a picky way of listening though and sometimes will cut off the first half of my commands, probably when she's initializing the
 mic.

            <p>Update on this issue:</p>
<p>Cortana still replies only infrequently to me as I speak to it directly. My headset, though working at configuration settings and at every other point of usage, doesn't speak to Cortana at all. I am using a USB headset into a Dell D630, with 4gb RAM and
 a 2.2ghz processor.&nbsp;I've had Community&nbsp;response that an integrated microphone is providing limited success, as is my laptop providing very limited response when I speak to Cortana directly. Has anyone else had these problems with a headset and solved them,
 or if those of you using a dated laptop have had success I'd like to hear from you.</p>

<h2>            Sorting data in Excel</h2>
                    <p>I have a worksheet containing just textual content information -- no formulas. &nbsp;I am trying to sort the entire worksheet of which there are multiple cols/rows by LAST NAME &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on just the header LAST NAME, and click SORT, it automatically highlights every column
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">to the right of (and including) </span>LAST NAME, but does not include the columns of pertinent data to the left. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click to select the entire worksheet, the SORT Function is grayed out. The functions is not available. &nbsp;I cannot use it to sort by anything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on the very first column in the worksheet, and click SORT, it automatically highlights all the Columns up to,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">but not including</span> LAST NAME. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so frustrated. &nbsp;It seems like half of the worksheet is somehow "disconnected" from the other half. &nbsp;I have tried copying the whole thing to a new sheet, and the same thing happens. &nbsp;Obviously, I am copying the problem as well. &nbsp;This problem does not
 exist in any other worksheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a main database of names and pertinent information. &nbsp;Starting over is not an option. &nbsp;Over time, as the need arises, I have added columns to the left of the LAST NAME . &nbsp;Did that trigger a malfunction?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your quick response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking at the Contact folder. &nbsp;Is that a read only file? &nbsp;The reason I'm looking at it is because it is filled with errors and is missing a lot of information. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there is a folder in the email called Sync Issues (this computer only). &nbsp;All of the sync logs show "Synchronizing server changes in folder inbox" (or draft or chat) but when it comes to "Synchronizing local changes in contacts" there is a very long
 list of error messages that I believe are due to the missing contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must have made a bit of a mess when I set up my email and I don't know how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I did run the scan you recommended. &nbsp;It did find a few problems, but they were repaired and no new files were created.</p>
<p>

    <title>Missing Categories on ribbon for Contacts and Calendar. My email is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenfishman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Categories on ribbon for  Contacts and Calendar. My email is IMAP.</h2>
                    When i had a Mac I used Office for Business 2011. I used Categories for Contacts and Calendar appointments. The colours made my calendar more readable. Now i have a new PC. I bought Office 2019 for Business. In Outlook I no longer have any Categories.
 I've been told it has to do with my email which is IMAP. Can't understand why this makes a difference. I was also told I'd have to use Microsoft Exchange if my service provider would do it. Can anyone help? This makes no sense to me.

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Hi Stephen
<br />
<br />You pretty much summed it up. Lack of category support has to do with the IMAP protocol and not Outlook (the email client).
<br />
<br />Aside from it not being recommended to store contact/calendar data in an IMAP .ost file where the folders have the added words of "This Compute Only" in the folder name, the alternate solution would be to 
<br />
<br />#1 - create a new PST file 
<br />(go to Home Ribbon --&gt; &lt;New Items&gt; --&gt; &lt;More Items&gt; --&gt; Outlook Data File
<br />
<br />#2 - make the newly added PST file the default data file for the profile which is where the default contact/calendar folders will be stored
<br />(Go to FIle --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab --&gt; highlight the newly added PST file --&gt; set it as the default
<br />
<br />#3 - Copy the contact/calendar data from the IMAP folders to the corresponding folders in the newly added PST file. Categories will be enabled for contacts in the PST file
<br />
<br />Now for some background info
<br />
<br />- an IMAP .ost (offline storage) file is a mirror of the email folders on the server. Contact/calendar folders do not sync with the server (as defined by the IMAP protocol)
<br />- if you ever remove the IMAP account from the Outlook profile, the OST file will also be deleted from the system and data in any "This Computer Only" folders will be lost
<br />- also, if Outlook cannot find/open the .ost file, it will automatically create a new one, email folders will be sync'd and the "This Computer Only" folders will be empty

    <title>Microsoft Office 2013 Professional Plus Activation Problem Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Office 2013 Professional Plus Activation Problem Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 Home on my laptop. Everything works fine, except for Microsoft Office 2013 Professional Plus. When I went to check if my product was activated or not, it stated that the product was not activated. However, when
 I click the Show Additional Licensing Information link, it says that the product is activated, right above where it says that the product is not activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a screenshot:&nbsp;http://imgur.com/1NgDchq</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and it never prompts me to input my product key. When I go into that same screen and try to input my product key, after I click the install button, nothing changes at all. I've tried running it in administrator mode
 and it is still the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is my product activated or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Michael</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what you mean by linking your Skype Number to your old account, are you referring to "transferring" the Skype Number to a different account where you have purchased it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are, please be advised that it's not possible. This is because Skype Numbers are associated with the Skype account used to make the original purchase.

<h3> rangefinder10  say:</h3>
<h2>            E72 - Fabulous</h2>
                    
<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the owner of an E72 for the past couple of weeks, I want to record how delighted I am with the quality of the product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read a lot of the comments on this site before deciding that, despite the negativity from a small number of users, Nokia had a winner on their hands, despite a few possible minor initial technical glitches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I can say is from my initial experience, what a fabulous machine in terms of build quality and performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No problems - everything works as it is supposed too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call quality is excellent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The e-mail service is lightning fast. Messages reach my phone before they land on my MAC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you doubting Thomas's not have faith in Nokia resolving an apparent few minor technical glitches in a superb new product ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to experience a poor performance try a Blackberry (and enjoy premium e-mail costs in the process), or an I-Phone (and pay premium costs for the Apps included in the E72 like Office document/Scanner/PDF/ZIP etc)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recognise a quality product and have faith in Nokia to resolve any outstanding issues</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>regards to all</p>

<p>I have E71 running 400.21.013 firmware. I'm happy with the phone except for some glitches, particularly, WLAN, Apps, and multitasking.&nbsp; It's much slower than E72 due to its processor speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My friend has one and asked me to configure it for him to install some applications and run network services. E72 is obviously much faster than it predecessor E71. The interface is more fluid and smooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm now contemplating to buy a phone with 1GHz&nbsp; processor running Android. I have been reading a lot about such platform for many reasons like performance and stability, interface fluidity, application availabilty, diversity of services, etc..</p>

<p>A handful of happy E72 owners. Now if Nokia would fix the bugs that makes the rest of us unhappy...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me the E72 has the potential to be the best Nokia phone I've ever owned - if they can just put the cap back on the bottle of Kosken and fix the problems that plague the phone now.</p>
