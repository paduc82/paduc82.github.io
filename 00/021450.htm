<h2>            How do I clean up my hotmail inbox&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My hotmail account has become very full with over 3000 emails in my inbox due to the fact that I now read most of my emails from my phone and not the PC. This has meant that the inbox has become so slow and always comes up with errors on the page whenever
 I try to accesss any of the emails via this way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) can someone help me to delete all of these emails so that I can start over again with a clean inbox</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) how can I get emails deleted from my pc inbox when I press delete on my mobile phone email?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>More information is required to give an answer to your post.</p>
<p>It sounds like the phone is using pop3 access to your account.</p>
<p>If pop3 is being used, then the emails have to be deleted from the phone.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>b) how can I get emails deleted from my pc inbox when I press delete on my mobile phone email?</em></p>
<p>If pop3 is being used on the phone, then deleting emails on the phone will only delete emails from the phone.</p>
<p>EAS or IMAP access would have to be used to delete emails from the server when the emails are deleted on the phone.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How are you accessing the emails on the PC?<br />

                    I was able to download Windows 10 Technical Review using Windows update from Win 7 Professional 32-bit w/ service pack 1 but, at some point during the install, somewhere towards the end of the setup and activation when the screen says "setting up a few
 more things-100%" I get an error box with no error code. Just a message that reads "Windows could not complete the installation. To install Windows on this computer, restart the installation". I have run the update twice and it shows it was successful but,
 both times I get this message at the end of the install. Any suggestions? Steve

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Things to remember:</strong></p>
<p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your&nbsp;commercial installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The benefits of testing Windows 10 on a physical&nbsp;partition&nbsp;or hard disk&nbsp;versus a Virtual Machine include full access to the hardware, which includes memory, graphics and input/output performance of the local disk in addition to the ability to fully experience
 all features of the operating system that are not accessible in a virtual environment. The biggest benefit is, you don't lose your production installation of Windows and you can reboot into it at anytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things to consider before:</strong></p>
<p>Backup your current installation of Windows. Because you will be making signifcant changes to your computer, you should always backup before doing so. It is
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">strongly</span></strong> recommended! See links to resources about backing up by clicking the link for the respective version of Windows you are running:

<h2>            help&#33;&#33; accidentally deleted my digital certificate</h2>
                    <p>So I accidentally deleted something really important I think it was my digital certificate. If you go to internet options and under the content tab click certificates a page will pop up. Under the personal tab after it pops up there was a certificate there,
 I don't know what I was thinking but I deleted it. </p>
<p>Now my internet isn't running properly half of the time pictures are blurred out they look like static similar to how a blank TV channel looks. Then sometimes I get an error ,also sometimes the page I try to load just looks like a bunch of random html coding.</p>
<p>I know I screwed up by deleting it but I really need help. I tried a system restore but it didn't change it. If anyone knows how to fix this or if anyone can help in anyway I would very very much appreciate it.</p>
<p>I am on windows 7 and have also tried using a different browser.</p>

<h2>            How do I get to crop to a shape in the opposite direction ...</h2>
                    <p>I'm sure this is me. But crop to shape is like one of those things few people in the world know about ... except likely the folks here. I like to crop to shape and put a glow and soft touch on objects to really up my game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But see below. So I want that parallelogram going to opposite way ... but I can use the nodes to adjust it, it'll just turn into a square. Some shapes have opposites in the Flowchart at the bottom, but not this or (or a great deal others). But you can see
 all kinds of shapes like this. Look at the 3rd one in from the left with the slant on the right-hand side of the square. I want to do that on the left hand side. How do I do this? IF it was a shape I could draw it and flip it ... but this is a crop.</p>

<p>It may take some trial &amp; error, but one approach that may work is:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Flip the image, itself, Horizontal</li><li>Apply the Crop to Shape</li><li>Flip the cropped shape Horizontal again</li></ol>
<p>Another method of doing the same thing [but a bit less precise*] is to apply the Crop to Shape, then drag one of the middle side handles through the image &amp; out the other side. [*If you note the dimensions before inverting you can then reset them afterward.]</p>

<p>We understand your concern about receiving unwanted emails on your account and we will assist you. We suggest to contact Facebook support for receiving unwanted emails on your account.</p>

<p>For the Spanish email for password reset you may need to use Bing translator in order to translate the said email. After translating the email you may need to go to "Click here" if you didn't request for a new password. Here is the link&nbsp;to Bing translator:</p>

<p>You've mentioned before that one of your alias was used as an email account signing up for Facebook by the hacker. I suggest that you contact Facebook Customer Support regarding this so that you can verify that you are the owner of the email account used
 by another user to stop receiving notifications that is meant for someone else.</p>

</p><p>I have many users who have oneDrive on thir PC. They sync different project folders from our sharepoint solution. But when a user gets a new pc, all there sync settings are gone and they have to find all the projects in sharepoint again and pres sync, so
 the folders appear in the&nbsp; File Explorer again. This is a anoyting task for my users. Is there anyway to backup the settings for a user, what folders from Sharepoint the user have choosen to sync?</p>
<p>

    <title>Retrieve SharePoint Online Root Site Collections list using CSOM lib - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Retrieve SharePoint Online Root Site Collections list using CSOM lib or REST API without admin creds</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to solve simple task : To retrieve root site collections list automatically.</p>
<p>I know the easy way to do it using admin credentials and C# CSOM library, but it would be much better to use something like admin-consent (Graph API) flow to authomatically retrieve it.</p>
<p>I already have admin-consent functionality and I'm able to get SP server URL (like OneDrive item's property).</p>
<p>I'm sure there must be a way to do it but not sure it is implemented by MS dev teams yet :))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me guys!</p>
<p>Denis</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Seems like I found a solution, I'd name it the "technical trick". Not sure it is universal solution.</p>
<p>But I believe there will be more adequate one in future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Guys please add this stuff into the Graph API :)) in /organization info for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So the trick:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You know the tenant Id and your application is already registered in this tenant (using admin consent flow)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Using Graph API you can retrieve SharePoint server URL and admin site URL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; 2.1 Use this endpoint to get information about particular drive root dir https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/drives/&lt;driveId&gt;/root</p>
<p>&nbsp; (To get drives list use https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/drives)</p>
<p>&nbsp; (To test API you can use this helpful link https://graph.microsoft.io/en-us/graph-explorer#)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In "webUrl" property you can find "server related URL", so I suppose it is main SharePoint server for the tenant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For example it is name.sharepoint.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; 2.2 Now assume that admin site URL always (by default) is name-admin.sharepoint.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Using CSOM query site collections list using Tenant.GetSiteProperties()</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; 3.1 Get App Only token like this using your application certificate and (serverUrl = admin site URL)</p>
<p>
</p><p>private static string GetAppOnlyToken(string serverUrl)<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; string AuthURL = @"https://login.windows.net/&lt;TENANT ID&gt;";<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //set the authentication context<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //you can do multi-tenant app-only, but you cannot use /common for authority…must get tenant ID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AuthenticationContext authenticationContext = new AuthenticationContext(AuthURL, false);<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //read the certificate private key from the executing location<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //NOTE: This is a hack… Azure Key Vault is best approach<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var certfile = System.IO.File.OpenRead(PrivateKeyPath);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var certificateBytes = new byte[certfile.Length];<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certfile.Read(certificateBytes, 0, (int)certfile.Length);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var cert = new X509Certificate2(<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificateBytes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PrivateKeyPassword,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable |<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X509KeyStorageFlags.MachineKeySet |<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X509KeyStorageFlags.PersistKeySet); //switchest are important to work in webjob<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ClientAssertionCertificate cac = new ClientAssertionCertificate(AppId, cert);<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //get the access token to SharePoint using the ClientAssertionCertificate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Console.WriteLine("Getting app - only access token to SharePoint Online");<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var authenticationResult = authenticationContext.AcquireTokenAsync(serverUrl, cac).Result;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return authenticationResult.AccessToken;<br />
}</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; 3.2 Get client context</p>
<p>
</p><p>private static ClientContext GetClientContextWithAccessToken(string serverUrl, string accessToken)<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ClientContext clientContext = new ClientContext(serverUrl);<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clientContext.AuthenticationMode = ClientAuthenticationMode.Anonymous;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clientContext.FormDigestHandlingEnabled = false;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clientContext.ExecutingWebRequest +=<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delegate (object oSender, WebRequestEventArgs webRequestEventArgs)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; webRequestEventArgs.WebRequestExecutor.RequestHeaders["Authorization"] =<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bearer " + accessToken;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return clientContext;<br />
}</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; 3.3 And NOW!.. Get site collections list</p>
<p>
</p><p>private static void QueryRootSites()<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var token = GetAppOnlyToken(SpServerAdminUrl);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; using (var clientContext = GetClientContextWithAccessToken(SpServerAdminUrl, token))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var tenant = new Tenant(clientContext);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPOSitePropertiesEnumerable spp = tenant.GetSiteProperties(0, true);<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clientContext.Load(spp);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clientContext.ExecuteQuery();<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foreach (SiteProperties sp in spp)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Console.WriteLine(sp.Url);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
}</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So crazy stuff)) Now I'm wondering is there similar way using SharePoint Online REST API or Graph API?</p>
<p>What endpoint is hidden by GetSiteProperties function?</p>
<p>What to do if I want to use Python+adal+graphApi ?</p>
<p />

    <title>Publisher 2013 - Print and PDF Quality issue for embedded Excel. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skarlock  say:</h3>
<h2>            Publisher 2013 - Print and PDF Quality issue for embedded Excel.</h2>
                    When I print or export to a PDF, the embedded Excel documents in my Publisher 2013 document do not have crisp, clear text. However exactly the same document under Office 2010 they look and print fine. I have an example of a PDF created from the same Publisher
 document, one in 2010 (on the left), one in 2013 (on the right) which I have uploaded that clearly demonstrate the issue. Is this a known bug, or a font issue with Office 2013? I work at a University where we have an enterprise licence for Office 2013 so are
 only just considering to roll it out to staff currently, but if this is an issue we will have to wait for a fix.

            I&nbsp;have some Publisher file that have links to Excel objects.<br />
In Publisher 2013, these links to excel objects are seen in low quality and printing PDF /XPS is very bad.<br />
In Publisher 2010, these links to excel objects are seen in high quality and printing PDF /XPS is of high quality.
<p><span>I tried</span> <span>with</span> <span>two different computers.</span></p>
<p>How to fix?</p>

            <p>Perhaps the default pdf settings are different? When you get to the 'Publish as a pdf...' or the Save as screen click the 'Optimize' button and increase the quality of the pdf. Perhaps compare to the settings in Publisher 2010?</p>

            Exactly as Saturn says, there is an issue with Excel embedded documents (so they update when you open the Publisher document if the Excel has been changed). It can be seen on screen, when sending to a PDF or in print form. I can't find any way to improve
 it which is why I suspect it's a serious bug with Publisher 2013. Also it doesn't occur (for the same document) in Publisher 2010 or Publisher 2007 which I have now also checked.

<p><br />
I don't have a good answer for you. Perhaps if you save the Excel object as a higher resolution image and insert it into Publisher rather than linking you will at least get the quality you seek. Yes, I&nbsp;realize that updating will be more tedious.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any possibility that you can affect the&nbsp;object quality directly&nbsp;from Excel? In other words is Excel 2013 output lower quality than Excel 2010 and older? Is there a setting that changes that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if this will be fixed or changed before the final version of Publisher is released to the public. From what I understand there is still a built-in method of submitting 'bugs' from each program that you might try. Look under Help??? With Office
 2013 at the RTM stage I suspect you won't see significant changes to Publisher in the near future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry I am not of more help but for a variety of reasons I have opted to not install Pub 2013 yet and thus my knowledge about this version is minimal.</p>

            The main book&nbsp;I use Publisher for has over 100 pages of active Excel spreadsheets. These are in use by a number of people who regularly update them.&nbsp;The book is published monthly to keep everyone up to date with each&nbsp;others work.&nbsp;As&nbsp;such it simply isn't
 practical to use images of each sheet for me. I really would like to migrate to Office 2013 given how&nbsp;impressive the Excel changes are, but as it stands Publisher 2013&nbsp;is next to useless in its current form for me.&nbsp;I also really want to avoid having more than
 one Office version installed given the problems this has caused in the past. I'll have a look for the suggested way to report bugs when I'm back in work on Monday. It would be useful to find a mechanism to report these bugs directly to the dev team.

            <p>I understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to install Pub 2013 this afternoon and will continue to look for a solution. In the meantime please leave the images posted.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you import Excel 2013 spreadsheets into Pub 2010 and workaround the problem that way? I know that you said that you don't want to run multiple versions of Office but perhaps you won't have the same problems if you just run multiple versions of Publisher.
 I know you cannot run multiple versions of Outlook and running multiple versions of Word and Excel can also create problems.&nbsp;I also know that if you want to do a email merge or send a Publisher html formatted email via Outlook that the versions have to be
 the same. However, I have Pub 2000 - 2010 installed on a couple&nbsp;XP machines, and Pub 2000, 2003 and 2013 installed on a Win 7 machine without any problems. I just install the oldest first and do custom installs of the newer versions and opt out of overwriting
 the newer versions. Anyway, it is something to consider if the final version of Publisher 2013&nbsp;does not work the way you want it to.</p>

            <p>Thank you for this detailed step-by-step solution, also for the instructions to stay safe. I went ahead and deleted all Microsoft-related items in my keychain (I use 1Password to keep track of my sign-in information). When I opened Word it asked me to sign
 in, I did. Closed Word and remained signed in – in Excel as well, so the issue appears to be resolved for now.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

            <p>An issue that came up several&nbsp;months ago to possibly a year ago I think has been fixed; but, wasn't tied&nbsp;specifically a version of Office. &nbsp;For a period, Office installs would Mess with &nbsp;Keychain access and corrupt settings</p>
<p><span><strong>Password alteration in KeyChain Access,</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>by Microsoft software installers.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here lately, for some reason, the installers for Office 2016 updates, has been messing with Office 2016 Passwords stored in KeyChain Access. The following procedure might help. Also, it might not make a difference, or you may find
 items I suggest will already&nbsp;be changed, have been unaffected. Also, I have had one report doing this cause the application to crash, and the person removed the changed item and resigned in.:</span></p>
<p><span>Quit all open Applications (</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">including&nbsp;Microsoft Office applications</span><span>).<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Next open </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>KeyChain</strong></span><span> Access.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Click on: </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Passwords</strong></span><span>.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>In the </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>search box</strong></span><span> type in:
<strong>Office</strong>.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>The should be 3 to 4 items that appear to have a serial or code number.<br />
&nbsp;(In the Description area you should see reference to Version 15.0 or 15.2, or 15. with another number related to current 2016 series)</span></p>
<p><span>Now click on the icon with an "<strong>i</strong>" in the center.
<br />
</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd5d067c-4bef-4ba7-a0f0-7f04cb028d4e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd5d067c-4bef-4ba7-a0f0-7f04cb028d4e" /></a>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the&nbsp;checkbox next to </span>Show Password.<span><br />
&nbsp;(this is a Sample of window that will open)<br />
</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd42135b-36fc-4493-9553-11ad544f6028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd42135b-36fc-4493-9553-11ad544f6028" /></a></p>
<p><span>(I've Blacked out sensitive info so you could see window.)<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Check, If the password you used to activate, </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>does not show</strong></span><span> in each of the files, or is
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>mangled</strong></span><span>.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If so then enter the correct Password.&nbsp;<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Repeat, above steps, starting at step 5.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Once finished,&nbsp;make sure to save changes. Quit KeyChain Access, and try Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneNote. It's still possible you may have to enter the password; but, then you only have to do so once, and others should already
 be signed into&nbsp;Microsoft.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Receiving password reset emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gina_h  say:</h3>
<h2>            Receiving password reset emails</h2>
                    <p>So here is my issue, my account seemed to have been hacked a couple years ago so I deactivated it. The problem is this account is linked to an account that I have for a website that I can't seem to remember the password so I activated the account again and
 entered my email in the websites "Forgot Your Password" field. Now most websites would just send you a link on resetting your password, so if you don't click on the link then your old password is still the current password. This website, however, creates a
 reset password which therefore makes your old password invalid. I am not getting any emails sent so that I can reset my password. How do I get this email to appear???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I'm not sure if this is because I deactivated the account for a while, but when I activated it, all my e-mail folders were missing. While it's not a big issue, all my emails in those folders also disappeared. So let's say I had an old english essay
 that I sent to my teacher, and I want to remember what I wrote, the essay is no longer there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sorry if this isn't in the right category :(</p>

            <p>Not as helpful as I was hoping for. The first part, where you mentioned accounts that are inactive for 270 days, all emails and such get deleted, that explained why I was missing all my emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I did reactivate my account, and I have received some emails, but for some reason, every time I fill in my email in "forget password" section on the website I need to access, I'm not getting that one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only reason I reactive my Hotmail account was to get into this other website. Please help me solve this problem, or direct me to someone who can. Don't link other pages to the reply. I already read all those and they don't answer my problem</p>

            Hi Jatau, <br />
<br />
<br />
In case that you forgot the PIN (lock screen password) of your Windows Phone, the only way to access it again is by performing a
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">hard reset</a></strong>. This will reset your phone to factory settings. We hope
 that you were able to back up your files before this happened to avoid data loss.<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back if you have any other concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows Office stuck in Demo mode</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,<br />
I have just purchased a new laptop for university and the one I purchased was floor stock, I have downloaded and installed the office software twice now and my programs are still stuck in demo mode?<br />
I don't see any 'Microsoft demo' software to uninstall, signing in with my uni account changes nothing. I don't know what else to do.</p>
<p>Edit to add: So the software I have access through the uni is 360, and that is the software I can see in my uninstall program (see first picture), however the only software I can open is 2016 (see second picture). So what the heck??</p>

            Hi Mishael,<br />
<br />
From the screenshots you provided above, Microsoft Office 365 en-us may be the Office Demo pre-installed on your laptop, which is time limited. Since you would like to activate and use Office 365 with your school account, I suggest you check the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Uninstall Microsoft Office 365 en-us on your laptop.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Ensure you have the Office desktop license in Office 365 portal for your school account:
<a href="https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions </a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. If there is no Office desktop license in Office 365 portal, follow the guide on this page to try getting Office 365 for free:
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4. After that, activate Office 365 ProPlus with your school account.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yoga

    <title>Using IncludeText in merge when included text also contains merge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alysa58  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using IncludeText in merge when included text also contains merge fields</h2>
                    <p>I have a document (Doc1) in which I use mail merge, and depending on codes in the merge datasource, I might include chunks of text from another document - let's call it Doc2.&nbsp; The text from Doc2
<strong>also</strong> contains mergefields that, once in Doc1, should pull in data from the same datasource.&nbsp; When I perform the merge, the Doc2 text appears, but the merged data does not show up within it; it's just empty/blank.&nbsp; My include is this, and it
 works:</p>
<p>
</p><p>{ IF { MERGEFIELD EHC } = "TRUE" "{ INCLUDETEXT "R:\\Formatted\\Doc2.docx" ExpressHC}" ""}</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibly I'm going about this wrong.&nbsp; Should this work, or am I barking up the wrong tree?&nbsp; If there is some way to hide sections, maybe that's an option, except I have an SEQ in each section for a sequential count, and I'm afraid if I find a way to do a
 hide, the count on the hidden text would still increment and the final document would appear with the count messed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm no Word expert, but trying to just figure out as I go along.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update&#58;  Microsoft Office File Validation Add-in Question</h2>
                    <p><span>I have a question about a Windows Update.</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Update had an update to be installed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I updated KB2501584 (Microsoft Office File Validation Add-in).<span>&nbsp;
</span>After install, I clicked on Installed Updates and didn’t see this one in there.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I went back to View Update History and double-clicked on KB2501584.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Under “More Information” I clicked the link for Microsoft Support linking me to info about KB2501584.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This link took me to Microsoft Security Advisory: Microsoft Office File Validation for Office 2003, 2007 Office, and Office 2010: April 12, 2011.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Under More Information it said:<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>You must install the following architecture updates to Microsoft Word and Microsoft Publisher before
 you install Office File Validation: </span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft Word Architecture update.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I clicked into this and came upon this web page:</span></p>
<span>Update for Microsoft Office Word 2007 (KB2464605).<span>&nbsp;
<span>Update for Microsoft Office Word 2007 (KB2464605).<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Microsoft has released an update for Microsoft Office Word 2007. This update provides the latest fixes to Microsoft Office Word 2003-2007.
 Additionally, this update contains stability and performance improvements.</span>
<p><span>I didn’t have this update so I downloaded it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now I’m having second thoughts.<span>&nbsp; </span>Why wouldn’t Windows Update automatically have this update (Microsoft Office Word 2007 (KB2464605) if it’s needed for the Microsoft Office File Validation Add-in?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’ve never downloaded any updates myself and am wondering if I screwed anything up by downloading “Update for Microsoft Office Word 2007 (KB2464605)”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If I have, can you tell me how I can fix/undo what I did?</span></p>
<p><span>P.S.:<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Per chance, I went into Programs and Features, and the Microsoft Office File Validation Add-in was listed in there (?)</span></p>

            <p>I have a query relating to&nbsp;the Microsoft Office File Validation Add-In update as well. This update was part of the Windows Update so it wasn't installed manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our company uses an tool called Think-Cell. It is an Add-In for Office 2007 to create complex charts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This update&nbsp;caused a problem with the existing version of Think-Cell not to work and we get&nbsp;this warning&nbsp;message, "Office File Validation detected a problem while trying to open this file."</p>
<p>To solve the functional issue, we had to re-install Think-Cell. This seemed to have fixed the problem but the warning message was still displayed everytime we use this Add-In.&nbsp;To completely&nbsp;resolve it,&nbsp;&nbsp;Office 2007 had to be re-installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are currently using Office 2007 on Windows 7. Is there a better way to resolve this issue?&nbsp;I have contacted Think-Cell support already but they do not reply over the weekend. Your input is much appreicated.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Security Essential Scans</h2>
                    My scans using MSE usually finds nothing but recently it picked up on a cookie that might be a threat. The thing is I installed Spyhunter 4 and ran it as a free program. It found like 183 of these cookies that might be threats. What do you think is going
 on here? Does the Spyhunter 4 program work better? I have not registered with Spyhunter yet so nothing has been fixed per their scan.

<p><b><span>Frequently Asked Questions and General Concerns</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Can I have more than one anti-malware product installed?&nbsp;</span></b><span>No.&nbsp;Having more than one
 product installed will compete with other anti-malware product(s), and can cause severe performance problems and system instability issues, and may limit the effectiveness of the products installed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>MSE is concerned with protecting your computer against malware; cookies are not malware.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Never heard of Spyhunter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>Microsoft Security Essentials is designed to manage the PC’s real-time protection against malware including viruses, rootkits, spyware and trojans.
</span></p>
<p><span>No antimalware program will provide 100% protection. The authors of these rogue programs alter the characteristics/signatures on a regular (sometimes daily) basis to help the programs
 avoid detection.&nbsp; All AV vendors (whether free or paid versions) fight a constant battle to stay ahead of the bad guys and keep their databases updated and current...in fact we sometimes receive complaints on these forums regarding failure of other AV programs
 to&nbsp;adequately protect&nbsp;computers…see these threads:&nbsp; </span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_scanning/pack-win107-2121/7e7385e1-c5db-4d1a-9aa5-b0279af0849c"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_scanning/pack-win107-2121/7e7385e1-c5db-4d1a-9aa5-b0279af0849c</span></a><span>
 and </span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msescan/thread/2d19448c-7cc7-451d-88c6-c9db9b2f7a3e/#e5a340d7-0ee2-4335-a357-291d1989f26e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msescan/thread/2d19448c-7cc7-451d-88c6-c9db9b2f7a3e/#e5a340d7-0ee2-4335-a357-291d1989f26e</span></a><span>.
 &nbsp; MSE seems to be doing as good a job&nbsp;against malware&nbsp;as any of the AV programs.</span></p>
