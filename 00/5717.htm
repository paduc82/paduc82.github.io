<h2>            Outlook.com Contact Sync Issues</h2>
                    <p>I added my Outlook.com address to my office Outlook 2016 so I could sync my contacts and calendar. All works fine but I am now starting to lose some contact job titles and/or company names. I use a Blacberry Priv and a Microsoft Surface. I have a gmail account
 as well and no issues with Google. How do I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Hi Jerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There could be a couple of reasons why you're experiencing syncing issues in Outlook. We'd like to get a better understanding of your issue, so kindly answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did the issue begin?</li><li>Did you make any changes in your account recently?</li><li>Have you tried removing your account and then reconnecting it?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Any additional information on your part would be highly appreciated. Feel free to share them in your next reply.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Thank you for reaching out to me. Here are my answers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Not sure when it started but I have added a few new contacts and started noticing job titles, company names and now addresses are disappering. I will fix them and then next time maybe it will only be a job title and not the company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I have not made any changes to the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I have removed the account and added it back several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sync with an Android phone, the Blackberry Priv.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for that Jerry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To clarify, where are you not seeing the contact information properly? Is it in Outlook.com or Outlook 2016? This is for us to isolate and determine which one to troubleshoot first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is happening in Outlook.com, you should check this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-in-Outlook-for-Windows-ecf61305-f84f-4e13-bb73-95a214ac1230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support
 article</a></strong>. We did a bit of research and found that under <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Outlook-contacts-are-missing-the-Company-Name-in-Outlook-com-connected-accounts-a12f9e80-b454-42f4-9113-a10bc18fc731" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook
 contacts are missing the Company name in Outlook.com connected accounts</a></strong> section, there's a known issue and it's still currently being investigated by the dedicated team. It would be best to check back every now and then for updates regarding that.</p>

            <p>Thank you! The contact info (job title, Company name or address) are missing in outlook.com and 2016. I added my Outlook.com email to 2016 so I can sync contact and calendars. Caledars is great, no issue. It's just some of the contact information randomly
 disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also keep an extra set in Gmail so if information is missing at least I have all the details available, especially on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what is causing this but someting is just not right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>I don't know what happened but I removed my account from Outlook 2016 and added it back and now my contacts synced without an issue. Not sure what happened but it was a few weeks that I had the issue. One thing that I noticed is it shows the total contacts
 that I have and also shows a total that is unread. Does anyone know what that means?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case my contacts are back to normal. I hope this continues because Gmail never has an issue.</p>

            Well...the issue is back. I am going to move away from Outlook and start using Gmail and Google. This is embarrassing for Microsoft as they now are so focused on the cloud but cannot sync contacts properly.

<li>I note that each user can add contacts and then share them as business contacts so that they show in OCM&nbsp;for all three of us. Obviously this is not best practice from a company data integrity point of view. Ideally I want all company contacts saved
 in one central repository and then shared with the users.
<ol>
<li>How does one do this and where does one save the contacts?</li></ol>

<p>Hi PWW_888,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read all your conversations and made a test on my side: It's not feasible to have Outlook Customer Manager shared contacts shown on Outlook for Android personal contacts list. Once you create a contact in OCM, it actually creates a contact in your&nbsp;
 Outlook's personal contacts list. But shared contacts are different---- it's not created but synced from others' contacts, so it won't appear in your personal contacts list, which means it won't sync to your phone's contacts list either. On other hand, you
 can still view shared contacts' history in Outlook for Android if you highlight associated emails.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the situation, if you'd like this feature to be introduced into Outlook Customer Manager, you may send us a feedback via the following link, since this user has same requirement as you, you can vote on its comments.</p>

</p><p>Anyone has an idea how to fix this? Or is this just some children's disease of the program that cannot really be fixed at this stage of the development process?</p>

            No this isn't helpful. What would be helpful is having a program that I paid for function. I can't do my job effectively because Office 365 for mac is a completely defective product that is incapable of doing the functions for which it was intended. A
 response that would help me make this program actually functional would have been a helpful response.

            <p>I just experienced the same crash message yesterday in Word 2016. I was able to solve it by the following steps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I deactivated my installation. I'm not positive that this is necessary, but it seemed prudent:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using a web browser, sign in to <strong>live.com</strong> with your Microsoft account email.</li><li>In the upper right corner of the browser window, click on your <strong>name</strong>, then choose
<strong>Account Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Services &amp; Subscriptions</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Office 365 settings</strong>.</li><li>On the left side under <em>Install</em>, click on <strong>PC/Mac installs used</strong>.</li><li>For the installation on your computer, click on <strong>Deactivate Install</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Then I uninstalled Office 2016 using the steps on this page: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-for-Mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Uninstall Office 2016 for Mac</a>&nbsp;Then I restarted the computer, went back to Services &amp; Subscriptions&gt;Office 365 settings, clicked on the Install button and reinstalled. The CoreFoundation crash has not recurred since then.</p>

<h2>            New Build Issues&#33; &#40;build 9879&#41;</h2>
                    <p><strong>A few Issues so far: -</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>One Drive Folder location can not be moved to a different drive easy?</strong><br />
FIX: - <a href="http://winsupersite.com/windows-10/heres-fix-some-onedrive-problems-windows-technical-preview-build-9879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://winsupersite.com/windows-10/heres-fix-some-onedrive-problems-windows-technical-preview-build-9879</a></li><li><strong>Hyper-V can not be installed</strong><br />
Requires a complete system restore of the computer before the computer can boot again this is every single time on this build, previous builds worked ok</li><li><strong>Team Viewer dose not work and get an error about fast user switching: -</strong><br />
The screen cannot be captured at the moment. This is probably due to fast user switching or a disconnected/minimized remote desktop session.</li><li><strong>Have to do a clean install on ever interim build that is sent out<br />
</strong>All of the builds that have been released require me to reinstall the OS before I can upgrade and some times require a force restart to get PC back up and running</li><li><strong>Cisco VPN dose not install from Web, dose not work when installed<br />
</strong>have to install Cisco VPN manually (Copy install file from other PC) and once installed It dose not connect to company network (some of this is bad coding by Cisco) and Windows 8.1 workarounds don't work?</li></ol>
<p>I try and find more but because I cant remote in time is limited to when on physically on the PC :(<br />
<br />
P.S it would be nice to have some feedback like we used to from connect.microsoft.com :(</p>

<p>
</p><p>Not only that, but when you go to the TechNet page Winston suggests you find a hodge podge of threads that leave you wondering how to add your problems in a way that you can easily add to the others experiencing similar issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Matthew! </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Your different</span> issues with new build can have a relation with various origins<span> like your Motherborad, Memory or Bios set up</span></span>!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>we are in</span> a <span>transition</span> <span>period</span><span>,</span>
<span>some devices</span> <span>and operating systems</span> <span>no longer</span>
<span>support the</span> <span><strong>BIOS</strong></span> <span><strong>based on</strong></span>
<span><strong>UEFI and can</strong></span> <span><strong>only</strong></span> <span>
<strong>be initialised</strong></span> <span><strong>from the</strong></span> <span>
<strong>BIOS</strong></span> <span><strong>boot mode</strong></span> <span><strong>Legacy</strong></span></span>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot into UEFI mode or legacy BIOS-compatibility mode when installing Windows from your USB, DVD, or network location.</p>
<p>If you install Windows using the wrong mode, you won’t be able to use the features of that firmware mode without reformatting the drive.</p>
<p>Boot the PC. As the firmware starts to run, press the key that opens the boot device menu.</p>
<p>On the boot device menu, select the command that identifies both the firmware mode and the device. For example, select
<strong>UEFI USB Drive</strong> or <strong>Network - BIOS. </strong></p>
<p>You might see separate commands for the same device. For example, you might see
<strong>UEFI USB Drive</strong> and <strong>BIOS USB Drive</strong>. Each command uses the same device and media, but boots the PC in a different firmware mode.
</p>
<p>If a boot device option does not appear for your device:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the options in the firmware menus to enable or disable BIOS-compatibility mode.</li><li>To use BIOS-compatibility mode, check for options in the firmware menus to disable UEFI SecureBoot features.</li><li>For older PCs (Windows®&nbsp;7-era or earlier), look for options to <strong>Boot from file</strong>, and browse to the \EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI file on that device.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I hope my</span> <span>explanations are clear</span> <span>and</span>
<span>they can</span> <span>help you! </span></span></p>
<p>

 my laptop this morning to find that my top and bottom margins won't change. The left and right margins change fine but the top and bottom constantly stay right on the edge page and won't budge. I have included a screenshot of my problem. If you look at the
 margins on the left there's no grey area to indicate there is any margin. Normally you can drag the slider cursor to make the margins but this is not possible. Any help?

            As far as I can tell, clicking All - Professional means that the professional format is being applied to
<strong>all</strong> equations in the same document (and similarly for All - Linear). The other options apply only to the current equation (= the one containing the insertion point).

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for replying.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Did you re-install Office after upgrading Vista to Windows 8?</span></p>
<p><span>2. When do you receive the error message while installing Office or while opening the Office applications?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If Office is installed on the system then repair Office 2010 installation and check:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/repair-or-remove-office-2010-HA010357402.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/repair-or-remove-office-2010-HA010357402.aspx</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above step do not fix the issue then check if the Office applications are running in compatible mode:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Close Outlook.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Browse to the location mentioned below:</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>For win7 32 bit:</span></p>
<p><b><span>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14</span></b></p>
<p><span>For Win7 64 bit:</span></p>
<p><b><span>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14</span></b></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Right click on
<b>Outlook.exe</b>&lt; <b>Properties</b>&lt; <b>Compatibility</b></span>
</li><li>
<span>Uncheck the box
<b>Run this Program in Compatibility Mode</b>, Make sure you also click on the option
<b>change settings for all users</b> tab at the bottom of the same screen
</span></li><li>
<span>Click on
<b>Apply</b> and <b>Ok</b>.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Open <b>
Outlook</b> and check if it works.</span>
</li></ol>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Follow the above step for other Office applications too and check.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are receive the error message while installing Office 2010 then right click on the setup file, click on
<b>Properties</b>&lt; <b>Compatibility. </b>Uncheck the box <b>
Run this Program in Compatibility Mode, </b>click on <b>Apply</b> and <b>Ok</b> and then try to install Office 2010.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope the above suggestion helps to resolve your issue. If you need any further assistance reply and we will be glad
 to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

            <p>Well sorry&nbsp;I cannot add much, and I do not know if a .lan TLD is handled any different in Windows 10 as I do not use that. Do you have any domain? can the nas be nas.local.yourdomain.com? (just searched for something similar and got ideas like that)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than that perhaps post this on the TechNet forums more IT Pro type setup,

            <p>It only happens with the .lan TLD, I tried with a valid TLD and everything works fine.</p>
<p>I will try to ask in the pro forum, and rename the local domain to a valid one but it seems a bug to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife's PC running a clean windows 10 install has no problems at all accessing devices in the .lan TLD ..... I guess I should finally do a clean install :-) I am still running a windows 8.1 updated to &nbsp;windows 10 several months ago in the windows insider
 program ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aftera clean install all is working as expected, no idea what caused that weird behaviour.</p>

<h2>            green dot instead of drag</h2>
                    <p>Lately I am placing the cursor at the corner of a cell and trying to drag the cell down to copy the formula to other cells but when I do, a green dot with a rectangle (rotatable) appears &amp; preempts the cursor from&nbsp;dragging.</p>
<p>How can this be fixed?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may follow the steps below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>Go to <font>
Error Checking</span> and you may uncheck the option <span style="font-weight: bold">
Number stored as textbox or Enable background error-checking.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this suggestion is helpful.</p>

            <p>Well, thought that&nbsp;solved it&nbsp;but&nbsp;no. I unchecked both &amp; have the same issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed the green dot &amp; box again after selecting data, formatting it, then clicking in another cell outside the selected area. The green dot behavior persists even after the area is unselected, but only in some cells &amp; the cells (so far) seem to be random.</p>
<p>&nbsp;7/20/13 the pages that have the error&nbsp;have charts (maybe other pages too).&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi Kristof,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand you navigate to Teams &gt; OneNote &gt; Home &gt; Meeting Details in the Microsoft Teams client and encounter the issue. May I know if the issue is as following:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After clicking Sign In, you’ll receive a message “Add Meeting Details wants to display a new window”. Then you click on Allow. A browser page will pop up and let you sign into OneNote. After typing your user name and password, you’ll get
 a blank page as the screenshot shows below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23c027e1-9dd5-43c9-93c4-22f1a8c093b3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23c027e1-9dd5-43c9-93c4-22f1a8c093b3" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 also Store update with the new UI. Unfortunately some days ago, I performed a reinstall in an attempt to solve the OS updating problem and ended with the version typed above. It looks Store didn't update in the process of OS update.</p>

<h2>            Installation Problem- Error 0x8007045D-0x2000C</h2>
                    Hey Microsoft Community. For months I have been trying to install the Windows 10 Technical Preview on my laptop. The first time I performed the installation through Windows Update and after restarting the computer it booted and then changed to "Restoring
 to previous version of Windows". &nbsp;Recently, I downloaded the iso file of the Microsoft website and ran the setup file. It was going very well until it came to my files and PC settings in the last steps. Then it said windows could not install Windows 10 Technical
 Preview. Error Code:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">0x8007045D-0x2000C. I really would love to install Windows 10 before it releases. I know almost all in
 the Community are more intelligent than me so any help and ideas would really be appreciated. Basically the question is: How can I install Windows 10 Technical Preview without having the issues i'm having and the error code I am having? Thanks.&nbsp;</span>

            <p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure what the Microsoft Technician said is correct. However there is another way. I confirmed the solution above and prove that it is the solution at least for my problem. All you do is run the command prompt as administrator and then put in chkdsk
 /R C: &nbsp;And then when it asks you the question you put Y for yes and then you restart your computer and it should start cleaning your hard drive. What I understood is that the probable cause is that Windows was corrupted for different reasons and the files
 are too so this command prompt fixes and deletes unecessary files that allow the update to happen. It takes a long time. I've heard 18 hrs from many for the chkdsk. But it is the solution. Thanks.</p>

                    I have just received a text message from Nokia, asking me if I have activated voice guided navigation on my Nokia Maps. It suggested that to enhance my navigation experience, I should select Extra Services &gt; Add Navigation. I have an N82 which has not

<p>Presumably you are using Nokia Maps v2 and in the enclosed screenshot&nbsp;<a href="http://i48.tinypic.com/2drtjs0.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i48.tinypic.com/2drtjs0.jpg</a> click on "Drive &amp; Walk" for purchasing options after selecting "Extras"
 in Maps application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Maps v3 it would show under "Shop &amp; Licences" as in this screenshot:<a href="http://i46.tinypic.com/2lcblow.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i46.tinypic.com/2lcblow.jpg</a></p>

 I wanted to report this glitch to Microsoft, but wasn't sure how to do that.

<h2>            Deleting default pst file</h2>
                    I have experimented with Outlook 2010, but don't want to use it any more. In my profile, the Outlook PST file is just over 2 gigs, and I'd like to delete it to recover the disk space. Can I delete it? If not, how could I delete all those emails to shrink
 the size of the file?
                </div>

            Found out how to do it--I went into the Account settings/options (from the File button, Info/Account Settings. I clicked on the Email tab, then hit Remove for the email account connected to the PST file, then clicked on the Data Files tab, then selected
 the file associated with that account.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, doing this also cleaned out my&nbsp; inbox&nbsp; in my Gmail account--I now have a clean inbox (a plus), although I really would have liked to have kept those emails. At least Outlook was nice enough not to delete the stuff in other folders.<br />
