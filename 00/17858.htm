<p>Hello, Mary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please disregard the previous reply. It is a SPAM post.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> In order to request that the contents of the email account be released to you, or to request the closure of the account, please contact the Microsoft Custodian of Records by emailing *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to initiate the process. To
 process your request, we require that you provide some information about the account as well as copies of documentation to verify the status of the account holder and your kinship. Please refer to “What information and documentation will I need to provide
 for the next of kin process?”</p>
<p>Please also provide us with an email address where we can reach you in case we have any follow-up questions and so we can notify you of the status of your request.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. </strong>In order to prove that you are legal next of kin and that the account holder is deceased or incapacitated, we require the following documentation:</p>
<p>1) An official death certificate for the user, if the user is deceased. Unfortunately, we cannot accept anything other than an official, government issued death certificate. Examples of documents which we cannot accept are:</p>
<p>a. An obituary<br />
b. A coroner’s interim death certificate<br />
c. A coroner’s statement of inquest into a death<br />
d. A funeral director’s statement of services performed</p>
<p>2) A certified document signed by a medical professional in charge of the care of the user, if the user is incapacitated. A note signed by the doctor in charge and notarized will suffice, as will a signed court document showing that you have power of attorney
 or executorship of a trust for the account holder.</p>
<p>3) A Document showing that you are the user’s next of kin and/or executor or benefactor of their estate, or that you have power of attorney. We accept any of the following documents as proof of kinship or executor status:</p>
<ul>
<li>a. A marriage certificate showing that you are the surviving spouse of the account holder.<br />
b. Signed power of attorney paperwork.<br />
c. A copy of a will or trust document naming you as executor or beneficiary.<br />
d. A birth certificate for the user, if you are their parent; or guardianship paperwork for legal guardians.</li></ul>
<p>4) A photocopy of your government issued photo ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3.</strong> We require answers to all of the following questions about the account holder’s email account.</p>
<p>1) What is or are the email address or addresses?</p>
<p>2) What is the first and last name that the account holder used when creating the account?</p>
<p>3) What is the date of birth that the account holder gave when creating the account?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Once you’ve gathered your documentation, you may submit it to us in any of the following three ways:</p>
<p>1) You may scan and email the documents to us at <strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong>.</p>
<p>2) You may fax the documentation to us at (425) 708-7851 .</p>
<p>3) You may mail copies of the documentation to us at:</p>
<p>Next of Kin<br />
One Microsoft Way<br />
Redmond, WA 98052</p>
<p>Please do not send originals of any of the documents, as all documents will be shredded upon completion of the verification process.</p>
<p>4) What city, state, and zip code (for U.S. users) or country did the account holder enter as their place of residence when the account was created?</p>
<p>5) Approximately when was the account created? This doesn’t need to be anything specific. “During the late 1990s,” or “Around 2004” are perfectly acceptable answers</p>
<p>6) Approximately when was the account last accessed? It is important that you tell us if you have been checking the account past the account holder’s date of death, or if you suspect that the account has been accessed by an unauthorized individual after
 the account holder’s death.</p>
<p>7) Your shipping address, if you are requesting a copy of the contents of the account. Please note that we cannot ship to a P.O. Box. Since your shipment will be coming from the U.S., please include your shipping address in the following format:</p>
<p>a. Attention<br />
b. Street Address<br />
c. City<br />
d. State/Province<br />
e. Zip/Postal Code<br />
f. Country<br />
g. Contact Phone Number</p>
<p>8) What type of computer you use, if you are requesting a copy of the contents of the account. We support PC, Mac, and Linux users, but we need to know what type of computer you use for preservation purposes.</p>

    <title>Changing password using iphone or ipad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bythelake2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing password using iphone or ipad</h2>
                    Can I change/update my password for my email account using my iphone or ipad? &nbsp;So far I have not been able to see how to do so. &nbsp;I do not want to go onto a computer to change my hotmail account settings. &nbsp;I think my computer has been an issue, as after
 I sign in using my computer, my iphone/ipad gives me the message of "incorrect password". &nbsp;Then I have to go through the process of resetting my password. &nbsp;I just did that and put in a rather weak password that I want to change to a stronger one. &nbsp;Please help.

</p><p>Hi there:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My name is John.&nbsp; My Microsoft(tm) refurbished computer died at my private office this afternoon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 're-installation' reinstalled Windows 10, but all files, except my personal; files were erased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased MS Office 2016 and the Microsoft DVD player.&nbsp; If MS Office 2016 is the Home and Student edition, then I do have an activation code</p>
<p>here somewhere; however, I purchased the MS DVD player and now it wants me to buy the DVD player again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the code for the DVD player that I purchased?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help...</p>

<p>I am having the same Bluetooth problem with a Nokia 5228.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using a Bluetooth dongle and have tried with Windows 7 and Vista.</p>
<p>I have loaded the latest Toshiba Bluetooth software.</p>
<p>I can send and receive messages/items from the computer to the phone via the Toshiba software without any problem. I can also transfer data from a Sony phone and an PDA without trouble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have paired the 5228 with the computer and made the computer authorised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I use the OVI package it can see the Bluetooth, it can see the 5228 but when I tell OVI it to connect to the 5228 it says "Checking the Bluetooth capability of your device" and waits for ages before saying failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also checked under synchronization on the phone to make sure that Bluetooth is on, that the computer name is correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What am I, of the software, doing wrong??</p>

<p>I have the same trouble with my E71 and Lenovo TP w510 (Windows-7-64).</p>
<p>I've made clean install recently (disc crash) and I have now everything up2date - system, drivers, BT (Microsoft stack) and latest OVI suite. But I can't connect with BT (same messages and then error). However, I can browse my phone directly (windows BT
 connect) easilly.</p>
<p>Before disc crash I've had Office 2007 and OVi Suite 2.xx together with PC Suite (ver. 7) and everything worked ok. Now with clean install of all latest system, drivers and sw it doesnt work. This is what make me furious with Nokia and their SW - it is worthless.
 By my opinion the step from PC Suite to OVI Suite is is like step from ugly good horse to fancy dressed **bleep**. You have no control of syncing things not even a proper logs etc. This is simple stupid. And OVI messed thing many times. For example - lately
 it write me some events (serise) all over many days in my caledar. And gues what - it looks it is immpossible to clean whole calendar with one simple move on the phone.</p>
<p>I am seriously looking for a new phone and it looks like this is my last Nokia.</p>

            Hello Nokia,<br />
The problem of lack of Windows 7 bluetooth drivers for the N8 has existed since it was launched. You have had long enough to sort this out.<br />
<br />
Support for software has been really poor, especially with the update fiasco.<br />
<br />
Please get this fixed, as I cannot sync my N8 using bluetooth on W7, so have to cable connect every time.<br />

<h2>            DOCX Incompatible Between Word 2010 and Word 2007 - randomly drops spaces from between words.</h2>
                    Hi, I'm using Word 2010 and I _need_ to send somebody a docx who is using Word 2007. However, Word 2007 randomly drops spaces from between words. Given the document is a few thousand words long it's not an option to manually put them back in. Does anybody
 have a solution? This is the exact same problem as here: <a href="http://www.bnet.com/blog/businesstips/word-2010-spacing-problem-solution-actually-just-a-workaround/8049" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            If you READ the discussion you would have seen that Gray Knowlton from MS said the problem was fixed in Office 2007. I have not seen anyone else mention that it has been a problem in 2010.<br />
<br />
Sometimes problems like this are also caused by 3rd party programs. To eliminate that possibility, you are going to have to do some work using the following testing procedures:<br />
<br />
<div>
<b><span>Trouble Shoot Word problems that occur when you start or use Word 2010, 2007, 2003, or 2002
</span></b>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541</span></span></a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><b>NOTE:<span>&nbsp;
</span></b>part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth device driver or addin, ie “send to Bluetooth”, installed. Disabling BlueTooth is rapidly moving to the top of my Office trouble shooting
 process. Blue Tooth drivers have been identified as the cause of problems with many different “random” symptoms. If you have BlueTooth, disable it in control panel, device manager and possibly as an addin in Office apps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s not that I think there is anything inherently bad with Blue Tooth. The problem is with the people writing the drivers.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b><span>Uninstall Recent Software</span></b>
<p>At this point, you have also think about any software or plugins that you may have installed on your computer. Annoyingly, this problem with Word can be caused by a program that is completely unrelated to Word!</p>
<p>Did you recently install some new hardware? A printer, scanner, label machine, web cam, tablet, etc? Have you installed any software? If so, uninstall it and see if the problem goes away.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The following Skype links are an example of this issue</p>
<b><span>Clipboard functionality no longer allows ability to paste formatting in Office Apps – Skype error – Official notice</span></b>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2697462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2697462</a></span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/excel/thread/0cffef67-afca-45ad-b75d-3eeb4a859983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/excel/thread/0cffef67-afca-45ad-b75d-3eeb4a859983</a><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>Starting in March 2012, "Skype click to Call" has been causing problems File Open problems, and Copy/Paste problems in Office Apps.
</p>
<p>The quick test for this problem is to close all open browsers. If the problem goes away it is probably Skype.</p>
<p>March 30 – MS has released an update to Skype that fixes the problem. Go to the Skype site, download and install the newest version ofc the program.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b><span>Clipboard broken – “Smart RAM”</span></b>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>For anyone reading this, I figured out the problem after surfing the web for the past 3-4 weeks. Painful process. I have a paid version of Advanced SystemCare Pro, v5.2.0. 3-4 weeks ago, while scanning through it's vast offerings, I came
 across a feature I could activate called "Smart RAM". I turned it on and checked the 5 boxes it offers in the settings. The last of those 5 is "Clean Clipboard". I unchecked this box a few minutes ago and it fixed my issues. I now have no problems with copy/paste.
 Info only, it case it helps anyone.</p>

<b><span>Bluetooth Fix: “Microsoft Word has stopped working”</span></b>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b><span>Example of a problem caused by Bluetooth </span>
</b>
<p>Alright, well, I found the answer to this final issue: I only needed to disable the Bluetooth add-in on Options. I have no idea why that would have been the problem, but I found it as a suggested fix
<a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-microsoft-word-has-stopped-working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. Now every single thing opens quickly and without error. </p>
<p>Thanks for all your help everyone.</p>
<p>As a recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>My Office 2010 was a Click-to-Run version</li><li>Word suddenly giving me messages about "Downloading the Required Feature," freezing up, slowing down...</li><li>Ultimately had to uninstall Office</li><li>Reinstalled it from the Microsoft website with my product key, choosing the 64-bit version instead of the Click-to-Run version</li><li>Installed all new updates from Windows Updates</li><li>Restarted computer</li><li>Word working quickly with no messages, but became unresponsive when trying to open old files</li><li>Went to File-&gt;Options-&gt;Add-Ins-&gt;Go-&gt; and unchecked Bluetooth.</li><li>Everything seems to be back to normal, if not better than before.</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b><span>Black Blob during Copy / Paste</span></b>
<div>
<p>
My problem is if I copy text from a web site or from Excel, Access etc into Word all I get is a black spot.</p>
<p>
I have tried a repair install and checking all the settings against my laptop - where this function works properly.
</p>
<p>The problem is caused by a defective Bluetooth add-in for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, turn off the Com Addin.</p>
<p>
<b><span>Additional Notes:</span></b></p>
<ol>
<li><span>The defective Bluetooth add-in is usually installed by a Bluetooth driver. (In my case - Intel Centrino Wireless Bluetooth 3.0 + High Speed
 Adaptor (v1.1))</span></li><li><span>Updating your Bluetooth driver (or reverting to an older version) may also resolve the problem.</span></li><li><span>Unfortunately simply disabling the add-in through the Word options may result in a 3 second freeze when loading Word 2007. (If this is a
 problem, changing to a different bluetooth driver version may be the better option)</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b><span>Additional tip - Remove Older Printer Drivers</span></b>
<p>Oddly enough, this ended up being the cause of my problem. I had an older print driver installed on my Windows 7 machine and once I removed that driver, Word started working without any problems!</p>
<p>You can delete individual printer drivers by going into the registry. Note that simply going to Printers and Faxes and deleting a printer there does not delete the printer driver.</p>
<p>Follow <strong><span>Step 3</span></strong> in my previous post about a printer error to remove the printer drivers:</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b><span>Starting point when Word does something unexpected</span></b>
<p>As a general rule, when something seems to be going wrong, or at least not the way you want it to go, in Word, any version, go to Tools and then Options and study all the settings on all the tabs. You may even find some settings that
 you want to try that have nothing to do with the current problem.</p>
<p>When I was teaching Word and other Microsoft Office programs at a private business college, I had three rules:</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Always check Tools Options</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When in doubt, right-click on something</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If you're wondering how to set up a special kind of material in a document, consider whether Word tables are suitable. The placement officer of the school came to me several times and asked how I thought she should set something up. Each
 time the answer was, "I'd use a Word table." By the fifth time she had stopped asking--she got the point.</p>

<p>I am a Microsoft employee, I lead the Program Management team for Office Sustaining Engineering.</p>
<p>This is a known issue with Word 2007. The <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wordshare/thread/34682f6f-7be2-4835-9c18-907b0abd5615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
issue is also discussed in another thread.</a></p>
<p>The&nbsp;issue&nbsp;has already been addressed in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/951944" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
a release that first appeared on September 25, 2008</a>. The "non-security fixes" section of the article describes the behavior. The knowledge base article and solution for the problem are located under the link. For Office 2007 users who will receive your
 documents, ensure they are current on updates for Office. Specifically, ensure the patch referenced in the link above is installed, or ensure the user of 2007 has installed Office 2007 Service Pack 2.</p>
<p>The easiest way to obtain the fix is to install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=b444bf18-79ea-46c6-8a81-9db49b4ab6e5&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 2007 Service Pack 2</a>.</p>
<p>This is an issue related to opening files that we discovered and fixed before the shipment of Office 2010. It was important enough for us to push the fix through the security update channel. At Microsoft we were able to re-produce the problem on machines
 which did not have the patch installed for Office 2007, and we are unable to reproduce the problem on machines that have the patch installed.</p>
<p>Yesterday we re-tested this problem based on the information being reported in the forums and on various blogs. There are a few details worth noting:</p>
<p>- If you have already saved the document in an unpatched version of Word and the spaces are missing, unfortunately there is no way to recover them.<br />
- When you send the file to other users from Office 2010, unpatched users who edit the document may cause the spaces to disappear. It is important to ensure Office 2007 users are patched with this update, and ensuring that can be done by turning on Automatic
 Updates.</p>
<p>Related to the other forum post on this topic:<br />
- In our testing, turning spooling services on and off did not affect the problem.<br />
- Additionally, the presence (or not) of a specific printer driver or any printer driver did not solve or cause the problem.</p>
<p>As has been reported on various blogs, the Open XML standard is not&nbsp;the cause of&nbsp;the issue. This is an issue with Word 2007, and we believe a solution has been available since 2008.</p>
<p>We certainly regret any inconvenience this issue may have caused.</p>
<p>If you patch your 2007 installation to the current update level, and you are authoring documents on patched versions of Word 2007 (or 2010), and you still experience this problem, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Phone Gets Worse with every update to Insider Preview - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oldgeek59  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Phone Gets Worse with every update to Insider Preview</h2>
                    <p>I finally had enough and restored my phone back to 8.1.&nbsp; When I first installed the Windows 10 Insider Preview, I had some initial problems but was able to get those worked out and thought Windows 10 Phone was a contender. Then the updates started breaking
 things.&nbsp; Windows 10 Phone was stable back in October so why change and break things that were working.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was really frustrating having gone from a stable OS with nearly all the features working, to an OS that completely renders the phone useless.&nbsp; Each time I posted a problem (after searching and finding hundreds of other Insiders having the same problems),
 I would see&nbsp;some posts from Microsoft engineers.&nbsp; The answer was always the same - try a soft reset and then a hard reset.&nbsp; Am I the only one that is frustrated that the folks at Microsoft have not posted one solution to the endless bugs that are appearing
 in the latest releases?&nbsp; It appears that the software engineers are not even listening or trying to correct serious issues with the OS.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest release turned my phone into&nbsp;pocket warmer.&nbsp; I even posted the task screen showing Skype and Messaging was using 40%+ CPU and 60%+ Available memory.&nbsp; When idle, my phone was using 900mb+ of 1gb memory.&nbsp; As a developer, this tells me they have
 a serious loop and memory leak.&nbsp; I saw on the Insider Community that hundreds of folks were having the same problems with Messaging and Skype and the phone eating a battery in 2 to 3 hours when idle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not give me the option to have SMS and MMS without
 installing Skype? HINT: Try looking at the user reviews for Skype -- it used to be 4 star rated app.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since November 2015&nbsp;the majority of the reviews are 1 or 2 stars.&nbsp; The vast majority of folks who used Skype in the past 2 months do not like it or want it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem with the latest release was constant App crashes and reboots.&nbsp; The previous release was at least stable and the applications worked.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Microsoft's built in apps would crash or reboot the phone (Office, Outlook, and Cortana).&nbsp; Some other
 issues I have experienced with latest release include touch screen feels like resistive, very slow response when launching any application,&nbsp; voice recognition no longer understands me, incorrect application launches when tapping a tile,&nbsp;Wi Fi would not connect
 to secure APs, could not browse using LTE connection&nbsp;&nbsp;and I could&nbsp;not&nbsp;unlock my phone if I set the pin unless I rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a Device Recovery back to 8.1 and then reinstalled the latest build for the Insider Preview.&nbsp; I removed all third party apps before the reinstall and&nbsp;skipped the&nbsp;restore so I was running a virgin OS.&nbsp; My phone came back to life and worked great for
 about 4 days - only to revert back to a pocket warmer on day 5.&nbsp; The phone would reboot when making a phone call!&nbsp; I did not install any other software and the only software on the phone is what is installed with the Insider Preview.&nbsp; Again, this tells me
 there is a bug in the OS that causes a background application or service to enter a loop and memory leak.&nbsp; I am now back to 8.1 and will not even consider upgrading to Window 10 Phone when it is released (by that time we will probably be on Windows 12 or 13).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was impressed with the earlier releases of Windows 10 Phone and really thought that this would finally make Windows Phone a worthy contender.&nbsp; Now, I am almost certain Windows 10 will be another Windows Me and put the nail in the coffin for the Windows
 Phone.&nbsp; It's a great OS for the Desktop, Laptop and Tablets but you can't design a phone OS that uses 60% of CPU and 80% of available memory when the phone is idle and expect it to be anything other than a complete failure.&nbsp;

<h2>            Spartan</h2>
                    <p>Mighty nice of Microsoft to introduce Spartan with the in-ability to make Google search the default home page. i can make almost any other web page home but that one. was not appreciated that you took it upon yourself&nbsp; to create a new email addresse for
 me. i dont want it. you can go ahead and delete it!!!! Thanks for slowing Firefox down!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can take that Quicksilver card and put it right in the puckerhole!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And WOW....so intrusive.&nbsp;&nbsp; how do you know what my latest searches have been if i have never used Spartan or dont use IE?</p>

<p>The easiest fix is to select the whole document and apply a font which actually is "complete."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A long term solution is to also modify the default font for the document.</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />There is nothing to fix. The link you have no longer refers to a web page. Pages are created and deleted every day. Sometimes the pages that link to them are not updated. It looks like you were looking for a page about malware. Is that correct?
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards

<p>I am using a software tool to generate a website.&nbsp; The new website that is generated is placed in a directory on my (c:) hard drive.&nbsp; I want to be able to browse this new website and look for any errors or omissions before uploading to my ISP.&nbsp; When I use
 Internet Explorer 8 to open the main page of this website from my local hard drive, I get the following error:</p>
<p><em>To help protect your security, Internet Explorer has restricted this webpage from running scripts or ActiveX controls that could access your computer. Click here for options.</em></p>
<p>If I click on the Information Bar, I can "Allow blocked content..." and everything works fine.</p>
<p>However, I want to prevent this error from occurring.&nbsp; I tried adding "c:\gardner - watson\" as a trusted site in Internet Options but I get the error message:</p>
<p><em>You have entered an invalid wildcard sequence.&nbsp; Examples of valid patterns.....</em></p>
<p>How do you add a website on your local hard drive to your list of Trusted Sites to prevent this error from occurring when I attempt to open this local site?</p>

<h3> garthstokes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials Definitions Download Size</h2>
                    Every day I receive upto 2 definition downloads and have noticed that they are increasing in size now over 6Mb each one.<br />
Question (1) After downloading and installing doses the old definions get deleted or will my definition file get biger and biger, within one year the file will be over 4Gb of definitions.<br />
Question (2) If they do get deleted why cant microsoft just send the updated definitions only to save on download time as over the year I am sure the definition file&nbsp;will become very big.<br />

<h2>            Where are bookmarks &#40;favorites&#41; for IE8 located in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Background: My computer which was running Windows 7 died. The hard drive, however, was fine and I now have it plugged in to my new (Windows 7) computer as an external drive. By doing a backup and then restore on my former C drive, I've gotten access to all
 my files and I'm in the process of moving application data to the new computer.</p>
<p>Question: I'd like to get my list of bookmarks for IE8 onto my new computer. Where do I look for them? I've looked in Users/myname and in Users/myname/AppData but haven't found anything that looked right.</p>

    <title>Drive and folder widgets slightly skewed to right in This PC. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Drive and folder widgets slightly skewed to right in This PC.</h2>
                    I did a fresh install of win10 pro and upgraded to the latest insider build soon after. I noticed this strange thing where in This PC, certain widgets - C drive, Documents, Videos, External Drive widget (when connected) were a little skewed to the right.
 Also when connecting an external drive, the capacity bar is shown but not the capacity values (see screenshot). I have no idea what triggered this behavior and how to resolve this. Any help please?

<h2>            Content Copier Nokia N95 8gb Not displaying large backup</h2>
                    Hello<br />
I have a Nokia N95 8GB, and created a backup for it about 2 weeks ago, this was a full back. Once I open the Content copier click restore the newest backup isn't display but if I go to the location of were the files are save C:\Documents and Settings\User_Name\Application
 Data\NSeries\ContentCopier<br />
<br />
it show that there had been a back up that isn't displayed, and the size of the backup not displayed is 4GB. I'm assuming that it is due to content copier not supporting files of that size. Could someone please tell me how to restore this backup as there is
 a lot of stuff that I can not be bothered putting back on one by one

            <p>This is how to invoke, you have to invoke and also speak your command all at once.&nbsp; Just saying "hey Cortana" by itself won't do anything (she won't ask "what do you want?").</p>

</p><p>So if you say all at once with no pause, "hey cortana what's the weather in Seattle?" she will activate and reply.</p>

<p>I've tried saying that to my laptop and of course nothing happens. &nbsp;How do I install Cortana? &nbsp;Once installed, how do I shut it off if I'm paranoid about Microsoft constantly listening to everything I say?</p>

            Go to Cortana options (the three lines at the top-left of the cortana window) and turn off the voice detection option under settings.
