<h2>            GTA 5 &#126; crew invites.</h2>
                    I'm on xbox 360 playing GTA 5. My crew invites are not showing up. Not on my console and not when I go to Rockstar Social Club. People send me invites....but I just never get them. Anyone have an answer for me?

            <p>I did some searching online and the best answer I got was from Rockstar where it says that it may take upwards of 10+ minutes to appear. This could also be a bug so I would reach out to the official forums or social at the Devs.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Disabling physical keyboard when in tablet mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skiesareforflying  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disabling physical keyboard when in tablet mode</h2>
                    I have an hp spectre laptop that bends back to become a tablet, and goes into "tablet mode". In this tablet mode, however, the physical keyboard does not disable and when I have it in my lap I will inevitably start accidentally pressing random keys. Is
 there a setting in Windows 10 where I can disable the keyboard specifically when I go into tablet mode? I don't want to have to manually disable it any time I want to use it as a tablet, that would be unreasonable...

            The page you linked must be out of date. the settings that they refer to do not appear to me. e.g. there is no "Keyboard" section of the control panel. Rotating my laptop doesn't work, and resetting to factory settings unreasonable... this seems like an
 operating system issue. could an update have messed everything up? really frustrating.

            Occasionally games get deleted.&nbsp; It's definitely worth checking to see if it is available to download again.&nbsp; A pain I know because its large.&nbsp; But any game saves would still be on the cloud.

<h2>            Unable to communicate with an HP Color Laserjet M477 printer.</h2>
                    <p>My desktop PC is unable to communicate correctly with my new HP Color Laserjet Pro M477 through ethernet, USB or wirelessly but my Windows 10 laptop has no issues doing so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that is something not setup correctly on this PC but I am at a loss as to what it might be. Windows firewall is off, anti-virus software has an exception for the ip address of the printer. The ethernet setup sees the printer and I can install drivers
 but it won't print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fairly fresh install of Windows 10 Pro 64 bit on an SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All system drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>in cmd I can ping web addresses but can't ping the printer address. From my laptop I am able to ping the address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>network is cable modem with wireless capabilities connected to PC through ethernet cable. Internet is fully functional on the PC, no issues. I can browse, I can game etc.</p>

            <p>I have already run the printer troubleshooting tool and all it comes up with is that the printer isn't the default printer in the instances where it actually sees the printer. (usually when connected with the ethernet cable.)<br />
</p>
<p>One other thing that I have done is make sure that network discovery is turned on and file and print sharing is also on.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply Ian. Yes the printer was set to default during the installation process as well as during the troubleshooting steps which is pretty much all the troubleshooter would find wrong. All drivers on the system are up to date including the
 printer driver which was downloaded from the HP website before even attempting this and re-downloaded several times to be sure there wasn't something wrong with the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue here is the lack of the system's ability to communicate through any means with the printer other than seeing it to be able to start the install process. As mentioned above, my laptop is fully capable of completing the install for all 3 connection
 types without issue. The system will see the printer when it is connected via USB or LAN, but doesn't see it on Wi-Fi. Regardless of connection I can't ping the printer at all on the desktop system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing that I have experienced is that when the printer is connected through LAN, the printer is unable to do a network check and returns an error 49.</p>

While it's not clear what the OP's issue is,&nbsp; image files are <strong>not</strong> stored in the Photos app.&nbsp; The Photos app accesses the files from wherever they happen to be stored.&nbsp;

<p>I am not sure who I am replying to, but the some of files were imported from a previous computer and were always accessible in Windows 7 from the original C: file and some are newly created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said above, for a professional,&nbsp; while that app is a great viewer, it has limited use for editing and sending files in batch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need direct access to the original file to work on the images, something I cannot do with the Photo App. Furthermore,</p>
<p>I do not understand the architecture of what was done to my picture files and that also has me upset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted support and they had no understanding of the issue for business and wanted to sell me a another level of support services. I really thought that something called creators edition would have more flexibility for more than personal use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot believe that no one else has written about this problem.</p>

<p>As a test I opened with Paint. The image opened, but I could only see one image at a time not all of the files like I used to be able to do. I also took a look at the app store to see if there were other apps that I could use. Too many to deal with now,
 but I need a solution where I can contain and prepare for sending to others multiple files at a time. The other thing that I don't understand is the function for shared files or duplicate files. My problem is that I don't see that Microsoft thinks it is important
 to explain how this stuff works for <strong>every user. Where are the support explanations for this stuff? I have tried to find them.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I really thought that MS was a great solution&nbsp; and when I bought a new computer, I rejected Apple, now I am doubting what I did.</p>

            Every user?&nbsp; All 400,000,000 of them?&nbsp; You've referred to yourself as a professional of some sort, and it seems to me that it's incumbent upon professionals to familiarize themselves with the tools of the profession.&nbsp; You&nbsp;<em>can
</em>open files from file explorer as it turns out, and you have already determined that the Photos app is inadequate for your needs.&nbsp; You need to find image viewing/editing software that suits your purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many free options, including

<p>I meant different classes of users. I am trying to familiarize myself. That is why I came here. I never faced the problem before I bought the Windows 10 computer and the need recently arose for me to access the photo files. I don't remember having this issue
 before I converted to the Creator's Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the suggestions on the viewers, but I feel I still don't understand where my files are and why I can't have files in two locations. Any explanations from you or anyone else would be greatly appreciated. I would especially like to hear from
 photographers.</p>

            If you were able to access a file in File Explorer and open it in Paint, how can you not know where it's located?&nbsp; There is no reason that you shouldn't be able to store files in more than one location.&nbsp; What makes you think that you can't?<br />

<h2>            Blue screen when attempting to install .NET Framework 3.5</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had an ongoing issue with installing .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 10 since the 1809 patch.</p>
<p>Due to this and other issues, I've remained on patch 1803 until now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've began upgrading a few machines in my environment and ran into an issue where I'm unable to install .NET Framework 3.5.</p>
<p>A blue screen message appears and displays the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Stop Code: SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION</p>
<p>What failed: ntfs.sys</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If that machine is reverted back to 1803, the installation is successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried downloading the offline installer for .NET 3.5 and it also fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine specs are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell Precision 3630</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro 64-Bit - 1903 (OS Build 18362.145)</p>
<p>CPU: Intel Core i7-8700</p>
<p>RAM: 16GB DDR4</p>
<p>GPU: NVIDIA Quadro P400</p>
<p>SSD: SK Hyni SC313 SATA 512GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>The error appears to be related to the file system and there may be a conflict between between Symantec drivers and the OsrIsolate.sys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OsrIsolate.sys appears to be the older driver,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you update the software that installed the OsrIsolate.sys driver? </p>

<p>The installer requires more data to be downloaded </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Translation: Whatever you're trying to install, your machine needs some other updates to be installed first.</p>
<p><b>Run the SFC /SCANNOW command</b>:</p>
<p>This will check and repair if necessary any critical Windows system files prior to installing SP1.</p>
<p>Click on Start/All programs/Accessories then </p>
<p><b>Right</b> click on Command Prompt option and select 'Run as administrator'.</p>
<p>At the command prompt enter: <i>SFC /SCANNOW</i></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Rename the 'Software Distribution folder</b>':</p>
<p>a) Click the Start Button, click 'All programs, and click on 'Accessories'.</p>
<p>b) Next <b>Right</b> click on the 'Command Prompt' option and then click 'Run as administrator'.</p>
<p>c) In the 'Command Prompt' window enter: <i>net stop Wuauserv</i> and press the 'Enter' key.</p>
<p>d) Next click the Start/Orb button in the taskbar, in the 'Search' box, enter:<i>%windir%</i> and press the 'Enter' key.</p>
<p>e) In Windows Explore view, search for and locate the folder named "SoftwareDistribution".</p>
<p>f) <b>Right</b> click on the folder and select the 'Rename' option and change the name to:<i>SoftwareDistributionOld</i></p>
<p>g) Close Windows Explorer and in Command Prompt window enter: <i>net start Wuauserv</i> and press the 'Enter' key.</p>
<p>h) Wait for the "Windows Update Service has successfully" before exiting/closing the command prompt window.</p>
<p>i) If you open Windows Explorer you should see that new "SoftwareDistribution" folder has been created.</p>
<p>j) Reboot</p>

Install the stand-alone package for the service pack instead of using Windows Update to install the Service Pack</p>

<p>For 64-Bit Windows 7 download: windows6.1-KB976932-X64.exe 903.2MB</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Download, *<b>save</b>*, and install the Service Pack with no security software (antivirus/security suite) installed, disconnect from Internet, disable the fire-wall &amp;<b>close all non-essential</b> process in the
<span>task</span> manager. I also recommend taking off USB keys or any external media as this takes place.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When it is downloaded <b>right</b> click on the file and select Run As Administrator from the menu.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have a corrupt save file for the game and it is getting hung up on that.</p>
<p>Go to Dashboard, then scroll over to the System Tab and open it up.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;When the tab opens, click "Storage"</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Navigate to the device in which your save data for Tenchu Z resides in</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Somewhere there you should see something about save files (it varies from game to game).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;You will probably need to delete the save game files.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Enfocement</h2>
                    <p>So I got an enforcement action taken on my account for my "profile" but I feel like nothing is wrong. If a video game is rated M for mature why do people get mad when something post-war history is set as a logo. It's like making a make about WW2 and not putting any **** flags in the game which is un heard of. &nbsp; I want to argue it with the enforcement&nbsp;team but they have no way of contacting them via live chat or message if your report gets denied.</p><p><br /></p><p>Also I was wondering how many "strikes" you can have before you get ban. I have 3 but I've&nbsp;been a 5 year member&nbsp;playing so much i still have a "good" reputation after 3 reports. &nbsp;I just want to clear my name as ive&nbsp;been here for a long time and mistakes happen :(</p><p><br /></p><p>-thanks !</p>

            <p>Games themselves can be rated M, but everything done on Live has to be rated E for everyone.That is per the code of conduct/terms of use you agree to when you sign up for Live.</p><p><br /></p><p>You can be banned permanently for one thing, but generally suspension time gets longer as you go on, starting with a 24 hour suspension up to 2 weeks and then it would be a permanent ban.

<h2>            Enable Full Screen Mode in Microsoft Edge and other Apps on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Edge does offer full screen mode but the option is not shown in a list in the browser's menu. To get full screen mode in Edge, on your keyboard press and hold down
<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>Windows Key</strong>+<strong>Enter</strong>. This will not only work for Microsoft Edge, but also apps like the mail app, windows store, etc.&nbsp; I am currently running the creator's update. I hope this will be valuable to you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Gamertag was banned and was still charged for a year of Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>My console and gamertag were banned around the time when Halo 4 came out. A friend of mine had the real game early and I got banned for it even though it was not a burned disc or a mod chip in my xbox. Anyways the main reason I am on here is if my gamertag
 is banned for life and cant go online then why was I charged for another year of Xbox Live for $59.99. How can you be charged for something that you cant use? It is not the gamertag that I am signed in with. The gamertag is AngelofDEATH121. It took me months
 to even consider coming back to xbox and I am now getting screwed again. I want it cancelled and refunded</p>

<h2>            Help with ripping and no sound.</h2>
                    I've recently bought a new computer and I have used it to rip around 10 CD's with absolutely no problem. I have one CD though, that simply will not Rip at all. It's Trivium - Ascendancy (2005) and it plays absolutely fine through a CD player, but not at
 all on my computer. It registers the album, downloaded the album art and track titles and plays it, but no sound occurs when it's playing. (Windows sounds and other music such as Youtube play fine at the same time though, so it's not a speaker fault) Also,
 when ripping, it gives each track an 'Error' under the Rip status section and gives up.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I love the album, anyone have any advices or fixes?</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
<div>I changed it to highest quality on the slider and still no sound, i'm currently on the Codec part. It tells me the files are 'CDA'. never come across this file type before. I'll try downloading the codec and get back to you.</div>

            I saw the CDA isn't actually read as an audio file, so I downloaded a converter called FreeRIP to attempt to make it playable, but that doesn't rip either. Really not sure what to do.&nbsp;

            Hi Ryan,<br />
sounds like the disk may be written in a different codecs.<br />
If you right click on the cd , select properties, and see what file type they are saved as.<br />

    <title>Unable to load a saved game from Skyrim - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to load a saved game from Skyrim</h2>
                    
<p>I have had the game, Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim for a week or so. One day out nowhere it says disk unreadable. So&nbsp;I cleaned the disk several times and it still came up with the error. So I tried starting a new game and loading the old game from there, and as
 soon as I hit load it came up with the error again. Then I started another new game and tried to save it and the error came up again. So I went back to GameStop and got a brand new copy of the game, went home and tried it and the eroor came up again. I then
 installed Skyrim to my Xbox 360 and then tried to play it&nbsp;and the error came up again.&nbsp;So I put in one of my other games Call Of Duty: Modern Warefare 3 and that game loads, saves, and plays fine. The same with any of the games that I put in.</p>
<p>I tried everything xbox.com said to do to solve a unreadable disk error, and those didn't work. So now I need some help and suggestions to try and help me be able to load my old file and play Skyrim.</p>

<p>unreadable from a new skyrim game? its probably your hard rive, I once had issues like that, I just kept ejecting the disc until something came up, but usually when you successfully install a game, there should be not read errors since most of the data is
 pre-loaded</p>
