            <p>Hi Serge,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, you only get the option to upgrade to Windows 10 when you try to upgrade from Windows 8.1 Pro, is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, please be informed that you will only be able to upgrade from a previous operating system to the same version(Home/Pro) of Windows 10. Just to confirm you have Windows 8.1 pro installed in the computer, follow the steps below to check the version
 of Windows installed.</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R.</p>
<p>2. Type Winver and press enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it shows Pro and you are unable to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, I would suggest you to try upgrading to Windows 10 using an installation media. Follow the steps given by Andre Da Costa on
<strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-upgrade-from-previous-versions-of-windows/31722b30-1da9-42bb-b331-0edc4649bf43">How to: upgrade from previous versions of
 Windows using Windows 10 ISO file</a></strong></p>

<p>Thank you all for your answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, I was trying to do an Upgrade by going to a website and it was Windows 8.1Pro - to -Win 10 Home</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did fresh 8.1Pro install again and went to Windows Update then checked for updates. Few minutes later Windows Logo showed up next to the clock bar. I clicked it and applied Upgrade that way and it worked.

                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
Other Windows Live Messenger issues

<div><b>Did you receive an error code or message? </b></div>
<div>No</div>
<div><b>Please enter the error code or message you received </b></div>
<div>none</div>
<div><b>Please provide your impacted Email address : </b></div>

<div><b>Is your computer behind a corporate firewall ? </b></div>
<div>No</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
I had an MSN e-mail account in 2001. I stopped using it long ago. I just bought a new notebook and it does not have Outlook included so I set up Windows Live and reactivated the free MSN e-mail account by changing my old password. It said someone might have
 used the account in the past so the password had to be changed. I did that and OMG,. over 17,000 e-mails are sitting there.&nbsp; Apparently, it saved it all from 2001.<br />
<br />
How do I batch delete all of them?&nbsp; to start fresh. <br />
<br />
I don't know which version I am using but it must be the most up to date because it is a new notebook.
<br />
<br />
Please help. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi <span>lb314bb,<br />
<br />
I regret to tell you that Windows Live Mail currently don't have the option to delete all email at one time. As a workaround, I suggest that you sign in to your account via web then delete all the emails. To do this, please follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Sign in to <a href="http://mail.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mail.live.com</a>.<br />
<br />
2. Click on <strong>Sweep</strong> located on the upper-left corner of the screen, then a drop-menu will appear, click
<strong>Empty this folder</strong>.<br />
<br />
3. A pop-up message will appear saying "You're about to delete all of the messages in this folder." then click
<strong>Ok</strong>.<br />
<br />
<p><span>Thanks,<br />
<br />
Windows Live Hedda A.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Locks up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rosswjohnston  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Locks up</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from windows 7 64 Bit that came with my wife's ThinkPad T530 to Windows 10 64 bit&nbsp;and she stated having random lock up problems.&nbsp; The installation went smoothly without any detected problems and the computer appeared to function properly after
 the upgrade, but within one day it began to exhibit random lock ups.&nbsp; It locks up in&nbsp;many different applications and even&nbsp;when only the task manager is running.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The lockups are random length and occasionally require a reboot.&nbsp;All the MS updates have been installed for both Windows 10, Office 2013 and other applications but he problem persists, however since the latest Windows 10 upgrade in November the frequency
 seems less.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded 4 other ThinkPads we have and 2 of those I needed to do a clean install to Windows 10 but none have exhibited the lock up problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer not having spend another week&nbsp;doing another clean install dose anyone have a solution to this?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Ross, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience. I understand the frustration when the computer locks up randomly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Random hangs are often due to damage to the Windows configuration, faulty hardware, or malware. However, because this behavior is random, it can be especially difficult to identify the proper cause. If the system is hanging randomly, it could be caused by
 damaged system files, software compatibility, or damaged registry files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve this problem, use the inbox <strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool</strong>. Then, install the Windows update or service pack again.
</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<span>Search</span>. Or, if you are using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, and then click
<span>Search</span>. Type <span>Command Prompt</span> in the <span>Search</span> box, right-click
<span>Command Prompt</span>, and then click <span>Run as administrator</span>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<span>Allow</span>.</li><li>Type the following command, and then press <span>Enter</span>.<br />
It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<div><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></div>
<span>Important</span> When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions. However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running Windows installation as the repair source, or use a
 Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD, as the source of the files. To do this, run the following command instead:
<div>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:<var>C:\RepairSource\Windows</var> /LimitAccess</div>
<span><strong>Note</strong></span> Replace the <var>C:\RepairSource\Windows</var> placeholder with the location of your repair source. For more information about using the DISM tool to repair Windows.</li></ol>
<p>Please revert if you face any issues with Windows in future. </p>

            <p>Hi Jessen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Security scan came up clean.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI I am an engineer and have developed HDDs and other storage systems for 40 years although many of those years as a VP or higher, so I understand how the operating systems and software are intended to function.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I tried the security scan I attempted an unusual approach to fix the problem.&nbsp; Since the supposedly offending opencl.dll is&nbsp;locked while the volume is mounted and I could not just replace it.&nbsp; I took the HDD out of the computer and connected it to
 a computer with a good 64 Bit Windows 10 installation through a USB port.&nbsp; I then found the flagged files and replaced them with copies from the other system.&nbsp; For one of the files I had to take ownership from the trustedInstaller&nbsp;and reset the permissions
 but I got it replaced and reversed the permissions.&nbsp; I then returned the HDD to the original system, but it didn't fix the problem; it still hangs telling me the SFC check in incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then booted the system with a specialized drive utility and checked the drive SMART&nbsp;table for grown defects but the HGST 500 GB drive is completely clean.&nbsp; At this time I am satisfied that there are no hardware issues.&nbsp; This leaves the only conclusion
 that the operating system is corrupted, but where. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Another observation is that by watching HDD activity in the Task Manager the HDD is being accessed far too much.&nbsp; With no applications open it is being used 100% of the time.&nbsp; It appears that the HDD access requests are coming in from somewhere and overloading
 the HDD SATA controller.&nbsp; I have not put a buss analyzer on it to verify my observation though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this is beginning to look like another case of wipe the HDD and start from scratch.&nbsp; If so that is 3 out of my 6 ThinkPads and makes it update in place a 50% failure rate for Windows 10 installation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any new ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ross</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Integrated Intel GMA Drivers issue. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Integrated Intel GMA Drivers issue.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently had a problem with the resolution on my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing Windows 7 (Home Premium 64 bit) updates the screen resolution was dramatically reduced and changing the resolution did not give me the same settings I had previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a problem with the Intel (R) HD Graphics display adaptor which I could not resolve by installing new drivers from the manufacturers website. Eventually I tried a restore point which fixed the problem. Before doing this I had disabled 'automatically
 install drivers for new hardware' which did nothing as after uninstalling the display adaptors and restarting the computer Windows 7 then automatically installed drivers. I also disabled automatic updates, changing to notify me about new updates to Windows
 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventhough I have not updated Windows 7 since this occurred the problem keeps persisting and will only be resolved with restore points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last time it happened there were no notifications about Window 7 updates - are these still installing on there own?&nbsp;(I have checked these settings after using a restore point).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated,</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello Lee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, Code 37 refers to an instance when t<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">he driver returned a failure when it executed the DriverEntry routine. So, reinstalling the drivers
 for this device is the best resolution. Please refer to the following link:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310123/en-us#37" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Error codes in Device Manager in Windows: Code 37</a></p>
<p>Hence, you need to completely uninstall the driver and then reinstall it back again from the Acer website. Also, the system model was not located on the Acer support website. So, I would request you to check the system model in the system information page.
 Refer to the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;button, type&nbsp;<strong>msinfo32</strong>&nbsp;in the Start search and hit ENTER.</li><li>Check for&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>System model</strong>, in the list of System summary.</li></ol>
<p>In addition to that, I would suggest you to run the following troubleshooter to check if the device driver is working.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/en-us?entrypoint=lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any .dll file corruption.</p>
<p><span>i. Type&nbsp;<strong>cmd&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>start&nbsp;</strong>search box.</span></p>
<p><span>ii. Right click on cmd in the Program list and then select the option&nbsp;<strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>iii. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p>iv. Type the following command, and then press ENTER:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sfc /scannow</strong><br />
</p>

<p><span><span>As far as I can see your Windows Update problem relates to your HP Officejet Pro 8620. The update error is 0x80070490 ERROR_NOT_FOUND.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Select the keyboard shortcut
<strong>Win+X,</strong> and click<strong> Command Prompt (Admin) </strong>on the drop down menu. Type
<strong>cd\</strong> and press ENTER. Type or copy and paste the command "<strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
</strong>" without the quotes and press the ENTER key. Type or copy and paste the command "</span><span>
</span><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></strong><span>" without the quotes and press the
<strong>ENTER</strong> key. Make sure you include the spaces where indicated. These procedures can take a long time to complete so you need to be extremely patient. Type
<strong>exit </strong>when it completes, press the <strong>ENTER</strong> key and restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you get an Error 87 response recheck the command you entered.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please upload a copy of the DISM log file</span><span> as a shared file
</span><span>to your OneDrive and post a link here.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may need to show hidden files. Use the keyboard shortcut
<strong>Win+X </strong>to access Control Panel, Folder Options and select View, Advanced Settings. Verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders" is checked and "Hide protected operating system files" is unchecked. You may need to scroll down to
 see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide extensions for known file types" is not checked.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Open Windows Explorer (keyboard shortcut
<strong>Win+E</strong>) and locate your C partition Expand C along the file path C&gt;windows&gt;logs&gt;DISM&gt;dism.log. To expand C click the arrowhead to left of C and repeat with windows and sub-folders as necessary.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 8 will not allow me to install any new programs. Get an error message saying that something else is installing.</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader2">I have Windows 8 on my laptop. It was working fine when I got it just over a year ago. Then, one day, it decided that it would not let me install anything, especially from the Internet. It gives me an error message saying that something
 else is being installed and that I have to wait until that is done installing. However, this has been going on for nearly a year now and I have not had anything installing for that amount of time. I finally got that same message today with the added website
 of http://go.microsoft.com with a bunch of letters and numbers after it. Going there was a blank page. Currently, I am wanting to download Zune so I can put updates on my Windows Phone. However, Windows 8 will not allow this. What can I do to take care of
 this problem I am having? </p>

If you are unable to load Windows or if your PC isn't performing as well as it once did, and you don't know why, you can refresh your PC without deleting any of your personal files or changing your settings.</p>
<p><br />
Refresh<br />
"The Refresh option reinstalls Windows, but keeps personalized settings and files. It does, however, reset PC settings to their defaults, but keeps apps downloaded from the Microsoft App Store and places a list of removed apps onto your desktop. A refresh does
 not require the Windows product key to be re-entered. Refresh is a good way to recover system performance, while keeping your data intact."</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> "Only Metro style apps when customers refresh their PCs, and require desktop apps that do not come with the PC to be reinstalled manually. We do this for two reasons. First, in many cases there is a single desktop app that is causing
 the problems that lead to a need to perform this sort of maintenance, but identifying this root cause is not usually possible. And second, we do not want to inadvertently reinstall “bad” apps that were installed unintentionally or that hitched a ride on something
 good but left no trace of how they were installed.</p>
<p><br />
Refreshing your PC goes like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC boots into Windows RE.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows RE scans the hard drive for your data, settings, and apps, and puts them aside (on the same drive).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows RE installs a fresh copy of Windows.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows RE restores the data, settings, and apps it has set aside into the newly installed copy of Windows.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC restarts into the newly installed copy of Windows."</p>

            <p>Well, and this is just my thinking, in single player everything is local. It loads the map, and everything in the map, done.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In multiplayer, it obviously involves talking to the server, and getting information from it about what's happening in other parts of the map that you can't see and such, as well as constantly making sure you're in sync with the server so you see what everyone
 else sees etc etc. </p>
<p>I&nbsp;can see plenty of things possibly going wrong with just those areas, for example, other players on the opposite side of the map are killing each other, blowing stuff up, etc, and his computer (while talking to the server) has to keep track of all that
 as well as what's happening in his area where he's killing guys and blowing stuff up. Could be putting slightly too much of a workload on his video card, or it doesn't know how to handle it, or a driver problem, etc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My line of thought got to this because on my computer, when I play Dragon Age 2 in DX11, everything is fine, until I turn on (if I recall correctly) ambient occulsion. Then **** hits the fan. Every texture (from what I can see and I could easily be wrong)
 gets what appears to be a black layer in the exact same position as the original texture, so they start fighting over who is on top and therefore visible to the player, so everything starts flashing between normal and covered in black triangles, and the gpu's
 amount of work goes through the roof. </p>
<p>This is apparently caused by a problem with nvidia drivers or nvidia cards. (I'm pretty sure my EVGA GTX 580 has a "nvidia base" or is a nvidia card modified by evga or something) So I'm thinking the problem is his Nvidia card, or rather, the game doesn't
 like a new driver that was just installed for the card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: The forum turned my nicely spaced reply into a giant wall of text. How fun!</p>

            No, only in multiplayer. Only when i had my 9800GTX, my new card has a lot of issues with this game and Medal of Honor. Not that i know of, I&nbsp;haven't&nbsp;updated my BIOS recently or changed it all. Yes it is set at that speed,I checked it in BIOS. Thank you&nbsp;

            I ran this game before on DX 11 with all settings but no AA and everything was good till a couple months. Just to note i cant even join the game, example, I click a server then it goes to the multiplayer map loading screen then i click join and then my
 game freezes on a black screen and crashes. But i agree with you, it could be drivers or anything else you said. Thanks&nbsp;

            <p>I'm inclined to doubt that overheating could cause this, since it's only one application and only when it does a specific thing, but the ram is a good idea, I guess if it's not on a native setting and it tries to load too much at once then maybe a crash
 would be the&nbsp;result.</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, Boss, do you have steam? And if so, could I add you on it?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 store corrupt. Crashing multiple core services&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi I'm having huge issues with the store, I cannot download apps anymore or even look at game or app store pages, it never loads. It causes crashes or multiple services including windows update and task scheduler. This happened on my previous install of
 windows 10, I'm currently on a new install from the latest ISO from MS. I have tried everything to fix this, I have tried wsreset, sfc scan now, DISM. I'm out of ideas, any help is appreciated!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Connor,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I appreciate if you could answer few questions to narrow down to the issue.
</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>What is the make and model of the computer? </span>
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Did you install any third party security application?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Which is the current build installed on the computer?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>As an initial troubleshooting step, </span><span>I suggest you to download and install any pending updates that needs to be installed on the computer through Windows update and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue persists, </span><span>I suggest you to create a new account and check if the issue persists in new account.</span></span></p>

<p>I use my laptop in three places at my cottage in Canada at my home in the USA and at my condo in the USA. Some how the internet has tagged my computer Canadian. When I google things the answers are always with Canadian sites with .ca instead of .com. This
 is annoying me. Is there anyway to change this?</p>

            On a Linux machine open Disk utility and format the drive using FAT format and it will work fine in Windows. &nbsp;Windows isn't capable of reading the EXT4 format used by Linux, but Linux can read both the FAT and NTFS formats used by Windows.&nbsp;

                    <p>After one year my computer decides that no printers exist on our network and I can't install them because the print spooler isn't turned on. It will not allow for any printing (even creating a PDF).&nbsp; &nbsp;I turn the print spooler on and it will not stay on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took my computer home this weekend and it did&nbsp;recognize all printers on my home network.</p>

                    <p>I have been given An Acer Aspire M5600 Desktop PC Tower ( Acer unused Engineers Sample )&nbsp;loaded with Windows Vista and I want to upgrade it to Windows 7 Home Premium. I have my own copy of Windows 7 which I had in my last old Tower which developed a virus
 and has been scrapped. There appears to be a problem when I try to load the disc to update.&nbsp;A cryptic message appears to say I cannot do this. There are also problems trying to load the Yahoo Toolbar, opening some web pages etc. etc. etc. There was no re-boot
 Vista Disc with the unit. What is the best way for me to get my Windows 7 installed? I am a disabled 70 year old Pensioner and am not totally computer literate so any help will be a big bonus. I can be contacted via this site so others see the answers but
 also my e-mail address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated. For a start, how do I take out Vista and then load my disc? is a start. Thanks, in advance,&nbsp;to everyone who can
 help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You do not tell us where your Windows 7 Disk came from; you only mention an old, scrapped machine, but you do not tell us if you bought that Windows 7 yourself and installed it or it came with Windows 7 already installed..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the&nbsp;old tower&nbsp;came with the Windows 7&nbsp;Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc), that Product Key that came with the Laptop is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines) is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>And Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps before you&nbsp;install Windows 7:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to your Computer / Laptop&nbsp;Manufacturer's website and see if Windows 7 Drivers are available for your Make and Model Computer / Laptop.
</p>
<p>If not available, Windows 7 will not&nbsp;work correctly for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run the "Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor"</p>

            I have posted another note saying that the Windows 7 is my own Disc which I purchased when it first came out. I just hope that I can upgrade my operating system&nbsp; as I am having many problems with the Vista that is loaded. I really need to remove it in
 total and then put Windows 7 in. Can this be done?

            <p>I merged your other "note" with this question.</p>
<p>Kindly stay with the original question and not start another question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked up your Acer model M5600 at Acer's website and there are no Windows 7 Drivers available for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was what&nbsp;I originally advised you to do:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Go to your Computer / Laptop&nbsp;Manufacturer's website and see if Windows 7 Drivers are available for your Make and Model Computer / Laptop.
</p>
<p>If not available, Windows 7 will not&nbsp;work correctly for you."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To fix Vista follow these steps and reinstall Vista:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reinstall Vista on an Acer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&nbsp;press the Left Alt Key and F10 at Boot to start the Recovery to Factory Settings process.</p>
<p><a href="http://acer.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://acer.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2631</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can order Recovery disks from Acer, if they still have them.</p>
<p>How to order eRecovery Disks:</p>
<p><a href="https://store.acer.com/store?Action=DisplayDataValidationServicePage&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;SiteID=acerna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">https://store.acer.com/store?Action=DisplayDataValidationServicePage&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;SiteID=acerna</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also you should have made your own Recovery disks.</p>
<p>Read your manual on how to make them through Acer's eRecovery in Programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some manufacturers no longer have Vista Recovery Disks available.</p>
<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>
<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is
 installed. </span></p>
<p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>
<p><span>"<b>How to Do a Clean Install and Setup with a Full Version of Vista"</b></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>
<p><span>"<b>How to Activate Vista Normally and by Phone Activation"</b></span></p>

            Thank you very much for your comments/answers. I am still at a loss because as I said before I am 70 years of age and am not totally computer savvy. I am talking to a contact for the seller and know that they will take the beast back. I will then hopefully
 get another Tower. The seller is not about until Jan. 6th. and knows nothing about Computers. There is no Handbook with the 'beast' and one cannot be downloaded. I was given to understand that Vista could be removed and my legal Windows7 disc could be installed
 because that is exactly what happened to my old tower. If I have a useless bit of kit that is no good to man or beast, it has to go. I feel a bit sorry for the supplier as there are 14 of them that are useless when I give them a feedback. Thanks any way and
 I am still open for help. Regards, D.

            <p>The Acer M5600 will not run Windows 7 correctly as Acer does not Support Windows 7 on it or supply Windows 7 Drivers for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acer only&nbsp;supports Vista 32bit and 64bit on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the Acer&nbsp;link again&nbsp;to look it up and get Manuals, etc for it:</p>

<h2>            PayPal unavailable for Gamertag Change</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I'm trying to change my Gamertag. However, when I click "Claim it!", the following window pop-up only allows me to add a Credit Card as a form of payment. My Microsoft / Hotmail account already has a verified (linked) PayPal account to it, and I have already
 successfully bought Killer Instinct (recent example) in the Windows Store by using the exact same account (the one I am trying to change the Gamertag of). I have looked for (perhaps) a separate option that would allow me to add a payment method specifically
 for changing Gamertags, but I haven't found one (I don't think there is).</p>
<p>Is there any way (one that I might be missing) which would allow me to add a PayPal account as a payment method in the window after I claim a new Gamertag?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h3> naveen mathias  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop background size</h2>
                    In the desktop background settings, there is an option to choose the picture possition. The options provided are "Fill, Fit, Stretch, Tile, Center". No matter what i choose, the system automatically changes it back to "Stretch". Due to this its difficult
 to use my personal snaps as the desktop backgrounds since they all look stretched. Please suggest the solutions. Thanks

    <title>Error&#58; The current profile is not allowed to play on Xbox Live. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stratahgy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error&#58; The current profile is not allowed to play on Xbox Live.</h2>
                    
<p>So I stopped playing on my xbox for a month, then as Black Ops 3 comes out I want to play online again. The last time I was playing; it was online BF4. Yesterday I go and download BO3 and continue to try and play online mode. First I thought my live ran
 out, which it did and I renewed with a month subscription. Today I go to play again and I still get the error message as yesterday. I deleted my account and resigned in to see if that works, nothing. I am online since I have friends that shows me as online
 with a Gold account. Any solutions? </p>

<p>general troubleshooting steps for this issue. go to settings&gt;all settings&gt;network&gt;network settings&gt;advanced settings&gt;alternate mac address&gt;clear alt mac&gt; restart. if this doesn't work run the multiplayer connection test in the network settings and when it
 gets to the end(says its all good or gives you an error) stay on that screen and press and hold both bumpersand both triggers at the same time(rb,lb,lt,rt) this should bring up your detailed network statistics. if your nat is anything but open contact xbox
 support and ask them to walk you through port forwarding/dmz (I prefer dmz its much easier and quicker and generally provides more reliable results)</p>
