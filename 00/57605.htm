            Microsoft is not releasing an ISO to current customers. We must download from the store. The only other way currently available is to buy Windows 8.1. I think if I was in your place I would concel the upgrade and try again.&nbsp;Hope this helps and if you need
 any further assistance post and we will be glad to help you.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above opinion is mine and mine alone and doesn't necessarily reflect that of Microsoft, it's employees, or any other member of this forum.</p>

<p>Assuming you don't have a Vista Installation Disk, you need to contact Toshiba Tehnical Support
<a href="http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/support/jsp/home.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/support/jsp/home.jsp</a>&nbsp;for assistance.&nbsp; They will probably sell you Recovery Disks at a small fee.&nbsp; It's also possisble there is a Recovery partition
 on your hard drive (that may be functional even if the system partition has crashed) - and there may be a keyboarad command to activate a re-installation to factory settings.&nbsp; In any case, you're going to lose everything on the hard drive so it would be good
 to first backup your important data (if possible).&nbsp; <span>
You can use Knoppix </span><span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></a><span>&nbsp;along with a blank CD (using another computer).&nbsp;
 Boot to the disk and this should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp;
<span>
To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and
 exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>We cannot help you with the recovery process
 as it is Toshiba's process - not Microsoft's and each manufacturer does things differently (sometimes even for different makes and models of computers).&nbsp; We do not have access to this information.&nbsp; In short, you need to contact Toshiba.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>You
 can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery
 disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows: </span><span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 100 updates pending,..&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I
 hope this helps.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Good
 luck!</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Factory Reset after installing a NEW hard drive</h2>
                    <p>I originally had Windows 7. Then I upgraded to Windows 10. A year later, my hard drive crashed and I installed Windows 10 on it. Now I find I need to do a &nbsp;Factory reset; will it go back to windows 7 or will I have windows 10? Also, since this is a new hard
 drive, will I have to activate windows 10?</p>
<p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

<p>You will get Windows 10, unless you use install media sent from your computer's manufacturer, which may be Windows 7.</p>
<p>Windows 10 will also auto-activate so long as you have not changed your computer's motherboard or processor. Just changing the hard drive is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can verify the activation status before reinstalling Windows 10. Go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Activation. On this screen, if you see the line "Windows is activated with a digital licence", then you can skip any requests for a product key during the
 reinstall and Windows 10 will auto-activate the first time the computer is connected to the Internet after install.</p>

<p>My computer shows the log on screen, but when i log on everything stays in black.&nbsp; I cant even see the taskbar or anything else, the only thing i can see is the mouse.&nbsp; I've let the PC like that for minutes but nothing happens.&nbsp; So i tried to go on safe
 mode with cmd and at least i can use cmd.&nbsp; I restored the pc but nothing happens, I maked a new user and tried to use the diferent user, still nothing happens.&nbsp; I know it still can work because&nbsp;I can open programs from command prompt and they work without
 any problems.&nbsp; But im very limited to everything.&nbsp; This has never happened to me before, the last time I used the computer it was working perfectly.&nbsp; Now i just turn it on and this is happening.&nbsp; And I didnt maked any administrative changes or anything that
 could posibly harm the PC, I was just playing itunes.&nbsp; Please help.</p>

<p>1. Are you able to start the computer in safe mode? Yes I am able to start it in safe mode but I still cant see anything, only the letters safe mode on each corner<br />
2. Do you have Windows 7 DVD? No, this computer was already designed for Windows 7<br />
3. How did you restore the computer? In safe mode Im able to start it with command prompt option, I can see cmd window(is the only thing I can see)&nbsp;in cmd I typed rstrui.exe and hit enter.</p>
<p>I accessed help and support from cmd so i was able to start device manager then. I tried the steps to do, what happened is that now Windows and text are bigger but still cant see or fix whats wrong.</p>
<p>If my computer's problem needs more advanced repair methods I want to know if I can fix it&nbsp; or if I have to call&nbsp;for direct support.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I forgot to say preffered language is spanish but english is ok too.</p>

            <p>I followed the script. Did the scannow and all of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Critical Error quite displaying but the Start Menu does not work. Microsoft Edge seems to have disappeared entirely and I cannot download a new version of it. For some odd reason the download comes as a docx file, 6053_Micorsoft_Edge...docx. Word can't
 open it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated my Surface Pro 3 from Win 7 to Win 10. It works. My HP All-in-One worked for awhile before developing this Critical Error. The HP did not like having a new touch screen app. It complained about several apps no longer working. To be expected, but
 also Microsoft should have expected us to move these not so old machines to MS 10. I actually wanted to stay at Win 7, but the update to Win 10 prompts kept coming from Microsoft and in a moment of weakness I made the move. Foolish.</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;for responding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know if you&nbsp;have made and changes to your operating system prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>If so, I suggest you to perform System Restore to the earlier point before the issue occurred and check if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Recovery options in Windows 10</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>Refer to: <strong>Restore from a System Restore point</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>System Restore:</span></strong><span> Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc, but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while
 system restoring. </span></p>
<p><span>During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead
 to loss of important files as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>If not, I suggest you to create a test&nbsp;user account and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>This will help&nbsp;us to know if the user account is corrupted.</p>
<p><strong><span>Refer to: </span></strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/create-a-local-user-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Create a local user account in Windows 10</span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Try the above and reply to the post with an updated status of this issue, we will be&nbsp;happy to help you further.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Black Ops Download is corrupt - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Black Ops Download is corrupt</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I am from Salt Lake City, Utah. While on vacation I had purchased an Xbox 250gb with Kinect Bundle from Hong Kong.<br />
<br />
Now I recently purchased Call of Duty Black Ops using Microsoft Points from the Xbox live Game Market Place for 4800 points, I downloaded it twice to my console's hard disk but both the times the file was corrupt even though I had downloaded the file which
 is around 6.8 Gb.<br />
<br />
Can you please tell me if this problem is happening because my console has been purchased from Hong Kong and I bought the game from American Xbox live Marketplace due to some kind of region code restrictions?<br />
<br />
What are my options now? It is really disappointing that I am unable to play the game.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Getting error message &#39;hotspot has started, but internet connection sharing could not been enabled&#39; while using mHotspot app</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Problem with sharing internet</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,<br />
For months I have used mHotspot app for one-click internet sharing. Nowadays I got a problem with it almost every time I need a wifi connection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app says that "hotspot has started, but internet connection sharing could not been enabled". Of course, I went to Network and Sharing Center and tried to share Local Area Connection (my internet source) to Wireless Network Connection 2, with a result
 of warning message: "The service cannot accept control messages at this time". So, I looked into internet, what should I do, but in fact, everything looks good... but still sharing doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only solution that worked is to... reboot computer. But in fact, I don't want to do It, because it takes a lot of time to save everything, close everything, reboot, re-open everything and so on...<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do to get this working without having to restart everything every time I wanna use it?</p>
<p>Windows 7 Professional 64-bit on Asus X54H laptop.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue normally occurs when there is any problem with the application that you are using or the dependent services are not configured properly or not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:<br />
<br />
</strong>I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall Hotspot app to see if that helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Uninstall or change a program</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/uninstall-change-program#uninstall-change-program=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/uninstall-change-program#uninstall-change-program=windows-7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: <br />
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, you may open <strong>'Services' </strong>and check each services to see if it is enabled or not.
</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<div>a. Click <strong>Start</strong>, Run, type <strong>services.msc</strong>, and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</div>
<div>b. To enable a service, find it in the right pane and double-click its entry.</div>
<div>c. Be sure its <strong>Startup Type </strong>is set to <strong>Automatic </strong>
and click OK.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>All the following services must be thus configured in order to share Internet:</strong></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Application Layer Gateway Service<br />
Network Connections<br />
Network Location Awareness (NLA)<br />
Plug And Play<br />
Remote Access Auto Connection Manager<br />
Remote Access Connection Manager<br />
Remote Procedure Call (RPC)<br />
Telephony</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>After verifying and/or configuring Automatic startup for each of these services, close the Services window and restart the computer before attempting again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Reply with the status so that we could help you further.

            <p>Thanks for a response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, I've tried 1st method few times. It worked only for the 1st time, then I tried it again, but it was no more a solution. Even tried installing different version with the same effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 2nd one. Yes, I found it in one of the answers before. I set everything on, and to automatic startup, but it doesn't seem to work too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why I ask, because I've run out of ideas how to solve it. :)</p>

    <title>SMS character counter and cost counter not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elpenor1  say:</h3>
<h2>            SMS character counter and cost counter not working</h2>
                    <p>So, the sending of SMS messages are finally working again in the updated version... Thanks for that, even if keeping Skype Classic would have been better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I'm writing an SMS the character counter is now not working. Just keeps saying 160. It also wrongly indicates only the cost of one SMS, regardless of message length.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem affects (at least) both the Mac desktop version and the iPhone version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I also really wish that the new version would allow switching of automatic conversion into graphic emojis, like the old one.)</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor Specialist on Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />Sometimes there are glitches in the installation / update process that don't pop up an error message so we end up thinking the installation is all ok when it not the case, which can cause strange behaviors as the one you describe.
<br />
<br />May I suggest that you uninstall Skype, restart your device, re-install Skype and try again?
<br />
<br />Has the issue been fixed?
<br />
<br />Looking forward to hearing back from you. 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great weekend! 
<br />Margarida       
        </p>

<br />If that is the case, I recommend sending the feedback directly to skype. To do so, please follow the directions provide here:

    <title>Proxy Server for Instant Messanger - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> walkgirl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Proxy Server for Instant Messanger</h2>
                    My MSN Instant Messanger worked yesterday but doesn't work today. I got the error message 81000306 and when I went through all the troubleshooting steps I found one part I can't resolve. It asked me to check the connections by testing them. The HTTP &amp;
 TCP tests show connectivity but the SOCKS test shows I need to define a proxy server. I don't know what that is or what it should be. I have Windows Vista Premium and Instant Messanger Version 2009 Build 14.0.8089.726. Please, I need help resolving this problem
 as I am not a computer person other than using one and setting very simple things on it.

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and<span>&nbsp;</span>then click Disable All.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>5. Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>6. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></p>
<p><span>Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Someone logged into my account and tampered with my account</h2>
                    <p>I am almost certain someone has logged into my Xbox profile and tampered with my account. I went onto my recent activity and saw that an unknown IP had logged into my account, causing me to freak out and change everything I am able to change from security
 to account preferences. Now, I am certain no one is going to be accessing this account, other than myself, but I am concerned that my account might get reseted or banned. While loading up Halo 3 tonight, I noticed my profile information was changed (that I
 didn't change) and more importantly my gamerscore for a couple games were not 0gs (when I was 12, I modded my gamerscore and was reset for it, which I regret doing but I was young and stupid). I deleted my profile and re-downloaded and it changed itself back
 to the original gamer score total.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess what I am asking is should I be alarmed/worried or am I perfectly safe, since nothing was done by me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>It's possible, but if you do get the account reset, or banned due to something that the previous compromise on the account caused. You can always submit a
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Case review</a> to dispute the enforcement action that was created due to that specific previous compromise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have contacted support. Got a case number for reference in case an enforcement happens. The weird thing is that when I check enforcement history, one of my suspensions is missing but that was the only thing out of the ordinary. I will just have to be more
 careful in the future</p>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 4&#58; Unable to connect to online</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought Forza Horizon for the online features, however I'm unable to connect online no matter what I do. I've completed a year in-game (which is what I thought you needed to do to unlock online), but I'm presented with a message saying it's connecting
 me to a session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen similar posts about people having issues getting online and was wondering if this is a known issue or something potentially wrong on my side. If anyone has any solutions that might help, that would be great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I should also note that I'm playing this on PC, not sure if that would affect my capabilities to get online.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Printer Error with Brother MFC-7340 Printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donaldzombo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Printer Error with Brother MFC-7340 Printer</h2>
                    <p>I loaded Windows 10 and just noticed today 8/5/2015 that my Brother MFC-7340 printer stopped working. At first the printer was not even listed among the printers available.&nbsp;After looking around the system I was able to add the printer. Although I was successful
 adding this driver when I try to print it will not work. It says there&nbsp;is an error&nbsp;during&nbsp;the printing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help with this problem I would certainly appreciate the help. As of right now I have no means to print documents and since this is a business computer I need it back in operation as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Usually when you install Windows 10 all the drivers for the hardware gets installed with the operating system files. If you are facing any issues with the drivers installation, then I would suggest you to download the drivers for that particular printer from
 the manufacturers website and install in compatibility mode. Also check with the computer manufacturer to see if there are any updated drivers for Windows 10.<br />

            <p>Actually I didn't take the advice and kept trying for fixes myself. I loaded a driver repair program (Drivethelife)and it repaired the drivers that were visible in my printer menu. Unfortunately, the driver for the printer was still not in the pick list
 so I still had the problem. A friend of my suggested to delete the primary printer device that was designated by a checkmark next to the device. I tried to delete this device but it would not delete. After several attempts I left the control panel and device
 window and rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the reboot I was going to try other things but I thought I would look back into the device section covering the printers. To my surprise the MFC-7340 Printer Driver appeared. I selected this driver and tried to print a document and it worked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as far as what I really did to make this happen its beyond me. The only thing I know is that the printer is now on line and I am back in business and that's all I care about.</p>
<p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to follow these steps: 
<br />
<br />1.Open Windows PowerShell as Administrator
<br />	Method 1:
<br />	1. Press Windows Key + R on your keyboard
<br />	2. Key in PowerShell and hit Enter.
<br />	3. Right click on the PowerShell icon on the taskbar and select Run as Administrator.
<br />	
<br />	Method 2:
<br />	1. Right click Start button
<br />	2. Choose Command prompt (Admin)
<br />	3. Key in Powershell in the black window and hit Enter.
<br />	
<br />2. Paste the following command in the Administrator: Windows PowerShell window and press Enter key:
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />3. Wait for PowerShell to execute and complete the command. Ignore the few errors (in red color) that may pop up.
<br />4. When it finishes, try hitting Start and hopefully it’ll start working. If not, this solution won’t apply to you, unfortunately.
<br />
<br />Are you able to solve it for you by following the procedure mentioned above or it fails? If it it fails, do make sure that you ran Powershell as Administrator (window will be called Administrator: Windows PowerShell ) and gave the command enough time to execute.
<br />

            Hi Brigita,
<br />
<br />Try this, it might work . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter
<br />
<br />In the resulting dialog, click on your account name
<br />
<br />Then click 'Properties'
<br />
<br />Click on the 'Group Membership' tab
<br />
<br />Can you set yourself as Admin from there?
<br />
<br />
<br />If that fails:
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter (replace AccountName with your login name)
<br />
<br />net localgroup Administrators AccountName /add
<br />
<br />Restart your PC

<h3> whocares8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 keeps muting Winamp</h2>
                    <p>I installed Winamp 5.8, and for some reason Windows 10 keeps muting it. The slider in App Volume and Device Preferences keeps returning to 0 when a new track is played, even after I pull it to 100. How do I turn this off, it is very silly? It doesnt happen
 with any other program.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></span></p>
<p>

<h2>            deleted folder won&#39;t leave my desktop</h2>
                    I've been trying to fix this for a while, but I've had no luck. I had a file folder on my desktop that I didn't need anymore, so I deleted it. It was fine until I restarted my pc. Now the folder is back, and trying to delete it doesn't work because it
 says it is not there. Holding it and dragging it to the recycle bin does nothing. I've looked up other posts, including the command prompt (admin) to delete it, but it says it's in error. What are my options?

            Hi  dragonmaster113
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Try turning off syncing then delete the folder again to see if it works. 
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Account &gt; Sync your settings
<br />Toggle off sync settings
<br />
<br />Restart then delete the folder to see if it stays permanently deleted. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work....
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />Check your hard disk for any errors:
<br />Click Start
<br />Type: CMD, from the results, right click Command prompt
<br />Click 'Run as Administrator'
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f
<br />Hit Enter
<br />When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />You could try removing the folder using its 8.3 name via an Administrator Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />There is a video in the following link explaining:

<br />This is a permanent delete (does not go to recycle bin).

            Hi Dragonmaster.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Reset the Desktop icon cache to see if that sorts it out:
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/232779/how-to-rebuild-a-broken-icon-cache-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/232779/how-to-rebuild...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then go into Repair Mode where WIndows becomes inert, use the Command Prompt to delete the icon using this same method as to rescue files when WIndows won't start, except instead of copying, delete it:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I tried to delete the cache, but the option to go to command prompt is not listed in the right click menu for explorer. I've tried to do it by doing a directory change as well, but I can't seem to get to the directory.

            Sometimes a missing component of DirectX will crash a game!GFWL has some of these dx files and might start the game. I had the same problem with you and some of my games wouldnt start until i installed GFWL.Try it, it might work to you too.

<p>Please take your sales pitch elsewhere. Most everyone here has been educated to the fact that this type of software is useless and potentially damaging to the operating system. The only people who benefit from the use of these bogus 'Miracle Cures' are those
 who sell it and those who get paid to repair the damage they do. I don't think anybody here is stupid enough to use it.</p>

 fails quoting an error.&nbsp; I already have DX 11 installed on my Desk top that apparently came with the Windows8 download.

            <p>Try running this DX Updater from 2010. It overwrites the existing files in case they are missing or need to be repaired:

<p>Then run the other DX Updater to update any other files:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DX 2011</a>

            <p>It is 18 Oct 2015... I just had the same problem with Witcher Enhanced (v1.5)&nbsp;that I downloaded from GoG.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the file I needed from Microsoft and uploaded it to my Google Drive. Here is the link the Folder/Command you want to execute is "DXSETUP" among the many files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After it installed... Witcher Enhanced started just fine.</p>

<p>I'm assuming that you have some Windows Live Account that you are unable to login to for some various reason.&nbsp; Can you clarify that this the case, and can you clarify that you have forgotten your login password or your User Name?</p>
<p>If you are talking about these type of Forums (below) then they are very busy but eventually you should get a response from Microsoft.&nbsp; If the problem is what I am guessing it to be then only Microsoft can sort out the problem for you, non Microsoft posters,
 like&nbsp;we find in this Forum, will not be able to do much for you other than to advice on a course of action to follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reset your password<br />

<p>If I remember the way Microsoft handle these type of problems with "lockouts" is that they contact you via E-mail (some address that you can still access) and either reset your password or clear the problem after you have proved to their satisfaction that
 you are the owner of the blocked account.&nbsp; The process is made a lot easier if you have (at setup) provided them with an Alternate E-mail Address, or have setup (and remembered) a Secret Question answer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the whole process can fail and you may lose that account for ever.&nbsp; If that were the case you should start now trying to get duplicates of important E-mails from the original sender.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was by far my favorite MK game&nbsp;out there. Why isn't it on Xbox Live Arcade yet? I've already bought 3 Ultimate and I'm fighting the urge to buy the Arcarde Trilogy. It'd be nice to play as Rain&nbsp;&amp; Ermac again... You know, the REAL way.</p>

<p>i wish MK4 was included with the arcade mortal kombat arcade kollection. i still like the game. they should release the sega dreamcast gold version of MK4 . it featured 4-5 new fighters not found in the regular MK4 arcade version. and an extended ending
 for reiko that made his ending make more sense.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 0, 1)">I loved MK4 so much! I would love to see us get it on XBLA but I really doubt it though. Seeing as we just barely even got the MK Arcade Kollection.<br />
<br />
Personally i'm just ready for them do do another full length Mortal Kombat game the reboot that came out last year was fantastic!&nbsp;</span></p>
