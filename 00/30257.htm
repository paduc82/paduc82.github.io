    <title>Xbox cycling the tv power for no reason - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox cycling the tv power for no reason</h2>
                    
<p>Since the new update my Xbox one has been cycling the tv power on and off repeatedly even when i'm just sitting at the dashboard. &nbsp;I've even tried disabling the tv control settings by deleting the TV. &nbsp;Is this a common problem? &nbsp;I am concerned because my
 Xbox one is nearing one year old and even though i've barely used it in that year it will be out of warranty soon. &nbsp;Please help me figure out what to do.</p>

<p>I know you have removed the TV from the settings but have you tried to re-add it and maybe try other codes for Xbox to use for control?</p>
<p>It is possible that it is cycling because the remote code is not the correct one.</p>
<p>I would definitely suggest trying the setup of the TV again to see if that resolves it.</p>
<p>Good Luck.</p>

    <title>Access internet over WIFI NAT while also being connected to LAN NAT - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Access internet over WIFI NAT while also being connected to LAN NAT &#40;which has no internet access&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys, my house network is currently setup in very uncomfortable setup:</p>
<p>My internet access is through a shared WiFi with my neighbors, so I connect to their network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a freeNAS server running my media storage, and that computer does not support wifi - so I have a separate router just for it.</p>
<p>I have that NAS server plugged in via ETH, AND my Surface Pro 4 as well (via the MS Surface Dock).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This work nice when I try to access the media shares via Network, I can see the nas and fully access it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However it plays havoc on my internet connection! all routing I think is jumping to the ETH network instead of wifi - I cant browse (most of the sites, or as soon as routing/dns is updated not sure), I cant auto download subtitles, Kodi plugins etc until
 I disable the LAN connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WIFI network sits on 192.168.0.X, while LAN is on 192.168.1.X (I can easily change the LAN, although if needed I should be able to get admin details to change the wifi configuration).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solution please?</p>

<h2>            Importing a backup of start menu layout</h2>
                    <p>This question is NOT about moving a start menu layout from one machine to another and therefore has nothing to do with gpedit:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have successfully backed up via export startlayout and am pasting the first few lines just to be clear</p>
<p>
<strong>&lt;LayoutModificationTemplate Version="1" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/Start/2014/LayoutModification"&gt;</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &lt;LayoutOptions StartTileGroupCellWidth="8" /&gt;</strong><br />

</p><p>
</p><p>Now I am tryinhg to decipher the reverse command "import startlayout" with its somewhat cryptic syntax like mountpath supposedly pointing to a wim file. &nbsp;As you can see, this is an xml backup and I want to use it to recreate tiles should anniversary update
 wipe out hundreds of tiles like it did in one of the 14xxx builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am tring to import this XML and replace all my start tiles with the recreated version backed up. &nbsp;Assume my user directory to be c:\Users\myusername\ and please help me with assumptions and syntax. &nbsp;I sure hope windows will offer a simple to use export
 import scenario in the future. &nbsp;Thanks for the consideration.</p>

            <p>Hi Norman, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue pertains to importing the XML and replacing the start tiles, which is out of the support boundary.&nbsp; I would request you to post the query in
<strong>TechNet Forums </strong>for better assistance. </p>

            <p>Two things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) what does outside the support boundary mean. &nbsp;Sounds like a bit of technotalk for we don't want to do it.</p>
<p>2) I got it working with another product. &nbsp;I won't tell you what it was as I have no doubt Microsoft would want that functionality removed from me.</p>

            As usual, I found a third party free solution to this problem. &nbsp;What a shame Microsoft doesn't support me for this kind of need. &nbsp;I'm all good now. &nbsp;As this is a windows community, I am choosing not to disclose the third party tool. &nbsp;

<h3> icedfate  say:</h3>
<h2>            0X000000FE bug usb driver blue screen error</h2>
                    <div>I looked at this site and searched and read all the Q and A on here and none of the "solutions" offered have worked for me</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I keep getting blue screen errors.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I built my computer 2 years ago. &nbsp;up until 2 months ago everything was fine when suddenly out of nowhere I started getting bsod errors again and again.</div>
<div>it would happen several times a day but with no consistency and apparently at random.</div>
<div>I always get error code bug usb driver</div>
<div>it always has this code too &nbsp;0X000000FE</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can leave the computer on for days and browse internet and I'm fine as long as I don't play games.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>it's always when I'm doing something video related.</div>
<div>sometimes it is a youtube video</div>
<div>sometimes it is a facebook game</div>
<div>usually its when I'm playing a game on steam</div>
<div>it happened while playing binding of isaac, space pirates and zombies, dungeon siege III, mass effect, plants vs zombies...all on steam</div>
<div>it has happened while watching youtube</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>it happened while playing marvel :ultimate alliance, gangs of boomtown on facebook</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>sometimes when it happens my computer wont beep and boot up until I unplug it then reseat the ram.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I thought it was the ram and I run memtest86 and it always comes up with no errors.</div>
<div>I run spybot seek and destroy, malwarebytes antimalware, &nbsp;ad aware, avast antivirus &nbsp; &nbsp;they all say my system is clean.</div>
<div>I updated the BIOS to the most recent version</div>
<div>my graphic drivers are fully updated</div>
<div>I tried the thing where I go in device manager and removed all the usb drivers and let the computer put them back in</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I thought it was my power supply and graphics card and I went and bought a new power supply and a new card and a new fan/heatsink for my cpu</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I installed them all and my computer ran beautiful for a month I was able to do anything I wanted, play steam games facebook videos and then I moved.</div>
<div>I was extra super careful moving my computer I padded it and carried it so gently and now its starting again.</div>
<div>right after plugging in my computer from moving it, the thing refused to start up, it would not start up until I removed both ram chips and then&nbsp;</div>
<div>I tried one and then the other and it only starts up with one of them but not the other and not when both of them are in there</div>
<div>I was running windows xp that I had not reinstalled for 2 years and apparently my old windows install disc&nbsp;</div>
<div>does not reecognize the partitions on a SATA drive so I now was forced to buy windows 7</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I bought windows 7 and did a clean install.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>on a fresh install, I'm still getting bsod bug usb driver 0X000000FE</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm wondering if its being caused by my wi-fi adapter</div>
<div>the only hardware change I made since moving was buying a netgear WMA3100 wifi adapter...most of the time my internet runs great with it at 144mbps&nbsp;</div>
<div>but whenever I get the bsod my driver for it becomes corrupted and I have to reinstall it</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I went on the netgear website and other users were getting bsod and I was directed to download the most up do date driver and I did so and it seems to give my</div>
<div>adapter better performance..when its working...but now I'm getting bsod more often than ever!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried using microsoft fixit and all it does it downloads a file..I doubleclick it, it opens a wizard and asks if I want to proceed</div>
<div>then I say yes and does not appear to do anything it just comes back with "your fix it has been processed" "tell us what you think"...I'll tell you what I think:</div>
<div>THAT PROGRAM IS A JOKE!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>piriform speccy monitors my temperatures..my cpu never goes above 20degrees</div>
<div>my graphic card never goes above 40degrees</div>
<div>motherboard always at 31 degrees</div>
<div>hard drive always at 31 degrees</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm out of ideas! I have been scouring the internet for an answer! &nbsp;the microsoft website claims code 0X000000FE has to do with sleep mode and only happens</div>
<div>when putting it to sleep or waking it up....that's totally not when its happening to me! I don't even use sleep mode!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>my system specs are&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>windows 7 home premium 64bit sp1</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>asus brand m4a785t-m motherboard with bios version 2302 (most up do date..I had to flash the bios)</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>a usb keyboard and a usb mouse brand name "engage" from office depot</div>

<div>both of them in there, I had to pull one out)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried just about every "fix" on the net and nothing has solved my problem!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>the only things I have not replaced are my motherboard and cpu and my hard drive and ram</div>

            <p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.<br />

            Auggy is very good at looking through dumpfiles and could well pin point the precise driver giving you grief. A complete list all your devices connecting to your USB ports might be helpful. Problems are often caused by devices like a web cam.

            <div>thanks for responding </div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm suspecting it has to do with my usb hub..I only have 3 devices connected to it, my keyboard, my mouse and my netgear wi-fi adapter.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>also</div>
thanks for responding but I can't find the minidump files.
<div><br />
<div>I downloaded bluescreenviewer but every time I get a blue screen and I open up bluescreen viewer there's nothing there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I read you need to use dumpchk.exe but I search for that and my computer does not have it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then read that I have to go download windows debugging tools and I found a link to the website but I don't know which one to download.</div>
<div><br />
<div>it has "<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/br259105" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Install Debugging Tools for Windows as part of the WDK</a>"</div>
<div>"<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852363" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Install Debugging Tools for Windows as part of the SDK</a>"</div>
<div><br />
<div>then it says</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>"If you do not want an entire kit (WDK or SDK), you can install the Debugging Tools as a standalone component from the Windows SDK. In the installation wizard, select&nbsp;<strong>Debugging Tools</strong>, and clear other components that you don’t want.</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>TO GET JUST DEBUGGING TOOLS</strong>: In the SDK installation wizard, select&nbsp;<strong>Debugging Tools</strong>, and clear other components that you don’t want.</p>

<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>and when I click them it brings me to another screen to download some kind of software development kit for windows 8 preview</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>WTF!</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>sorry but I'm really frustrated.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>also to add, &nbsp;I got another blue screen today but this time I got something different..</span></div>
<div><span>it said "MEMORY MANAGEMENT"</span></div>
<div><span>and the error code is 0x0000001A</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>and when my computer rebooted, my wifi adapter wouldn't connect to the internet and in device manager it said "device failed to start error code 10"</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I went in and uninstalled all the usb drivers except the one where my mouse is...I have a usb mouse and apparantly this motherboard only supports usb mouses..you can't even plug in the old kind of mouse with the pink plug into the mobo I have.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>my computer is up and running again but ..for how long..I dunno.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>just want to add..I'm not that computer savvy. &nbsp;I did manage to build this computer with my own hands and I know how to install a cpu and ram chips and fans and the mobo and etc...but I don't know how to diagnose problems and I don't understand most
 of the technical jargon people use on these websites</span></div>

            Case can you check the following?:
<p>&nbsp;Start &gt; type <em>view advanced system settings </em>in the "Search programs and files box" and press "Enter" &gt; then press "Settings" under "Startup and Recovery" &gt; then make sure "Kernel memory dump" is selected under "Write debugging information and "Overwrite
 any existing file" is also selected &gt; OK</p>
<p>With those settings both a kernel memory dump (%SystemRoot%\MEMORY.DMP) and small memory dump (located in %SystemRoot%\Minidump folder) should be created with each crash.</p>
<p>But sometimes these files, for various reasons, are not created.</p>
<p>Dump files can also get deleted if one uses cleaners as CCleaner.</p>
<p>For the Windows Debugging Tools you can use the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=8279" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=8279</a></p>
<p>When you run the&nbsp;installation for the "Installation Options" choose "Debugging Tools for Windows' only.</p>
<p>There is a good tutorial in the following link on using WinDbg;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/crash-lockup-debug-how/26584-configuring-debugging-tools.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/crash-lockup-debug-how/26584-configuring-debugging-tools.html</a></p>
<p>Also, it may help if you make available the following files:</p>
<p>Start &gt; type <em>msinfo32 </em>in the "Search programs and files" box and press "Enter" &gt; File &gt; Save &gt; then save as an .nfo file</p>
<p>Then make the resulting .nfo file&nbsp;available via Windows Live SkyDrive</p>
<p>Also, can you do the following:</p>
<p>Start &gt; type <em>eventvwr </em>in the "Search programs and files" box and press "Enter" &gt; expand "Custom Views" and then right-click "Administrative Events" &gt; select "Save all events in Custom View As" and save as an .evtx file</p>
<p>Then make the resulting .evtx file available via Windows Live SkyDrive</p>

            okay..well I went into skydrive and that in itself is kind of baffling. &nbsp;I found a folder in there called "public" and it says "shared with everyone" and I made the .nfo file and the .evtx file and I dragged them into the folder.
<div>I'm not sure how you are gonna get into my skydrive or if I have to provide some sort of link. hopefully you can find the files I made.</div>
<div>in my eventvwr I dont understand any of the messages but there are 477 bad "error" events dating back from today back to 3-29-2012 which is when I did my clean install of windows 7<br />
<div><br />
<div>still have not figured out how to find my minidump.</div>
<div>I went in and changed it to "kernel memory dump"&nbsp;</div>
<div>I clicked your download link and downloaded the SDK thing and went into the installer and unchecked everything except the one that says "debugging tools" and installed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I do have CCleaner but I have not used it.</div>
<div>the last 2 days my computer has crashed 3 times and I'm not getting the blue screen..but its acting the same way as when it usually gets the blue screen its just not showing the blue screen anymore.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I realize some of this is redundant info that I probably already said before, I have not gone back to see what I'm repeating so I'm just gonna type in again...sorry if I'm repeating myself.</div>
<div><br />
<div>it happened once while on facebook playing facebook games and I opened up multiple tabs and suddenly BAM..</div>
<div><br />
<div>it happened once while I had a facebook game going and I walked away to use the restroom and when I came back there was an error popup window I had never seen before and I clicked "ok" and BAM..</div>
<div><br />
<div>today I was playing the same game and I&nbsp;accidentally&nbsp;clicked a third button on the side of my mouse that usually acts as a "back" button for the browser and the instant my finger slipped and pressed it...BAM..</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can watch videos on netflix flawlessly.</div>
<div>I can&nbsp;browse&nbsp;the internet, post on forums</div>
<div>go shopping and whatnot</div>
<div>I can look at ebay</div>
<div>I can look at webcomics etc...</div>
<div>it only seems to happen when I'm playing facebook games, when I'm playing games on Steam, or watching youtube.</div>
<div><br />
<div>and each time, my WPA3100 netgear adapter&nbsp;fails&nbsp;to start up when my computer reboots and I have to uninstall the drivers and&nbsp;re-install&nbsp;them to get back online.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried it in every one of my 6 usb ports and the same thing keeps happening.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'll probably have to pay so professional to dignose it but I was hoping maybe I can get to the bottom of this here.</div>

            just thought I should add...
<div>I couldnt figure out which one to click and I installed the entire SDK package (1GB of stuff I'm never gonna use..whatever..I have a terabyte hard drive)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I now have something called WinDbg.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I used the tutorial and I typed in that thing to "set my symbol path" and whatnot.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I went into my startup and recovery</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have kernel dump set.</div>
<div>the file path is %SystemRoot%\Minidump</div>
<div>it was&nbsp;%SystemRoot%\Memory.dmp</div>
<div>but I changed it to&nbsp;%SystemRoot%\Minidump because other resources said to do that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>bluescreenviewer can't find a .dmp file</div>
<div>I cant find one through winDbg</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I think my computer is not even generating .dmp files</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm searching internet and other people have had this problem</div>
<div><br />
<div>one user said to open cmd prompt and type in this&nbsp;<b>dir /S *.dmp</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><span>and I did that and it says :</span></div>
<div><span>volume in drive C has no label</span></div>

            I dunno if this is right...I go into live drive and opened my public folder and this is the link
<div><br />
<div><a href="https://skydrive.live.com/#cid=EF1335E471FC66E4&amp;id=EF1335E471FC66E4%21103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/#cid=EF1335E471FC66E4&amp;id=EF1335E471FC66E4%21103</a>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I have no idea what the "paging file" is.....</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>also, it just happened again an hour ago.</div>
<div>I had unchecked the box that says "automatic restart" and the blue screen came up again with bug usb driver error code 0x000000fe</div>
<div><br />
<div>and then there was a counter at the bottom that counted up from 1 to 100% "creating" dump files.</div>
<div>then it said "dump file successfully create" or something like that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>then since there was no automatic restart, I had to shut down my computer pushing the button and restart it and I looked everywhere for the dump file and can't find it. I go on forums trying to find out how to find it and I tried what they said and it
 wont work, I can't find the dump file.</div>

            <p>According to the Event Viewer several different stop errors have occurred over the last few days such as BUGCODE_USB_DRIVER, MEMORY_MANAGEMENT, SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M, SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION and KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED.</p>
<p>You can check these codes in the following link for more info on the errors:</p>

<p>These errors would indicate a hardware problem.</p>
<p>Also, in the Event Viewer was the occurrence of the following error:</p>
<p><em>Event 21,&nbsp; WHEA-Logger</em></p>
<p><em>A corrected hardware error has occurred.</em></p>
<p><em>Component: AMD Northbridge<br />
Error Source: Machine Check Exception<br />
Error Type: 14<br />
Processor ID: 0</em></p>
<p>This error&nbsp;may further indicate a hardware problem.</p>

            hi, I came back here just now to see if there was further answers. thanks for responding.
<div><br />
<div>most forums I've been on where I read psts of other people having this problem seem to have left me hanging with no closure, the people experiencing the problems just stopped posting and never said if the problem was solved or not, I don't want to do that
 here </div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I still haven't figured it out but I did try one thing.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>in one of the forums, a user stated that they solved the problem by getting rid of their wna3100 netgear adapter and putting in a cisco linksys adapter.</div>
<div>luckily, the store I bought the netgear adapter from allowed me to exchange it and now I have the linksys AE2500.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have not had a bluescreen error since putting it in but for now the situation is inconclusive.</div>
<div>I have not yet put my computer through the paces, I have not attempted to "cause" another bluescreen I'm just gonna keep doing what I normally do and hope another bsod does not appear.</div>
<div>I won't have peace of mind until I go for an extended period of time without one.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>now, as to your prognosis that its a "hardware problem"...this is what I suspected but that's kind of vague isn't it?</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I do know that when this originally started happening I had a 500 watt power supply and a radeon hd4650 graphics card.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I upgraded those 2 hardware components and bought a really nice heatsink for my cpu to replace the stock one.</div>
<div><br />
<div>the problem stopped for a month I was able to do everything again...the problems did not start up again until I moved. &nbsp;the ram chip didn't go bad until I moved.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm confused why the computer was perfectly fine and then all I did was move the computer to another apartment in the same complex I was already living in and bam..it goes bad.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was so careful...I put all this padding on the computer and wrapped it in blankets so it wouldn't get knocked around and then I put it on a furniture dolly and wheeled it up the sidewalk to the new place..I was certainly more gentle with it than I had
 ever been before.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I'm clicking the 2 links you provided, the second one from sevenforums.com I've actually already been on that one and tried just about everything on that list.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I havent attempted to replace every bit of hardware just the power supply and the graphics card..but there aren't that many pieces left..</div>
<div><br />
<div>there's the ram, the mobo and the cpu and the harddrive....as far as I can remember from when I built the thing.</div>
<div>I'm pretty sure it's not the hard drive.</div>
<div>so that leaves the ram, the motherboard and the cpu.</div>
<div>I don't know how topull out a cpu chip once it's been put in there.</div>
<div>I'm worried to spend money on new ram but I would like to have my 4 gigs back especially since I now have windows 7 which will actually recognize all 4 gigs instead of just 3.2 which my xp did</div>
<div><br />
<div>if its the mobo then that pretty much means I have to buy a new &nbsp;motherboard, ram and a new cpu..</div>
<div><br />
<div>so there...I pretty much just scrapped my old computer after 2 years and built a whole new one.</div>
<div><br />
<div>this seems odd..shouldn't a computer have a longer life span than 2 years?</div>
<div>I'm not talking&nbsp;obsolescence&nbsp;here I just mean ..is it odd for a comp to literally fall apart after only 2 years?!</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>it is possible that buying the linksys adapter solved my problem as it solved another person's problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>the first link you provided seems a bit more complex and I have to dig through that to try and understand it so I'll comment on that when I'm done</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Audio passthrough on xbox one s controller windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to get audio through my Xbox one s controllers audio jack, this is connected over USB to a windows 10 laptop.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is not coming up as an audio device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The controller works fine in all other areas and I can use for games etc.</p>
<p>I am looking to be able to plug my headset in to get the same headset experience as I would on my xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope this makes sense,</p>
<p>
</p><p>so far I have reinstalled my soundcard drivers, uninstalled the native "fast charge" utility from asus and tried updating my controllers firmware to no avail.</p>
<p>I am running the latest version of windows 10 and no updates are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Robert</p>

<p>Alright, seems like your controller and headset are fine then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First up, have you restarted the PC? Probably an obvious answer, but sometimes it gets forgotten. Restart your PC, if you haven't already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to be clear, when you say it's not picking up, are you looking in Control Panel &gt; Sound &gt; Playback? And it's not listed there? Be sure to right-click the background here, show disabled and disconnected devices, just to be sure.</p>
<p>If it does show up here, make sure it is set as the default device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failing that, right-click Start button (or press Windows+X) &gt; Device Manager<br />
Look under Sound, video, and game controllers. See if Xbox Controller is listed there, and if it is, check that it's not disabled (it would have a small down arrow). If it isn't, right click it, and Uninstall device.</p>
<p>Then, look under Xbox Peripherals. Xbox One Controller should be listed here. Do the same thing, right-click and Uninstall.</p>
<p>Then, unplug your controller, and plug it back in (with the headset connected). It should take a minute to set up. See if that resolves the issue.</p>

<h2>            App Store Doesn&#39;t Have The Most Popular Apps</h2>
                    I have a windows Surface tablet, and the only apps downloaded from the store that&nbsp;I use are Netflix, Twitter&nbsp;and Hulu. The windows store doesn't have
<strong>any</strong> of the most popular and basic apps that people use like Kik, Instagram, Snapchat, Let, Pandora, YouTube (etc.) It's highly annoying because those are some of the apps I use the most. And the alternatives suck. I don't wasn't Snapper, I
 wan't snapchat. I feel like buying this is a waste of money if I can't use any apps.

            You can just use the youtube website that has all the features. And about complaining: You should go complain to the companies that don't make their apps for windows. They're the responsible ones.

<h3> oarmatt  say:</h3>
<h2>            sign-in status changed - xbox one</h2>
                    <p>So I am playing the backwards compatible BO2 zombies and about 10mins in to a game, it kicks me out saying that my sign-in status changed. This only happens when I play a custom game in zombies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Multiplayer works fine!</p>



<p>I do not have control over my router or NAT type unfortunately due to&nbsp;my ISP giving me a private address. It is strict on the xbox, but Moderate in zombies.&nbsp;Will this basically mean I cannot play zombies with friends?&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a test, my father was able to play using my account and his NAT type was Moderate in zombies, but open on his xbox one.</p>



<p>Only other thing I can think of is geo-location blocking? I live between the UK and Philippines and this is the first time I&nbsp;have brought my xbox with me to Philippines (thus my IP address is Philippines).</p>



<p>Any help/ insight appreciated!</p>

<p>I notice that when I go to check on system restore points created, there are two drives</p>

<p>This&nbsp; is how it shows under system restore</p>

"Create restorepoints on the selected disk/Drive"<br />
C&nbsp; Drive has a check meaning restore points w ill be created<br />
D Drive/Recovery Drive does NOT have a check, meaning NO restore points wll be created<br />
<br />
Is this how it should look? That Recovery drive should NOT have restore points created?</p>

            That's OK.&nbsp; The Recovery Drive doesn't change when you use your computer, so it doesn't need restore points.&nbsp; That drive was installed at the factory, and its purpose is to restore the computer to the way that it was when it was new.

<h2>            My cursor is spazzing&#58; Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes when I try to type on my computer, my cursor starts moving all over the place without me touching my touhpad/computer. &nbsp;It will highlight random things, flick all across my screen, and click things that I don't want it to click. &nbsp;Even when I completely
 remove my hands from my computer, the cursor will continue moving as if there is someone else on my computer (although I am pretty sure I haven't been hacked, the movements aren't usually

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
It seemed that the magnetism of the touch pad has become too sensitive. You are right that it is possible for some tiny foreign objects to be responsible with the randomized clicks and movements of the cursor. This is a sign that the touch pad will need a little
 physical maintenance, which is a little complex and without a professional approach, the machine might be at risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you on your observation, you can turn off the touch pad on your laptop by pressing the designated hot-key and check if the cursor will still move. It is usually by pressing
<strong><em>Fn</em></strong><em> key</em> + <em>another F1 -12 key</em>, depending on how the unit was designed by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is best to consult the computer manufacturer's <em>nearest service center</em> in order to obtain the best assistance for physical maintenance.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Feel free to update us about any results.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate the update. There are some angles that we can consider when our files get lost specially that you've kept track of the locations on where it should be. That being said, one of the many possibilities would be a corrupted file that was detected
 by the system and was removed, or a file that was identified as an infected data that got quarantined. Mainly updating your Windows would be securing the integrity of your system and also fortify features that you might have troubles with. There are cases
 that some files get <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/14201/windows-show-hidden-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">hidden</a></strong>. And if in case that all files are not hidden, we advise that you scan your computer for any
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_other-protect_scanning-windows_other/list-of-malware-removal-tools/d824b9af-ebd8-4c47-94e2-8ee6c544c100">possible infections</a></strong> on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned on the previous post, you can perform the troubleshooting in <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12386/windows-10-find-lost-files-after-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">retrieving lost files on your system</a></strong> specially if your computer came from an upgrade. In the event that you are not
 able to retrieve your files, it would be best to have your concern consulted to the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14148/computer-manufacturers-contact-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">manufacturer of your computer</a></strong> to know what file retrieval program can they suggest as we don't have any
 specific program available yet. It is best advised though to prevent any file lost in the future to

 I lost thousands of pictures. I just wanted you to know that you're not alone.&nbsp;

<p>Well, Microsoft has done it again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;My pictures and files had also disappeared.&nbsp; Ends up that the update tries to move your default storage to Microsoft Onedrive even though the user hasn't changed the default storage location.&nbsp; The files
 were still in my C:/users/(useraccount)/pictures&nbsp; documents, etc but wouldn't show up in the MY PC/pictures documents, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got tipped off when I started receiving notices that my Onedrive was full and I hadn't put any files in it.&nbsp; I uninstalled Onedrive and all of my files are back where they belong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish Microsoft would give us a choice instead of forcing this kind of change on a user and then forcing us to have to "fix" what wasn't broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if I could just get the system to keep changing the default .pdf reader back to Edge all the time!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

    <title>Denied Permission Access to Restored Files from Backup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pm_47th  say:</h3>
<h2>            Denied Permission Access to Restored Files from Backup</h2>
                    <p>After buying a new computer&nbsp;installed with Windows 10, I restored my backup files from a Western Digital backup drive to my new hard drive in the Documents folder.</p>
<p>Most of these documents are not accessible to me, and I have to go into the Properties/Security/Advanced/Permissions to add my User name to the list.</p>
<p>This has worked for the small number of files that I have tried this on, but now I need a fix for the thousands of files in the backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read in an online forum that saving the backup to the Desktop and then moving the files to other folders would work to establish the permissions, but am concerned about the impact on the Desktop folder handling all of this file management.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there a best practice solution for establishing a mass permission change to a large number of files?</p>

<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community and Thank you for posting your query.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Are you facing this issue in local account or Microsoft account?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I see that you have tried many suggestions to correct your issue of access denied while trying to access the files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>What account are you logging on with when trying to access the file? </p>
<p>You need to be sure you are logging on with an Administrator account.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the information helps. Do reply if you need further assistance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

            <p>You should be working with the Permissions of the highest level folder(s) that you can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the folder's <strong>Properties</strong> dialog -&gt; <strong>Security</strong> tab -&gt;
<strong>Advanced</strong> button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give both the Administrators group &amp; your User <strong>Full</strong> <strong>Control</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you want to check the
<strong>Inheritance</strong> button:&nbsp; If it says <strong>Disable Inheritance</strong>, leave it alone.&nbsp; If it says
<strong>Enable Inheritance</strong>, click it.&nbsp; Then be sure to <em>check the box</em> labeled
<strong>'Replace all child object permissions with inheritable permission entries from this object'</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I am logging in to a local account, and it is an administrator level privilege.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instructions for inheriting permissions, confirmed full control for both administrators and myself, the button said Disable Inheritance (so I left it alone), and I checked the box for child objects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows responded with this error message:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ac579fe-1f4d-4d25-9c8f-fdfdde234101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ac579fe-1f4d-4d25-9c8f-fdfdde234101" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I hit continue, it moves to the next photo, and displays the same message, and so on until I hit cancel, at which point it warns me that there may have been an inconsistent application of permissions if I quit early.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any thoughts about what could be causing this situation?</p>

            <p>I think that you have exceeded my limited IT knowledge with that question (it wouldn't take much to do that!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suffice it to say that the only thing that I have done is 1) bought a new PC, 2) restored files from a Western Digital backup drive, and 3) found that I could not open files that I had restored due to lack of permission rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get permission to each file individually by using a method similar to what you suggested:&nbsp; Properties/Security/Advanced and adding my name as a Principal in the list along with System and Administrators.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But I cannot do this for a group of files or a folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the Security tab, it says that I "must have Read permissions to view the properties of this object"</p>
<p>It also lists "Owner:&nbsp; Unable to display current owner"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that imply that there is an ownership problem, and that I need to globally take ownership of the files somehow?</p>

            <p>well Keith, you have helped to make progress in solving this problem.</p>
<p>I was able to change the ownership of a folder, and once&nbsp;I have done that, it will allow me to use the "replace child object permissions..." for that folder, as you suggested.</p>
<p>It still won't work for the entire group of folders (in this case, I tried selecting the Pictures folder, assigning ownership, and making the permission changes globally, but I got the same "enumerated objects" error).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But when I follow the procedure folder by folder, it works just fine, and gives me access to the files in that folder.</p>
<p>So unless there is another trick for changing multiple folders,&nbsp;i think that i should declare victory and get to work on changing those folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sincerely appreciate your persistence in answering my many questions about this problem, and offering appropriate solutions for the problems that I described.</p>

            <p>
</p><p>Hi, Paul</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having the same exact problem as you did. Bought a new PC (Dell - Windows 10). Downloaded files from old computer (HP - Windows7) using WD Passport Ultra. Now I am unable to open my documents because I do not have permission! I also haven't been able
 to "move"&nbsp;my documents file&nbsp;from the backup folder on my desktop to list them under "My PC".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needles to say, I'm sure you can tell that I am not very tech-savvy. I even had to have WD talk me thru the transfer process. (And am considering calling them to help me now, even though I don't really think it is their problem. But, calling Microsoft for
 help is a waste of time.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... when I try to do what you suggest, I can get to the Advanced section and it says Owner = "Administrators (DESKTOP-LNPHEC0\Administrators". If I click on "CHANGE", it tells me to "Select User Group" and then I am lost. It does not give an option
 to "Change owner on all child objects"... whatever the heck that means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you or anyone can help me out with really easy to follow instructions, I'd so appreciate it. This new computer setup has been a nightmare for me. Difficulties after difficulties. I just don't understand why it all has to be so complicated!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustrated and confused! Melanie</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS - Also... when I go to my transferred Pictures, all I get are icons and I cannot figure out how to have the actual picture there as it was before I transferred them!</p>

            <p>Hi Melanie,</p>
<p>it is a pretty confusing process, and it took me a while to work my way through it, with the help of some folks on this community forum.</p>
<p>You got yourself most of the way there.</p>
<p>Once you have the box open for "Select User or Group", go to the box which says "Enter the object name to select".</p>
<p>In this box, I put in my Log On name that I use when starting up my computer, so yours might be Melanie or Home or whatever username you have when it asks you for your password when starting up the computer.</p>
<p>I put this username in the box, and hit the "Check Names" button on the right of the box.</p>
<p>this should fill in the full user name that the computer is looking for, and then you can hit the "OK" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this will bring you back to the "Advanced Security Settings" screen, and you should see your username in the Owner:&nbsp;line near the top of the box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you will go to the bottom of the box, and you will see a check box which says "replace all child object permission entries with inheritable permission entries from this object".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>you will check this, hit the Apply button, and then OK.</p>
<p>(Refer to the graphic that Keith provided in the response chain for this topic.&nbsp; he circled the box to check with red line)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you get past the problem, and get access to your files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you do this for your picture folders, it should show the photo icons like you are used to seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your speedy reply. Confusing is not the word for it! I don't understand how Microsoft makes things so difficult for the casual user (which I am)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... I am still not able to get this fixed. Under <strong>Sharing</strong>, I have listed
<strong>Everyone</strong> (read/write permission level)&nbsp;and <strong>my name (my email)</strong> (owner). When I go to
<strong>Security</strong>, then <strong>Advanced</strong>, it lists Everyone, SYSTEM, Administrators (DESKTOP-</p>
<p>LNPHE0\Administrators), and then&nbsp;my name (my email) - all with Full Control. It also reads
<strong>Disable inheritance</strong>. But when I click the <strong>Replace all child...</strong>, I get the same error&nbsp;message that you got!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Sorry - can't figure out how to&nbsp;take a screen capture. Tried Windows + Print Screen and Alt + PS. Another call to Dell.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also unable to move "My Documents" from my desktop backup folder to the "My Documents" in "this PC.&nbsp; I am "not allowed " to do this either!</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am able to access My Pictures that I transferred. All the settings within Properties seem to be the same. However, the actual pictures do not show up with in the file. Rather a blue and whit icon with a mountain that I have to click to open the
 photo. Needless to say, that's a problem, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So frustrating...</p>

                    <p>I know there are multiple discussions about this particular issue but I want to add to this in the hopes Microsoft pushes an update if that's whats needed at this time. I have done all the normal fix actions (Superfetch, BIT, Notifications, other things),
 to no prevail. I have read that it could ave been the most recent Windows update but I haven't seen anything from official sources to back that up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started randomly around 10:30PM EST last night. Before then it was working perfectly fine. I downloaded Malwarebytes and ran the test multiple times throughout my troubleshooting journey but it did nothing nor found nothing. I Also changed my paging file
 to the system managed size ( 16GB RAM installed).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has a technical explanation for this I would be interested to hear about it. I'm an IT guy so this process intrigues me regardless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*I hope the official fix is an update pushed by Microsoft</p>

            I'm not familiar with "ISAM" but it apparently needs to access the hardware directly. Unlike in DOS/Win9x/ME, this is not permitted in NT-based operating systems such as XP, Vista, or Windows 7. There is no workaround.

Examples of partitioning layout include MBR (BIOS) and GPT (UEFI). In this article, we show you several ways to create a bootable copy of Windows 10 from an ISO file.

<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft

<p>Does your hard drive still work or is it dead?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it still works, you can make an image backup of the drive and restore the image to your new hard drive. This is a common procedure so hard drive manufacturers will usually include the software and instructions to do the job right. This doesn't take long;
 in less than an hour you can be back at work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the hard drive no longer works, you're going to have to start from scratch, as Andre describes. In that case I hope you have a recent backup of your own personal files.</p>

    <title>Bluetooth File Transfer with iPhone &#40;or Android&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shadowsports  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth File Transfer with iPhone &#40;or Android&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am testing all of the hardware on my SP2.&nbsp; Has anyone successfully performed a file transfer (picture or .doc) between the SP2 and their iPhone?&nbsp;&nbsp;(or Android)&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have an iPhone.&nbsp;<strong> Paring the devices was no problem.</strong>&nbsp; They&nbsp;both see each other and stay connected, but file&nbsp;transfers fail when initiated from the SP2.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have not found a way&nbsp;to initiate a BT transfer from the phone yet (which is running iOS 7.0.3) via AirDrop or other.&nbsp; Going to hit the Apple forums next.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm satisfied that the BT&nbsp;hardware on&nbsp;my SP2 is working and this was&nbsp;the primary reason for performing this test, but I'd appreciate hearing from others who have also tried and what&nbsp;the outcome was?</p>
<p><br />
</p>

There really is no easy magic here as either your equipment does support it and is properly working or it doesn't.

Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance. </blockquote>
Many thanks for your response. I have taken your advice and tried everything regarding my problem. Today I found out that my computer C50-C satellite does not have the hardware to allow Miracast. I feel somewhat embarrassed about this issue because it now appears
 that I was wanting something to happen when in fact the hardware in this computer is not built to provide same.

            Well you can try adding Miracast with an add-on USB Adapter. Check with your local computer shop.

                    My Aunt has Windows Vista on her computer and every time she tries to open up a pdf file Windows Media Center opens. Is there a way to get Windows Vista to point to Acrobat Reader to open the file or does she have to go to AR directly? Thank you for any

<h2>            What file holds the Contact list please&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My windows 8.1 user profile became corrupted, so I had to 'clone' a new user account, including LiveMail. I use LiveMail for POP3 only and do NOT use the website or have a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of the profile corruption I was not able to 'export' from my 'old' LiveMail. Fortunately I was able to copy the folder with all my folders etc to the 'new' account and LiveMail can access all my folders and accounts &lt;phew&gt;. However the Contacts have
 disappeared!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In what folders/files would the Contacts list have been held please? As I still have the 'old' user profile files, hopefully I can recover from that, but I need to know what to look for!</p>

<p>Windows Live Contacts are stored in databases. You claim not to have a Microsoft Account, but that can't be true, because you can't post at this site without one ...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The database containing your contacts is&nbsp;a folder called <strong>DB</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>tore</strong> at this location:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>C:\Users\</strong>{user}<strong>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live\Contacts\Default</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>There may be several folders; it depends on which version of the program is installed which one is the current one.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>As I still have the 'old' user profile files, hopefully I can recover from that, but I need to know what to look for!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no provision in Windows Live Mail for recovering the default contacts list unless you backed it up by exporting. The program makes available a perfectly seamless backup arrangement for contacts and calendars which requires no user configuration
 at all. All you have to do is to sign in in Windows Live Mail with a Microsoft Account. If you choose not to do this, then I'm afraid you only have yourself to blame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be able to recover your default contacts list by copying the current DBStore folder to exactly the same location in the new user profile, but there's no guarantee that it will work.</p>
