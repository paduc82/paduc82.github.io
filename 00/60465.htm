            <p>Hi Cheryl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the error code 0x800CCC90, this means that Windows Live Mail&nbsp;received an invalid response from the&nbsp;POP3 server. This could be an issue with your mail server or with the mail client itself. For us to properly address the issue, allow us to verify
 additional details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How long have you been having this concern? Prior to it happening, did you do any updates to your Live Mail account? What is the OS ( Operating System) of your computer? Can you also send us a screenshot of the page with the error message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<h2>            People claiming to be Xbox Live Admins, How do you really know&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>To protect the innocent I'm not going to mention gamer tags yet but what I would really like to know is how do you really know if someone is an Xbox live admin. &nbsp;The reason I ask is I've played with some certain people that have claimed this and spout off
 some what I consider rediculous claims but then also seem to have magical powers.</p>
<p>So is there a way to tell. &nbsp;I'm not looking to gain anything out of this I just want to know and feel that if they are not real admins they should be dealt with.</p>
<p>One example of a claim is that they have a Xbox One Dev system but they are playing COD Black Ops II on it, I find that very hard to believe.</p>
<p>Another example of a magical power is that they some how arranged a public hard core lobby where only their friends and friends of friends joined. &nbsp;The so called admins went into a lobby and then after some time they magically had a lobby of just friends
 and friends of friends. &nbsp;My guess is they went into a lobby and claimed to be admins and got everyone to leave the public lobby.</p>
<p>Anyways I'd really like to know if there is a way to confirm they are real admins.</p>

<p>Any "admins" you meet playing call of duty are without any doubt,lying.</p>
<p>[/quote]This right here.&nbsp; The biggest difference between real admins and those stating that they are?&nbsp; Real admins will NEVER warn you that they will ban you, they will do it out right.&nbsp; They don't send out warnings, or anything of the like.&nbsp; If you are
 breaking the Terms of Use or Code of Conduct they will ban you.<br />
<br />
Also it is worth noting that if people state that they are MS employees when in fact they are not, they will get a permanent ban from MS.</p>

<br />Microsoft takes seriously its commitments to protect and maintain the privacy of its customer data and empowers its customers to implement and use our services in a protected manner. Unfortunately, technical support scams have become all too common across the industry, affecting consumers worldwide. Customers, family, friends and Microsoft employees are receiving unsolicited phones calls and pop-up advertisement from fraudsters claiming to be from a reputable company or a partner of Microsoft.
<br />
<br />Report a technical support scam here:

                    <p>hi all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>its a big ask</p>

<p>I have a bunch of contacts who are nothing to do with social media and I would like to select from them when I create an email in the email app...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for choosing Windows 8. As I understand, you need help in importing the contacts to people app. I will surely help you to find a resolution regarding the issue.
<div><strong>To add contacts one at a time<br />
</strong></div>
<div>1. On Start, tap or click People. <br />
<br />
2. Swipe up from the bottom edge.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, right-click within the app.)<br />
<br />
3. Tap or click New contact. <br />
<br />
4. Enter the info you want for this contact, and then tap or click Save.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you want to add several contacts at once, you can import them into one of your other accounts, and they’ll appear in the People app the next time it syncs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the question is how to import directly into a people app... not how do I add one at a time nor import into other accounts...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the link you provide is equally useless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you think I am being critical then I would agree, I expect much better comprehensive support... such as what I give...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>for example...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>no you cannot import directly into the People app but we will forward your suggestion to the development team because that is a good idea... in the meantime you can import into Outlook 365 as follows using the following format.... then when the people app
 syncs with Outlook 365 your contacts will be synced....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is that too hard???</p>

            <p>Hi George,</p>
<p>The "useless" link that Winston&nbsp;gave you&nbsp;actually had the answer you were looking for.&nbsp; You weren't specific about where your contacts are currently stored so let's say you use Gmail:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open&nbsp;the <strong>People</strong>&nbsp;app.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<span><strong>Settings</strong></span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<span>Settings</span>.)</span> </p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click&nbsp;<strong>Accounts</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span><strong>Add an account</strong></span>, select the type of account you want to add (like Google), and fill in your login info.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use another less-known contacts manager, then be more specific in your post and let the community help you and be nice! :)</p>

            Hi Drummerego,<br />
<br />
Yes I suppose I wasn't being very nice... and critical ... and I phrased my question poorly which deserves the 'wrong' answers... I incorrectly assumed that the magic word import might let everyone know what I was after...<br />
<br />
The question should have been phrased as follows:<br />
<br />
I am aware that if I add an account into the people app such as an Outlook account or Gmail or Hotmail account that my contacts are synced in. However I have an account which isnt on the 'normal' list, Thunderbird mail, and I do not wish to add these one by
 one but would prefer to export them from Thunderbird and import them here.<br />
<br />
I have spent a long time searching, using google, for an answer to this problem and drawn a blank. As far as I can tell there are no import facilities available in the People app - can anyone confirm this or offer me a solution to this problem.<br />
<br />
I have only come up with two solutions so far, is there a better approach for anyone else reading this thread or having similar problems:<br />
<br />
1. Create an Outlook.com account and forward all your email to that account and add that account<br />
2. If you intend to use Office 365, as I am, then you can import your contacts there, but you need to know what the import format is so that you can export correctly from Thunderbird, and I obtained that information here -
<a href="http://http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_home-outlook/what-is-the-format-of-contacts-for-office-365/a7b71572-1f0f-4150-a748-15d0e9bee80d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
Solution 1 is the simplest BUT when you reply the reply will be from the outlook.com account which you cannot change and may confuse people... for example I have two mail accounts say *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy *** both forwarded to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. All
 replies will come from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this describes my issues and concerns....<br />
<br />
You know, I like the simplicity of the Mail app and its excellent integration with People and Calendar app... and its junk filter capabilities ....but .... look at Outlook.com and Office 365, their mail functionality is so much better ... why on earth did MS
 create THREE different mail apps???<br />

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 1803. About a month ago Windows Defender Firewall would not start. It would say that it wasn't using the recommended settings. When I would try changing them I would get this error: Windows Defender Firewall can't change some of your
 settings. Error code 0x800706d9. Then I looked at the event log and got the message in the Subject line. I've try many things at this point with no success. Any idea what file might be missing, or what I should do?</p>

    <title>Upgrade from Windows &#38; Starter to Windows Home Premium - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Upgrade from Windows &#38; Starter to Windows Home Premium</h2>
                    <p>Hi. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 7 Starter running on an old Sony Vaio Notebook (VPCW12S1E). I want to upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium but am having great difficulty finding out what I need to buy to do this successfully. Any help will be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have missed the boat with free Anytime Upgrade, but cannot even acquire Home Premium via the 'Anytime Upgrade' option on my PC. The link will take me to the Microsoft.com site for IOS download to USB but that site will not accept the Product Key for my
 pre-installed Sony licence (tells me to contact my PC merchant). Sony Support do not offer this upgrade any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked on the www for the right product to buy but the descriptions are mystifying and non specify exactly what I need to buy to go from Starter to Home Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Microsoft Support to try to find an answer. However, because Windows 7 is no longer supported all the tech could tell me was that I need to buy a 'Windows Anytime Upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help please? I would prefer not to have to make a clean install of Windows 7 Home Premium but will be happy to do that if it is the only option. Or can anyone tell me where I can buy the 'Windows Anytime Upgrade to Home Premium' that has been
 mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You :-)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anytime upgrade&nbsp; is no longer in stock and what few are available cost $300.00 or more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You only option is to purchase an OEM / System builder version of Windows 7 Home Premium which requires a "Clean" install. A check at both Amazon and Newegg indicates "Out of stock" also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your only choice currently is the 64Bit&nbsp;Professional version an you need to check that your Sony Notebook meets the requirement for a 64Bit version and Sony has the necessary&nbsp; 64Bit Device Drivers for your model number.</p>

</p><p>Just after making my post last night I found, on a UK site, an unused Microsoft Windows Anytime Upgrade from Windows 7 Starter to Home Premium. I have ordered that and will keep my fingers crossed that I can use it. From your comments regarding OEM versions,
 I am a little concerned that it will not let me upgrade from the OEM Starter that was pre-installed on my notebook when I bought it (many years ago!). But, it will be worth trying as a first step and I can always call Microsoft Support for help as that was
 the fix mentioned by their agent and I kept the Case No. for the discussion.</p>

Subsection: What do I do if I purchased a Windows Anytime Upgrade key card package, but there's no upgrade key inside?<br />
Answer: If you purchased an upgrade key card package and the upgrade key isn't inside, review the package instructions carefully. You might need to go online to retrieve your upgrade key using the PIN that's included in the package.</p>
<p><br />

<p><br />
To start the upgrade process:<br />
Click Start/Search and enter the words:&nbsp;&nbsp; Anytime upgrade<br />
Next in the list of displayed results, click on 'Windows Anytime Upgrade'.<br />

 is empty. Can you help?

            <p>Hi Calvinius, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since its a issue with the in-built hardware, there is nothing that can be done from a operating system point of view. You can contact a local computer technician in order to get the issue resolved.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you. I appreciate your interest in Windows 10.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If we see the screen flickering after sign-in there are two possible causes.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
This could be because of apps causing Explorer to crash, or display driver issues.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Press <strong>Windows </strong>logo<strong>&nbsp;+X </strong></span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Command Prompt admin</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Type <strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong><br />
<strong>sfc </strong><strong>/scannow </strong>(notice the space between sfc and "/")</span></li><li><span>Reboot PC.&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p><span>We have reports that removing these apps help resolve the issue: </span>
</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Norton Antivirus </span></li><li><span>Other AV solutions </span></li><li><span>iCloud </span></li><li><span>IDT Audio (faulting module IDTNC64.cpl)</span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span>If Task Manager is flickering, or it didn’t open, proceed with display driver troubleshooting:</span></strong><span><br />
The likely cause is a display driver or display hardware issue. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
Disable built-in graphics, if still flickers, try with only the other chipset enabled.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>If this does not work, or there is only a single chipset, uninstall the
<br />
device and remove the driver software. </span></li><li><span>Then boot into Windows and update the drivers to the latest from the <br />
manufacturer.&nbsp;</span><span> </span></li></ol>
<p><span>Refer to this link: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/find-install-display-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/find-install-display-drivers</a>

    <title>Laptop Dual Graphics Card 1709 Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harpojarvey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop Dual Graphics Card 1709 Issue</h2>
                    <p>Posting here again in the hope of getting some resolution to one of many actual Windows 1709 issues. Here are my specs:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>GTX 1070</span></li><li><span>i7-7700HQ (Intel HD Graphics 630)</span></li><li><span>16gb DDR4</span></li><li><span>Samsung 950 PRO 512gb</span></li><li><span>2x Samsung 850 EVO 1tb</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is the system seems to lock up (mouse stops moving, programs will temporarily freeze) when engaging the dedicated GPU. One example where this happens 100% of the time is when I right click the desktop, the mouse and other programs will freeze
 until the context menu comes up, because for some reason I guess that uses the dedicated GPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am completely sure this is the issue because if I have something running that makes use of the dedicated GTX 1070, the problem goes away. So for example if I have a program running that uses it, or have an external monitor connected (which are outputted
 by the 1070, thus keeping it active) right clicking the desktop will just bring up the context menu without locking up the PC or mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although keeping the dedicated graphics card always active fixes the issue, it isn't an acceptable solution on a laptop because it uses a lot more power than just the integrated Intel HD Graphics. This was fixed on 1703 so I don't know why the issue would
 have returned with 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found a bunch of posts about this exact issue:</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/micro-stutters-when-i-right-click-on-desktop-after/5a8d0f56-621a-486e-8a17-1b8c088a9cbb">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/micro-stutters-when-i-right-click-on-desktop-after/5a8d0f56-621a-486e-8a17-1b8c088a9cbb</a></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Will we get a solution to this?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Things I have already done/know:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Did a complete fresh install of 1709</li><li>All cumulative updates are installed</li><li>None of my hardware has any issues</li><li>All my drivers/bios/firmware are completely up to date</li><li>sfc scans show no errors</li><li>dism shows I'm all good</li><li>No memory issues</li><li>Not interested in posting to the feedback hub, have posted bugs there and never have even received one response. Please do not respond just telling me to post to the feedback hub</li></ul>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already tried in my case but the only answer I received was that Microsoft is aware of the problem and is working on a fix. That was some time ago. Meantime Microsoft releases new builds for Windows Insiders which didn't fix anything.</p>

            Well this is a temp fix and it will kill your battery but right click go to NVidia control panel go to manage 3d settings and select the NVidia gpu, save restart and then the internal will be disabled, I have a hinkering suspicion that this is a driver
 issue between the dedicated gpu and the onboard (intel HD) and because microcrap and intel neither one are willing to admit its their problem I highly doubt there will be any resolution anytime soon, to anyone having this issue try what I proposed, it worked
 for me and I now no longer have any hangups but I am stuck to a wall because the battery life sucks

<h2>            Windows 10 Desktop banner not responding</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my MSI GX60 from Windows 7 to Windows 8.1 to now Windows 10. Everything works fine but the bottom dark banner when in the desktop. I can not click and open the start menu nor use the "Search the web and Windows". All the icons along the border
 can not be left clicked. I can right click, but this is not the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            Hi Wuznme
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Here are a couple ways you might be able to downgrade to Windows 10 Home.
<br />
<br />Click Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type:
<br /> slmgr /ipk &lt;ProductKey&gt; 
<br />
<br />(Replace &lt;ProductKey&gt; with one of these below)
<br />
<br />    YTMG3-N6DKC-DKB77-7M9GH-8HVX7 
<br />
<br />Exit the Command prompt then restart.
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />There is another way you might be able to downgrqade to Home without having to reinstall everything, but its pretty advanced. 
<br />
<br />Open Registry Editor (WIN + R, type regedit, hit Enter) 
<br />Browse to key HKEY_Local Machine &gt; Software &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows NT &gt; CurrentVersion
<br />Change EditionID to Core (double click EditionID, change value, click OK). In your case it should at the moment show Pro
<br />Change ProductName to Windows 10 Core. In your case it should at the moment show Windows 10 Professional
<br />Browse to key HKEY_Local Machine &gt; Software &gt; Wow6432Node &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows NT &gt; CurrentVersion, change the same two values as in steps 3 and 4 above
<br />Close the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Download and launch the Media Creation Tool, do an in-place upgrade by launching the setup from desktop (not booting with Windows 10 Home install media)
<br />When asked, enter your valid Windows 10 Home product key then select what to keep (settings, personal files and apps, only personal files or nothing)
<br />Windows 10 Home in-place upgrade will be done now. 
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. 
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Creators Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

            Hi Wuznme 
<br />
<br />You can force Windows 10 bootable USB installation media created with the MCT to give you the choice of installing the Home version . . .
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose New - Text Document 
<br />
<br />Paste the text below into that document 
<br />
<br />[EditionID] 
<br />Core 
<br />[Channel] 
<br />Retail
<br />
<br />Then choose File - Save Aa, at the bottom of the Save As dialog, change file type to 'All Files' then save that file as ei.cfg (note you must manually add the cfg file extension) 
<br />
<br />Then copy that ei.cfg file into the Sources folder in your USB Installation Media 
<br />
<br />Then when you begin the Installation, you should be asked which Edition you want to install . . .

                    Hi, Movie Maker won't let me add any music to my project, it keeps saying "music starts after the last item". I was hoping for a solution to this so I can get back on my project. I've tried on many forums to help me find a solution but I didn't find one,
 so now I want a direct answer from a professional. This is very important because tons of people are counting on me to get this project done. Thank You so much, your time is greatly appreciated

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, the error message you received occurs if music begins after the last video or photo in your project. You can fix this issue by either or using all the resolution below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <strong><span>Add more photos and videos</span>.</strong> If you add enough photos or videos to make the project longer than the first song, the song at the end will play in your final movie. You can refer to the link below for steps on how to add photos
 and videos in Movie Maker:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/movie-maker-add-photos-videos-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I add videos and photos in Movie Maker?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. <strong><span>Fit your movie to the music</span>.</strong> To do this, on the
<span><strong>Project</strong></span> tab, in the <span><strong>Audio</strong></span> group, click
<span><strong>Fit</strong> <strong>to music</strong></span><strong>.</strong> The amount of time the photos are shown will be automatically adjusted. Depending on the number of photos, amount of video, and the duration of the music, the song at the end might
 be able to play because the duration of the photos will be longer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. <strong><span>Make the photos play longer</span>.</strong> Adjust the duration of photos on your own and make one or more of the photos play longer. After making one or more photos display longer, the music at the end might be played because the overall
 project is longer. To adjust the duration of the photo, click the photo, and then, under
<span><strong>Video</strong> <strong>Tools</strong></span>, on the <span><strong>Edit</strong></span> tab, in the
<span><strong>Adjust</strong></span> group, click <span><strong>Duration</strong></span>. Click or enter a longer duration.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. <strong><span>Trim music</span>. </strong>Trim a song in the project to make it shorter. If you trim the song so it's shorter than the length of the videos and photos combined, the song at the end will be able play in your final movie.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. <strong><span>Remove other music from the project</span>.</strong> This moves the song at the end to an earlier time in your project so it plays in your movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please inform us if the issue still persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            first, ensure you are on the current version of Windows Movie Maker 2012.<br />
If not already, download the latest version of Windows Movie Maker 2012-<br />
you can download it from here. <br />
<br />

</a><br />
<br />
Obviously, when you are adding music to a video the positioner should be where you want to insert the audio. You can accomplish this by using the add music or using the drag-and-drop function.<br />
<br />
Does this not work correctly for you?<br />
<br />
I hope this helps... <br />
<br />
Until next time,<br />

<br />The Windows 7 backup included in Windows 10 was only intended to be temporary and will be phased out soon.  
<br />
<br />Are you following these steps to set up and run File History?  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/configure-windows-10-file-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/configure-wind...</a>

<br />You might have better luck with Macrium File Backup which along with their imaging backup is the choice of most experts:  <a href="http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Backing+up+files+and+folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/B...</a>

<p>Hi Andre</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Backup using File History but I end up with empty folders. When I am doing the backup there is no indication as to how close to finishing it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My work around is to manually copy and paste the most important folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the tips on Macrium backup software. It looks logical and hopefully be easy to use.</p>

            File History is on the chopping block, so its kinda buggy at the moment. I am encouraging users to switch to third party alternatives such as Macrium Reflect (Free) or Easeus Todo Backup.

<p>Hi Greg</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using File History Backup to backup my files. I don't remember setting it up but all the folders I wanted backed up are listed plus quite a few folders I excluded from the backup. I still ended up with empty folders for the files included. This method
 is unreliable for me so I will try the third party software you mentioned and if that fails I will return to copy and paste.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find File History backup difficult to use. When you change the backup drive you have to hunt around looking for a way to change it. I have a backup for another computer on the same drive but see no way of saving the Win 10 backup to a specific part of
 the drive. On Win 7 you could select where you wanted the backup to be saved. When a backup starts you have no idea how long it will last and it is not obvious when it's finished. That plus empty folders means I do not rate Windows 10 file backup.&nbsp;</p>

            Till the legacy Windows 7 styled backup and restore is present, I recommend using that. It is far more robust than File History.

</blockquote>
<p>Because you need to run the command under elevated privileges. When you type <em>
cmd.exe</em>, press Ctrl+Shift+Enter, then click <em>Run as administrator</em>. You might now be able to stop this service. If you still cannot stop it then this is because Microsoft deemed this service to be an essential service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do you actually want to stop it?</p>

            As I noted in my original post, "I have an update icon on my start button that will not go away". &nbsp;When I turn of the computer, no updates are installed and the update icon returns to the start button when I turn the computer back on.<br />
<br />
To fix this problem, &nbsp;I was told to "Flush the Windows Update Folder". &nbsp;I was told to do the following: &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Go to Start &gt;&gt; type in cmd.exe and [Enter-key] to get a command-prompt window<br />
type in: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; net stop wuauserv &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
That will temporarily stop the windows update automatic service. &nbsp;<br />
Go to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download &lt;&lt;&lt;--- this folder<br />
Delete all the contents of the Download folder.<br />
Go back to the command-prompt window.<br />
type in: net start wuauserv&nbsp;<br />
Exit the command prompt window.<br />
<br />
Were the instructions this person gave me incorrect?<br />

            <p>The instructions you followed will indeed flush the update folder but I wonder if they are the answer to your problem. To see what it actually is I would like you to post an illustration like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press PrtSc on your keyboard.</li><li>Open mspaint.exe.</li><li>Press Ctrl+V. You will see a snapshot of your desktop.</li><li>Run snippingtool.exe.</li><li>Click <em>New</em>, then draw a rectangle around the problem area you are discussing.</li><li>Save this snapshot as a file to your desktop.</li><li>Attach the file to your reply.</li></ol>
