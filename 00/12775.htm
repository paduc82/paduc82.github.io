<h2>            Transferring contacts between email accounts</h2>
                    <p>I have the Windows Phone 7 on a Nokia Lumia 710.&nbsp; I have various email accounts with different contacts in each email account.&nbsp; When I go into&nbsp;'People' from the start menu&nbsp;and select a contact, at the top of the page under the contact's name is the email
 account in small font that shows what email account(s) the contact is(are) associated with.&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I transfer a contact from one email account to another email account that doesn't have the contact in it?&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that&nbsp;I don't want the contact in both accounts,
 I want to transfer it to a different email account.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Thank you for keeping in touch in regards to your query about managing the contacts on your phone and accounts!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the contacts on your phone should be linked with the primary Microsoft Account that you used to set up the phone with (listed as Windows Live under Settings -&gt; Email+Accounts).&nbsp; When you add a second email address, if you set it up to sync contacts
 it will import those contacts and add them to the primary account's contacts.&nbsp; You can view all of the contacts currently linked to your Microsoft Account here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://contacts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://contacts.live.com</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an option as soon as you sign in there to import contacts from another account, or from a CSV file.&nbsp; Most other email providers have a way to export contacts as a CSV file which gets saved on your local harddrive.&nbsp; If you want to export the contacts
 from your Microsoft Account, you'd go to Manage on the website, and there will be an Export option in that dropdown.&nbsp; There should be a way to import from CSV in Outlook.&nbsp; In the end, all contacts on your phone will pretty much always be linked to your Microsoft
 Account, which is how the phone is set up to back things up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're wanting to move contacts around between other accounts, separate from the Microsoft Account, you'd want to contact support for those email providers to find out how to do that through their systems, but as Entegy mentioned this wouldn't be done
 through the phone, but through their website or software on your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in touch if you have any other questions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Kevin J S</p>

<h2>            Lumia Backup</h2>
                    <p>Lumia 550 Insider</p>
<p>My Phone settings was changed, and it's not related to the Insider Builds.</p>
<p>First I can't find my way around NOT retrieving a backup, my phone insist on downloading a backup I never made, the backup I get are special in that way that all settings and passwords are shared, even before I log on using MSA.</p>
<p>Those settings can't be changed.</p>
<p>So I get stuck, if I use my MSA I share passwords and settings, and apparently at the same time start to upload those settings to??</p>
<p>I was lucky at a point where I could choose NOT to use "my backup", now the phone download a backup regardless of what I do.</p>
<p>Tried Windows Device Recovery tool, works great btw, but the backup I never made are still retrieved during setup.</p>
<p>So I need help, on how to force my phone not to retrieve a backup.</p>
<p>Really need a hand here!</p>

<p>Hi FX,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your passwords are not part of a backup, they are part of your MSA profile.&nbsp; Don't know where it is on your phone but on a PC you can find it under Settings-&gt;Accounts-&gt;Sync your settings-&gt;Passwords.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Edit] Yes, it's on the phone also. I assume these settings are on a device-by-device basis, so you should be able to turn it off on one device while keeping them synchronized on another device but, frankly, I don't know. Please post if you find that this
 is not the case. TIA</p>

<p>First thanks!</p>
<p>Second, it's about a backup I never made, who downloads after I do a reset. During setup my phone retrieving a backup I never made of the phone. Previous I found two phone backups on of my phone, on OneDrive, I never made.(deleted now).</p>
<p>The backup I get are where I share passwords and settings across devices, a setting I never made. And not a default setting.</p>
<p>A series of lock screens who seem to belong to a Windows 8 Phone who has a language I think are Turkish but not sure, can't read the signs. At a point, before I did a fresh start on it, had more than one mail icon, now I know it's a m.hotmail.com account.
 (That account even show up on my Desktop, in my mail settings.)</p>
<p>So it's a backup of a phone who are not mine I can't bypass, I never get the opportunity to not use the backup.</p>
<p>What else that backup contains, I'm not sure, but it's possibly it has something in it I don't want.</p>
<p>So how can I do a fresh start and not download a backup?</p>
<p>About passwords, yes MSA are the same password ofc, but PIN Codes are NOT identically across my devices, they are unik to each device, and I don't sync them.</p>
<p>Thanks for a reply, if you happen to come across more info about not retrieving a backup, please let me know.</p>
<p>Regards FxTell</p>

<p>Well, I can't really help you but maybe shed some light on a couple of things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Backups are made periodically and automatically. I know you can choose to do this 'more often' but I don't think you can turn it of completely (or at least don't know how |--)</p>
<p>b) Last time I did a Reset of a phone it clearly asked whether I wanted to restore any backup. But this was a long time ago, a Windows Insider Build and things might well have changed in the mean time.</p>
<p>c) A PIN is something that is stored in a TPM chip on your device. It is completely local to that device and is 'translated' into a password before it is sent 'over-the-wire'. As such there is no option to sync that across devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as you stated, you can remove those Backups, so have you tried simply removing all and Resetting after that?</p>

<p>A) Did not know, af first start of my phones I always turn backup Off.</p>
<p>B) Same after a factory restore, first time, I had a prompt asking "use backup", the last couple of times I can't choose anymore.</p>
<p>C) OH did not know, thought I sync both my password and pin.</p>
<p>I don't have any backups, so I can't delete or remove something whos not there.</p>
<p>Where "my backups" are stored or comes from beats me.</p>
<p>Gonna give it another go, and hope I can choose NOT to use any backups.</p>

<p>You Got ME.. can't remember, I should have taken a note before restoring.</p>
<p>During setup, after restoring to Factory Settings, at the very top of my phones screen, I get a small notice saying retrieving backup, after that I can log in using my MSA and my phones start screen are not the default screen, lots of empty space, were there
 should be icons, as if it has retrieved a backup!?!</p>
<p>Only way forward are to give it a go, and accept the sync settings of password.</p>
<p>Oh befor I forget, the sync settings also applied to the password I use on my wireless network, so I would login to my wireless, that feature made me a bit unease.</p>

<p>Well, a Reset won't change the build, so we'll find out later.</p>
<p>BUT, you get that message <em>before</em> you login with your MSA account? How very weird, never have seen anything like it. Do you have an SD-Card in your phone? I never had that and that's the only place I can think of from where it could get anything
 like that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, yes, that would be something I would not like. And the fact that 'Sync Passwords' is the default does indeed raise some questions, looks like those Passwords
<em>will</em> be downloaded on your phone whether you like it or not....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest an entry on this in the Feedback Hub. Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure you won't get
<em>any </em>upvotes. Unfortunately, Joe average is completely not bothered by things like that, the stupid turlingdromes.</p>

<p>Did a full restore, Version 1607 Build 10.014393.1066 atm.</p>
<p>Logged into MSA only to find some settings are managed by your organisation, coll by me if I was a member of an organisation, hopefully that part are related to Insider Builds.</p>
<p>What are worse are the reset simply don't change a thing, and worse my mail client insist on being a m.hotmail.com account, and I use Outlook.com.</p>
<p>Don't think a factory reset, would remember an account who don't belong to me, and further more be able to remember my routers wireless connections password, NOT even on a Insider build.</p>
<p>So two might happen here,</p>
<p>a) The Phone looks like it makes a reset, but in fact, the reset are overruled by malicious code who keeps settings to it's favor.</p>
<p>b) The phone does a factory reset, but in the last part of the setup a backup are downloaded who has a series of settings like sharing password, and turning remote access on from other devices, who seem to use a VPN.</p>
<p>So the challenge here are if my Lumia 550 ever are going to be able to do a real factory reset and install all default settings and not use a backup.</p>
<p>Or if I have to ditch my phone and buy a new.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did some tests on the backup issue.</p>
<p>Made a new reset and retrieved what supposed-to-be-my-backup.</p>
<p>Then made a change in the phone settings, and insisted on the phone did a backup of my start screen.</p>
<p>Not my passwords.</p>
<p>Opened OneDrive, on my desktop, and waited for the backup to show, it never did.</p>
<p>So where the backup comes from, and where the backup goes to beats me!</p>
<p>It's not on my OneDrive.</p>

                    <p>I am unable to use Skype. After 15 years of using it Microsoft have finally managed to botch it up so that all I see now is a blank blue screen. I have spent hours trying to resolve it. I am sending this last message in desparation in the hope that someone
 out there can assist me. I had 3.5 hours of MS online help and even that did not work. I am shocked at what has happened and that no one at MS even seems to care.</p>
<p>Can someone tell me what to do please?</p>

            Hi Richard
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />I sometimes see a white screen when signing into Skype, waiting a bit it eventually signs in.
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if you are also not able to sign into Skype for Web too?
<br />
<br /><a href="https://web.skype.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/en</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure you are using Edge or Chrome to access Skype for web.
<br />
<br />Other things i would also check:
<br />
<br />First, check the Skype status page to be sure there is not a known outage causing login issues: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/status/</a>
<br />
<br />Check if your account might have been compromised:

<br />If you are using the Skype for Windows 10 App, uninstall that version
<br />
<br />Then, click the link below and download the full Skype for Windows application.

<br />On this page, click the drop down and choose the bottom option . .

    <title>Word 2016 cannot open .doc files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 cannot open .doc files</h2>
                    <p>I have wasted hours searching for a solution to this.</p>
<p>Not sure whether MS cares or not, but there are obviously a lot of people with same issue and and no fix seems to have been provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot open .doc files with Word 2016. &nbsp;(Windows 10 OS)</p>
<p>Each time I get the error dialog box appearing saying "Word experienced an error trying to open the file".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have unticked all Word document types in the File Block Settings in the Word Trust center, but that makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems ridiculous that MS hasn't made Word 2016 compatible with earlier versions of word files when open source programs can handle this without any difficulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone solved this issue - apart from re-installing Word 2010 ?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>We're only a small business, but we have thousands of word .doc files, none of which will open with Word 2016.</p>
<p>These are all client files and we are not allowed to make them available to third parties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has only arisen since upgrading to Word 2016.</p>
<p>We have one PC running Word 2010, and one PC with Office 365 which has not yet been updated to Word 2016, neither of which have any problems opening the .doc files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it is nothing to do with the files themselves. &nbsp;It is some issue with Word 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like every Microsoft update recently has cost us hours and hours of productivity for some reason or other. &nbsp;We're really over it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this stage we're looking at re-installing Office 2010 on everyone's PC.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply Stacy, &nbsp;but these .doc files are not an Outlook attachment - the files are in shared folders on our file server. &nbsp;Most are years old (date back to mid 1990's) and we had no problem opening them prior to the WOrd 2016 update.</p>

<p>If it is any consolation, I doubt that there is anything that Word 2016 can do that you cannot do with Word 2010 which is the version that I use the most out of all of 2003, 2007, 2010, 2013 and 2016 that I have installed on various

            <p>Hi Doug - Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;I'm reasonably certain it is some aspect of Office 365 configuration that is causing the issue but cannot work out what it is, and it is something which changed with the latest update to the 2016 suite.</p>
<p>We've now re-installed Office 2010 on one of the machines and it has no problem opening and editing the .doc files. &nbsp;If we try and open the same file from Word 2016 (using the File/Open command in word) on the same machine, the error happens.</p>
<p>I've wasted more than a day on this which I can't afford (I'm a database developer who gets roped in sometimes to solve issues in the office.) &nbsp;The employees here really only use Word and Outlook so longer term maybe some solution other than MS Office is
 the answer.</p>
<p>I think we'll re-install Office 2010 on all machines just to stop the frustration in the meantime. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I googled the issue and there are a lot of tickets raised about this - but also it seems there may be multiple causes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Miing, does this happen with all .doc files, including new ones?</p>
<p>If it happens with a new, blank .doc file, for example, that would be very surprising, and informative.</p>
<p>Or, is there some company letterhead, or other content that is in common across all the affected .doc files?</p>

            <p>Hi Andrew. &nbsp;The .doc files are all old, but they are from dozens of different sources (many outside out firm) so nothing in common.</p>
<p>We're only a small firm so cannot afford to spend the time to track down the issue.</p>
<p>But a clue is that last week we had a PC with issues booting up. &nbsp;As there was nothing of importance on the local drive and no apparent hardware issues, we decided to use the recovery partition to reinstall the operating system it came with (Win 8) and re-upgrade
 to Win 10. &nbsp;We then did a fresh install of Office 365.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This PC now has no problems opening our old .doc files using Word 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like the obvious quick solution for us is to uninstall and re-install Word 2016, but after having a quick look at that it seems that we have to do the whole of Office 365, not just Word.</p>

</p><p>That sounds like a valuable clue. One thing it could mean, is that you were encountering a known issue in an older version of Word (for still-unknown reasons), and it has been fixed in the latest version. You could try updating an existing machine to see
 if that fixes the issue. There are instructions on <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Known-issues-with-Office-and-Windows-10-28d56d84-c16c-4763-8eac-e51e05a37a16?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>They're very unlikely to / probably won't, since software development is focussed on the newer Symbian phones. There was word a while back on here from the Nokia guys saying there is a firmware update for the N97 and N97 mini in the works, which by the look
 of things looks like will be the last one for these devices.</p>

                    <p>I am having an issue with Build 10162, that is, all my cursors are being stretched. All but the default pointy one at least. This is occurring in all programs including: Edge, Cortana, Visual Studio 2015 and Foobar2000. Each of the cursors render with a
 pixel of space between all of the image. This occurs vertically so all the cursors are twice as high as they should be and appear dotted even though they shouldn't be. This also results in the cursor not being correctly placed above other objects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could take a screenshot of it, but the printscreen commands aren't capturing the cursor in them.</p>

<p>Hey Basha_usop,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Nokia forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try and perform a soft reset using code *#7780# security code 12345 by default if prompted.</p>
<p>If this does not solve the issue, Please plug your device into Nokia Suite via USB, create a device backup and reinstall the phone software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you get your issue solved, let me know if you need further support.</p>

<p>Hi Basha,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes it looks like a hardware issue, I suggest taking your device to a <a href="http://www.nokia.com/repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
care point</a> to be inspected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In that case I think you need to take it to your local Nokia Care point. Quite probably this is a hardware issue.</p>

            I am having the same problem, before latest update (111.040.1511), Bluetooth and WiFi worked as it should, after the update both WiFi and Bluetooth stopped working and WiFi reboots the phone when ever turned on.<br />
And besides that it has a higher battery usage than before the update, the battery won't last 8 hours... IDLING!?<br />
<br />
I mean come on Nokia, W T F ??? Don't **bleep**ing make a update to a downgrade, EMBARRASSING!!

<h2>            Home Use Program Office 2013 Download Link Stripped by military e-mail Security.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a great deal of difficulty downloading Office 2013 through the Home Use Program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a member of the US military, and purchasing it using my military e-mail address. &nbsp;I get the download e-mail sent to me at that address and check it through the military Outlook Web App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the e-mail system automatically strips out all embedded download links as a security measure. &nbsp;I click on the link, to get a "<span>This link has been disabled to protect your security." error. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know I have virtually no chance to get military security policies regarding e-mail changed, so how can I proceed with this? &nbsp;How do other servicemembers handle this? &nbsp;Is there some other way to get the download link
 (if it's present in the e-mail text, it's not stripped out, but the security software strips out embedded links.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            <p>I finally found a solution last night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the page you get after the HUP site tells you that it has sent you a download link, there's a link to re-send the e-mail. &nbsp;Clicking on that link brings you to a page that has an option on it to send a plain-text version of the purchase e-mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The plain-text version of the e-mail can be used because even if the hyperlink is disabled, you can cut &amp; paste the address and use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help. &nbsp;</p>

 have to head over to Motorola to get assistance with your device.</p>

</p><p>I recommend that you run Disk Cleanup or CCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Delete temporary files</strong>. </p>
<p>To delete temporary files: Do a disk cləanup. Click the <strong>Start</strong> button, in the səarch box, type
<em>disk cleanup</em>, and then, in the list of results, click disk cləanup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And/Or </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>CCleaner</strong></p>
<p>One of the single-best system maintenance tools around. Can be used for cleaning junk, browser safety, startup management, and plenty more. A must have on almost every system.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've been having more problems with Cortana lately. After installing build 10130, Cortana, instead of decrypting my speech like a crazy hacker as usual, just jumps straight to "Thinking..." after I hit the microphone button. She also no longer responds to
 "Hey, Cortana". Please help!</p>

    <title>Missing Insider Hub and Windows Feedback after rolling back from Build - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spr85sigma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Insider Hub and Windows Feedback after rolling back from Build 10547 to Build 10532</h2>
                    <p>I updated to Build 10547, but there were some issues with the display and with web browsing. I also found out that some programs that I had installed on my system might have caused the problems. After rolling back the computer, I deleted the programs. However,
 I found that the Insider Hub and Windows Feedback apps are missing from my start menu. I checked my Windows update settings and I am still set to receive Insider builds. I also checked my apps settings and found that the Insider Hub and Windows feedback apps
 are "installed." But they are NOT showing up in my task bar. Another app that is missing is the Windows DVD player app. Any suggestions or "fixes" to get these apps back would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A secondary issue is if I will be able to get the 10547 upgrade again through Windows update to reinstall now that I have removed the problematic programs. I have checked for updates a number of times and am told that my computer is up to date.

<p>Yeah, that is part of the problem, I successfully updated to 10547 after a few nitemare failures and the insider hub wasn't working. It would launch and clock for a second and then close. &nbsp;I went to optional features and add a feature and figured I would
 remove it and then re-add it. &nbsp;Hey guess what? &nbsp;if you remove it it is gone, it doesn't return to the list of available features to install. &nbsp;Anyone know if there is a reg key to make it reappear or an installer to add it back? &nbsp;I chatted with a Microsoft
 tech but she was not very knowledgeable of the insider builds and she sent me here.</p>

    <title>Must I always unlock my phone&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robad5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Must I always unlock my phone&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hi. <br />
Every time I connect my Toshiba G810 (Windows Mobile v6.1) to my PC (Win7 64bit) and run WMDC I get the message "Your device is currently locked. To connect to or synchronize with this PC, please authenticate on your device."<br />
I think on XP ActiveSync asked me if I wanted to unlock the phone every time but WMDC doesn't.&nbsp; Any idea how I can stop it doing this?&nbsp; Or is it a Microsoft "improvement"??<br />
<br />
Thanks,&nbsp; Rob

            I know some folks experience that but I cannot replicate it on my PCs (I do not have a 64 bit machine).&nbsp; I spent quite a while this morning trying to find a solution .. no luck yet but I will continue to look later today.&nbsp; I'll ask the other mods if they
 have any thoughts on this Rob.

WMDC download details</a> it says:<br />
<em>Automatic device authentication - Connect the Windows Mobile device to the PC without the need to enter the device-lock PIN every time upon connect</em><br />

            Hi Jack,&nbsp; no I'm not using Exchange.<br />
I recently upgraded from XP (32) to Windows 7 (64).&nbsp; Previously I didn't get this annoyance (to be fair, it is little more than that).<br />
A couple of days ago I deleted and recreated the partnership with my work PC (XP) and it asked if I wanted it to remember the authentication (or something like that...).&nbsp; It's probably one of those hidden settings you only get to see once, when you first set
 it up.&nbsp; But using WMDC on Win 7 I have never had such an option and can't find an associated setting.&nbsp; I also have a slightly dodgy USB connection so if I move the phone it will disconnect, reconnect and lock...<br />
There is a setting under "Connection Settings" called "allow automatic device authentication".&nbsp; I have it ticked, but unticking it doesn't seem to make any difference.<br />
<br />

            Sadly I do not have a 64 bit machine so i can't really share the experience.&nbsp; I will send Laura (one of our mods) a note because she has a 64 bit PC and maybe she has a few thoughts.<br />
<br />
Under Connection Setting that checkbox for "Allow automatic device authentication" should (IMHO) do the trick so I am baffled why with it checked it is not doing what I thought it was supposed to do.<br />
<br />
I might try checking it again, reboot the PC and connect to your device while it is unlocked.&nbsp; Let it sync, disconnect, lock it then connect again and see if it will sync. (this is just a stab in the dark BTW).<br />
<br />
I did send a note to a friend at Microsoft to see if she could find someone that could point us in the right direction.

            As unlikely as it might seem, that appears to have worked!<br />
I did the following:<br />
- Unchecked "Allow automatic device authentication" option<br />
- Rebooted PC<br />
- soft reset phone (incidentally this does bring up the same or a similar 'unlock' screen)<br />
- Run WMDC and check option<br />
- 'lock' phone (this isn't the same as above, as it doesn't require the password to unlock)<br />
- Connect phone and sync<br />
At first I thought I was going to have to lock the phone before connecting, but (at the moment) I can disconnect and reconnect to my heart's content.<br />
I won't flag the thread as answered until it works again tomorrow...<br />
Thanks.<br />

<p>Yes, I do see this on all my devices that have a pin on both a 32 bit and a 64 bit machine. I just assumed that this was necessary. I can't see any settings in WMDC to change this.
<br />
You don't have to enter the pin on the PC, just the device to unlock it. I believe that you used to have to enter that pin on both PC and device, but not 100% on this.</p>

Interesting ... on my 32 bit PCs, even if I have a PIN to unlock my device, it will sync when connected.

            Hi,
<div>Microsoft implemented the password prompt as part of their security review of WMDC. &nbsp;So this behavior is part of the design of WMDC.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This was also changed in ActiveSync 4.5 which also prompts the user to unlock the device.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the past Microsoft would prompt the user on the PC for the password however this is not as secure as entering it directly on your device.</div>

<h2>            Office wont work without WiFi</h2>
                    <p>I used to use Office all the time, anywhere. I recently resubscribed and activated the account. It works when I'm at home and automatically opens when I have WiFi but when I'm at school or out, it asks me to activate my account again, but I don't have WiFi
 so I can't activate it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really annoying because I paid to use these programs because I need them for school but they don't work when I'm at school. Since I cant get the programs to start I often end up using Apples free programs. They don't work like Microsoft but it's
 all I have.</p>

            No the documents are saved onto my computer it self. I can't even use word or whatever I'm using. It lets me open it but then without wifi it asks me to activate again and I can't because I don't have wifi.

                    <span>Hello community,</span>
                    <span>Hello community,</span>
<div>I have a Windows 8 (8.1) Touchscreen that I was loving for a couple of months, but have trouble now. &nbsp;I think it started about the time that we updated from 8 to 8.1. &nbsp;In any case, on the touch version IE 11 browsing is now pretty limited because
 I can no longer "click" on many icons on lots of websites. &nbsp;For example, when trying to click on "my que" on netflix.com nothing happens. &nbsp;Clicking on the icon with the cursor doesn't work and neither doesn't touching it with my finger. &nbsp;No action. &nbsp;Same with
 weather.com when clicking on forecasts and hourly breakdowns. &nbsp;Many other major sites same thing. &nbsp;So I revert to the desktop browser and things work normally, but I want to be able to use the touch IE 11. &nbsp;Anybody have any insight here? &nbsp;Thanks.</div>

            OK.&nbsp; Thanks, Anil.&nbsp; But you understand it's not just the touch function right?&nbsp; The cursor click doesn't work either on some icons.&nbsp; But on a lot of icons and web pages I can "touch" and "click" to activate and go to the assigned web page.&nbsp; It's not&nbsp;all
 icons.&nbsp; Again, IE11 touch was working great for a couple of months, but I think I lost functionality on it with the switch to 8.1.

<h2>            Onedrive and Onenote wont open in browser</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for hardworking to improve your services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all I should apologize for posting here, because my question was multifaceted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you know the appearance of&nbsp;outlook.com has been changed automatically&nbsp;as the same time of upgrading.</p>
<p>I`ve got some problem with the new version of outlook.com:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I can`t open onedrive from the tiles. even though I open www.onedrive.live.com I see "Hmm, we can't reach this page" message.
</p>
<p>I should say I work with onedrive service in my tablet and windows application correctly, but I can`t use it in browser. I`ve changed my browsers, cleared my history, checked my firewalls, but it didn`t worked. please help me. this error finds after&nbsp; outlooks.com
 upgrading. I didn`t have any problem with this service before automatically upgrading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. my second problem is related to first one. because my online onedrive is not working, my online onenote is not working too. onenote.live.com opens but after logging in, I can`t see any of my notes. my ex notes has been removed, and when I want to create
 one, the new page shows me "Hmm, we can't reach this page" message again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should say all another live services are working well, except these two important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me, I don`t want to go use another services like google and evernote and etc.</p>
<p>I love Microsoft and I don't want to loose it.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try doing these steps to check if it will work:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows key + R</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>CMD</strong> on the RUN command.</li><li>On the Command Prompt (Black Window), type in these commands:</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong> and hit enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>ipconfig /release</strong> and hit enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>ipconfig /renew</strong> and hit enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing the steps, reboot your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, try to reset or clear the cache of your browser and try to access the OneDrive and OneNote again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

            <p>Sorry for delay to respond and thank your for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>unfortunately your command didn`t work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;i should tell OneDrive and OneNote services are working correctly in any other platforms like phones, tablets, and etc. i have problem to open those websites in desktop computers different browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess those may had been locked because of using in a unsafe situation, but those don`t message and warn me to find out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>any solution?</p>
<p>&nbsp;can you reset the services for me?</p>
<p />
