<h2>            Can&#39;t receive email from Yahoo.com users</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Microsoft Live to sign into my Hotmail email account.&nbsp; For a while now, I don't receive any emails from yahoo.com users.&nbsp; I checked all my filters, block lists, spam and have gone through every option in my profile to see if something was specifically
 blocking yahoo.com users.&nbsp; NOTHING!&nbsp; Can't understand why it's only Yahoo.com users?&nbsp;&nbsp; I receive every other domain's emails, but Yahoo.&nbsp; I even tried to set up a filter to look for yahoo.com in the sender field, and have it forward it to my inbox, but this
 didn't work either.&nbsp; I am able to "Send" to Yahoo.com and they receive it fine.&nbsp; I just can't seem to get incoming messages from that Yahoo users that send to me (first).&nbsp; The only time it will work is if I send them an email first and they "reply" to me,
 but that doesn't help if they try to send to me first. The weird think is they get absolutely no notification that their email failed to send.&nbsp; Not sure if all those emails are just sitting up in the Outlook server, discarded, or what? Very frustrating....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated!&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I am receiving the same error code (800704DD). <br />
The code says "Current user is not a member of local Administrators."<br />
Interesting because I'm the only user on this laptop (Dell Inspiron 1525, running XP), and I am the only administrator.<br />
I can't find any other troubleshooting suggestions other than making sure I'm the Administrator. I am.
<br />
<br />
Help please,<br />
Scott<br />

            <p>Thanks for your comment. I already tried all that is mentioned in the article you sent me.</p>
<p>I uninstalled and reinstalled Zune.</p>
<p>Reseted my phone to factory settings.</p>
<p>Made sure I'm the only user of my computer and an administrator.</p>
<p>Can it be that the problem lies within my computer?</p>
<p>By the way, I had no problem updating from Windows 6 to 7 a few weeks ago.</p>

            <p>Maybe everyone know this already, but IU'll post how I was able to get around this issue on my LG Quantum in Windows XP.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My problem was exactly as described here and many other threads, Zune wouldn't allow me to upgrade and kept giving me the 800704DD error code, even though I already had admin privliges.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I created another user in XP and gave it admin rights. Logged onto that user account, and Zune was able to upgrade without any other hitches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worked for me anyway.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Support.&nbsp; I understand you're having issues updating your Windows Phone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've already tried the steps in the link provided by Gianpaolo, I recommend trying out the recommendation put forth by TysonBrewer, and try creating a new user profile for your computer.&nbsp; Then see if the Zune Software will allow your phone to update
 then.&nbsp; Steps on how to create a new user profile can be followed here: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<span>lakgj Power Point,</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Good day! Welcome to Microsoft Community.&nbsp;I am&nbsp;glad to help you with your concern.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the support request that you submitted, you cannot sign in to your another Microsoft account. You stated in your post above that when you sign to your Live&nbsp;account you go directly to your Hotmail account.
<br />
<br />
In order for us to isolate the issue, I would like to ask you first where do you access your Microsoft account and what computer are you using. Are you accessing your Microsoft account via Outlook.com Webmail using Internet Explorer, Mail Client like Windows
 Live Mail and Office Outlook or Mail app? Are you using Windows 8 computer? <br />
<br />
If you are using Windows 8 computer and you access your Microsoft account via Outlook.com Webmail using Internet Explorer browser, we would like to inform you that when you log in to your Windows 8 computer using your Microsoft account, automatically you will
 be logged in to your Microsoft account using Internet Explorer browser. <br />
<br />
To access your other Microsoft account, we advise you to log out the other account or you use "New session" and other browsers.
<br />
<br />
<span>We hope that the information above will help you. If you have further questions, feel free to ask.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Carissa J.</span></p>

            <p>I apologize for the late response.&nbsp; I didn't realize you would respond via this website.&nbsp; I have been checking the other e-mail addresses for a response from Microsoft.&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp;thank you very much for this response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will do my best to answer all of your questions.&nbsp; I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
normally</span> use my HP (Microsoft 7) computer, select Internet Explorer (IE), go to my MNS.com homepage, and click on the Outlook.com link at the top of that page.&nbsp; Then, I sign in as
<strong><em>(removed for security reasons)</em></strong> using my password.&nbsp; At this point, even now, my Hotmail.com Inbox opens.&nbsp; Several days ago I couldn't open any of the e-mails, create a NEW e-mail, or REPLY to an e-mail.&nbsp; Today, I discovered I could
 open an e-mail from the Inbox but I still cannot create a NEW e-mail or REPLY to an e-mail I have received.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife follows the same procedures above to sign in to her Hotmail account <strong>
<em>(removed for security reasons)</em></strong>.&nbsp; We both use both accounts and know each other's passwords.&nbsp; We have never been able to open both accounts simultaneously in different windows using the same computer on Windows 7; one of us had to sign out
 for the other one to sign in.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>We do not use the e-mail function internal to the Windows program.&nbsp; I believe the program is called Live.&nbsp; We do not use it because we do not want to store the e-mail on our computer and risk virus infection that frequently accompanies e-mails.&nbsp; That is
 the main reason we have been so pleased with Hotmail; we really like the way it screens e-mail and the Microsoft Spam Fighters messages it produces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We bought a Dell (Windows 8) computer last year but are just now getting around to setting it up.&nbsp; We have struggled to figure out how to navigate through the Start and Application pages.&nbsp; I have been working a little bit at a time for a month or so to get
 it set up.&nbsp; I entered both e-mail accounts on the Mail link on the Start page and they both appear to be operating normally on that computer; I can toggle between the accounts by clicking on the word "Hotmail" which appears twice in the lower left corner.&nbsp;
 I have difficulty navigating through each account because it doesn't appear to be opening all e-mail in the respective Inbox of each account; it tends to separate them out by newsletter, etc.&nbsp; I find this very confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have logged out of my wife's account <strong><em>(removed for security reasons)</em></strong> on my Windows 7 computer but still cannot get my account
<strong><em>(removed for security reasons)</em></strong> to let me send or reply to e-mails.&nbsp; However I can send or reply on the Windows 8 computer.&nbsp; I can also log on using Google Chrome on the Windows 7 computer and send or reply.&nbsp; I am not a fan of Google
 Chrome; I prefer to use IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if the reason I can't send or reply in Windows 7 is related to having both accounts entered on the Windows 8 computer.&nbsp; If so, why is the
<strong><em>(removed for security reasons)</em></strong> still fully functioning when I log in on the Windows 7 computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to hearing from you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Willy See?,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you were unable to send a new message or reply to any emails that you received. The cause of this issue could be the browser that you're currently using. As our initial troubleshooting step, I recommend that you clear your browser's cache
 and temporary internet files to make sure that they are not causing your issue. This is often caused by a corrupted file in the browser. You can clear your browser's cookies by following the instructions below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Clear Your Browser's Cache</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If clearing the cache doesn't help, we would like to verify the following to isolate the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you accessing your email via web browser, email client or other device/s?</li><li>Are you having problems accessing other accounts on the same computer?</li><li>Does the issue persist on other computer?</li><li>Have you tried using different browser?</li><li>Do you receive any error message when you try to click the "Reply" or "New" button?</li></ul>
<p>If issue still persist, we will be needing additional information to further investigate your account. I have posted it in the private message that I have initiated for you for security reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">: You need to click the notification that states<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>You have a private reply to this message. Click here to read it on our secure private message
 section</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>or by clicking the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Private Messa</span></strong><strong>ges</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

            <p>Carissa J. and Ron Sommer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I apologize for my tardiness in responding.&nbsp; I stepped away to do some other things but now am back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your instructions and cleared the IE 11 cache of "Temporary Internet files and Website files".&nbsp; I did not clear anything else like Cookies, etc..&nbsp; That simple step solved my problem.&nbsp; I can now create New e-mails and Respond to e-mails.&nbsp; My Hotmail
 account appears to be operating just as it did before I contacted you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the years I have normally cleared my cache either by using IE Tools Internet Options myself or using a piece of software that came with this computer.&nbsp; That software has expired and lately&nbsp;I haven't been diligent about cache clearing.&nbsp; Thank you for
 teaching me yet another lesson.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at the Private Response you sent but chose to submit my response here.&nbsp; I can still respond there if you want me to.&nbsp; However, I believe every problem is solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further elaborate, Ron's instructions on how to use "InPrivate Browsing" were followed and I successfully opened both my wife's and my e-mail accounts at the same time......for the first time ever on this HP Windows&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;machine.&nbsp; I have seen that they
 both can be open at the same time on the Dell Windows 8 machine.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; It is amazing what I will put up with just because I am too lazy to ask some real professionals how to do things.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still need to spend some time getting more accustomed to Windows 8.&nbsp; I have found several tutorials and just need to start practicing.&nbsp; I don't want to be a burden so I will try not to&nbsp;overuse this website in the future.&nbsp; If you have further recommendations,
 feel free to present them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Willie See&nbsp; (I like that name....I'll use it now that I "see".&nbsp; Thanks again.)</p>

            <p>The only way is to transfer all mails saved locally in DBX file to the mail server. Try to connect Outlook Express with your account via IMAP and then move them. I can't give you more clue because I have no Office365 but if you have Outlook Mail/Outlook.com
 account adresses &amp; ports for IMAP connection are present on MS website.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. Make a copy of DBX files first.</p>

            <p>Thank you. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried&nbsp; your suggestion:</p>
<p>1) Logged into Outlook.com from my Windows XP PC.</p>
<p>2) Received a message from Outlook.com that my browser is too old and to upgrade my Internet Explorer.
</p>
<p>3) I am unable to upgrade my IE browser because&nbsp; Windows XP is no longer supported. (Also tried Outlook.com using Firefox and Chrome - no luck.)</p>
<p>4) Therefore, not being able to login to Outlook.com, I m unable to load my DBX email files from Outlook Express to Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to change my Outlook Express DBX email files to a PST file? I understand Office365 will read PST files. Office365 will not read DBX files. I have the Outlook Express DBX files saved to a flash drive.</p>

<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just got my new nokia today and have only transfered phone numbers accross to the phone from my old Nokia. since doing that I now have a constant flashing envelope on the top right corner of the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have a new message or any unread messages that I can find. And I can't see how the memory could possibly be filled with only 30 numbers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts???</p>

    <title>Make reviewing pane default to vertical - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david newmarch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Make reviewing pane default to vertical</h2>
                    I use the following macro (and others like it) to insert a comment, but whenever I do so the Reviewing Pane is activated (if it isn't already showing), always in the horizontal position. And if the Reviewing Pane is already showing in the vertical position,
 using the macro makes it revert to the horizontal position. Often I prefer not to display the Reviewing Pane at all, and if I do it is preferably in the vertical position where I have more room to spare on my screen.<br />
<br />
When I insert a comment directly, not using a macro, the Reviewing Pane is not automatically activated, and if is already showing in the vertical position it stays there and doesn't switch to horizontal.<br />
<br />
This is the macro:<br />
<br />
Sub BadName()<br />
'<br />
' BadName Macro<br />
'<br />
'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.Comments.Add Range:=Selection.Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.TypeText Text:= _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Author name spelled differently in text and References list. Please fix as needed."<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Is there anything I could add to the macro to stop it from activating the Reviewing Pane in this way, or alternatively is it possible to make the Reviewing Pane always default to the vertical position?<br />

            <p>Thanks for the prompt reply Bill.&nbsp; I forgot to say that the VBA tools&gt;references is greyed out.&nbsp; I have also forgot to say that it is only the switchboard item that seems to cause the problem.&nbsp; Once I have closed down the error message and the VBA editor,
 the data entry and other parts seems to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm sorry for not giving this information earlier, but I have spent nearly a week trying to pin this problem down and my head is in a bit of a whirl.<br />

            Ah! Could it be that you don't have the database in a trusted location? That would automatically block all VBA code and many macros, too. Anytime the Switchboard fails, I always know I forgot to set up a trusted location.
<div><br />
<div>You can also lower the macro security to the lowest level, but that would have to be done on each user's computer. Trusted locations are easier to maintain.</div>

            <p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>No luck so far.&nbsp; I had already got my database directory which is on a different drive as a trusted folder, including subdirectories.&nbsp; I hadn't, but have now, also put the directory and subdirectories of my program that I pull data from its own database.&nbsp;
 Which does have a DLL program associated, but that has not made any difference.</p>
<p>To&nbsp;day I have rechecked the link that I have to the database and cannot find any fault with that.&nbsp; I'm still suspecting something to do with the link, as, soon as I click the link the error message "there was a problem while sending the command to the program."
 comes up, then access opens up with the navigation pane and no switchboard.&nbsp; Then immediately the VBA editor opens up with a "compile error: error in loading DLL."&nbsp; Before I can even try and step through the program I have to close both error messages.&nbsp; It
 would then let me try and step through the program but as soon as I do.&nbsp; Up comes the compile error again.&nbsp; The only way I can open up the switchboard to view it, is in design mode.</p>
<p>I seem to remember when I got the error message before, in Windows 7 "there was a problem while sending the command to the program."&nbsp; And I hadn't allowed my database to be converted to accdb from MDB.&nbsp; That access 2007 was trying to call an earlier version
 of itself.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is of help.</p>

            <p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>Yes I have run a repair on office which didn't make no difference.&nbsp; I have also reinstalled office three times plus Windows after zeroing the disk.<br />
As far as I can tell there is no DLL called at start-up.&nbsp; The only DLL that I call is "raccd32a.dll" which allows me to use the data from my radio amateur call book.&nbsp; This is only called in my first switchboard item "logbook entry" when I click on the item
 and only interrogated after the call sign is entered.</p>
<p>I have not imported anything into a new database, although I have started a new database and I get the same error message "error in loading DLL", as soon as I try to open the switchboard manager.&nbsp; I have added nothing further to that database apart from
 the initial table 1 and after clicking switchboard manager and closing the error message and resulting dialogue box.&nbsp; This then gave me switchboard items underneath the navigation pane with "switchboard items: table" and "switchboard".&nbsp; I then opened the new
<p>While leaving the new database open I opened my problem database which still gave me the same errors.&nbsp; There was a problem while sending the command to the program.&nbsp; Then the VBA editor opening immediately with the error.&nbsp; Compile error, error in loading
 DLL.&nbsp; After closing the error messages down I was able to read the tools&gt;references.&nbsp; This has five items checked.&nbsp; "Visual Basic For Applications, Microsoft Access 12.0 Object Library, OLE Automation, Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Extensibility
 5.3 and Microsoft Office 12.0 Access database engine Object Library.&nbsp; I was never able to open the tools&gt;references before.&nbsp; It didn't matter what I did, so what the difference is now I do not know.</p>
<p>I'm afraid I'm now starting to get out of my depth with access?<br />

            Sorry to heard Windows 8 is not working for you. I tend to stick with the version I'm on until the new one has at least 1 Service Pack, but even then you can run up against major issues.

            Do you know what types of installations you have for each? There are multiple "channels" of distribution you can use to get products and updates and some of those different distribution types don't mix. For example, you can't mix C2R (click to run) and
 MSI installation types.<br />

    <title>Cannot send email - daily limit reached - due to PST import - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mec2dfw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot send email - daily limit reached - due to PST import</h2>
                    <p>Created a premium outlook.com account and created a couple users. Added to a new Outlook profile on a user PC, went fine, imported their old PST (about 10GB total), which of course imported into the OST for syncing online. Except the user now cannot send
 emails. Outlook 2010 just shows an Inbox bounce but the error in the web app shows the an error that we have exceeded our daily limit. Of course, no mail has been sent, just the syncing. Apparently, in the laziest of moves, they've implemented an item count
 in Sent Items as their check on how many emails are sent, rather than actually tracking it through their internet transport.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have a user, stuck at 10% of an import, who cannot send mail, doing a mail import that is extremely slow compared to every other import ever done, who cannot send emails... for how long?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Didn't pay alot for premium Outlook.com but we did pay, and this is unacceptable - alot of time and effort is put into changing mail providers, creating profiles, importing, and getting things working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh - the cherry on top of the sundae, no real support from Microsoft, three support sessions, two with remote control, the second disconnected a few minutes in, and the third, when we was getting nowhere and with control of the PC, went to the chat window,
 wiped the data, and disconnected so I could not copy/paste our chat information. That's the most unprofessional thing I've run across in quite a while. His name in the part he COULDN'T get to (the hidden LogMeIn window) was Adrian Mico. He should be fired,
 immediately. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I presume there is no fix for this that makes sense? I am stunned this is so poorly constructed. If there is something we can do to resolve this, I am all ears, but as of now, I have mail redirected to a Microsoft mailbox that will not allow us to, you know,
 send email through it. </p>

            <p>Nope, it's absolutely outlook.com related - outlook.com has the "daily limit" that is being triggered by the import. You can do what I am doing all day long against an Exchange server or Office 365 hosted Exchange without a problem. There is a mechanism
 they have in for outlook.com to babysit against free account exploits that apparently monitors your sent items and if you send to many, it drops the hammer. Well, it's dropping the hammer on imported Sent Items from 2007... these aren't mails sent out through
 the system, just emails sent a long time ago and imported during the PST import process. Rather than monitor the transport service for number of sent mails, it is just lazily checking the Sent Items item number and if # &gt; old#+300 then cannotsend=1. Something
 like that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do wonder if doing a non-OST import would make a difference but it is academic now, the mailbox was imported and now is syncing from the OST to outlook.com.

<h2>            Can&#39;t Download Files in IE 10 - Possible Zero Access Root Kit</h2>
                    This tread was initially started under the title "Can't Download Files in IE 10". &nbsp;I was asked to post it as a new question. &nbsp;Here is the link to the original post:
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie10-windows_7/cant-download-files-in-ie-10/0d686833-7c7e-4c7b-b4b9-78dd664edc06">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie10-windows_7/cant-download-files-in-ie-10/0d686833-7c7e-4c7b-b4b9-78dd664edc06</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is the pertinent information:</div>
<div>
<p>I recently started experiencing problems with IE 10.&nbsp; I cannot download files or run files from a download site like CNET.&nbsp; The save and save as commands on a download do not do anything.&nbsp; Selecting run will show a percent of the file being downloaded but
 it will stop long before 100% and nothing will actually be downloaded.&nbsp; Other user accounts on the same machine work properly as does Google Chrome.&nbsp; I am running Windows 7 and IE version 10.0.9200.16736.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Note: I also have issues now with staying logged into accounts in IE.&nbsp; For instance Gmail or Hotmail do not stay logged in despite my choosing the option to keep signed in to the accounts.&nbsp; This was not a problem before the IE problems began. &nbsp;This is not
 a problem when the same accounts are accessed from Google Chrome.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have gone in safe mode and run the following tools:</p>
<p>Hitman Pro</p>
<p>Malware Bytes</p>
<p>Adw Cleaner</p>
<p>Junkware Removal tool</p>
<p>TDSS Killer</p>
<p>MacAfee Rootkit remover</p>
<p>AVG Zero Access Remover</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All are coming back clean except for Hitman Pro.&nbsp; It returns the following:</p>
<p><br />
Malware remnants ____________________________________________________________</p>

</p>
<p>My recycle bin for all accounts on the machine is empty.&nbsp; I cannot clean this using Hitman because my free trial is expired.&nbsp; Are there any other things I can try to restore this functionality?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>Based on a previous post I had already tried resetting the IE settings. &nbsp;It did nothing. &nbsp;Just to be thorough I did it again today. &nbsp;It still did not cure the issue. &nbsp;I did not recreate the user account yet. &nbsp;I already know that other user accounts work
 properly. &nbsp;I was under the impression that this problem was due to malware not the user account getting corrupted. &nbsp;If you think malware is not the issue and it is just a corrupted file please let me know.</div>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>You don't mention the classic symptom of a ZeroAccess/Sirefef infection, the message with every download that "~Filename~ contained a virus and was deleted." Your problem may not be malware related.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See if these procedures help:</p>

<p>Check after each step:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. From Internet Options&gt; General&gt; Browsing History&gt; Delete, uncheck "Preserve Favorites website data" and select and delete the Temporary Internet Files and Download history. Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Start Internet Explorer without add-ons by right-clicking the IE icon on the desktop. Choose Start without add-ons.<br />
or<br />
from Start&gt; Programs&gt; Accessories&gt; System tools&gt; Internet Explorer (no add-ons)<br />
If the problem goes away, an add-on is causing it. The culprit may be something like DAP/Download Accelerator Plus/Speedbit or another download manager.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Disable your antivirus and/or other security programs just long enough to try a download or two. If running ZoneAlarm, you may haveto uninstall it to test. Disabling ZoneAlarm doesn't always disable all of its features.</p>

<p>I tried all 3 suggestions and tested after each one.&nbsp; No progress.&nbsp; I still cannot download and I still do not stay signed in to sites.&nbsp; Just to elaborate, since the details may be buried in the thread.&nbsp; When I try and download I am presented with the Run,
 Save and Save as options.&nbsp; Pressing Save or Save as does nothing.&nbsp; Pressing Run gives me the message a security scan is being run and then I see percent progress of the download.&nbsp; It always stops before 100% and nothing runs or is downloaded.&nbsp; As far as staying
 logged on the issue is I can log onto Gmail or Hotmail and select stay signed in.&nbsp; If I then loan another page and immediately go back to the site I am supposed to be signed in to, I will no longer be signed in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am awaiting your further suggestions.</p>

            Whoever said it was a "Microsoft error" was wrong.&nbsp; It is most definitely a server-side error generated by the Cox server.&nbsp; If their "service" droids won't help you solve the problem, escalate it to the level 2 tier.&nbsp; Keep escalating it until someone at
 Cox will tell you what causes their server to generate the message.

</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To download the ISO files, the user must be a member of the Windows Insider program already. Also, the files will only work on a PC that has been previously activated with Windows 10 or with a Windows 10 product key. After downloading the files, you will
 have to transfer them to a DVD or USB flash drive and then perform a clean install from either one of those sources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Microsoft use to provide hashes for the ISO downloads but they have stopped this recently.</p>
<p>They might be thinking if it works then then the ISO is good, it not then download again.</p>
<p>You can suggest via the Feedback hub to have hashes provided for all ISO downloads in future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time I have downloaded build 14295 ISO files and used HashCalc with these values</p>

            <p>Yeah, I&nbsp;ran SH256 with Hash Check Shell Extension and got the same value on x64 as&nbsp;you did for the 14295&nbsp;.iso.&nbsp; Not&nbsp;much to do with it since MS doesn't offer hash values before download.&nbsp; Can't even create a hash&nbsp;sum to backcheck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, just checked in with MSDN and they list the SHA1 values for the downloads.&nbsp; This one confirms the SH1 x64 from HashCalc and&nbsp;HashCheck:&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thanks Max.&nbsp; I would rather verify that the download is good before installing it rather that try to guess what is causing problems and re-download only to find a problem goes away.</p>

    <title>Repeater Merge Fields to output in the same line instead of listing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zackyg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repeater Merge Fields to output in the same line instead of listing repeater items in separate rows</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can someone help me formatting repeater merge fields output in MS WORD in such a manner that the results will list in the same line using comma separate format?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Currently the multiple outputs are listed in separate rows. for example</span></p>
<p><span>PRINCESS</span></p>
<p><span>AMIGO</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My desired result would be:</span></p>
<p><span>PRINCESS, AMIGO</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Another issue I am having is when I use the repeater merge fields right after the normal merge field, the output result will repeat the output from the previous merge field again after the repeater merge field ends.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>for example</span></p>
<p><span>if the merge field &lt;&lt;residentname&gt;&gt; outputs SMITH and the repeater merge field &lt;&lt;PETSNAME&gt;&gt; outputs PRINCESS, AMIGO, my output shows like this:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>SMITH PRINCESS</span></p>
<p><span>SMITH AMIGO</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I want this output to be&nbsp;display in MS WORD as:</span></p>
<p><span>SMITH, PRINCESS, AMIGO</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>sample merge fields</span></p>
<p><span>«residentname»</span> <span>«tablestart:pets»</span><span>«petsname»</span><span>«tableend:pets»</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Your reference to fields containing <span>«tablestart:pet»</span><span> &amp; </span>
<span>«tableend:pets» show that you're using a third-party product for your merge, not just Word's mergefields. In that case, you're limited to whatever your
</span>third-party product supports. The alternative is to not use the third-party product and rely on Word's mergefields, plus other field coding and/or macros.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use Word's Catalogue/Directory Mailmerge facility to group like data (the terminology depends on the Word version). To see how to do so with any mailmerge data source supported by Word, check out my Microsoft Word Catalogue/Directory Mailmerge Tutorial
 at:<br />

The tutorial covers everything from list creation to the insertion &amp; calculation of values in multi-record tables in letters. Do read the tutorial before trying to use the mailmerge document included with it.<br />

Alternatively, you may want to try one of the Many-to-One Mail Merge add-ins, from:<br />
Graham Mayor at <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/ManyToOne.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/ManyToOne.htm</a>; or<br />
Doug Robbins at <a href="http://bit.ly/1hduSCB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bit.ly/1hduSCB</a> <br />
&nbsp;<br />
In addition to a 'Many to One' merge, the latter handles:<br />
• Merge with Charts<br />
• Duplex Merge<br />
• Merge with FormFields<br />
• Merge with Attachments<br />
• Merge to Individual Documents<br />
• Merge, Print and Staple</p>

<h2>            Adding outlook EMAIL account - WORKAROUND</h2>
                    <p>There is an issue with adding outlook account to the outlook native application using a predefined&nbsp;button so I am posting a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run Outlook application -&gt; Add account -&gt; Advanced setup -&gt; Internet email</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enter settings manually:<br />
</p>
<p>- Account name - Choose whatever name you like (example: Outlook)</p>
<p>- Your name - Enter your name (example: Jack Sparrow)</p>
<p>- Incoming email server -&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">imap-mail.outlook.com OR&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">pop-mail.outlook.com (NOTE - If you don't know what is the difference between imap and pop, use imap)</span></p>
<p>- Account type - Depends on what incoming email server you have set &nbsp;- Use IMAP4 for imap OR POP3 for pop</p>
<p>- Username - email (example: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</p>
<p>- Password - email password&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">NOTE - If your Microsoft account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) is secured using two step verification, you will have to generate "password for programs" in your account security settings and use it instead of
 your email password</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Outgoing (SMTP) email server -&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">smtp-mail.outlook.com</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Leave all checkboxes as they are (checked)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tap "Sign-in"</p>

            The issue with this is not receiving your contacts, calendar or todo's from Office 365. Considering people like me store all their contacts on O365 this doesn't really work as a workaround IMO. In this case I might as well just use OWA.

            <p>A better workaround is adding as an Exchange account (because Office 365 is an exchange account) You have to put outlook.office365.com as server and put your email address as user name (Left domain in blank)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll have your email and also calendar and contacts</p>

<p>How do you know it's opening as a .docx? Does the title bar show .docx as the file extension? Or is it just that it is opening in a Ribbon version of Word? If so, does the title bar show "Compatibility Mode"? If so, it is opening as a .doc file.</p>

    <title>Merge multiple presentations keeping links - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Merge multiple presentations keeping links</h2>
                    <p>I have read several threads to this subject but none of them really answers the issue we have and my suspicion is, that there is no solution to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have multiple presentations that needs to be combined to one presentation (scenario: manager is getting several presentations and needs to combine various slides into one). We are aware of the options how to insert the slides, however, there are the following
 requirements:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The linked Excel data on the slides needs to be accessed in normal view as well as in slide show view. In normal view so that the manager can check data without having to change to slide show view. Slide show view in order to present the data during the
 actual presentation.</p>
<p>2. Keeping the links while merging the slides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we tried several options but we cannot have all of the above. It is no option to fix all the links manually because there are so many. So we tried to solve this problem using the Pack &amp; Go option. But we are still loosing the links as soon as we combine
 the slides which were packed. Keeping source formatting also doesn´t keep the hyperlinks as suggested in some threads. Worse, that way PP is creating more masters in the background which make matters worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any further options I have overlooked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Prabhavathi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your response. Here are the answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. We tried it with Office 365 and Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013.</p>
<p>2. The links are related mostly to Excel. Ideally, we would like to embed PDF documents as well, however, they won´t work at all. By the way, XPS isn´t working either. We get the same error message. According to other threads due to security settings in
 the program Adobe Reader, so we gave up on it.</p>
<p>3. Well there are different ways. Most users tried via drag &amp; drop/copy &amp;&nbsp;paste&nbsp;between presentations. Keeping or not keeping original formatting. We went through all variations. We also merged using the function "reuse slide" (see description here:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Reuse-import-slides-from-another-presentation-c67671cd-386b-45dd-a1b4-1e656458bb86" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Reuse-import-slides-from-another-presentation-c67671cd-386b-45dd-a1b4-1e656458bb86</a>). At last, we had the idea using "Pack &amp; Go", hoping that the links are kept when packing and using the slides from the "packed"
 version. So basically, we opened a new presentation, and inserted the slides including the links from the "packed" presentations.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this explains it better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward hearing from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Nicole,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>1. The linked Excel data on the slides needs to be accessed in normal view as well as in slide show view. In normal view so that the manager can check data without having to change

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;-Whether you are in normal view or slide show view should not be an issue as the data is the same - just one view allows editing and one does not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>2. Keeping the links while merging the slides.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Now we tried several options but we cannot have all of the above. It is no
<strong>option to fix all the links manually</strong> because there are so many.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;- Does this mean the links are there, but the path is no longer valid? When you go to FILE| do you have the option to "Edit Links to Files"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried copying a slide with an linked-to-Excel embedded chart from one .pptx file to another, and the link was copied regardless of the formatting option (H or K). I used PowerPoint 2010 and 2016 and it worked the same in both cases. Can you post a sample
 slide?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi DNA,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. To answer your questions first:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Yes, I do get the options to Edit links to Files.</p>
<p>2. We are using PowerPoint 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I do think I got closer to the problem. I reproduced most of the scenarios I remembered and I noticed that the link only breaks when linking tables and not diagrams or when using hyperlinks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was always wondering why I only got the link option when I pasted a diagram/chart from Excel to PP using smarttags. When I copy and paste a table e.g. A1:F6 I do not get the link symbol in the smarttags. I have to go via the home ribbon and have to paste&nbsp;using
 "paste special". However, linking that way won´t work when we use the slide in other presentations. So the question remains, how do we copy slides that contain linked tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would be the best practice to keep the links for&nbsp;charts and tables when copying/pasting&nbsp;into PP&nbsp;and being able to access the data in normal and slide show view as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>That's odd... most of the time folks lose all of their favorites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is something to try....although I can't say for sure if it will work.&nbsp; There is a free 3rd-party application called EdgeManage that can be configured to show the deleted favorites.&nbsp; If the missing ones are merely deleted, then you can use EdgeManage
 to "undelete" them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take a look at the following article to see if this is something that you'd like to try:</p>
