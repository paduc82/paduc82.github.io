<h2>            Big Problem any help is Appreciated</h2>
                    
<p>OK so let me explain the situation. I have been using an Xbox Live account with the gamertag savdog666. I don't know any of the other information about the account, and whenever I try to find out by email or text, I either don't get the text, and when I
 try to sign into the email that it tells me is associated with the account when playing Xbox, Yahoo says it does not exist. I basically can't get any information from the account no matter what I try. At the same time, I, at one point in time, made another
 Microsoft ID, with the name Savitt. I know all the information with it, though I have never signed in with it on the Xbox, just on the computer. There is no Xbox Live with it. Then we have my CoD Elite account, which has lots of information I don't want to
 lose. This account is tied to my gamertag with xbox live, savdog666. Basically, I was thinking that I could change the Windows Live ID associated with my gamertag, which is associated with my elite account. I could just follow the instructions from this tutorial
 (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y2BZeSNnuk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y2BZeSNnuk</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/3y2BZeSNnuk?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/3y2BZeSNnuk?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>). I just want to know that if I do this, will I keep the gamertag and everything connected to it (i.e. the Live subscription
 and the Elite account)? Or will it change the gamertag and everything. I really want to know all of my info because it keeps becoming an issue. Please help and thank you in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Copying files from virtualstore folder with script&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Using a wscript (vbs) to zip and copy user data/files to a backup folder on the network. For some reason this user (a new client) has all his quicken files in:
<br />
"C:\Users\robert\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\Quicken\"<br />
<br />
The script file opens a cmd windows to run the zip program. But none of the files get copied. I figger it is a permissions issue for running the cmd windows not as an administrator.<br />
<br />
Suggestions please as to how to open an elevated cmd windows from a vbs script.<br />
<br />
Current syntax:<br />
destFile = newFolder &amp; "\quicken.7z"</p>
<p>&nbsp;srcDir = "C:\Users\robert\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\Quicken\Quicken Backup\*"</p>
<p>&nbsp;Set oShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")</p>
<p>&nbsp;oshell.Run "c:\progra~1\7-zip\7za.exe a -r " &amp; destFile &amp; " " &amp; srcDir, 1, true<br />
<br />
The above works fine for the documents folder and contacts. <br />
<br />
Guidance please.<br />
<br />

<h2>            The Mail, Calendar, and People app does not install into my tablet.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;It happened just 4 days ago. One day all my apps were working fine, the Mail, Calendar, and People app along with SKype and MSM Weather and then out of the nowhere they disappear. I let it restart and update many times. But now it won't suggest any more
 updates and the apps still won't download into my tablet start. At first, it would just say it is installed into my et but when i searched up the app again, it still allowed the button for INSTALL. I have gotten rid of so much memory so that's not the problem.
 I don't know what to do anymore. These apps are very important and now their gone.

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro build 10240 Audio &#47; Video Problem</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">So I upgraded my desktop from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 Pro build 10240 with the media creation tool. Ever since the upgrade, the computer no longer plays any sound through any device connected through
 a 3.5 mm audio cable. This includes my regular speakers, Sennheiser headphones, and iPhone earbuds. In fact as long as the default sound device is Realtek High Definition, any videos I play whether it be through Chrome or Edge or VLC stutters and lags. However
 if I change the audio device to play through HDMI (monitors) or USB (Razer Megalodon), everything is magically fixed. Sound is restored and videos stop lagging. I have tried numerous fixes including changing the audio frequency and deleting all sound drivers
 from device manager / reinstalling default drivers. I have even tried deleting all sound drivers and reinstalling older Win7 Sound drivers to no avail. The drivers I currently have installed are the latest nVidia drivers for video and the latest Realtek drivers
 for audio. Does anybody have any idea what might be causing this problem and have any useful suggestions for a possible fix?</span>

    <title>Unable to log in to Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jo-annhowell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to log in to Windows 7</h2>
                    On Friday my Packard Bell laptop with Windows 7 32 bit installed (at purchase, no OS CD supplied) worked fine.<br />
<br />
On Saturday I get: The user profile service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded - repeatedly.<br />
<br />
I began a fix found on the internet, entering using safe made with the command prompt. It may or may not have fixed the profile service failure issue but now Windows 7 no longer recognises my password, which has not changed since I bought the computer 18 months
 ago.<br />
<br />
I have no OS disc, and did not make a repair disc or password recovery disc and there is only one registered User.
<br />
This is because I am a USER not a PROGRAMMER or IT professional; I pay through the nose for your software, and when it goes wrong, I pay again, either in time or tears or money. Thanks for that. Anyway, I digress...<br />
<br />
Many instructions on getting in to change the user password take me via the safe mode with command prompt option, only the first step there is to enter the password, which Windows rejects.<br />
<br />
I used F2 to go into computer settings so it now boots from the DVD drive first, hard drive second.<br />
<br />
Password recovery software: I have tried Ophcrack, PC Login Now, Offline NT Password &amp; Registry Editor - all from bootable CD, the first two not running properly, the last giving me the success message that the password has been cleared, but a blank password
 doesn't work. <br />
<br />
I have downloaded the ISO file for the Windows 7 recovery disc, and burnt it to DVD (Nero) but it is not bootable.<br />
I have redone the above using Imgburn and web advice on the correct settings to make the disc bootable, but again Windows does not boot from disc.<br />
<br />
So what is next please? This is an expensive computer which Windows 7 has rendered unuseable, and I would appreciate it if someone from Microsoft would take responsibility and supply the necessary info and/or hardware required to fix it.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

Your initial post was strong on complaints. In the meantime a volunteer (not an MS employee) went to the trouble of writing a detailed set of instructions to help you fix the problem. Were you considering acknowledging his effort and marking his reply as "Answer"?

            Dear Bill,
<div><br />
<div>I have been out of range of internet and unable to respond, apologies for the delay and sincere thanks for your efforts.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, as stated in my initial post (aimed directly at Microsoft, since this forum bears their logo) I cannot boot the computer in safe mode as the first thing it asks for is the password, which it inexplicably rejects.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will, without fail, test your solution the next time the computer loses its head; as it is I have paid for a repair, and the repairer kindly gave me a copy of his Windows recovery disc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Best regards</div>
<div><br />
<div>Dear Forest Brook,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please see above. Despite a very kind effort unfortunately my question was not answered.</div>
<div>My justified complaints are directed at Microsoft, my bad for assuming they would receive them.</div>

    <title>Win 7 cannot detect Audio output device even with speakers attached - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> block306  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7 cannot detect Audio output device even with speakers attached</h2>
                    
<p>I use a Logitech speaker system on my desktop which have worked without a hitch on Win XP before. My motherboard is a Gigabyte GA-G33M/DS2R. Recently I have upgraded (clean install) to Windows 7 and have to reinstall my sound drivers. I downloaded the latest
 version from the motherboard site, which is a Realtek HD Audio Drivers V2.46.</p>
<p>The speakers works on-and-off with Win7 as the OS mysteriously switch between detecting Audio Output Device and not detecting one. Sometimes I reinstall the drivers again and it worked until now- it just does not detect the speakers at all. When I ran a
 "MMSYS.CPL", there are no speakers being shown as connected (not even the headphone).</p>
<p>Can someone please assist? Thanks.</p>

<p>Already did so. The drivers kept appearing and disappearing after a little while. Check the Control Panel when that happens, sure enough the icon for Realtek also disappeared when it happens.</p>

<p>This is REALLY annoying the ____ out of me. I have the latest Realtek drivers installed and restart. Win 7 will run the drivers and detect my speakers and off I go with a normal pc.</p>
<p>The next time I turn on the pc, the drivers DISAPPEARED mysteriously and the speakers will not be detetcted by Win 7. Troubleshooting only come back to tell me that there are no hardware changes and yet the drivers were gone.</p>
<p>I have to reinstall Realtek again, restart to listen to my music, watch videos etc. But the next time I turn on the pc, it's gone again!!</p>
<p>This seem to be a common problem with many Win7 users (I have read enough in this forum). C'mon MS, it's time to do something right.</p>

<p>This is very frustrating. Now even with re-installing the drivers and restarting, Win7 still cannot detect the audio device and drivers are not in the system.</p>
<p>I have copied the log (Application &amp; Setup) prior to the shut down and uploaded here. I could see why it is doing that.</p>

            It seems like the latest Realtek drivers may not be adequate - they may have some problems. &nbsp;Perhaps, try a previous version of the drivers, if possible.

<p>Well, the latest is v2.47.</p>
<p>I have even tried uninstalling the latest version, restart and use the oldest Win7 compatible version (v2.24) to no avail.</p>
<p>I can see from Realtek as one of the software installed when I view my list of programs, but still the pc is displaying "no audio output device detected". Cannot blame it on Realtek, I guess (as it works before as well).</p>

            First see the various troubleshooting steps here:   <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Next try enabling the Hidden Administrator account to log into and set up a new Local Administrative Account to sign-into, move files over and set up, using whatever method given here that works:  <a href="http://www.top-password.com/blog/4-ways-to-enable-built-in-administrator-account-on-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.top-password.com/blog/4-ways-to-enab...</a>

<br />
<br />To do this you'll need to access a Command Prompt in repair mode by one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  If you don't have the password this may be limited to using the booted media.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options for Command Prompt.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the Troubleshoot Options try a Reset, saving files.
<br />
<br />If this fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Block updates in Windows 10 Home edition</h2>
                    <p>Well i installed windows 10 and well I'm a professional dj and was doing a show in the middle of the show my pc restarted because of the auto update. because of this the owner of the venue asked for a refund. the update restart costed me $1500. dollars.
 i paid a lot for my computer and the software on it. what good is having windows if microsoft decides to take control away from the user. im not maid of money and i cant afford to buy the so called pro or enterprise version. is there going to be an update
 in the near future to be able to disable the auto update and give some control back to the owner? like i said we the public pays money for computers with microsoft windows to us as our work tool what good is that tool if we haft to give refunds from our job.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We are sorry&nbsp;for the inconvenience caused&nbsp;with Windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you know in Windows 10 Home edition&nbsp;there is no option to block or defer windows updates. There is an option to
<strong>schedule the updates i.e., when</strong><strong>(date and time)</strong><strong> the updates should be installed.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may follow the below steps and check.</p>
<p>1. In the search option of the taskbar type "check for updates" without quotes and press enter.</p>
<p>2. Click on advanced options.</p>
<p>3. In the "Choose how updates are installed"&nbsp;section drop down.</p>
<p>4. Select "Notify to schedule restart".(You will be asked to schedule a restart to finish installing updates).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However in rare cases, a specific driver or update might temporarily cause issues with your device, and in this case you will need a way to prevent the problematic driver or update from reinstalling automatically the next time Windows Updates are installed.</p>
<p>You can block a update by following the below article.</p>

<h2>            Installing Windows 7 alongside Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 installed on Partition D. I want to install Windows 7 on partition C but I would like to delete the partition, format it and then create a new partition and install Windows 7 on it.&nbsp; One thing that I know (at least that's what I think)
 is that deleting the partition would remove the windows boot information already on C drive and that I shall not be able to dual boot into Windows 10.
</p>
<p>My question is:</p>
<p>If I proceed, as stated above, how can I get back to Windows 10 on drive D? </p>
<p>How Can I get back the Windows 10 boot manager ?</p>
<p>I don't want to loose Windows 10 because (I love it) I've been using it for a while and have many good apps installed there.</p>
<p>I also need Windows 7 because I have some very good reasons for that.</p>

            Have you obtained your copy of Windows 10 by upgrading from the copy of Windows 7 you plan to use as part of your proposed dual boot arrangements?

            <p>Yes, but Windows 10 was installed from a Windows 8.1 upgrade. </p>
<p>The Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 7 has been removed. I will be redoing it, if possible.</p>
<p>You mean I cannot install that Windows 7 now? Please elaborate, thank you.<br />

            <p>You need to first find out if your system can even run Windows 7.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>A lot of computers that come preloaded with Windows 8 do not have native driver support for Windows 7 by the manufacturer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which versions of Windows is installed on C: and D: drives right now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please note, you will need to have a full version license for both Windows 7 and Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I honestly would recommend you back your data and start over. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Install Windows 7 first, if your computer supports it then create a partition after, then install Windows 10 there.</p>

            <p>Hi Andre Da Costa</p>
<p>Thank you for your very detailed reply but unfortunately it does not address my issue (at least that's what I have figured it out).</p>
<p>Installing two different or same versions of Windows (with separate licenses of course) on different partitions is not an issue for me. Even Windows and Linux, no problem. I have been doing that since Windows 2000.
</p>
<p>My problem is that I am not very familiar with boot manager of Windows 7 and afterwards.</p>
<p>Next I do not at all want to remove Windows 10 on drive D.</p>
<p>Also I want to clean partition C and install Windows 7. My system supports Windows 7 (both 32bit 64bit).</p>
<p>So I ask again or describe my concern</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have a chance to boot into Windows 10 after installing Windows 7 as I have described above?</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>I cannot and I'll have to install both the Windows from scratch?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi Andre Da Costa</p>
<p>Thanks for your help but I am sorry to say that it was not the solution.</p>
<p>I created the Recovery Media (it was not System Repair Disc what you suggested as it is not found in Windows 10).</p>
<p>Proceeded as I described above.</p>
<p>No luck.</p>
<p>Recovery media could only help if a Windows 10 entry exists in the Boot loader (BCDEdit). Since there was no entry, I was left high and dry.</p>
<p>But luckily I found a workaround and finally succeeded in Logging into Windows 10.</p>
<p>That too was not an elegant solution because when I log into Windows 10, the boot menu does not show up on restart and I cannot go back to Windows 7.</p>
<p>However, I managed to solve that but only temporarily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working on that and when I'll be able to find a permanent solution, I'll come back here to post it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meanwhile, if you can guide me, I shall be grateful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help though.</p>

 are really tight. Please let me know if you have any ideas. when my computer upgraded to 8.1 the system crashed and I "fixed" it and some how made all my data save to the recovery instead of c:. HELP!!!</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>

<h2>            ntoskrnl.exe with address 197670 causes BSOD since March</h2>
                    <p>Hello!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote in the Feedback Hub several times, but the answer is not received. The system thinks it's okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use the Windows 10 Home 64-bit since March and I have no more ideas how to cure the computer from DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION which periodically reboots it. I've been looking for answers, updated everything I can. Found a site, where it is indicated that with
 the updating of the controller, the error will disappear. Through device management Windows writes that it is updated. BIOS has been updated in repair. I finally learned how to get the report collected by the system and send it to you:) Computer is 4.3 years
 old.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me what is really causing the error and help me to cure it!</p>
<p>

                    <p>I want to look in my purchase history to see if I have paid to remove ads from one of my apps. When I go to the purchase history page, however, there are key details missing. Descriptions like "Remove ads" and "Upgrade to Pro" leave out a key piece of information:
 the app that the purchase applies to. Even the confirmation email is useless, showing the same description as the purchase history page. Is there any way I can see more detail than this?</p>

<p><span><strong><span>Hi alwan77,</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>1. Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
2. Have you done any recent changes on the computer?</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>You may check if you face similar issue in safe mode. Refer to the below link to boot
 to safe mode -</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span><br />
</span></span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2:<br />
</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>If you do not face the issue in safe mode then you may check in a clean boot state.<strong>To perform the clean
 boot follow the step 1 mentioned in the below article and then try checking in this clean boot state -</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><span>If the issue gets resolved check which non-Microsoft service is causing the problem; referring to the
 article and following other steps.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span>After
 you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On
 the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When
 you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 3:<br />
</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>You may perform a SFC (System File Checker) scan. It will list any issues and will also recover any files if needed.<br />
<strong>Follow the below steps to</strong> <strong>p</strong></span></span></span><span><span><strong><span>erform a SFC Scan</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;-<br />
a. Click&nbsp; <strong>Start</strong>, click &nbsp;<strong>All Programs</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click&nbsp;
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click &nbsp;<strong>Run&nbsp;as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click&nbsp;<strong>Allow.</strong><br />
b. Type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
<strong>sfc /scannow&nbsp; <br />
</strong>A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time.<br />
c. If any files require a replace SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Win 7 DVD for this process to continue.<br />
d. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations".&nbsp;<br />
e. After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan -<br />

    <title>My bluetooth wireless phone is asking for a passkey - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jess_hudson  say:</h3>
<h2>            My bluetooth wireless phone is asking for a passkey</h2>
                    This evening I tried to connect my phone (LG Xenon) to the computer via bluetooth for the first time. Vista got it and instructed me to type a passkey into the phone. Unfortunately the phone had locked by that time and I had to start again. I cannot get
 the computer to give me the passkey again. The phone connects and asks for the passkey, but it seems that the computer can no longer "pair" with the device.<br />
<br />
I go into Control Panel - Hardware and Sound. I choose Add a Wireless Device - select my phone - after a minute of trying to connect it says that it took too long and to try again.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something obvious? I have tried the Knowledge Base, which instructs me to use a wizard, but I have no bluetooth add device wizard.<br />
<br />
Thanks.

<p><span><span>Hi
<span>Jess_hudson,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Most devices let you choose your own passkey or you can use a passkey generated by Windows. To have Windows generate a passkey
 for you, run the Add Bluetooth Device Wizard; otherwise, contact the device manufacturer. Note that some devices use "0000" or "0001" as a passkey.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Remove and then reinstall the device:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click the
<strong>Start</strong> button, click <strong>Control Panel</strong>, click
<strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>, and then click <strong>Bluetooth Devices.</strong>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Select the device that's not working, and then click
<strong>Remove.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Click
<strong>Add,</strong> press the reset button on the device (or make it discoverable following the manufacturer's instructions), select the
<strong>My device is set up and ready to be found</strong> check box, and then click<strong> Next.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. If the device is not found, repeat the previous step. When the device is found, select it, and then click
<strong>Next.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Follow the rest of the instructions in the wizard.</span></span></p>

Hi,<br />
<br />
Thanks for asking! As I understood, you are not able to open spdf file. I would suggest you to follow the troubleshooting steps to check if it helps.<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?
<div>2. Is the issue confined to spdf file?<br />
3. Do you receive any error message?<br />
4. Where did you get the spdf files?<br />
5. Do you have Oracle SealedMedia Sealer software installed?<br />
<br />
SPDF files are regular portable document format files by a program called Oracle SealedMedia Sealer. SPDF files can be viewed with the Oracle IRM Desktop software, which facilitates the authorization rights management for the digital documents.<br />
<div>If you have the Oracle SealedMedia Sealer software installed you should be able to access the files.</div>
<div>You may download a converter and check.<br />
<br />
<span>NOTE: Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot
 guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk<br />
</span><br />
Please reply with the results. I would be glad to assist you further.</div>
