<h2>            How to install fonts with VBA</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an application that is distributed via Mac App Store. Inside this app there is a MS word document that includes sone VBA code that does some installation finishing. There are also some fonts that I used to install with an Apple Script that I copied
 to "<span>~/Library/Application Scripts/</span><span>com.microsoft.Word"
 with VBA code. Until version 16.15 this worked fine and I and my customers were happy.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since 16.16 I cannot access the script folder any more (error 75). As a workaround I tried to VBA-copy the&nbsp;fonts directly to the user's font directory. Same error. Probably this is due to sandboxing restrictions that were not
 implemented before.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any idea is appreciated.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you all!</span></p>
<p><span>Thomas</span></p>

<p>A couple of other people have posted recently with similar problems. I don't have a solution, but in my programming for Mac, I've also found that sandboxing can really tie your hands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt this will help you with font installation, but here is Ron de Bruin's article about Mac VBA and sandboxing. He writes about Excel, but the advice is relevant to all the Office programs.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rondebruin.nl/mac/mac034.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Problems

            Thank you very much, John. But I already knew this article. &nbsp;The problem is, but Microsoft most probably recently changed the excess rights without any announcement. &nbsp;And this is not the first time they did something like this. It’s really a mess if you
 want to satisfy your customers.&nbsp;

    <title>Workbook not found error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sharonr2015  say:</h3>
<h2>            Workbook not found error</h2>
                    In Office 365 and have opened an Excel workbook online, I have selected an area to print, go to file, print, selection and in the print preview window I get an error message "workbook not found". This happens randomly, the only way to correct this print
 preview error is to log out of 365 and log back in again then it will print preview several more times before the "workbook not found" error happens again. I have tried working in 365 in different browsers (IE, Chrome, Firefox). Is there a setting that needs
 to be changed?

            <p>Hi Sharon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Office Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need more information before we start.</p>
<p>Does the issue occur with all workbooks created and saved or with a specific file saved on OneDrive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try logging into OneDrive and then open files in Excel online using office 365 account on a different computer, check how it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have different Microsoft account, if so use that account to Open Excel online, try to create a new file Or open existing, now try to print view the files, check how it works.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above information helps. If you still have questions, you can always reply and I’ll be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Nokia Asha 210 Whatsapp Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ganznmetal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Asha 210 Whatsapp Issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I purchased a Nokia Asha 210 dual sim in India about 2 weeks ago. The Indian version does NOT come with a dedicated Whatsapp key which is completely fine with me. It comes with a dedicated Facebook key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people have complained <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/BFC4207A-6E15-4729-8F0B-4ACC90CFE79D">
here</a>&nbsp;that Whatsapp isnt installing for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However for me, inspite of having the installation file for Whatsapp, it came pre-installed out of the box for my handset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatsapp is working fine for me at the moment, except few bugs that I thought should be posted here for some relevant people who could look at this and take the right steps to correct it during firmware upgrades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if anyone is going through the exact same issue I am facing, then your voting would help make this issue well noted by the people concerned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: This is an exclusive WHATSAPP issue that is running on a Nokia Asha 210 per my experience!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;The first issue is using emoji/emoticons/smileys and text never coming together when you type it manually. The option of adding emoticons to the text just disappears when I start typing. And the other way around, when I start inserting emoticons, the blinking
 cursor just doesnt appear and I am unable to type text. So I can send them seperately, but never together. On the other hand when I copy paste a message from one whatsapp user to another or forward the message to another whatsapp user, in both instances the
 emoticons already typed in the message get sent.</li><li>The notification tone for Whatsapp never works. My phone only vibrates during a whatsapp notification. I tried the default tone and custom tones. But no luck. Otherwise for regular text messages or SMS's the tone works fine.</li><li>During long messages received from other whatsapp users that is more than one page, the text is getting cut either near the top or bottom boundaries of the message box. Might be a bit difficult to explain without a screenshot, but unfortunately I am unable
 to find an app to take screenshots with for Nokia Asha 210.</li><li>When I am pasting a message to be sent to a whatsapp user, the message gets sent automatically without me hitting the send button, the moment I paste it. Now I understand that usually the return function maybe added at the end of the message which is why
 the text would have gotten auto sent, but I tried that without ending the message with a return function/enter key using notes from where I copy pasted this message to whatsapp and voila the message is still getting sent automatically the moment I paste it.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So these are the whatsapp problems I am facing at the moment with my Nokia Asha 210.</p>
<p>The Whatsapp team doesnt have a solution for this as they have confirmed that Nokia is primarily taking care of this by embedding this app into the OS so that a user cannot delete this app by default and that till we get a firmware update, this issue cannot
 be resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally I think that such apps should NOT be embedded with the OS as are preloaded games that have been embedded which is a problem for genuine nokia buyers.</p>
<p>Thankfully I was able to go ahead and remove the preloaded games from the 4GB MicroSD card by accessing the card in LInux and Mac instead of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that apart not being a major problem, the key Whatsapp issues are definitely a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you have the same issues, please go ahead and second this post so that someone from Nokia can take notice of more users facing similar issues and resolve the problem in the next firmware upgrade, which I hope comes soon enuf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>GanZ</p>

            yes the text get cut but while reading jokes.well if you want to read it when the screen ends just press down only one time.for notification sound go to application settings and make sure application tones are to on. If this dosent work update your whatsapp.
 And you purchased it 2 weeks ago make sure that you download music from nokia music app its free for that device for 2 months.and it is also having a movie app better check it out.

            To highlight the currently selected row you can use conditional formatting.&nbsp; To facilitate this you first need to set the value of a hidden unbound text box control in the detail section to the value of the primary key.&nbsp; You'll find an example in FindRecord.zip
 in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file the option to open simulated 'split form' opens a form in which the currently selected row in a subform is highlighted.&nbsp; The fact that it's a subform is immaterial.&nbsp; The code in the subform's Current event procedure is:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' set value of hidden control to current AddressID value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' to facilitate conditional formatting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.txtAddressIDHidden = Me.AddressID<br />
<br />
Each visible control in detail section is conditionally formatted on the basis of the following expression:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [AddressID]=[txtAddressIDHidden]<br />
<br />
As to how it might be done when the mouse pointer hovers over the row I can't help you.<br />

<h2>            &#34;Account Compromised&#34; and locked - no information available on the Recent Activity log.</h2>
                    <p>At around 7:30pm I received an email on my gmail account which is linked to a Live account for whatever reason that it detected suspicious activity and I would need to verify my info upon signing in.&nbsp; I verified myself and reset my password as instructed,
 but when looking at the Activity log&nbsp;the oldest item is from about 10:30pm&nbsp;when it blocked my login and had me reset the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no information on WHAT event actually locked my account, and everybody I've spoken to on the phone runs me in the same circle stating they're not authorized to give out any "personal" information for security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there seriously NO way for me to see what IP address caused my account to be locked? This is ridiculous, the only "security" happening here is protecting the IP of somebody who's attempting to get into my accounts without authorization.</p>

<p>There is no information like that for the Fast ring, which is where 18852 is.&nbsp; The pause is for the release of 17763 to the public.&nbsp; That is not a preview but is the final.</p>

<p>Without any details it is hard for us on this forum which is for testing newer builds of Windows 10 to give you a proper answer, as 1803 is a version build date we need the build number, and some info about your system such as model number the size of the
 SSD, any 3rd party virus programs installed? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading thru your other posting about this same issue who advise you that your system won't work with 1803?</p>
<p>Others have given you some tips but see no reply from you did you try them?</p>

<p>My daughter gave me an old Toshiba Satellite C660-115 which, according to Toshiba, was not compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With everything to gain and nothing to lose, the existing drivers and a Windows 7 OS disc image were backed up to an external drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A USB&nbsp;stick containing W10 install media was then used to clean install W10 on the Toshiba Satellite. This was successful but the computer itself is too slow to be really useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Toshiba means by 'not compatible' is that the crapware on their computers is not compatible with windows 10 so&nbsp;an upgrade from W7 to W10 fails.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to be a clean install meaning that the drive is formatted as part of the procedure but before the
 install.</p>

                    <p>After migrated to buggy Outlook Preview, I have encountered several issues. The issue that annoys me the most is the sender's name display incorrectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Say my name is firstname lastname. And when sending out email, I expected the sender's name to be "Firstname Lastname". However, it turns backwards to "Lastname Firstname", which looks really annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone help me with this issue for I can't find any settings for that?</p>
<p>

            There must be a bug in the site. I had calendars I wanted to remove, and I was never able to do it. Then (several years later) I found this post. I had the same problem, the Delete never showed up (I was doing this in Windows 7, and I did have the latest
 IE browser updates). Then I tried it in IE&nbsp;on Windows 8.1 (which I also have the latest IE updates for), and it worked, I saw the Delete as I was told I would, and it worked. So then I went and tried it in IE on Windows 7 again. Something I noticed it that
 after double-clicking the calendar I wish to delete, the bar with the options would flash the options for a second or two, and then they disappeared, so I was unable to use them. I am assuming this is a browser bug, since it worked in IE on Windows 8.1, but
 not in IE on Windows 7 (both of which I have all updates for IE and Windows).

            I see the same behavior when you click on the calendar, if flashes for a moment with more items and then goes away.

            Thanks. This worked nearly perfectly. If people sync Outlook.com with their Outlook 2013 or 2016 desktop, this will make the calendar disappear on their desktop (which is what I was trying to do in the first place.)

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your issue in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern about deleting a Calendar on your account and we will assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me give you steps on how to delete a Calendar on your account:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Sign in using your Microsoft account&nbsp;at <a href="http://calendar/live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://calendar/live.com</a></p>
<p>2. On your Calendar page, click on the gear icon</p>
<p>3. After clicking the gear icon you need to click <strong>Option</strong></p>
<p>4. After clicking Option<strong>, double click the Calendar</strong> that you wish to delete</p>
<p>5. After double clicking the Calendar you would see the <strong>Delete</strong> option on the
<strong>blue bar</strong> on the <strong>topmost page</strong> besides Calendar link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would now be able to delete a Calendar on your account.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>This was mystifying me, tried it on every browser, then I realised I wasn't seeing the "Delete" button in the black bar at the top next to "Calendar", gah!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I don't know why you say "<strong>double click</strong> the Calendar that you wish to delete". Not needed at all, just
<strong>click</strong> on the calendar that you wish to delete, given it's a webface I wouldn't expect there to be a double-click anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And just a final nitpick; it's <strong>Options</strong> not <strong>Option</strong>, but thanks for your instructions, they really helped!</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>- Did you already try a different headset?</span></p>

<h2>            Wrong language in Outlook search string</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have an issue related to the following post&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_winother/outlook-365-search-parameters-in-wrong-language/a9d800ed-67c9-4027-bec6-5edcd895b1bd</p>
<p>
</p><p>The search string in the outlook is configured to Norwegian, even if the display language in the program for built in search strings is in English. So here is what I do: I put the cursor in the email search. Up pops the predifened boxes such as from: to:
 attachments: and when i fill these in, the til: fra: vedlegg: (norwegian search strings) shows up. I mean come on...I have defined the language to be English. Even when i use the English keyboard this feature is still an issue. I can obviously hard type in
 from: to: has attachments: yes in the search field, but this beats the purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix? Deinstall Norwegian as a language pack on my computer. Is this linked to the overall proofing language in Office?</p>

 works fine. I have a Canon iP4300 printer and the latest (only) Windows 7 64-bit driver is installed. All the latest updates (including the one for Canon printers) have been installed. The problem only began after the last round of major updates. When I attempt

            <p>The Canon printer update had already been installed and reinstallation was not allowed. I just got an "already installed" message.</p>
<p>However, uninstalling the printer, removing all traces of the driver, cleaning the registry with ccleaner and rebooting with the printer disconnected and then reconnecting it worked!</p>
<p>I can now print from IE9 again. I have now uninstalled Google Chrome&nbsp; - who needs two browsers?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Lumia 950</h2>
                    The software update this evening on my Lumia 950 cellphone hung up on the Windows icon. I've even removed the battery but still only get the window. Is anyone having the same problem or can suggest a remedy?

<p>Well, if I do this, won't EVERYTHING be wiped clean?&nbsp; I'd lose all photos, all Contacts (People), all email, everything that's on my Calendar, etc?&nbsp; As it is, this Lumia 950xl dual sim cell phone, AUTOMATICALLY does a&nbsp; "soft reset" after about 15 minutes
 of use; phone call history is gone, can't text message at all, can't log in to&nbsp; Cortana or Feedback Hub, won't stay Signed In to Microsoft Account, even though I always check the&nbsp; "remember me".</p>
<p>What do you think happened?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>OK, so your phone ONLY gets to the Windows Icon then reboots .... correct? If yes, then you do not have access to anything right now which is why I suggest the hard reset. Yes, it will wipe everything and set it up as if it was a brand new phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you set it up using the same Live ID then all your contacts and calendar information will return (so it is not lost). If you had auto-upload enabled for photos then your photos are still in OneDrive and will be viewed on your phone when you set it up
 again. You can check that your photos are uploaded by going to a PC and log into OneDrive. Look at the Photos section and see if they are there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would not restore from a backup but do it fresh. It is easier, faster in my opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You had indicated in your 2nd post that it "<span><em>does a&nbsp; "soft reset" after about 15 minutes of use</em>". So that means it gets beyond the Windows icon or am I reading that wrong?</span></p>

<p>Hey, Jack Cook.</p>
<p>Your comment:&nbsp; "You had indicated in your 2nd post that it "does a&nbsp; "soft reset" after about 15 minutes of use". So that means it gets beyond the Windows icon or am I reading that wrong?"</p>
<p>---YES.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; I CAN get into my phone.&nbsp; There are many things that I can't use per usual.&nbsp; After about 15 minutes of use the phone just arbitrarily restarts itself.</p>
<p>I'm finished with this phone.&nbsp; On to, probably, Samsung Galaxy, but have to study about it.&nbsp; Any thoughts about Samsung Galaxy?&nbsp; Please?</p>

<p>Appreciate your suggestion.&nbsp; If I did the hard reset, &amp; it made the phone worse, then if USCellular offered a trade-in credit, would it reflect badly on the trade-in value?</p>

<h2>            Upgraded Office 2010 to Office 2013 and Lost VBA Modules and Macros from the Old Normal.dotm File</h2>
                    <p>I have a lot of macros in my old Office 2010 Normal.dotm file but when I upgraded to Office 2013 they did not come with the new Normal file. When I checked the VBA I found it did not have the 3 Modules contained in the previous version (and of course no
 macros). </p>

</p><p>Is this just a case of the new Normal.dotm file being located in a different place in Office 2013 or is there something else wrong? I have a backup of the old 2010 Normal.dotm file and tried replacing the new file with the old backup and that this not help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Quick Access Toolbar came through just fine, just no macros. The macro security is set on low. Thanks in advance for your help!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks the response Germain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue in our case is not that our email server is blocked or cannot send emails to Office 365 users. The only case when our emails end up in spam is if the body contains above mentioned links. It looks like Microsoft's Safe Link service is blocking our
 links. Is there a way I can reach out to this team to request whitelisting?</p>
<p>

            Check with Brother if they support Outlook 2013 or when they plan to add support for it.<br />
There is already a version 4 of their Control Center software so try it with that first.<br />

            <p>Can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that Brother Control Center4 (as mentioned by Roady) works just find with O'2013 (at least in 32 bit mode - don't have CC4 installed on any system with Outlook 64bit to know if makes a difference) so you'll need to
 find out (from Brother) if CC4 works with your current Brother printer</p>
<p>(also - do be sure that the bit version of Outlook installed matches the bit version of the Brother CC software installed)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as CC3 goes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which E-mail packages are compatible with ControlCenter3? <br />

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>Came up with a solution for a client on this issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Created a batch file to launch outlook 2013 and attach the scanned file to a new email and then converted the batch file to an executable.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Batch file as follows (update path to outlook.exe if different)</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>@echo off</div>
<div>"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\office15\outlook" /a %1</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then used bat2exe converter (on Sourceforge) to convert the batch file to an executable.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not too sure if the link will stay here or not, so it's called bat2exe,&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bat2exe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/projects/bat2exe/</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Solution is working on Windows 7 64 bit, control center 3.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Add the executable bat2exe generates as the command line to a new entry you add for scan to email in control center's configuration.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got the batch file to open Outlook 2013 after adding it to CC3 configuration, but it doesn't attach the file or open the new email window in Outlook. What am I doing wrong? This is the first time I've used a batch file so bear with me in my inexperience.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            Works great thanks!<br />
<br />
one small problem, there is a command prompt window that remains open after the scan.<br />
I tried adding "exit" on the bottem line of the batch file but the window remains.<br />

Any solutions for this?<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Just create a text file and save it as "brother.bat" in a folder like "c:\brother"<br />
(make sure it has the extention .bat and not .bat.txt or something.)<br />
<br />
then paste the info above in uw batch file<br />
<br />
<div>
<div>@echo off</div>
<div>"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\office15\outlook" /a %1</div>
<br />
then save the changes, open the bat2exe tool and direct it to c:\brother folder.<br />
The tool will now create a file called brother.fix.exe<br />
<br />
Now provide the Brother controlcenter3 with the correct link to the newly create exe file.<br />
For example c:\brother\brother.fix.exe<br />
<br />
The scan to e-mail function will now work.<br />
<br />

<br />
Not all printers are compatible with the Controlcenter4 so you can't update to a newer version.<br />
Seems the batchtoexe does the trick tho<br />

            <p>Thanks B.Goffings,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That did it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was saving the .bat file to the desktop instead of creating the "Brother" folder in C and saving there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your help, and quick reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know as we upgrade to Outlook 2013 in the future for other users this will come in real handy.</p>

<h2>            Only option to purchase not rent</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there have been similar posts before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But&nbsp;most of the replies are about the movie being to new or region issues. I thought I would&nbsp;clarify my question to be more about&nbsp;how some of the movies were published in 2012 and that they are not that new anymore. I purchase and rent ALL my movies from
 the Video App and&nbsp;LOVE how when purchased I can watch on my PC Xbox WP and Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are plenty of movies that I have bought, but there are a quite a few that I would like to watch, only once. I would be happy to rent them but I can't justify the cost of a purchase price to watch a movie only once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to name a few.</p>
<p>Snow White &amp; the Huntsman</p>
<p>Battleship</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now these look like something that would be ok to watch once. But none of them fall into something that put into my collection. I can understand that if it was a new release then it might hold to purchase only... but none of these really qualify as new anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The questions I have are; </p>
<p>Is there a time frame that Movies do go to rent? </p>
<p>Or are these going to be purchase only i<span>ndefinitely?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you so much for looking into this in advance</span></p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Hello Matthew Ashmore:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding your interest in the Xbox Video store and your question about video availability.&nbsp; There&nbsp;is primarily one&nbsp;reason you might find content available only for rent or only for purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That reason is the content provider places&nbsp;restrictions or limitations on the content.&nbsp; This most often is related to other distribution deals they have that might limit what options we can make available.&nbsp; This is often a dynamic situation that will change
 over time.&nbsp; I have seen videos that are only available for purchase have the rent option added, videos that can only be rented have the purchase options added and content that is available for both rent and purchase have one of the two taken away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said I would suggest you continue to check this content and see if the options change.&nbsp; Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns we can assist you with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>

            Tried this advice with no change in results. Install still stopped at 23%/40% and then reloaded build number 10159, so this isn't the solution for my problem. I still received the same error codes and problem report as before.<br />

<p>I have no idea, why all my contact (except those last four) have been deleted and I'm searching for the answer how I can get all my contacts back on my phone.</p>
<p>Could anyone help me?</p>
