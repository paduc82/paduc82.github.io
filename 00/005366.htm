<h2>            Using magnifier causes Outlook to Crash</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My site just upgraded to Windows 10, and I have one employee that since the upgrade cannot have Outlook and Magnifier open at the same time.&nbsp; He has a multi screen set up where he uses two monitors and the display on his laptop.&nbsp; The magnifier
 is kept across the top of one screen.&nbsp; When he&nbsp;opens magnifier, then&nbsp;outlook will crash and say it has encountered a problem and needs to restart, which it will do over and over until you give up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been reading forums for weeks and trying different options.&nbsp; I have done the quick and online repair of Microsoft365, we have done the sfc/scannow and checked for issues, I have updated and verified the drivers on all his monitors, I got him new monitors
 incase that was the issue.&nbsp; I find myself now just rereading forums I have already read and not coming up with any additional options to try.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I just need to reimage the whole computer and start over?&nbsp; If possible, I would really like a Plan B if there is one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Jonnilee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better assist you with your concern regarding Outlook crashes when using magnifier, we'd like to ask some information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When using just only the monitor of the laptop, do you still experience the problem?</p>
<p>2. Since you've mentioned that you've already did the repair, have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the Office 365 and still having the same problem?</p>
<p>3. Aside from repairing your Office 365, what troubleshooting steps have you done so far to fix the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<p>It is my computer is question and I still have the problem.&nbsp; I was googling myself and found this from our IT Tech.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yes the problem still exist with only the Laptop Monitor on.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes Outlook will open but when I switch views to another sub-folder in my eMail it almost always crashes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never&nbsp;had a similar crash with Magnifier off.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Linked Facebook contacts on Hotmail account will not sync with iOS</h2>
                    Hi, I've recently imported contacts from my Facebook account (as well as Facebook email addresses) over to my Outlook.com/Hotmail account's contacts list, and when I go onto my iOS device (Which I have set up to sync with my hotmail account's contacts),
 the only contacts that show up are the ones created or added to (edited)&nbsp;on Outlook.com, meaning that I don't see any of my Facebook contacts or their information on my device, only the stuff that was created on Outlook.com.<br />
<br />
I've reset my email account on the device multiple times, and to prove that the problem is the Facebook contacts, everything else, including my calendars, my mail, heck, even my tasks/reminders (to my pleasant surprise!), and my Outlook.com contacts have all
 synced perfectly fine! <br />
<br />
Here's my info:<br />
<ul>
<li><span>Affected email account: <em>&lt;removed by moderator&gt;</em></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Model of device: <i>iPod Touch - 3rd Generation (Model MC008C)</i></span><font color="#000000">
</font></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">OS version: <i>iOS 5.1.1 (9B206)</i></span><font color="#000000">

It's been a while huh? Sorry for taking so incredibly long to get back to you on this, but my problem has not been solved. My iDevice still does not sync with my imported Facebook contacts, and it never has, even after you guys had made an adjustment to my
 account.<br />

Sorry about that, but better late then never, I guess...<br />

            I can see my Facebook contacts perfectly fine at people.live.com.<br />
<br />
Q&amp;A:<br />
1) I have never been able to sync my Facebook contacts with this device.<br />
2) My iPod Touch (3rd Gen.) is fully updated (I'm using iOS 5.1.1 because that is as far as my device can be updated).<br />
3) I haven't tried configuring a different account, but I'll give it a shot. <br />
<br />
Wait for my response, then.<br />

<h2>            E51 problems with the music player</h2>
                    So I have recently purchased a sandisk 4GB microSD to go with my brand new E51 (got it just over a week ago)<br />
<br />
I put around 3GB worth of music (albums mostly) on the mem card and everything was fine until this morning when I decided to put 5 more albums on it.<br />
<br />
I then proceeded to update the tracks and it removed all of them from the library!? and now I can't add them back!! I had to delete all of the tracks and format the memory card and copy alllll of them back onto it and then the same thing happened!!!!<br />
<br />
anyone know what the problem is and what I can do to fix it please

I can't think of anything that would cause that to happen, but a work around might be to get hold of the free Primo PDF converter that will appear on your computer as a printer and use that to print the document to a pdf file.

    <title>Shapes In Print Preview Full Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> macdaptable  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shapes In Print Preview Full Screen</h2>
                    I found the option to do a "Print Preview Full Screen"&nbsp;in Excel 2016. This what I have always used for print preview but is different from "Print Preview and Print" function that is found by going to File / Print. I am creating a flow chart&nbsp;by inserting&nbsp;standard
 Excel shapes. When I go to "Print Preview Full Screen", any shape, or part of a shape, that is on the bottom 1/3 of the page is cut off. It's not that&nbsp;they aren't&nbsp;there. I know this because it shows up in the "Print Preview And Print" screen. Also, if I send
 it to the printer they print. Has anyone else seen this? Any ideas on what might be causing it?

<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Method 1: Internet Explorer troubleshooter</strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">The built in Internet Explorer performance troubleshooter can detect and fix most of the errors and incorrect settings in Internet Explorer. You can refer to these
 steps to run the troubleshooter:</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">If the troubleshooter didn’t detect any issues, then the issue could be due to a corrupted or outdated video driver. I would suggest you to visit the manufacturer’s
 website and check for the recent Windows 8 display drivers and install them.</font></p>

<h2>            Best way to collect data from multiple documents</h2>
                    <p>I want to create an automatically updating workbook that gets data from other workbooks of the same format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each external workbook contains the exact same table on 52 worksheets from multiple users and I want to put all of the users workbooks into one workbook so all their data is collected together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at Pivot Tables and they don't seem to be able to copied over to each worksheet so we can separate the data weekly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a suitable solution?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's one solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Instead of having 10 workbooks with 52 worksheets each, one can have 520 CSV&nbsp;files (all stored in one folder)</p>
<p>2. Thereafter one can use Power Query to append data from all 520 CSV&nbsp;files into one single range on one worksheet.</p>

<h2>            We&#39;re a Charity, we want Exchange online,  and Office 365 online package</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community, hope a member or Microsoft themselves can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are a charity based in London, we run a Windows server, have a Windows domain network, &nbsp;and run Microsoft Email Exchange on our server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The director of the charity wants to run 1 licence of Exchange Online, and 1 licence of Office 365 pro for user account, so she can access her emails, create documents, but know her work and emails are safe on the Microsoft cloud Exchange, should something
 happen to the our server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I think we may be classed as non-profit-making organisation , what specific monthly package does Microsoft run to address both access for Exchange online, and online office 365 software requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As we are a Charity organisation, &nbsp;but may not be classed as a non-profit-making organisation by Microsoft, &nbsp;what is the cheapest monthly package that would give us both Exchange online function and the office 365 pro package for one domain user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would really be helpful, is if some forum member could direct me to the correct all in one packages by Web link, &nbsp;for both non-profit-making, and the basic profit making monthly package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be great</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Thanks, but I have seen these links, and not one of the packages clearly states that they offer Exchange online, so my question is, is there a non-profit package that offers office 365 &amp; Exchange online as one package, or</p>
<p>Is there a package for the profit making business, or</p>
<p>do I have to get a separate Exchange online package, and office 365 package.</p>

            <p>Well, I am not sure exactly where it says on the site that it is exchange, but the nonprofits are essentially the same as office 365 for business, and I can speak from personal experience that it is exchange online. &nbsp;I used it in the trial, before migrating
 to the exchange online plan 1 and used that until finally migrating to outlook.com premium preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are worried that you will be getting outlook.com instead of their business platform, I am sure you won't.</p>

            <p>Hello Monique, sorry for these slow replies to the thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is just a few of concerns still please, as we are a charity</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we were to go for the Office 365 Non profit business premium package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it confirmed that 'Exchange online' is included in this package?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can a existing 'Exchange server' network domain users migrate onto the Exchange online service?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How many Exchange server email accounts can I migrate onto the 'Exchange online' service for a single monthly package agreement, e.g if there are 3 domain email address, do I need 3 'Office 365 Non profit business premium' package's for each domain email
 address?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help again</p>
<p>

<h2>            Updates on WM phone does not reflect on Windows Live after Sync &#40;the other way works through &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    
<p>I want to have a copy of my contacts/calender/tasks on my laptop's Windows Live Mail&nbsp; IN SYNC with my WM phone</p>
<p>Tried to sync phone with WIndows Live on web (hoping LIve on web will sync with my desktop live mail). However, the updates I make on the phone in contacts does not show up in Windows Live - while any updates done on the Windows Live on Web does show up
 on WM.</p>
<p>I went through earlier threads related to this topic - but there was no conclusion. Is this a bug that Microsoft is working on still?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.</p>

                    <p>The prior edition of Mac Excel (2011) did not support the UTF-8 encoding and there were a number of work-arounds. I'm wondering if they've updated it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>When you use the Text Import [<strong>Data&gt; Get External Data&gt; Import Text File</strong>] method the first page of the
<strong>Text Import Wizard</strong> provides an exhaustive list of formats in the
<strong>File origin</strong> menu. Granted, it <em>defaults</em> to Macintosh, but UTF-8 is included in that list in both Excel 2011 &amp; 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I created a UTF-8 CSV using Apple's <em>Numbers</em> &amp; Excel 2016 opened it right up without hesitation using
<strong>File&gt; Open</strong>. Excel 2011 opened it readily as well, but I had to select
<strong>Enable: All Files</strong> in the <strong>Open</strong> dialog in order for the file to be recognized.</p>

            <p>Thanks for checking with recent version of Excel for Mac.</p>
<p>This led me to repeat my tests that I carried out sometime in 2015. Back then, UTF-8 imports resulted in garbled text.</p>
<p>Today, Excel 15.21.1 imports UTF-8 CSV files just fine, even non-ASCI characters got properly mapped.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I suspect you may be referring to the Sharepoint / Business version. I'm using the Office 365 Home edition. Which appears to be missing the "Site Settings" options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had two incredibly frustrating "Chat support" conversations which involved suggestions like using a substitute type of function to just "display" my data as needed so getting a bit desperate!</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have had my laptop a year with Windows 10. Then yesterday all the word documents would not open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to an IT shop and they suggested deleting Microsoft office and then installing it again. I did but it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely I can open powerpoint and excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Microsoft Office Home and Student 2016. Version 1812</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to open Microsoft word it says that it is not compatible with my operating system.</p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures:
<br />
<br />Try working with the Word Safe mode and check if it helps.
<br />Hold the windows key + Letter ‘R’ on the keyboard to launch the Run command &gt; Copy and paste the following command line in the open box and click Ok.
<br />Winword /safe
<br />
<br />If, word works properly do you need to disable add-ins:
<br />Go into Word
<br />Click on File menu.
<br />Click Options.
<br />Click Add-ins.
<br />Click on Go button besides Manage: Com-Add-in.
<br />Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox to disable them.
<br />Close the Word and restart it.
<br />
<br />In the link below explain how disable add-in:

<br />
<br />If, the procedures above didn't work, I refer to repair Office in the following link for more information:
<br />
<br />Go to Control Panel &gt;&gt; Add and Remove Programs and highlight Microsoft Office. Click on Remove. A menu will pop up allowing you to choose repair or reinstall. Try a Repair Online and verified after repair it fix.

<br /> 
<br />Please let me know if this helped and works.  
<br />

            What you're referring to is the Mini Toolbar which cannot be <em>restored</em> in Mac Office because it never has been included :-) It's a Windows-only feature.<br />
