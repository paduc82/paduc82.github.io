<h2>            Your network access was interrupted. To continue close the database and then open it again. Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>I've got a new problem that cropped up some time ago and only today did I find some critical information about this problem. Every once in a great while, with no consistency, a user will come back to their workstation and find the following error message
 on their screen:<br />
"Your network access was interrupted. To continue close the database and then open it again."<br />
<br />
We have our 2002/2003 format MS Access database backend stored on a shared drive on our SBS 2008 server. All the workstations are connected to the domain and they each have a local copy of the 2002/2003 format MS Access database frontend on their own hard drive.
 The server is a high performance dell with (4) 15K RPM hard drives in RAID 5, 12GB of memory, (2) Xeon processors, and gigabit wires to an unmanaged Netgear switch. All the workstations are gigabit as well. The server does file sharing, printer sharing, DHCP,
 DNS and MS Exchange on our small network. We have 8 workstations in use on a daily basis and two workstations that get used occasionally.<br />
<br />
All the workstations are running Office 2007 or Office 2010. This problem affects both 2007 and 2010. All workstations have MS Updates turned off but we do bring them up to date every few weeks.<br />
<br />
<strong>All</strong> of our <strong>Windows 7 workstations are having this problem</strong> and<strong>only our Windows 7 boxes are having this problem</strong> . These Windows 7 workstations are all 32 bit Dell Optiplex 760 or 780 minitower desktops. The machine
 I'm currently investigating has a built-in Intel 82567LM-3 Gigabit network adapter with driver version 11.6.92.0 from 4/12/2010.</p>
<p>We are using MS Server Backup on the server. I'm fairly sure that this problem is not related to the backup because the problem does not correspond at all with our designated backup times.<br />
<br />
I'm quite sure there is no interruption in network access. All of our XP workstations do not have this problem, including both those that are heavily used and those that are used lightly. I've checked for errors in the event log on the server and the Windows
 7 workstations and there are no related errors logged on either one. There are no distantly related errors. Nothing is logged around the time of the so-called "disconnect". I'm quite positive the network is not dropping connection at all, and if it is, it
 has to be the sort of hiccup that is so brief that there are no popups, warnings, errors, etc., other than this MS Access problem.<br />
<br />
Our network is a controlled environment. We have content filtering using OpenDNS and we have Norton Antivirus 2011 installed on every workstation. We haven't had viruses on any of our workstations in a couple years, maybe more. We don't have any other applications
 giving any error messages remotely similar to this.<br />
<br />
I do not believe this is a problem with our network as it is fast and rock solid. Our server is very clean and never needs rebooting unless we are installing some kind of updates or software that requires it. I do see a lot of other posts online about this
 problem but so far there don't appear to be any solutions, only the standard rhetoric of "check your network" which is clearly not doing anything to escalate and solve this issue.</p>
<p>I did have to make some changes in the registry on our server right after we rolled out the new server. The changes I'm talking about are specifically "Turning off the sharing violation notification delay". You'll see this documented on Microsoft's website
 at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/889588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/889588</a> . We made these changes because there was a very long delay when more than one user was using the database. This was also true of our 2003 Server and we had made those same changes on there as well.</p>
<p>How would you recommend troubleshooting this issue? I can probably do wireshark if necessary although the problem is fairly infrequent, maybe once or twice per day. It will require running any analysis tool for many hours in hopes that the problem occurs.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi HKoehn,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Normally, when we see this type of error message, though it may not seem like a network problem, it actually is.<span>&nbsp;</span>Access depends on a stable network connection
 and when that connection is interrupted in any way, it will display this type of message.<span>&nbsp;</span>A common symptom we see when Access displays this error is when you look at your mapped network drives on the machine, they will show as disconnected.<span>&nbsp;</span>My
 recommendation would be to have the user look at their mapped network drive as soon as this error message is displayed and see if they are showing as disconnected.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I would assume the next question would be why is it only happening on your Windows 7 machines?<span>&nbsp;</span>Unfortunately, networking is not my specialty, but it seems
 like a lot of times this problem does occur with newer operating systems and SMB 2.0 traffic / settings.<span>&nbsp;</span>I have seen several different steps used by our networking and platforms teams to fix issues with mapped network drives disconnecting and
 it appears one of the fixes they try (besides updating NIC cards) is installing the hotfix(s) in KB 982860.<span>&nbsp;</span>Though it doesn’t list the exact symptoms you are experiencing, it appears it does update some files and SMB settings.<span>&nbsp;</span>If
 you have a test environment that you can reproduce the issue on, it may be worth trying to test this fix.<span>&nbsp;</span>If you need more information about the fix and / or the impacts it will have, then you may want to consider opening up a support ticket with
 Microsoft so they can look at your exact issue and discuss the impacts of this fix.<span>&nbsp;</span>But once again, I would first verify that your mapped network drives are showing as disconnected immediately after you see the error message.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>982860<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A computer that is running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 takes four minutes to open a Microsoft Office 2003 document from a network
 share</span></span></p>

<p>This problem does indeed appear to be an MS issue related to SMB 2.0. Here's a post where the user came to the same conclusion:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.experts-exchange.com/OS/Microsoft_Operating_Systems/Server/SBS_Small_Business_Server/Q_25594983.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.experts-exchange.com/OS/Microsoft_Operating_Systems/Server/SBS_Small_Business_Server/Q_25594983.html</a></p>
<p>I'm currently testing a work-around on one workstation where I have&nbsp;disabled&nbsp;SMB 2.0. I think I will try applying the hotfix to another workstation so that I can compare the two "fixes" to see if both of them resolve the error.</p>
<p>If this is in fact an SMB 2.0 issue, as I presume it is, I'm quite miffed that the general reply is, in your own words, "<span>though it may not see like a network problem, it actually is". I've read many other
 forums posts on this issue and the symptoms are always the same; it only affects Windows 7 workstations connecting to Server 2008 while the XP workstations continue to run without any problem. I believe this "check your network" approach closes the door for
 MS to find a resolution to the real problem.</span></p>
<p>I work from a remote location so I have not been able to check to see if the network drives are disconnected or not when this happens. If I do find out, I'll report back.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi HKoehn,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks for the reply.<span>&nbsp;</span>The reason I said it normally is related to a network problem is because this error is usually directly related to some sort of
 networking issue, such as mapped network drives disconnecting, outdated drivers, or a machine being disconnected from the network (not just SMB 2.0 traffic, though lately this has been more and more common).<span>&nbsp;</span>In the scenario you bring up, I believe
 the SMB 2.0 problem doesn’t present itself on Windows XP machines because I don’t think this networking protocol was introduced until Windows Vista.</span></span></p>

            <p>I would be interested in hearing whether or not the hotfix helped with this issue. We have much the same issue, Vista and Windows 7 both have problems with network disconnects to databases stored on our servers. Multiple XP systems connected to the same
 network do not exhibit the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until recently it was only an issue for one of our developers, and he had simply given up on using the Vista system on any Access database opened remotely. Before giving up on it though, we went through three network cards and completely replaced the wiring
 for the Vista system. Now we've added three new Windows 7 workstations and they are showing the same symptoms. The share is on a 2008 Server, so I am fairly certain this is the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will be testing this evening after disabling SMB 2.0.</p>

            <p>I'm also interested in hearing if this worked. I have the same problem on all our new Win 7 machines, while the XP ones remin unaffected. I can also add that the network shares don't appear to be disconected when this error occours and I also tried all new
 wiring and various other measures to overcome this problem to no avail (although un-installing HP's security tools stops other fatal crash errors when openting tables in table view).</p>
<p>Hopefully now a few months have passed since these previous posts someone can confirm weather these measures seem to work (or not)</p>

            I have applied these fixes to both my 2008 server and the windows 7 and vista clients.&nbsp; The issue still remains.&nbsp; I also went as far as setting up a new 2003 std server and moving the data to it.&nbsp; Clients are still getting the error.&nbsp; I have 2 customers
 that are having this issue and the common thread between both of them is that we moved them to a virtual enviroment running on VMWare 4.0.&nbsp; I am going to focus in on that to see if the issue is stemming from there.

<a href="http://forums.iis.net/t/1071472.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.iis.net/t/1071472.aspx</a>&nbsp;there is a problem with file servers and IIS disconnecting user profiles network connections.&nbsp; I have not tried the above it
 look like you might have to reboot which is a pain for me.&nbsp; I was thinking that windows server software&nbsp;is monitoring network resources and disconnecting if there is not current activity.

<h2>            Deleted messages</h2>
                    I was wondering if Skype has a server that is saves messages on them, My old computer crashed, and i have changed cell phones a couple times. My fiance and I are trying to get our Fiance visa, and i was wondering if there is any way of retrieving old messages
 from over 2 years ago Or even just getting a PDF of them to put on a jump drive.

            My sincere apologies. Skype servers store only last 30 days of chats. For messages older than 30 days, you will need to access your devices only.

<p>Hi Jgould,</p>
<p>So far, we have received several reports about the 550 5.1.8 issue. It seems the senders are blocked from EOP. To further investigate the issue, I would like to collect the entire Non-delivery Report (NDR) and your tenant information (you need to involve
 your admin if you are not). I have sent a private message to you to request it, and please reply to me at your convenience.</p>
<p>To see the private message, please perform the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Please go to Your details section on the right side of the community site.</p>
<p>2. Click Private messages.</p>
<p>3. Click the subject title of the response to read the message.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Can I print a .pdf file from Access 2007 with a command button&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nancydocken  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I print a .pdf file from Access 2007 with a command button&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I believe I saw an answer to this that would work if only I knew HOW to use the information.</p>

<p>Albert D. Kallal responded to a similar question earlier by posting the following code:</p>

<p>
CreateObject("Shell.Application").Namespace(0).ParseName("c:\mypdf1.pdf").InvokeVerb ("Print")</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
He mentioned that one must be able to "right click" something and print it.</p>

<p>I have a database that is used to store information about clothes tailoring. There are some .pdf forms describing how clients can take their measurements or&nbsp;change the neckline or sleeve on a pattern&nbsp;and send them back to me, but I haven't found a graceful
 way to send them to my clients.&nbsp;It would be great if I could&nbsp;place some buttons on my "switchboard" to print out a .pdf document as a blank form that people can fill out and fax or mail back or just use as a guide while they work through a process. So where
 do I put that code? Does it go into the click event on the command button's Property Sheet? And when and where do I right click?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for any assistance you can give me on this, and please accept my apology for being so dense.</p>

<h3> ss_2014  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using a purchased MS Office license on a new laptop which is replacing a defective laptop</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Dell Inspiron laptop in March 2014. I installed MS Office 2013 on it after purchasing and downloading the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within days, the laptop had problems with it. I returned it to get another similar laptop from the retailer. I installed MS Office on it. Same license as the above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The replacement laptop stopped working in September. Dell tried to fix it under the manufacturers warranty. They couldn't. After 5 weeks of trying, they are giving me another new similar laptop. They are not going to send me the defective machine. I do have
 the serial number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd want to install MS Office on the new laptop I am about to receive now. But I've used up my two copies per license.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I use my purchased license of MS Office on this laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

                    <p>The Redmond-based company has finally broken the silence and said that Windows 10 Home will be priced at $119 and Pro will set you back $199; to upgrade from Home to Pro, you will need to pony up $99.</p>
<p>The company issued the following statement to Neowin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The easiest way to get Windows 10 is to upgrade for free. You may also purchase a copy of Windows 10 if you decide not to upgrade, or if you need to purchase a copy for other reasons like installing on a PC you built yourself. The suggested retail prices
 for Windows 10 in the U.S. are the same as Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home is an estimated retail price of $119. Windows 10 Pro is an estimated retail price of $199. And Windows 10 Pro Pack, which enables you to upgrade from Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro, is an estimated retail price of $99. All these are available
 in stores or online.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Thanks for the info, Andre.&nbsp; What is the relationship between MS and Neowin?&nbsp; I never heard of Neowin prior to today, and am curious as to why MS didn't just post that info on their own web site.</p>

    <title>Copy Multiple Worksheets into single worksheet Excluding certain - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sean in mi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy Multiple Worksheets into single worksheet Excluding certain worksheets</h2>
                    <p>I have 97 worksheets each having headers in the first 2 rows. I need to copy the rows with data from all worksheets starting with "ID#", using a control button, but exclude header rows (1-2). The destination worksheet (LOG_HISTORY) will also have headers
 in rows 1-3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rows have no blanks in between in column A, which is how i need it to know which rows to copy...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to copy values &amp; formatting, NOT formulas</p>
<p>I need it to clear the old history (NOT HEADERS) before it pastes in the new data (Row 3 &amp; down)on the DestSh(LOG_HISTORY).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hugh thanks to anyone who can save me... Thanks<br />

    <title>MSFT &#42;BILLING - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> merrymontgomery  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSFT &#42;BILLING</h2>
                    <p>I recently noticed an item on my bank account, shown as MSFT *BILLING CD 0187. for £31.99 (I am in the UK).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I logged into my Microsoft account to check my payment history to see what it related to. However when I tried to enter that area of the site I was asked for security info ( a part of my email address) which, when I submitted it, said it did not have an
 alternative email address associated with my account and asked if I would like to offer a mobile phone number as a new security to which they could then text a code to. I duly entered my mobile number and a text was sent to it with a code. I entered the code,
 which was accepted but then told me that the new security would not allow me to access that part of my account until the 2nd September 2015! That is a month away!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How on earth do I now find out&nbsp;the answer to my original billing enquiry?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. - remember I am in the UK</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The 30 day waiting period can<strong> not </strong>be waived. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. What should I know about the 30-day waiting period?</strong></p>
<p>Even when you choose to delete your out-of-date security info, MS don't fully remove it for 30 days.
</p>
<p>This waiting period helps to deter hackers from updating your security info and gaining access to your account without your knowledge.
</p>
<p>After 30 days, the user of the account <strong>will</strong> be able to access the security settings and update his/her preferred information.</p>
<p><strong>But the waiting period doesn't mean you're locked out of your Microsoft account.
</strong></p>
<p>Check to see if you can still access your emails via <a href="https://mail.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>https://mail.live.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>2. </strong>Should you have any problems go &nbsp;<span><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/id-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></span>&nbsp; and click the error you need help with

            <p>Hi Merry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Billing Information is part of your account's sensitive information.&nbsp;Therefore, an extra verification is asked (Security Code) to access these info. If the option provided to you is not available anymore, you will undergo an update procedure, which
 does take 30 days to take effect. This is a protection against hackers who try to update the account without authorization, as 30 days is a lot of time for owners to notice the&nbsp;ongoing changes on their account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, your Billing Info cannot be accessed for now, so if you want to review your payment history, or make some changes like updating your credit card info, you can contact Microsoft's Accounts and Billing instead.</p>
<p>

            Right-click on the Quick Access Toolbar and choose Customize the Ribbon. In the Customize the Ribbon dialog, on the right-hand side, there is a list of tabs. Expand the Review tab to display the various groups. I'm guessing that your Tracking group is
 missing. Under "Choose commands from" on the left, select Main Tabs and expand the Review tab. Select Tracking there and click Add.

            <p>I am having the same problem. I have a custom domain hosted by Yahoo on their servers (pop.bizmail.yahoo.com and smtp.bizmail.yahoo.com). I set up Outlook (not Windows Live) to retrieve and send e-mails through that custom domain. This worked fine for many
 months, then suddenly....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way I set it up is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. My primary alias was an e-mail address on my custom domain</p>
<p>2. A send/receive account was set up using the pop/smtp server settings provided by Yahoo</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said, this worked fine for many months, and then just stopped, with an error message saying "we were unable to sign in to your pop server, please make sure your username and password are correct" (which they were).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried setting up a different primary alias (a 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** address) and then removing and re-adding the custom address as a new account - but I still get the same error, and Outlook won't add the new account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am now able to SEND mails through Outlook using&nbsp;my custom&nbsp;domain (i.e., using my custom address as an alias), but completely unable to retrieve mails. Repeated attempts to set up the custom account again as a send/receive account are unsuccessful - Outlook
 simply appears unable to see and talk to Yahoo's servers, I keep getting the same error message (as above).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The pop/smtp settings, ports etc. are correct - exactly as provided by Yahoo, and the same as what was working for months before the current problems</p>
<p>2. My username and password have been correctly entered (repeatedly!)</p>
<p>3. I travel a lot, and am often in different time zones around the world - I never change the local time on my computer. I am wondering whether the problem may be due to:</p>
<p>a. Time differences or mismatches creating sync problems</p>
<p>b. Connections through servers in different countries creating the problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help? I just want Outlook to talk to Yahoo and get me my mails!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!! :-)</p>

            I really believe the problem lies with Yahoo.&nbsp; They do not support POP3 for their free accounts, but are supposed to when they handle e-mail for an ISP like ATT.Net.&nbsp; Earlier this year the same thing happened when they stopped allowing POP3 for the AT&amp;T
 e-mail accounts.&nbsp; They fixed it eventually but I believe it has happened again.<br />
<br />
While searching through the AT&amp;T site I did find a notice saying that their were problems and that AT&amp;T and Yahoo were working on it.&nbsp; One of the 2 accounts that I have set up to use with Outlook.com will receive mail once or twice a week now, but not every
 day.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
All of my settings are correct and have worked for months before this.&nbsp; I just wish Yahoo would get their act together.<br />

            I am having the same problem. Outlook was sending and receiving email from my Yahoo account fine until yesterday, 12/11/13. Now it will send but not receive email from Yahoo.&nbsp; I pay for the Yahoo mail plus subscription. it is not due to renew again until
 next summer. I have not changed any settings.<br />
This is the error I am receiving...<br />
<br />
Task *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - Receiving' reported error (0x80042108) : 'Outlook cannot connect to your incoming (POP3) e-mail server. If you continue to receive this message, contact your server administrator or Internet service provider (ISP).'<br />
<br />
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br />

            The problem is not with Outlook, it is Yahoo. &nbsp;They've had e-mail outages all week. &nbsp;One of the problems is that they only allow pop3 access to paid users, or in my case, to users whose ISP uses them for it's e-mail. &nbsp;They keep having issues where they
 treat ISP e-mail like their unpaid users. &nbsp;Try to login to their e-mail site directly instead of using Outlook and you might get your mail. &nbsp;If it follows the past pattern, suddenly your Outlook inbox will be full of new e-mails once they fix this.
<div><br />
<div>I've been having problems with them for months, and from my research can almost guarantee that it is not Outlook, but Yahoo with the problems.</div>

            <p>Hey all,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I know that Yahoo has had serious issues all this week, and also that they are not the most reliable outfit, but I really don't think it's them. My problem began weeks ago -- intermittently at first, but now, Outlook just can't connect to Yahoo.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I received some private replies, and the moderators asked me to try and connect to Yahoo through a desk to client. I was successful with several clients, including MS Outlook (desktop). So, the problem is NOT Yahoo.</p>
<p><br />

<p>The moderators confirmed as much to me through private messages on this thread. They assured me that they would look into it. That was over 3 weeks ago. Nothing since.</p>

            Yahoo has had issues with POP3 for months. &nbsp;The first time it happened I finally got hold of someone at Yahoo tech support who said the issue was theirs. &nbsp;It has not been stable (Yahoo) for quite some time. &nbsp;So, this is not a new issue. &nbsp;I sometimes go
 days not being able to get my mail, then it all floods in at once.
<div><br />
<div>If you have another pop3 e-mail client like Incredimail, I think you'll see the exact same issue accessing any pop3 account on Yahoo's mail servers in which you are not a paid member.</div>

            I am having the same problem. &nbsp;It worked for a long time and stopped about two weeks ago. Yahoo pop mail thru Gmail and using any type of email client works, now it just works one time when I initially add the Yahoo account but never again after that.
 &nbsp;If I "resave" the settings, it will again retrieve the Yahoo mail.

            <p>Did you look at the code presented by Tushar Mehta on this page?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tushar-mehta.com/excel/templates/match_values/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tushar-mehta.com/excel/templates/match_values/index.html</a></p>
<p>I have copied the code he published there and it appears below - you can copy it from this posting or from his original source on that page and paste it into a regular code module as I described earlier.&nbsp;
<u>The macro you want to call is <strong>startSearch</strong></u>.&nbsp; Note his instructions for use at the start of that routine:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The selection should be a single contiguous range in a single column. _<br />
The first cell indicates the number of solutions wanted. Specify zero for all. _<br />
The 2nd cell is the target value. _<br />
The rest of the cells are the values available for matching. _<br />
The output is in the column adjacent to the one containing the input data.<br />
</p>
<p>This may require you to copy your 3500 numbers to another worksheet so that you can use his code to arrive at a solution, since it needs 2 rows at the top of the list of 3500 entries for information and also will put the results into the column next to the
 numbers to be examined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>here is Tushar Mehta's code:</p>

            You probably can't, but checkout the Fn lock function in the Lenovo BIOS. I believe you press F1 to open the BIOS on boot up with this model. This is something you need to take up with Lenovo. it is not a Microsoft Office issue.<br />

            Thanks a lot for your prompt response. To answer your question, I have installed only windows updates as I do regularly but I haven't made any changes. And the problem still persists. Online repair as Suggested is still pending and I will do it in a while.
 Regards, Col Deb.

<p>Thanks for your reply. Online repair wasn't helpful and the problem still persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be really great if you can find an answer to my query. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On my keyboard the shortcut key i am having problem with is between Alt and Ctrl key on right of the space bar. When I press this shortcut key a shortcut menu pops up. The 'Insert' option of this pop-up menu remains deactivated, but the 'Delete' option remains
 active. Before i encountered the problem, even the 'Insert' option remained active and i could insert row or column. Now i can't do that and have to use the use the 'Insert' option of the Home menu thereby detailing my process a great deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me out with this problem.</p>
<p>

            This sounds like a hardware problem. If you use a different mouse, does the problem go away? &nbsp;If your mouse is wireless, try new batteries. Clean the mouse bottom and the surface, or try a different surface for the mouse.

<h2>            Cannot add a shape to existing canvas in Word so that it will connect with other shapes &#40;connectors not visible&#41;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm so flustered with this - I'm making a diagram in Word by inserting Canvas first, then connecting geometrical shapes with lines / arrows. It works great with connector points, and I can later re-arrange the placement of shapes and it all moves together.
 BUT: Once I'm done for the day and save my work, that's it! Next day I cannot add any line or shape to the canvas in a manner that it would still connect with the rest of the diagram! I click on canvas to make sure it's selected, I click "insert shape" (but
 also tried copy-pasting the lines / arrows I already have in this canvas!) and it pastes it alright, but would not show connectors on the existing shapes, so I cannot finish my diagram! Any solution for this?? Thanks!</p>

    <title>Two notebooks with same name, can&#39;t rename section, now section - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> svtdougm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two notebooks with same name, can&#39;t rename section, now section disappears</h2>
                    I'm using OneNote 2010.&nbsp; Love the program, until tonight.&nbsp; I was in one of my notebooks, and noticed that one of my sections - which I had named prior, displayed "New Section 1" as the title tab.&nbsp; (this section had one page with lots of notes)&nbsp; Weird -
 so I renamed it back to MyName - pressed enter, fine, then about 3 seconds later, the name reverts back to "New Section 1" on its own!&nbsp; What?&nbsp; I try naming the section MyName2 - same thing.&nbsp; MyName3 - same thing.&nbsp; I create a new Section - "New Section 2".&nbsp;
 Then try to rename "New Section 1" - no good - reverts back.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I changed to another section or notebook, then back to subject Notebook and section - and its gone!&nbsp; The section with my page of notes is gone!&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I checked the Recycle Bin - nothing.&nbsp; I quickly close OneNote - log in to SkyDrive - its gone from Skydrive.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I checked the folder structure - nothing.&nbsp; For grins, I checked the Windows Recycle Bin - nothing.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Then I notice that there is another Notebook in the list of Recently Closed Notebooks with a notebook of the same name as my subject notebook.&nbsp; Then I check the OneNote file folders - only one folder with my Notebook name.&nbsp; But the folder has only one section
 in it, where the one I was using had 3 sections, before I lost the one.&nbsp; Still can view 2 sections in OneNote.&nbsp; So it seems somehow that I have duplicate Notebooks - the one in the folder list is NOT the most current - it has only one section.&nbsp; I can open
 that Notebook, and view the one section - but it does NOT contain the missing section or the other section??&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long story, but I have a hunch the duplicate notebook names has something to do with the missing section and page, and the inability to rename a section.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So how do I get out of this mess - and possibly recover the missing section and page?&nbsp; How do I get rid of the second incomplete notebook?&nbsp; I am reluctant to delete it now, thinking it might be my only hope at recovering my missing section/page.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
BTW, I am not sharing any Notebooks with other users, just syncing to SkyDrive and Android device using OneNote Android app.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!<br />
<br />
Doug<br />

<p>
</p><p>ALSO, I need to know, is there a free Yahoo app for my microsoft Lumia phone, that is the real Yahoo app and is not full of ads? &nbsp; &nbsp;I currently have a Yahoo app, but it is full of ads and takes me forever to get to the regular email? &nbsp;Can anyone answer this

<p>Hi Prufrockx,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried uninstalling through Settings &gt; Installations &gt; Already installed? Go to there, then tap and hold on the items you wish to remove and select Remove. You will need to remove "Microsoft Apps", "Microsoft Communicator", "Microsoft Lync", "Microsoft
 Shared".</p>
        </p>

<p>I too would like to fully remove these but the uninstall doesn't completely remove everything as&nbsp;it still leaves the Microsoft apps icon &amp; coresponding software&nbsp;behind&nbsp;which consumes about&nbsp;10Mb of RAM.</p>

<p>The uninstall instructions for MS Apps can be found in the FAQ below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The apps are uninstalled in the normal way via the "Already installed" menu. The start icon for the apps cannot be removed but the actual apps get deleted.</p>
