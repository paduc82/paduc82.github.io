<h2>            How to remove the number showing the unread emails in the Inbox folder if the emails are already deleted from the phone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My husband got a new Samsung Galaxy S4 and it was set up to send his sent and received texts to our email inbox.&nbsp; He changed it on his phone but the number of texts still shows up on my inbox count but not in the inbox itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I delete them when they aren't there to delete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My husband deleted them off his phone but they stayed in the inbox number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

    <title>Excel 2007 does not calculate formulas. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andy_817  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2007 does not calculate formulas.</h2>
                    Excel 2007 does not automatically calculate all formulas. Calculation options is set to Automatic. F9 has no effect. Clicking Formulas|Calculate Now has no effect. If I highlight the column, select Data|text to columns, ONLY that column WILL recalculate
 (every time), so I know the functions work. If I put the cursor on the formula &amp; click the check-mark, ONLY the cell containing the formula will update. All cells in question are formatted 'General'. The sheet is large, and contains simple formulas as well
 as references to Macros. All macros have been Debugged using the 'compile' option. At random times, the whole workbook will update/recalculate, often if I make a change in a macro, but not always (less than half the time). Saving &amp; re-opening the workbook
 does not seem to have any effect. The keywords here seems to be RANDOM and UNPREDICTABLE

            Thank you very much for your reply Ashish!<br />
<br />
When I select all, or only some of the cells that should be calculating, and press ctrl+H, I recieve a message that says "Cannot run the macro "workbookname'!Record4'. The macro may not be available in this workbook or all macros may be disabled".<br />
<br />
A. I know for a fact that macros are not disabled, as they will occasionally execute, as when I highlight a column and click "Text-to-columns" and then "Finish". BTW, sometimes doing this will cause the entire page to recalculate (not just the column.) But
 only sometimes, and it does not ever seem to get the entire workbook to recalculate.<br />
<br />
B. I can find no reference to a Record4 in the workbook anywhere. (I searched within the workbook, using 'Match entire cell contents', so I don't know where that message could be coming from. ) I am also quite confident that the functions (macros) referenced
 in the cells are not calling any subs or functions other than those in the module.<br />
<br />
Thanks again! I will be responding to Daniel Jackson next. There may be additional info posted which may be helpful!<br />
<br />
Andy<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have an update!!!<br />
<br />
I entered the name manager and deleted a bunch of names for which the 'Refers To' column showed '=#REF!#REF!. I didn't check at the time but checking an earlier version indicates "Record4" was deleted.<br />
<br />
I tried the ctrl+H trick again, and now it tells me that over 7800 replacements have been made, and it appears that the entire sheet is really up to date (no cells have $VALUE!). This is excellent news, as I can now calculate the sheet, and have confidence
 in the results. Thank You! If we can figure out why it doesn't do this automatically, that would be great, but I am very happy with where I am now. Thanks again.<br />
<br />

            Thank you Daniel for your reply, &amp; for offering to help out.<br />
<br />
To answer your questions, yes, the file contains a number of functions (macros). The main sheet is a rather complicated aircraft performance analysis page, which looks up propulsion data from tables on another sheet (among other things). In order to restrict
 the scope of my problem search, I have been focusing on a particular page which does nothing more than plot out propulsion data for a range of speeds &amp; altitudes, primarily as a data-sanity check. Each cell contains a reference to the same macro-function.
 There are 2 possible pages of performance data. The macros contain a reference to a cell on the sheet which contains the name of the propulsion-data sheet to use. In theory, I should be able to change the name, and recalculate the sheet using Formulas | Calculate
 Sheet. In practice, if I try the Data | Text-to-Columns trick, I will eventually get good results with either data sheet.
<br />
<br />
I am not experiencing this type of problem on a file that does not contain macros.<br />
<br />
Addl info:<br />
&nbsp;I had been concerned that there might be circular references on the main sheet, but this sheet will occasionally calculate correctly, so I don't think that is a problem, not to mention that I never get any warnings about circular references.<br />
<br />
Although I am not by any means a VBA expert, I have done quite a bit of programming, and I am do not see any problems in the macros. I am defining my own type and passing an instance to a sub, but otherwise the functions are pretty straight-forward.<br />
<br />
I made a copy of the workbook &amp; deleted all pages &amp; modules not required to run the propulsion check. No improvement.<br />
<br />
I hope this answers your questions, &amp; thank you for your effort.<br />
<br />
Andy<br />

            Hello
<div><br />
<div>the replace all is indeed working but it's a manual operation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Creating a filter on those columns, open one of them, clicking ok</div>
<div>will give the same result.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But I do not want todo this, Users receiving a daily report must</div>
<div>not have anything to do wioth the file.&nbsp;</div>
<div>And vba is not an option here (no xlsm allowed)</div>
<div><br />
<div>So the question : is there a way to prevent this issue instead of fixing it manualy?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>

<h2>            Removing &#34;Send to Bluetooth&#34; Menu Item Permanently from Word 2000</h2>
                    
<p>Just installed Word 2000 on a brand new Win7 machine bought straight from the OEM (Dell).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the bottom of the File menu in Word 2000, there is an item, "Send to Bluetooth", which I want to get rid of. If I use Customize to remove that menu item, it goes away, but only temporarily: after I close Word 2000, the next time I open Word 2000, that
 menu item is back. I can remove any other menu item permanently via Customize with no problem; it's just that one "Send to Bluetooth" item that refuses to go away and keeps getting restored. How can I remove it permanently?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For reference, I also have Word 2000 installed on a WinXP machine, and the "Send to Bluetooth" menu item does not appear at all on that machine, so I know it must be removable.</p>

<p>The menu item is probably added by an add-in (global template). Take a look at your startup folder for Word (by default C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\Startup); you need to show hidden files and folder to see it because AppData is a hidden
 folder.</p>
<p>If you see a file there that is related to Bluetooth, move it out of the Startup folder, then start Word.</p>

            I checked the folder. The folder exists...but it's also empty (and yes, I am showing hidden items in Windows Explorer), so that's not it, unfortunately.

<p>I actually already thought of and tried that to no avail; just forgot to mention it. I checked both "COM Add-Ins" and "Templates and Add-Ins," and both are empty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, some more information: when I click on the "Send to Bluetooth" menu, I get a "Bluetooth Send Wizard" dialog box. I was hoping that it would be an independent executable so I could track down the offender, so I used the Windows SysInternals Process
 Explorer utility (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653) to investigate, but it reports the Bluetooth dialog box as running under Winword.exe (and if I use Windows Task Manager to kill Word, it also kills that dialog box), so no luck there;
 it appears to be integrated into Word rather than some fully-independent executable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Broadcom's WIDCOMM Bluetooth Software came pre-installed with the machine, and I suspect that is what is generating the menu item, but I don't want to uninstall the Bluetooth support software entirely from my machine; I just want to stop it from creating
 that menu item (if it is indeed responsible).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could it be some sort of plug-in tied to Word through the Registry that is hidden from the Add-Ins dialog box list? I'm perfectly willing to look through and edit the Registry (I do it all the time) if someone knows what keys I should be looking at and modifying.</p>

            <p>There is no Bluetooth function in Word. The menu item is being provided by your Bluetooth driver. Whether it can be removed or not without removing the driver you will have to check with Broadcom.</p>

<p>Presumably that driver must be hooking in to Word via some sort of plugin/component that I should be able to prevent Word from loading at startup through editing the Registry, right?</p>
<p>There's nothing under HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\Word\Addins. Any other locations in the Registry I should be looking at?</p>

            I tried to look in Control Panel for a Bluetooth control panel, but the driver doesn't have one.<br />
<br />
I decided to try setting Word's Normal template (Normal.dot) to read-only. Result: No effect; after examining the date-modified timestamps, it appears that the menu item is being repeatedly added at Startup without modifying the Normal template.<br />
<br />
Tony Jollans, thanks for the suggestion. You're right: It turns out that under "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Office\Word\Addins", there is a key called "BtOfficeAddin.BtOfficeIntegration.1" which contains:<br />
<br />
- a string named "FriendlyName" with the content "Send to Bluetooth"<br />
- a dword named "LoadBehavior" with the value "3"<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, changing the key doesn't work. I tried setting LoadBehavior to 0. No effect; the menu item is still recreated when I restart Word. I tried setting it to -1. No effect. I tried other values. No effect. I tried modifying FriendlyName. No effect.
 I tried renaming the entire key. No effect. I tried deleting the key. No effect.<br />
<br />
Instead of removing the menu item via Customize, I tried moving the "Send to Bluetooth" menu item to another, more out-of-the-way menu other than File. Unfortunately, this just results in the menu item being recreated in File. I tried renaming the menu item
 to something else, but this just results it creating a second copy of the menu item.<br />
<br />
I removed the menu item, and then I went to Administrative Tools -&gt; Services and temporarily stopped both "Bluetooth Service" (btwdins) and "Bluetooth Support Service" (bthsvcs). I started Word...and the menu item is still there.<br />
<br />
This thing is like a pest that just won't go away! :( I still can't get rid of it.

<p>As an outside possibility that has worked in the past with errant add-ins, try moving the BtOfficeAddin.BtOfficeIntegration.1 key from HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Office\Word\Addins to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\Word\Addins and set the LoadBehavior
 value to 0</p>

                    I just installed windows technical preview and it is awesome, but I think there should be the functionality of swapping into left and right corners as it is in windows 8.1, it makes lot more easier to work !

    <title>INK EFFECTS MISSING FROM EXCEL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> _fakeism  say:</h3>
<h2>            INK EFFECTS MISSING FROM EXCEL</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently started using the draw function in Excel on my Surface Go with Surface Pen. At first the effects options would come up everytime but now it has suddenly began to glitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially had a couple of the effects pens in my "favorite pens dock/list" but then they randomly disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened a new empty spreadsheet and noticed the effects pens and the function to choose an effect from the drop menu was available. But when I returned to my saved spreadsheet the pens/function would disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a few restarts and reopening files I managed to somehow get my effects pens and function back however for the first few minutes they didnt really work. When I selected one it would change back to one of the non-effect pens by itself. I deleted a few
 of the normal pens from the list and Excel seemed to "refresh" itself after stuttering for a second and then the effects pens/function started working again - for about an hour until they disappeared again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will just point out that the plain pen colours still work just fine - it is specifically the effects colour that I am having trouble with. Also its not the view as I keep it on normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See image below: no effects function in the drop down menu. And the previously saved effects pens disappeared from the list of pens I regularly use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I just doing something wrong? Can anybody help with this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t move existing sections into new section groups</h2>
                    <p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a product catalogue in OneNote shared on a SharePoint server. My task is to change the structure a little, mostly by creating some new section groups and moving existing sections and section groups into my newly created sections/section groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I have is almost immediately after moving the existing section/section group into my newly created section group it all moves back to where it came from. I created a copy of the live system in another SharePoint document library so as not to
 break anything. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what version of SharePoint we are running as it was upgraded as part of a recent Office365 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OneNote client is the 32 bit version of 2010, running on 64 bit Windows 7 Ultimate SP1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help much appreciated, thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>- Jim</p>

            <p>AFAIK.. this happens due to admin permissions on the sharepioint server. What you can do is to try copying over the notebook to the system, make the changes required and replace it on the sharepoint.

    <title>Win 10 mobile build 10166 Update Success - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Win 10 mobile build 10166 Update Success</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had just updated my Lumia 535 with build 10149 to 10166 with success. Here's how I did it.</p>
<p>1. Download Win-Insider and update it (mine is missing which is why I had to d/load again using the old 'Store' app not the 'Beta').</p>
<p>2. Before opening Insider make sure the 'Lock screen time out' set to 'Never'.</p>
<p>3. Open Win-Insider and tap Fast Ring and then go to Settings and open Update &amp; Security and tap Phone update.</p>
<p>4. Leave your phone alone and let it update and install by itself (it took about 75mins. for me - 5Mb home wifi).</p>
<p>5. After it installed the new build you have to wait a few minutes before you can open the apps (I suppose it is updating the apps).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this will help you guys..Good Luck.</p>

            <p>When I installed the 10149 update my wifi stopped working. I kept getting a message that turning it on couldn't be done, try again later. Wifi wasn't really an issue so I didn't try to fix it beyond soft resetting my phone occasionally. When I received the
 notice that 10166 was available I hoped that would fix it but I couldn't get it to update over my cellular connection. I finally did a hard reset which cleaned everything out&nbsp;of the phone and wifi now works. It still has 10149 installed so it didn't go back
 to WP 8.1. Unfortunately, I can't sign into my Microsoft account to try to restore from a backup. I tried installing the Windows Insider App by reinstalling it via logging into my account from my Surface Pro 3. It tries to connect to the phone but can't and
 this message: "Just a moment" is displayed.&nbsp;That message for </p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>I tried going to the Store (old, not Beta) and was able to log in that way. Direct from settings or via the Beta store would not work. It seems to be Downloading the updates but still displays 0%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll post again with any progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 2:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think due to a very poor cellular connection and unavailability of wifi the update to 10166 failed. I tried to do a hard reset when I got access to wifi. I think the wifi connection was slow but for whatever reason the hard reset failed. For several days
 now the reset starts, there is a graphic of the spinning gears and the progress bar makes it about 15% across. It stays there for a while (10 minutes or so) eventually the screen goes bland and then I get this:&nbsp; :-( for a minute. If the phone is connected
 to a charger it just starts the process over and repeats. If it isn't connected to a charger it finishes the one attempt and shuts down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions for forcing a new hard reset?</p>

            I was able to use the Windows Phone Recovery Tool to stop the locking up and then restore the phone. From there I was able to install the Windows Insider App and then the 10166 build.

    <title>nokia maps problem, gallery problem after firmware update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tudork---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            nokia maps problem, gallery problem after firmware update</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I just updated firmware on my Nokia N95. When I tried to use the Map Loader to load some maps, it said that map data on my phone was not good and it would replace it. After that, Nokia Maps did not work at all (did not start). I installed Nokia Maps again but
 everytime I start Map Loader, it wants to replace map data on my phone and then Nokia Maps does not work again!<br />
I have to say that everytime I upgrade my firmware, it's a new battle. Last time, phone crashed completely and I had to take it to the service. Now I have all kinds of troubles with it, like the one above, and another one: in Gallery, when I want to email a
 pic, it says that no mailboxes are defined, although of course I did define my mailbox.<br />
How can I go to the older version of firmware or at least how can I get these issues resolved? Anyone has any idea? Thank you very much.<br />
Tudor

            Hi tudork<br />
<br />
Can you confirm to which version you have updated to?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately in addition to version of Nokia Maps installed with phone software there have been update .sis released at times which doesn't help matters.

    <title>Adding attachments to emails in Outlook for iPad - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Adding attachments to emails in Outlook for iPad</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Outlook on my iPad for my work email and also have OneDrive for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I create a file (say, for instance, a Word document) on my iPad I save it to OneDrive. If I then want to email the document to somebody I go to Outlook and click the paperclip to add a file. This brings up a pop-up menu and I select Attach File. This
 brings up a blank page - there is a column down the left-hand side with a heading of Files (with nothing shown below) and a larger column on the right-hand side with a graphic that states No file selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sounds like an obvious problem to solve but I figure out how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions gratefully received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

<p>Hi Chris,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It seems that the issue is within the Outlook application and the best thing that we can do is to reinstall the app. In this case, this will give Outlook a fresh new start and possibly resolve the issue. Don't forget to re activate the application after
 the installation.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Can not resize table column width when on even page using mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can not resize table column width when on even page using mouse</h2>
                    <p>I'm using word 365 x64 on windows 10 x64 French.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a document template with headers and footers, different on fist page, even pages and odd pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I put a table on an even page I can not resize column width using the mouse.</p>
<p>If I insert page break before the table, I can resize the column width using the mouse.</p>
<p>If I remove the page break before the table, I can not resize the column width using the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The intersting thing is that if I use shift+mouse click, I can drag the column, whichever the page is odd or even (but the table width changes, which I and my template user don't want).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get out of this situation ? Starting a new document is not an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen other posts on other forums from poeple having this problem.</p>

<p>This does not work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is related to page marging : when I set a left margin different as the right margin, the problem appears.</p>
<p>If I set same values, there is no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw, If I want to make a book, I need to set different margins depending on the page size (left or right). Where can I do that ?</p>

    <title>Refinement issues when using multiple default values on a library - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anita boerboom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Refinement issues when using multiple default values on a library</h2>
                    
<p>suppose there are 2 content types:<br />
knowledge - column classification was added, default value 'private'<br />
minutes - column document status was added, default value 'in progress'</p>
<p>these content types were added to a document library on one of the sites.</p>
<p>an overview of the default values at document library (source of default value) level:<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=686d8ab3-bfb9-4afb-bd54-2b8819d45370" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d686d8ab3-bfb9-4afb-bd54-2b8819d45370" /></a></p>
<p>a new document is created based on the knowledge content type. when checking the version history of this document, the following can be seen:<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=29b1f702-5b54-4b34-b5bc-4cfcee75f662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d29b1f702-5b54-4b34-b5bc-4cfcee75f662" /></a></p>
<p>the default values for the fields in both content types appearently are set, but the document status field isn't present at the content type selected, which is knowledge. knowledge has the classification field, not the document status field.</p>
<p>i expected fields to be ignored when they're not present in a content type. <br />
in the above example i only expected to see the value for classification.</p>
<p><strong>can you explain why this behavior happens?</strong></p>
<p>this issue causes the next one:<br />
the classification and document status fields are mapped to refinablestrings and used in the refinement panel in the search center.</p>
<p>because both values were set at the knowledge document the refiners don't work as expected.<br />
the search results contain the knowledge documents and there are refinement values for both classification and document status.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0909c7ac-43f4-40cd-9a01-d0f5324e014b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0909c7ac-43f4-40cd-9a01-d0f5324e014b" /></a><br />

<p>hi anita,</p>
<p>i cannot repro this behavior. to narrow down and look into the issue, let me confirm the following information:</p>
<p>1. what the content type applies to the knowledge and minutes? are they both document content type?</p>
<p>2. make sure there is only <b>classification </b>column in the knowledge content type</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0a6188a8-1a57-421a-be4f-8156f80b0f2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0a6188a8-1a57-421a-be4f-8156f80b0f2e" /></a></p>
<p>3. test if you only add <b>knowledge </b>content type to the library, will this behavior occur?</p>
<p>4. create a new library and check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />
iris</p>

<p>hi iris,</p>
<p>1. both are of type document.</p>
<p>2. yes:<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=97ef36ba-fb1f-44d1-8cd1-34b2a6ce3b47" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d97ef36ba-fb1f-44d1-8cd1-34b2a6ce3b47" /></a></p>
<p>3. when there is one content type added to the library and therefor one default value, the behavior will, of course, not occur.</p>
<p>4.this behavior is easily reproducible on multiple tenants, sites and libraries by creating a new document.</p>

<p>hi anita,</p>
<p>thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>i've tested on my side: <br />
<strong>1.</strong> create two content types: knowledge and minutes just as you said,</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=2b164763-6eef-4962-a406-de0ef19ec21c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d2b164763-6eef-4962-a406-de0ef19ec21c" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=55f56b44-70ea-44c1-9635-58f1b88a5f34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d55f56b44-70ea-44c1-9635-58f1b88a5f34" /></a><br />
<strong>2.</strong> create two documents (document 3 based on knowledge, document 4 based on minutes ), and i can see the two columns displayed &nbsp;with both documents in view and also in version history :</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=990950c2-bdc5-40c2-93a4-707475bfb7a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d990950c2-bdc5-40c2-93a4-707475bfb7a0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=64670503-15f7-4483-a8f6-910fadd8c3aa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d64670503-15f7-4483-a8f6-910fadd8c3aa" /></a><br />
<br />
but when i check the properties, i got the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=2ed2b00d-d3a5-4a9a-a2fd-d58dc5f1a057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d2ed2b00d-d3a5-4a9a-a2fd-d58dc5f1a057" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=2c4b1057-11bc-4b3e-9330-440166940373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d2c4b1057-11bc-4b3e-9330-440166940373" /></a></p>
<p><br />
given this situation (the information displayed in version history and in view doesn't matches that in content type settings and document properties), i need your tenant information for further investigation.<br />
to protect your privacy, i've sent you a private message to collect the information, you can access it via the steps below:<br />
1. go to the <strong>your details</strong> section on the right side of the community site.<br />
2. click <strong>private messages</strong>.<br />
3. click the new message to read and reply.</p>

<p>Hi Anita,</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay.</p>
<p>Please configure the content type as the following to see the outcome, and apply them according to your situation.</p>
<p>1. Create a Site column with the Default value added.</p>
<p>2. Create a Site content type and add the Site column, to associate the column with the content type.</p>
<p>3. Go to the Library and enable management of content types to add the created content type.</p>
<p>4. Go back to the Library Settings.</p>
<p>5. At the Columns section, click on the column, which is added by the column-associated-content-type, to access the column settings.</p>
<p>6. Scroll down to Default Value section, remove the Default value.</p>
<p>7. OK.</p>
<p>Then you may set up the other content type in the library by the same steps.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Rene</p>

<p>hi anita,</p>
<p>let me know whether you have tried the above procedures to configure the content types in the library.</p>
<p>i would be able to create documents based on one content type with pre-set default value added, without being affected by the other content type.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=06194738-6828-4d32-bacd-ecd16fa05192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d06194738-6828-4d32-bacd-ecd16fa05192" /></a></p>
<p>when we add the content type to a list, sharepoint copies the site content type as a list content type, and copies the column templates to the list as list columns. therefore, when we add a new content type, we can consider the situation as we further directly
 add a "column" on a list.</p>
<p>since, based on your screenshots, we may see you set the site column as required when adding it to the content type, then the column, which is referenced in the content type, is set as required within each list content type as well, which, in your case,
 add all the default values to the required list column.</p>
<p>therefore, we can and need to later override the related settings in the specific list "column".</p>
<p>best regards,<br />
rene</p>

<p>Hi Rene,</p>
<p>I have tried your suggestion, but this is not what I want to accomplish.</p>
<p>Basic setup is indeed adding a required site column to a content type and adding the content type to various lists.
<br />
Each list then needs its <em>own</em> default value for that site column, not a <em>
generic</em>&nbsp;default value for the site column itself.</p>
<p>Therefor the default value has to be set at list level.</p>
<p>As you can see from my first post:<br />
'The default values for the fields in both content types apparently are set, but the Document Status field isn't present at the Knowledge content type. Knowledge has the Classification field, not the Document Status field.</p>
<p>I expected fields to be ignored when they're not present in a content type.'</p>
<p>Can you explain this?</p>
<p>Regards, Anita</p>

<p>Hi Anita,</p>
<p>As you may have known from the above, column template in the content type is copied to the list as list column when adding the content type.</p>
<p>All the columns would be available to the items stored in the list, which won't be ignored, since the column is added at list level instead of file level.</p>
<p>So, if we set the default value for the columns, when we add an item, the column with the re-set value will be directly added as one of the properties of it.</p>
<p>We need to configure several content types with site column to pre-set all the default values in this case.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Rene</p>

<h2>            Error 0x8007000B on Windows 10 mobile</h2>
                    I have a Microsoft Windows 10 mobile phone (on Vodafone) which has suddenly lost everything except Outlook Mail, Calendar and OneDrive. I have no Contacts and cannot make calls or texts although I am getting incoming calls but these are not logged. I have
 tried moving files from phone storage to SD Card but get error 0x8007000B every time. There is a fix for this on my laptop but I can not download it on my phone.

</p><p>I am trying to download the latest September update and there is room in the device storage - 700mb (6.58GB used out of 7.28GB) which is bigger than the download but it still fails and requests to move more from the device to SD card. I have moved everything
 it will allow but the problem continues........</p>

            The update eventually finished successfully but made no difference nor did soft restart. I basically have a Windows 10 computer with Outlook, Facebook and One Drive but no phone. I can not make calls or texts but can get phone calls. I have also &nbsp;lost
 camera.

<p>
</p><p>I have looked at the Back Up Your Stuff section:</p>

<p>I had lost Messages so couldn't proceed to Settings to Sync.</p>
<p>Took phone into Vodafone store where they did a hard reset. Fortunately I think I have recovered most things since.</p>
<p>Incidentally they were less than complimentary about the Microsoft phone and said they have been discontinued along with Windows. &nbsp;I will have to look at other manufacturers when my contract is due in January along with iPhone or Android. &nbsp;Is this true?</p>

<h2>            Outlook &#40;and OneNote&#41; 2016 for Mac &#40;16.41&#41; issues</h2>
                    <p>When I attempt to upgrade to Outlook 16.41 on my Mac and attempt to open Outlook I get the spinning pinwheel and no further progress.&nbsp; Must force quit.&nbsp; I have to revert back to Outlook 15.41 to work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li>MacBook Pro</li><li>macOS High Sierra 10.13.5</li><li>O365 account</li><li>Last version of Outlook that works: 15.41</li><li>Most recent Outlook that does NOT work: 16.41 (nor any releases between 15.41 and 16.41)</li></ul>
<p>*Updated with clarification of versions later than 15.41 that also cause same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Additional update:</strong> issue seems to affect all Office app versions &gt;15.41.&nbsp; &nbsp; Any Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and OneNote versions &gt;15.41 get hung during Sign In.&nbsp; Had to revert to version 15.41 for each of those as well.</p>

<p>Hi JS901,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try to restart your Mac first to see if it works. May I know if you can open the other applications such as Word and Excel successfully? If yes, please check for updates in Word or Excel to
 see if any updates are available. If the issue persists after the steps above, please try to create a new profile and set the new profile as the default profile(you can just right-click the new created profile and set it as default profile ) to see if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-profiles-or-identities-in-outlook-for-mac-fed2a955-74df-4a24-bef6-78a426958c4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-profiles-or-identities-in-outlook-for-mac-fed2a955-74df-4a24-bef6-78a426958c4c</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Outlook for Mac still can't be started with the new created profile. Please let us know if you get any error messages when trying to start Outlook, if yes, would you please send us the screenshot
 of the error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I did a restart.&nbsp; As updated in my original post, Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (&gt;15.41) will start, but will not login into O365 account without hanging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also created a new profile which corrected none of the apps when &gt;15.41.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to restate, if I using anything &gt;15.41 the following behaviors are observed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outlook - will not start at all, pinwheel spins</li><li>Word, Excel, Powerpoint, OneNote - will open, but cannot login to O365 accounts from within those apps; attempting to do so causes the app to hang</li></ul>
<p>I have tried completely uninstalls and re-installs at least 5 times now</p>

<p><span>Please start or restart your Mac, then immediately press and hold the Shift key. The Apple logo appears on your display. Then try to start your Outlook for Mac to see how it goes. You mentioned that
 you re-installed it, would you please help confirm if you just moved Outlook under Finder&gt; Application to trash or reinstalled as the following article shows<span>？</span></span></p>

Hi JS901,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any updates? Have you tried to shut down the add-in to see if it works fine?</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wow. I would think after the first install/reinstall you would be convinced the problem is not with the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Coldwell offered a suggestion to start your Mac in Safe Mode and test your apps in Safe Mode. I think that is a good way to troubleshoot, as well. Please give it a try and reply with the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, the current version is 16.15</p>

    <title>Open form based on combo box selection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rob ingles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open form based on combo box selection</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to open a popup form (frmForRemarksPopup) based on the selection in a combo box on a form named qryAssessmentDetailforSubform in order to add remarks.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;want the frmForRemarksPopup to appear in order to better bring attention to the user that they must make a remark as to why they selected "Below Expectations" in the combo box.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remarks is one of the fields in the "qryAssessmentDetailforSubform" form but is not visible although I would like it to be visible once the user has returned to "qryAssessmentDetailforSubform" after inseting remarks into the popup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...The popup form is for remarks and only appears if "Below Expectations" is selected in the combo box. I think this is a start on&nbsp;how the vba needs to be structured but have not been successful in creating the VBA syntax.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Private Sub cboRanking_AfterUpdate()</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If cboRanking = "Below Expectations" Then</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm frmForRemarksPopup&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>End If</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>frmForRemarksPopup has two fields.&nbsp; AssessmentSessionID and Remarks - memo field.</p>
<p>The source form (qryAssessmentDetailforSubForm) has cboRanking field that displays four options.</p>
<p>The common fields are AssessmentSessionID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some help with the VBA code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Rob</p>

            There are two columns and the associated column is (I think) RankingID which is numeric.&nbsp; Should I be using the numeric value instead of the text value of "Below Expectations"?

            You can reference the second column of the combo box by means of its Column property:<br />
<br />
Private Sub cboRanking_AfterUpdate()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If cboRanking.Column(1) = "Below Expectations" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "frmForRemarksPopup" <br />
<br />
End If<br />
<br />
The Column property is zero-based, so Column(1) references the second column.<br />

            <p>I think I have partially solved my problem. The&nbsp;RecordSource should have been the same query that frmAssessmentDetailForSubform is based on.&nbsp; I
<em>think</em> I might just need to link the frmAssessmentDetailforSubform to the frmRemarksforPopup via the AssessmentSessionID.&nbsp; The frmRemarksforPopup does appear when "Below Expectations" is selected however it does not reflect the AssessmentSessionID of
 the record from which it is triggered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">might</span></em> help clarify:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Main form is frmAssessmentHeader - contains session info including AssessmentSessionID, session date, contractor name etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Popup detail&nbsp;subform is frmAssessmentDetailForSubform linked to the main form with AssessmentSessionID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The popup detail subform (frmAssessmentDetailForSubform) allows the user to input the answer to the question, rank the answer (Below Expectations, Above Expectations, Meets Expectations and N/A) and there is a Remarks field&nbsp; which is not visible - I don't
 want it to be visible as the only time a remark needs to be entered is if the answer Ranking is Below Expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than making the Remarks field visible on the frmAssessmentDetailForSubform when Below Expectations is selected I want the field to be available from a popup form frmRemarksforPopup.&nbsp; Here is the design of the frmAssessmentDetailForSubform - the three
 specified fields should appear in the frmRemarksforPopup form when it pops up.</p>

            If the form is now updatable I'd guess you just have to filter it to the current assessment session:<br />

            Please start the command prompt (cmd.exe) with admin rights [1] and run sfc [2]:<br />
<br />
sfc.exe /scannow<br />
<br />
Is it able to find and repair broken files? Do you now see all updates?<br />

<h2>            Refund for unauthorized in-app purchase&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Today I lost my phone (recovered later) but someone made an in-app purchase for $116.86 (I believe it was with the app My taking tom since the email I received said " a vault of gold coins"). Please let me know what I need to do to cancel this purchase and
 refund the money to my card.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
