<h2>            photo tile shuffle stuck on a few photos</h2>
                    I have set my photo tile to shuffle, which it does do, but it seems to be&nbsp;stuck on a few photos and not all of my photos. How do I get it to shuffle through all of my photos?

<div>&gt;&gt;Hi Naranjan, </div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;Thank you for your assistance, it was very helpful, unfortunately try as I may, the shuffle photo program has a mind of it's own. </div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;I don't know if I've inadvertently enabled a particular photo or set of photos and if I have I can't seem to find a way to check, let alone disable. </div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;It will pick on one file and use that to shuffle, and refuses to use all the files in my pictures. I even removed a file so it couldn't use it, it just picked another and used that one. </div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;I've given up now and turned off the photo tile, it's not something that I really need so I'm not spending any more time with it. </div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;Thanks for your help, when I have more time, and feel like getting completely frustrated again, I may come back to it. </div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>

<div>Alan,</div>
<div>Have you seen my Wiki on how to clear the current selection of 5 images? </div>
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows8_1-pictures/clear-photos-app-live-tile-images-in-windows-81/c2707fe5-ff63-409a-80f6-e71b3cf30ae7">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows8_1-pictures/clear-photos-app-live-tile-images-in-windows-81/c2707fe5-ff63-409a-80f6-e71b3cf30ae7</a></div>
<div>&gt;&gt;Further to the above I found the following on Windows Apps webpage:- To shuffle photos on the tile </div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;When you turn this on, the Photos tile will rotate through 5 images from the 50 most recently added photos. </div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;This explains everything! Maybe a support engineer should be aware of this. </div>

</p><p>There is a wide variety of webcams that supports Skype.</p>
<p>What you need to look for is the compatibility of the webcam with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as the webcam works with Windows 10 then it will definitely work with Skype.</p>

            Hi Caz, your best option is to download the ISO and disconnect form the Internet, it will save you all that data form the failed attempts . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            <pre>Windows 10 / Windows Update (and Office 365) appear to be designed with the ASSupmption that everyone has a fibre optic connection to the internet with unloaded upload / download capacity.  Unrealistic.
One of the symptoms of those assumptions is that Windows update runs "live".  It applies updates as they are being downloaded.  So, if there is an update error / failure, it ends up downloading the same update, time after time after time ....  For you, on a limited connection the 1803 "Update" can be extremely expensive.
CONTROL AND VIEW HOW YOUR BANDWIDTH IS USED FOR UPDATES IN WINDOWS 10
https://www.digitalcitizen.life/how-control-view-how-bandwidth-used-updates-windows-10 
Starting with Fall Creators Update, Windows 10 lets you control how your bandwidth is used for Windows Updates. Here is everything you should know about this new feature.
So what you need to do is try to take some control of the update process.  After you have an update failure, you will know the KB number. You can then go to the MS download site and download and save the update to your local drive.  After you do what ever trouble shooting, you can disconnect your computer from the internet, then run the downloaded update. Hopefully it works, but if it doesn't, you can trouble shoot again, the run the update again WITHOUT having to download it!

&lt;snip&gt;
For many months I have a long list of Microsoft Office 2010 pro updates which I could not update. Since I am using my university license (professional version), I tried uninstalled it to install the 2013 pro version but it came up with an error message (I was not able to uninstall it). After searching for help, I found a ‚ÄúFIX-IT‚Äù removal from the Microsoft website. I have used it and it successful uninstalled it i.e. the Microsoft office 2010 pro was removed from the ‚ÄúPrograms and Features‚Äù list in the control panel. Then I installed the Microsoft 2013 pro. To my shock, after installing it, it could not run. When I clicked on Word, Excel or others, the error message is ‚ÄúThis action is only valid for products that are currently installed‚Äù. Then I search for this error and I found that some people managed to fix this error by running repair and this is done by clicking on to the office  listed in the ‚ÄúPrograms and Features‚Äù and select change to repair it. I tried that but I get another message ‚
Thanks for your help. I have manage to solve the problem by shutting off the printer spooler services and I am not sure why the printer spooler services are interfering with the office updates.
Try this manual Windows Update reset

5)	Once downloaded Run it as Administrator.
6)	Once installed, restart the machine.

The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs.

            That is another example of MS sowing confusion.
<br />
<br />Yes, I mentioned "Version 1803".  But you are still working on "Version 1709".  It says so right in the screen capture you provided.
<br />
<br />The problem is, MS want's us all working on the same version, but then they stage the rollout around the world, and allow various people to actually run multiple versions 
<br />
<br />If you look closely at the details in the update history.  Although they are all for 2018-05 ... 1709 ... they are separate "KB" articles, KB4103727, KB4134661 etc. 
<br />
<br />FYI: "KB numbers" identify specific updates.  "KB Articles" provide descriptions (very high level) of what changes the update makes.
<br />
<br />The 4 updates listed in the screen capture have started being applied, they are at least partially installed.  Some updates can be applied without restarting Windows, but these 4 do require windows to be shut down and restarted so that they can replace files that windows normally has locked open. 
<br />
<br />So, in this case you do have to shut down and restart Windows for these updates to try to complete.
<br />
<br />So after you restart, keep monitoring Update History to see if they succeed or not.  If the fail, rather than letting Windows Update handle them, you should go to the "MS Catalog" link I provided earlier, search for the failed "KB number", then download and SAVE the appropriate update to your HD.  Do your trouble shooting then you can run the update from your computer. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Go into Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Advanced Options hyperlink &gt; Delivery Options hyperlink &gt; Advanced options hyperlink (again). In here you can set a limit on the amount of updates you allow Windows to download each month.
<br />
<br />Go to this article:
<br /><a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/monitor-your-data-usage-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.cnet.com/how-to/monitor-your-data-u...</a>
<br />It describes how you can limit downloads.  Note: the specific path to the setting may have changed since the article was written, but the setting is still there.
<br />
<br />
<br />whew ...!
<br />
<br />Back to the 1709 vs 1803 "Version" question.  Right now you are still on version 1709. Actually, it is probably a good idea to stay with it until MS gives it to you. There are a number of problems with it. When you decide to try to apply it what you should do is make a "Full image copy backup" of your system BEFORE starting the update. This is an infiinitely more reliable way of undoing a failed update.  Use the Update Catalog to download and save the required Update file. Disconnect from the internet, then run the update file.

            My apologies for the late reply. The download is typically 8gb or less. I don't know about Australia but here in the States I typically recommend people in your situation to find and use a free WiFi such as at a local coffee shop for the download
<br />
<br />As for the license it should be digitally imprinted on the PC motherboard and automatically recognized by the Microsoft activation servers

            Thanks Sengupta, but yes I know where to find these options in Wm Player, but after applying these color correction effects to brighten my dark video, is there any way to save corrected video quality to an MPEG file etc on my PC, so can have color correction
 changes permanently, and just not when play video files in WM Player? Thanks<br />

You may try a video editor to correct this issue.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.avs4you.com/guides/How-to-improve-too-dark-video-using-AVS-Video-Editor.aspx It depends upon graphic card also." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AVS Video Editor

<br />
<br />
The graphics card should support hardware decoding too,The graphics card should have hardware acceleration of h.264.

            The only lighting and brightening filters that appear to work pretty good on my dark videos, are in Media players like Window Media Player work great, and VLC etc, but apparently these color correction effects only work in their players, cannot export
 corrections as mpeg or wmv file etc.....<br />

<h2>            Spamming</h2>
                    
<p>I'm sorry to have to say this, but when I signed up, due to GTA IV, I did not expect to have emails every day from this site.</p>
<p>Unlike most other sites, I see there is no way to OPT OUT of the emails.</p>
<p>That is just wrong, in my opinion. I used to be an OEM dealer for Microsoft, and the fact that I need to post this, shows that Microsoft is starting to get like the rest of the internet world. Annoying.</p>

<p>Please set it up so people can opt out, or you will have more people setting filters up top auto-delete the emails. Either that, or be reported as spamming.</p>
<p>I am a fan and follower of Microsoft, and it shames me that things like this is necessary here.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I have it checked on my 2nd account and it sends me emails at a rate of 3 times a month. If you recently unchecked the options it could take a while as my primary account hasn't received a promotion email since January. If you have more than 3 emails in
 a month you may also have more accounts with that being your contact email. If it is becoming a bother you can just block the emails as spam through your email.</p>

 the emails is to change my email or cancel my account (when you cancel an account, you can *never* use that email address as an account again in the future).</p>
<p>This practice is unlawful and they've pushed me away from any further business with Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 restart loop</h2>
                    <p>Okay so, i went to stay over at my friends house for a day, came back, boot up my pc and everything was fine, i left my pc on and went for a nap as i was feeling tired, when i wake up, i found my pc having a problem, windows 10 says there is problem with
 the pc and would restore it to a time when it was still working, there were 2 options, restore and cancel, naturally i clicked restore and it just puts me in a windows startup screen without the loading circle, went to sleep again and when i woke up it was
 still there, so i tried restarting the pc and it crashed: system_service_exception(atikmdag.sys)</p>
<p>i went online to search for a fix and found a fix(not really), they told me to click the "advanced option" but the problem is... I DO NOT HAVE THAT OPTION, so i went to search for system_service_exception(atikmdag.sys) and all i found was a fix for the crash
 where you can startup the pc</p>
<p>It would be nice if anyone could help</p>
<p>Im using an acer aspire v5-552g</p>

            <p>Can you check if the following registry key exists?</p>
<p><em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\<strong>SYMEFA</strong></em></p>
<p>At that registry key in the right window can you double-click&nbsp;<em>Start </em>and set the
<em>Value data</em> to <em>4</em></p>
<p>That will disable that service and stop the SYMEFA.SYS from loading at startup in Normal Mode.</p>
<p>Create a System Restore Point beforehand and restart the computer in Normal Mode afterward.</p>
<p>If you can&nbsp;restart in Normal Mode then uninstall Norton.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello kunseera,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a look at both dumps and it appears to be SYMEFA.SYS that is causing this issue.</p>
<p>This is a component of Norton.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>My recommendation:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Download the latest version of your Norton product.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Uninstall the Norton product.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Reinstall with the latest version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M (1000007e)<br />
This is a very common bugcheck.&nbsp; Usually the exception address pinpoints<br />
the driver/function that caused the problem.&nbsp; Always note this address<br />
as well as the link date of the driver/image that contains this address.<br />
Some common problems are exception code 0x80000003.&nbsp; This means a hard<br />
coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but this system was booted<br />
/NODEBUG.&nbsp; This is not supposed to happen as developers should never have<br />
hardcoded breakpoints in retail code, but ...<br />
If this happens, make sure a debugger gets connected, and the<br />
system is booted /DEBUG.&nbsp; This will let us see why this breakpoint is<br />
happening.<br />

 to Windows 10 as I do not want to be left in this state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft did not warn me that it would get me into this mess and I need them to get me out of it.</p>

            I have now fixed this using a Partition manager piece of software.&nbsp; I had to shrink the main partition, then move it to put the freed up space at the front so it could be used to grow the System Reserved Partition.&nbsp; It all then worked.&nbsp; Why oh why&nbsp;&nbsp;can't
 Microsoft put simple instructions out on stuff like this?&nbsp; There must be millions of people who have installed SSDs to give their PC a mid life kicker.

            <p>Yes you can but with limited possibilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have to push, say C:, then it won't be possible because data have to be displaced.</p>
<p>Anyhow, W7 will tell you if you can't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are specialized (some free) Tools which can manage partions like this one :</p>
<p><a href="http://www.partition-tool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.partition-tool.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But be careful and save your system before. In case of power failure, for example, disaster may occur !</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, I grew the System reserved partition from 100 Mb to 600 Mb and the update&nbsp;succeeded afterwards.</p>

<h2>            How does it make sense that my name is against code of conduct&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently got reported for my gamertag being against code of conduct and was forcefully changed. When I chose that name, I had no intentions of the name being malicious or offensive in any way. My original gamertag is my actual name but with three N's instead of two. I signed up on xbox with my name that is public on my profile as well. If it's offensive, then why is it the name I&nbsp;signed up with under my account&nbsp;has not been reviewed and punished by the enforcement team if it is against code of conduct? If my name can still be used on my account, then why am I&nbsp;not allowed to use it as a gamertag? Am I going to have to be forced to change my name on my account as well?</p><p><br /></p><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fimg-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net%3a443%2ftenant%2fxvi%2fentityid%2fRE1keRA.img" /></figure><p><br /></p>

            Forced Gamertag Changes
<p>When a forced Gamertag change is imposed, the system automatically 
assigns a new Gamertag to the affected account, much in the same way a 
system-generated Gamertag is provided when you first sign up for Xbox 
Live.</p>
<p>If a player is unhappy with the assigned Gamertag and wishes to 
change it, he or she may purchase a new Gamertag through the standard 
Gamertag change process. However, the Gamertag that received the forced 
change will remain unobtainable.</p>
<p>A forced Gamertag change may be issued if a Gamertag visually 
resembles, sound likes, represents, hints at, abbreviates, or otherwise 
insinuates any of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Profane words or phrases</li><li>Topics or content of a sexual nature</li><li>Hate speech</li><li>Controversial religious topics</li><li>Notorious people or organizations</li><li>Sensitive current or historical events</li></ul><p><a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/howto#sub-topic0-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/howto#sub-topic0-2</a></p><p><br /></p><p>You can try a case review and see if that will do anything</p><p><br /></p>How do I submit a Case Review?
<p>Submitting a Case Review is easy, and can be accomplished in several steps:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Sign in</strong> to enforcement.xbox.com with the account that received the enforcement action and select the large box with an <strong>orange hammer icon</strong>, or visit your <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/Enforcement/ShowEnforcements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Enforcement History</a>.</li><li>Find the enforcement action that you wish to have reviewed, and select <strong>Apply for Review</strong>.</li><li>Read the Case Review Terms of Use and agree by clicking the checkbox and selecting <strong>Agree</strong>.</li><li>If you are already eligible for a Case Review, select the <strong>green arrow icon</strong>.
 If you are not yet eligible, you will be presented with a short 
questionnaire. These questions help gauge your understanding of the Code
 of Conduct and associated policies. Upon successful completion of the 
questionnaire, select the <strong>green arrow icon</strong>.</li><li>Provide
 any details (up to 500 characters) regarding the enforcement action 
that may help XBLPET conduct a more complete investigation. This may 
include context around the activity or content that received 
enforcement, information about your game activity, or any other facts 
that you believe are worth noting. When complete, select <strong>Submit</strong>.</li></ol><p><a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/howto#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/howto#sub-topic0-6</a></p>

            <p>In order to get VLC Player to auto-start DVDs, I had to right-click on the Windows DVD Player in the apps menu, and click "uninstall." The button promptly disappeared, and I got the VLC Player to behave properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean that I won't get a Windows DVD Player update? I don't know that I can reinstate that app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not a big deal, because VLC Player does work, but wouldn't it have been nice if Microsoft responded to all the complaints, in the past 1 1/2 months? Instead of pretending like there was no problem? Honestly, look at the replies we got on this. Nothing but
 banalities. Run the troubleshooter, do SFC scannow, and similar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You did not list my problem, which even PC Week wrote about. Windows DVD Player does not play DVD movies. It says it can't decode the disk. When you put in the disk, originally it played the FBI warning and the clips, but it choked on the movie itself. After
 the 18 August update, it choked on everything. (Parenthetically, I read that Windows DVD Player lacks the necessary codecs. I read that if one installs the complete codec pack, one can use Windows Media Player to play DVDs. Interesting. I didn't go this route,
 but I might just experiment.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Begin rant. The basic Windows 10 seems to work well. But it baffles me how Microsoft could have pushed out so many truly bad apps. What happened? DVD Player doesn't work, as far as I can tell, it doesn't work for anyone. It doesn't even work for those who
 pay $15 for it! Edge can't do some of the most basic functions, such as allow copying a link from the address bar, to paste in a document. Or even copying a web page as an htm file. Mail is way too primitive, hardly up to either Outlook Express or Windows
 Live Mail levels of competence. And these are just the most basic of apps that everyone uses. There is a litany of complaints about many, many other apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question: How is it that Microsoft could put out perfectly competent apps in previous Windows versions, and then (apparently) have forgotten everything? I never experienced this sort of regression before, that I remember, when going to a new Windows version?
 What happened? The best advice we consistently get is to install third party apps, for mail, calendar, playing DVDs, making movies, to replace media center, you name it. Weird, wouldn't you say?</p>

            <p>Hi Albert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize that the "cannot decode" error isn't in the post. We're aware of the issue and hard at work on a fix, but it slipped past us when preparing this thread. We'll be updating the original post soon to include that information. Unfortunately we don't
 have an official workaround to recommend at this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm checking with the apps team regarding how you can restore the Windows DVD Player app when an update is available, and I'll let you know as soon as I have that information in hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to personally apologize that more complaints were not publicly addressed before now, in the time since release. We (meaning those of us working on the DVD app; I can't speak for Microsoft as a whole) have been very focused on gathering feedback from
 a variety of sources (the Microsoft Community forums, the Windows Feedback app, app reviews, etc) and trying to fix the issues we've been hearing about. It becomes too easy to focus 100% on that part of the cycle and forget to close the loop with customers,
 as we're trying to do now. I intend to keep a close eye on matters and make sure to close that gap with regards to the Windows DVD Player app.</p>

            Thanks for your patience. At this time, Microsoft has no plans to bring a first-party DVR app to the Windows Store. If you own an Xbox One, you may be interested in the

            <p>Hi Albert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Returning to your question about reinstating the Windows DVD Player app, it does not appear possible to do so for free without restoring your machine to an eligible version of Windows 7 or 8 and performing the upgrade again. Unfortunately, for technical
 reasons, the app is not attached to your Microsoft Account when you upgrade to Windows 10, so there's no way to restore it from the Windows Store or otherwise.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your answer Chris!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not own an Xbox One but even if I were to purchase one next year the promised DVR functionality&nbsp;would not address my problem: I need cablecard support to be able to decrypt encrypted cable channels (I am not able to receive OTA signal where I live,
 at least without a mast), and the Xbox One promised DVR functionality is (currently)&nbsp;limited to over-the-air. On top of that it seems it will be only single-tuner (so no watching and recording at the same time). Finally it is unclear that this feature will
 be available before the cutoff date for the free Windows 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could work for me is an Xbox One that supports a SiliconDust HDHomeRun Prime (or the equivalent): three tuners,&nbsp;cablecard... and this within the next six months. Could this happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To go back to Windows 10 I certainly can understand that Microsoft would want to decouple Windows from Windows Media Center to be able to reduce the cost of Windows, as was done for Windows 8/8.1. So why not do that? I am quite sure that some people would
 be&nbsp;ready to pay&nbsp;for Windows Media Center if the price was similar to what it was&nbsp;under Windows 8 (e.g. $99 pro pack if I recall correctly). Note that software development cost is virtually zero (just change the splash screen and the about box from the previous
 version)... and mandatory royalties for mpeg2 and dolby are probably under $5. Recurring EPG might cost more but I believe that there is&nbsp;money to be made...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway for now I am going to keep one computer running Windows 8.1 with Windows Media Center, which certainly goes against Microsoft wish&nbsp;for me to upgrade (if I believe the constant nagging in the taskbar). Awkward isn't it?</p>

</p><p>Normally, the files and photos that will show up on your device will depend on when you initially used the version 8 of Skype on any device. Meaning, all of the photos and files you received and sent during and after the initial usage will be stored in the
 cloud for 2 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One possible reason why you're not seeing the photos and files that you're looking for is because the senders deleted it. So, you will really not be seeing those from your conversation history with your contact. If you suspect they didn't delete anything
 from their end, I suggest you to ask your contacts if the photos that you're looking for appears on the gallery or not. If the files and photos, appear on their end, please ask for a screenshot of it and the screenshot of what appears on your end and send
 it to the private message I sent to you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            SP3 stuck on Surface logo</h2>
                    <p>Have purchased today brand new SP3 from Microsoft dealer, installed and paid for Windows 10 and now stuck on Surface logo, no idea if W10 finished installing or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried Microsoft 2 button 4 step process, media recovery and SP3 recovery but nothing changes - still stuck on Surface logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I wanted was to buy a computer for business and use it, not spend a whole day achieving nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it that when a buy a brand new out of the box SP3 from a well established retailer it is out of warranty ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did I have to pay $179 to upgrade from W8 to W10 ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do with this clunker that has only achieved dragging another $179 out of my wallet and then frozen. That was it's only function since startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Webcam</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Haven't used Skype in a while but have recently gone back to college and my Webcam is no longer working. I've updated my version of Skype and it's still not working. While I'm chatting to people it appears as if everything is working fine. I can see the
 person I am speaking to, they cannot see me. My webcam is on, the light is on, it's just doing nothing. Any ideas?
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Using Disk Compression - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ladydee123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Disk Compression</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7 Ultimate on a Laptop.&nbsp; I have two partitions c: = 149 GB and d = 138 GB.&nbsp; Disk C only has 10.5 GB left.&nbsp; I can not create a VHD because of that.&nbsp; Is it safe to compress drive C which is the boot disk?&nbsp; I have moved everything I could
 to D:, but I think all the updates I am getting is filling the C: drive.&nbsp; I only installed Office, Visual Studio, SQL and other MS products or applications where I could not change the drive.&nbsp; I mostly use drive D: to install applications.&nbsp; I am a web devloper
 and BixSpark in Microsoft.&nbsp; So I used the D: for developing.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? Is compression Safe.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

<h2>            &#34;File not found&#34; in VB6 when trying to use richtx32.ocx, MSComctlLib and MSComct2</h2>
                    I have been maintaining a VB6 program for years on a couple of machines. &nbsp;Suddenly, on one machine, the rich text box,
<b>even though it is registered </b>and useable by existing programs, cannot be found by VB6. &nbsp;I have unregistered and reregistered it several times to no avail. &nbsp;I have even copied a working version of the ocx from a second machine and registered it but I
 still get the same problem. &nbsp;I don't understand what is going on -- I have been using this control for years. &nbsp;This also happened for MSComctlLib and MSComct2. &nbsp;I don't even have an old enough restore point to get me back to a previous working state so I really
 need a solution for this. &nbsp;Thanks.

            I solved the problem but I'm still not sure what caused it. &nbsp;I had compressed the System32 folder but not all files got compressed. &nbsp;When I tried to undo it by decompressing the folder the already compressed files did not decompress. &nbsp;I tried recompressing
 the folder and still not all the files are compressed but the VB6 problem seems to have gone away. &nbsp;Very strange!

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span>
</span><span>I suggest you to place your computer in Clean Boot state as below and check whether the issue persists or not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the article How to perform a clean boot in Windows in the below link and check if it helps:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a>
<strong>(Applies to Windows 10 as well).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong><strong>:</strong> Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section
<strong>‚Äú<span>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</span>‚Äù</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> I recommend you to download the Microsoft Safety Scanner from the
 following link and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-gb/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-gb/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>

<h2>            Black screen Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Ausu laptop running Windows 7 service pac 1 that I don't use much. I logged on to do updates before going out of town and after a second msg about zone alarm needing another update (I had just done an update for zone alarm) on reboot I get a black screen.
 I have a mouse only but does go to the first pic of my screen saver after the right amount of time with no use. I can open a task manager but can do nothing but look at it. When I click on anything to start services it tells me access denied and if I click
 on the "services" button at the bottom the laptop locks up.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Attempt to Create Installation Media for Inspiron 1420 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christian rast  say:</h3>
<h2>            Attempt to Create Installation Media for Inspiron 1420</h2>
                    So, I've had this Dell Inspiron 1420 for quite some time, but just recently I started messing around with it. I downloaded Windows 10 Pro, and it seems to be working just fine. I wanted to see if Fortnite would run, and found out that I had an unsupported
 OS. I tried to change the system type to a 64 bit, but got stuck when I tried to create installation media. After I thought the download was complete, I received this message,"There was a problem running this tool. We're not sure what happened, but we're unable
 to run this tool on your PC. If you continue experiencing problems, reference the error code when contacting customer support. Error code: 0x80070005 - 0xA001A." Is there anything that can be done? Thank you.

<p>Yes, Fortnite does require 64bit Windows, but you cannot simply change 32bit Windows to 64bit. You have to
</p>
<p>reformat and reinstall Windows using a 64bit Windows installer package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If your machine is the model with&nbsp; <span><em>NVIDIA GeForce 8400M GS</em>&nbsp; it is limited to using DirectX 9&amp;10.
</span></p>
<p><span>Fortnite will only run with DX11</span><span> (One site</span><span> shows DX9 &amp;10, but that contradicts other sites, including Epic who say</span></p>
<p><span>DX11 compatible graphics processor required). </span></p>
<p><span>Also note the games <em>minimum</em> RAM requirements is 4GB</span><span> ( the reason the game requires 64bit Windows )</span></p>
<p><span>Many 'older' games that use DX10/11 can also run with DX9 files, but newer releases are tending to be more restrictive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>- Regardless, this card would not run this game even if it were DX11 capable. Just by way of quick comparison</span><span>, the
</span></p>
<p><span>Passmark score for the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">8400M GS&nbsp; = 82</span> .
<p>
</p><p>- Short story.... Your laptop was first released in '07. In computer dog years this machine is a senior citizen, and too old</p>
<p>to be running Win10. <br />
The OS it came with (Vista ? ) is the OS that best suits the hardware if you expect full performance from the machine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- While Nvidia does provide a Win10 driver for your 8400M GS it may not provide optimal performance as would</p>
<p>drivers released by DELL. </p>
<p>This is because the mfg's of laptops customise the generic Nvidia driver to suit the way the implement the gpu on their machines&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Nvidia have a disclaimer to this effect in their release notes ).</p>
<p>- Unfortunately laptop mfg's stop driver support <em>very</em> early on, and I don't even have to look to
</p>
<p>know DELL will not have an Win10 driver for your laptop. </p>
<p>- The generic driver provided by Windows Updates is not much good for gaming either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The Win10 1709 version update seems to have been the final straw for making Win10 incompatible with much</p>
<p>of the old hardware that people were seduced into 'upgrading' to Win10. Especially laptops.</p>
<p>Not unexpected really. Hardware incompatibility&nbsp; has always been an issue when trying to run old machines on
</p>
<p>new versions of Windows. I believe MS has been negligent in allowing people with old unsupported machines to install Win10.</p>
<p>imo - With Win10 you are likely to have ongoing issues, which will only increase with successive version/feature updates</p>
<p>that MS is releasing twice a year for Win10.</p>
<p><br />

            Well, thanks for the help I guess. Unfortunately I'm understanding that Fortnite won't run with my computer. I do have a Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series. I tried to download Fortnite on it, but the game performance was very laggy, and almost impossible to
 play. Is there anything to improve the lag but still keep the rest of the computer's performance high?

<p><em>"Is there anything to improve the lag but still keep the rest of the computer's performance high? "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- The best you can do, in addition to running the game on all low settings,&nbsp; is not have any other software or browsers open when</p>
<p>running games. Games are system intensive so there is no 'keeping the rest of the performance high'.
</p>
<p>You cannot multi-task while running games on low end machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Laptops generally allocate around 2GB of the system RAM to graphics processing.
</p>
<p>With Win10 this gets a bit confusing because of the terminology the choose to use, but mainly you want to verify the '<em>shared' RAM</em></p>
<p>is <em>2GB</em> or more. There is also RAM that is shown as '<em>Dedicated GPU Memory'</em>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>You may be able to raise this amount, but if you are not trying to multi-task it should not matter as the game will still</p>
<p>use the available amount of RAM that the Intel HD graphics is capable of processing.</p>
<p>Look in -&nbsp; <em>Task Manager &gt; Performance</em> &gt; Highlight <em>, GPU0 (Intel HD Graphics)</em>&nbsp; for the amount of RAM 'dedicated' to the Intel HD graphics.</p>
<p>You can find out how to increase the amount of 'Dedicated GPU Memory'&nbsp; in your user manual, or by contacting DELL.</p>
<p>With Desktop machines this is normally changed in BIOS, but laptops often have different methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- I'm afraid that with laptops, what you see is what you get. You cannot upgrade the graphics processor, and while Intel HD4400/5500
</p>
<p>are much better than the old Intel GMA graphics, they are still absolute minimum spec for this game.</p>
<p>I see two Inspiron 15 3000 sub-models with different cpu's. One has Intel HD4400&nbsp;score = 564&nbsp;&nbsp; and another with Intel HD5500 score = 583
</p>
<p>(The minimum dedicated gpu shown on the specs list score = 4127 , but you could obviously run a lower spec&nbsp; DX11
</p>
<p>dedicated graphics card as well ). </p>
<p>The cpu's on the&nbsp;Inspiron 15 3000 models are a bit low end for gaming. Dual core 2.0/2.1Ghz is a bit slow for many modern games,</p>
<p>and also comes in a bit under Fortnites minimum recommendation of 2.4Ghz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- To get good gaming performance with anything other than games that have basic graphics, such as point and click adventure,
</p>
<p>Jewel Quest type games, and a good number of old PC games on a laptop you need an expensive machine with a mid/high end</p>
<p>dedicated graphics card. </p>
<p>Even then there are problems controlling heat, and on a performance per dollar value, desktop machines win hands down.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Part of the reason integrated graphics does not offer good gaming performance is it has no true dedicated video RAM (VRAM)</p>
<p>and has to 'share' the system RAM. The use of the term 'dedicated' RAM for integrated graphics is misleading.</p>
<p>VRAM is faster than system RAM, and games use both VRAM and system RAM (to hold and feed data to the VRAM),
</p>
<p>when using a dedicated graphics card.</p>

<h2>            Cannot read or write cd&#39;s or dvd&#39;s on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After searching numerous web forums and doing multiple supposed "fixes", I still cannot read or write DVD's or CD's since installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Formatting" option is not working as all discs that I have purchased, Sony, Memorex, Fujifilm, in both -R and +R are being stated as "Write Protected"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased an external CD/DVD burner but cannot install the software because my "Autoplay" just spins the disc at various speeds and does NOT open the disc. Even trying to manually open the disc via the drive under "this PC" is a failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have wasted many hours and money trying to solve the problem and further delays&nbsp;that&nbsp;are costing my business money.

            <p>Did not work for me. I'm now in process of trying to download everything onto an external hard drive. I appreciate the effort in helping, but since the upgrade&nbsp;to 8.1 and then to Windows 10, I've had nothing but problems with my system. Once I clean my system
 out, I will gladly go back to XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: Nevermind on the external Hard Drive. Windows 10 won't read it either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of right now, I cannot save any of my work onto disc, read any discs, and doing a factory reset will cause me to lose over 800gb of work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will attempt to upload everything to a private DropBox account. But that will also cost more money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So who can I send the expense bill to at Microsoft for this?</p>
