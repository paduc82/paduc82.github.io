    <title>Why does Facebook mess up on my Windows phone sometime while using IE - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does Facebook mess up on my Windows phone sometime while using IE &#38; never on their APP, which I refuse to use &#40;see why below&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This phone does three weird things and the first one it only does on the Facebook site when trying to enter a Status and not even when entering a Comment.<br />
<em><strong>1. </strong></em>It will sometimes enter the first letter and then any more letters that I type are added in front of that one. The workaround is to just type any key at first and then hit the backspace key before I start typing the Status. This
 bad thing comes and goes. Right now it won't do it even though it was doing it a few hours ago and FYI, I haven't left my house or turned the phone OFF/ON or recharged the battery any during that time period.<br />
<em><strong>2. </strong></em>Quite often, if my Status includes adding a Photo, I'll just Paste in my text from somewhere that I Copied it. But then quite oddly, it won't let me ever click anywhere in that text and make any changes. My workaround is to just
 Post it and then to hit the EDIT and make my changes which it does just as it should.<br />
<em><strong>3. </strong></em>This is the weirdest: Occasionally, the Facebook page will be displayed shifted to the left as it is in the image that I've added here.<br />
This just keeps happening. I don't use hardly any APPs. I've never dropped or mishandled my phone. It is a replacement that T-Mobile sent me under warranty 4 months ago. Ever since I got it, it does some weird stuff ONLY on Facebook and
<strong>I don't use the Facebook APP since it has limited options that using the m. mobile site in Internet Explorer doesn't do to the User.</strong><br />
T-Mobile tech support that is reached thru their Facebook page has had me do an Internet Explorer reset. That did nothing to help. They've given up and have suggested that I ask Facebook. I told them that Facebook, just like all others such as Microsoft, hides
 behind what they call a Community. So now I'm asking you community people. Is there any hope for this piece or should I just toss it at one of those fake Electronics Recycling Days things that I see in parking lots and buy an iPhone or an Android like my wife
 and kids have?</p>
<p>I've asked this same Question over at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/community/question/?id=1113702551993392&amp;added&amp;rdrhc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/help/community/question/?id=1113702551993392&amp;added&amp;rdrhc</a>&nbsp;but I
 wanted to try over here to since I'd heard that Microsoft is who made the Facebook APP for their 'feature phones' maybe since these phones are just minority players. I love mine since it syncs all of my outlook.com stuff so I just want to make it work as it
 should.</p>

            <p>I actually NEVER use any Facebook APP so I wouldn't think that having the latest version on board would matter. Would it?</p>
<p>Also, I always access Facebook thru Internet Explorer because in the past and maybe still, the APP wouldn't let me do certain things that the actual browser version would.</p>
<p>I wouldn't know how to clear 'browser history'. Is that somewhere in Settings?</p>

            This thing has SO many problems that I can't even believe that Nokia sold them. This is my second one since T-Mobile replaced my first one under warranty due to the stupid stuff that it would do and I even had to go thru the Master Reset mess with that
 one and I've done it with this second one, which did nothing at all to fix it. I don't use hardly any APPs and for sure I use nothing that is 3rd Party junk. I just want to sync with my computer's Outlook 2013 but if it wasn't for that, I'd have an iPhone
 5 like both of my kids and all of the friends have.

            AND I see no reason AT ALL for seeing anyone's latest Facebook posting information when I look at their 'People' ie Contact in my phone. Seems pretty ridiculous to me. That's what Facebook is for, not Outlook.

    <title>Word 2010 Paste Link to picture problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smithchuck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 Paste Link to picture problems</h2>
                    In Word 2003 I can insert a JPEG file into a document, then copy it and use Paste Special, Paste Link to re-use it in other parts of the same document.&nbsp; Then if I'm careful about what I do with the first instance of the photo, the changes will automatically
 be replicated to the linked versions in the same document.<br />
<br />
When I try to do this in Word 2010, the "Paste Link" option is grayed out.&nbsp; Any idea how to re-use linked versions of the same photo inside the same Word 2010 document?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            <div>I may have misunderstood Hans V's approach, but I think when he says "hyperlink" (i.e. insert-&gt;hyperlink), he means "bookmark", i.e. insert-&gt;bookmark.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The old LINK method only works in .doc format. If you open a .doc that uses it, save as .docx, and try to fix up the LINK path names to point to the .docx, then save/close/reopen, Word will crash. Or it does here, at any rate.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The technique that Hans V mentions should work with .doc, and .docx in Compatibility mode. But it doesn't appear to me to work in .docx that isn't in compatibility mode - the copies don't appear to change when you update the fields, except in the case
 where you inserted the first picture as a link, and either literally change the picture (i.e. link to a different picture) or modify the picture outside Word.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, it's possible that Hans V and I are using different methods to insert the picture.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What does appear to work here is to put the picture in a text box, select the text box, then use Hans V's approach, except bookmark the textbox instead of the picture. Or even insert a "drawing", put the picture on the drawing surface, and bookmark the
 drawing surface.</div>

    <title>Problems using external keyboard with Word for Android. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems using external keyboard with Word for Android.</h2>
                    <p>Hey&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I figured I can't be the only one using Word on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 with the Samsung Bluetooth keyboard case. Or trying to, at least...</p>
<p>I'm able to type a few words at most before the keyboard seems to freeze - I can backspace but nothing else. Can't add a single letter. When this happens (several times a minute), I have to touch the screen, turn the keyboard off and on or wait it out for
 a few seconds before I can resume typing. As you can imagine, this makes writing anything in Word pretty impossible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The keyboard pairs with the device fine and allows me to type unhindered on other apps, so the problem is definitely within Word. I've tried working online and offline, with documents saved to OneDrive and to the device itself, but the problem persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope someone else has experienced and overcome the same issue. Any advice greatly appreciated, thanks!</p>

            I'm having same problem, only with Word. I had the problem with a different external keyboard too. Currently I have a new M-Edge 7" Ellipse 7 Android tablet.&nbsp; No problem pairing with the tablet.&nbsp; Using Word, I can only type a few words before no interface.&nbsp;
 The tablet indicates that the devices are connected. I can bring back interfacing by turning off the keyboard and back on, but not always successful and in any case the problem is back in a flash.&nbsp; PLEASE HELP--this makes composing on Word miserable.

<p>I am having a similar issue, making Word unuseable on my Android device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, Android 7.0, with Logitech S-Type keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using the Backspace key, Word will not recognize any keyboard input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is only one exception - the directional arrows work.&nbsp; After using the directional arrows to move the cursor forward and then back, Word will recognize keyboard input and I can begin typing again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not happen with any other text input in any other app, including other Office apps.&nbsp; It happens to all files in Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have regularly updated both my system and Word, which currently reads "Version 1.0.1 (16.0.9226.2077)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated, as I purchased this particular setup specifically for quick writing in Word, and it has made Microsoft Word unuseable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help that you might be able to offer.</p>

<h2>            saving pptx as pps as opposed to ppsx</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to open a powerpoint file (that I could potentially receive in the form of either ppt or pptx) as a slideshow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to accomplish this, in my program, I create a pps file and copy the contents of the ppt ./ pptx file into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are</p>
<p>1) while it seems to be working, is there a downside to saving pptx as a pps instead of a ppsx that i should be aware of?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) is saving 2007 pptx file to a pps file the same as saving a 2010/2013 pptx file?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Am</p>

            Saving as a pps is saving in the old 97-2003 format. You will lose any new features that were added in 2007. For example text with a bevel or reflection will be saved as an image, animated Smart Art will not animate.<br />

<h2>            Increase in Spam on Outlook.com</h2>
                    I've had a dramatic increase in spam on Outlook.com this week. &nbsp;I get a new one about every five minutes or so. &nbsp;Some are from bestbuyinfo @ a best.buy address but it's not the regular best buy mail. &nbsp;Others are from addresses that are random strings of
 text. &nbsp;I'd expect junk mail filters to catch those, but they end up in my inbox. &nbsp;Hopefully Outlook.com will improve its spam filters. &nbsp;I'd rather not set my inbox to contacts only. &nbsp;Before this week, the filter was doing a great job at catching most spam.

<h2>            Can&#39;t upload audio files to Sway</h2>
                    I am not able to upload any audio to Sway.&nbsp; I keep receiving "This audio file is corrupted and Sway can't use it."&nbsp; I have tried recording directly onto Sway using the recording function.&nbsp; I have created separate audio files from my phone and tried to
 upload onto Sway.&nbsp; I have tried to save using .wav, .mp4, and .mp3.&nbsp; I have also used two different computers (PC and MacBook) and keep receiving the same error message.&nbsp; All of my audio files work on all of the devices I have downloaded to.

            As you have no doubt found out already, you cannot directly reference a cell on another worksheet in a conditional format formula. However, if you give the cell on the other worksheet a
<i>name</i>&nbsp;with a scope of <i>Workbook</i>&nbsp;you can reference the name within the conditional formatting rule without further problems.<br />

<h2>            Yet more unsuccessful sync attempts from people in other countries</h2>
                    <p>I posted a thread recently regarding someone in Russia perform an unsuccessful sync, and while nothing happened from that and I got it sorted by removing my email account from my phone, I quickly realised I still needed to use/receive emails on my mobile
 device. After downloading the Outlook app I thought everything would be fine, but when I recently checked my recent activity after the weekend, I found two more unsuccessful sync attempts that seem to have happened overnight (for me, at least.) While both
 of them appear to have my email address, they were and are not me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it safe to ignore these, since they were both unsuccessful syncs, and why does this keep happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Removed screenshot as per suggestion of reply.</p>

            Dear finlandsberet ,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />First of all please remove personal information from the screenshot.
<br />
<br />This is happening as someone is trying to obtain access to account using that alias from screenshot. Now if that alias is not primary you can go to sign-n preferences (in your Microsoft account) and disable login to your account using that alias. After this whenever someone will try to login with the account he will be receiving error and will not be able to login in.
<br />
<br />Also, you can find a lot of suggestions how to secure you Microsoft account here <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/...</a> and here <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12410/microsoft-account-help-protect-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12410/...</a> .
<br />
<br />It is also advised to add more security info <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4026473/microsoft-account-how-to-add-security-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/402647...</a> in order to access or retrieve compromised account <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10494/microsoft-account-how-to-access-a-compromised-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10494/...</a>
<br />
<br />Also please do not share your account (new alias) and password, pay attention to suspicious emails and do not access links there <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this answers your question and will help secure your account.

<p>Thank you for such a speedy reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed the screenshot entirely, but my question still stands; since they were both unsuccessful syncs, is it okay to ignore them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, on an unrelated note -and since I thought it would be better to ask in my own thread anyway- but I've noticed my IP address is different to the one I had this morning. Is it normal for IP addresses to change? I've signed out and in to my emails and
 checked my recent activity a couple of times now, and it does appear to be me and not someone else, based on the device/platform and browser used, as well as the session activity. It's only the IP address which seems different now; could this be due to my
 internet service provider?</p>

            Dear finlandsberet , 
<br />
<br />If it is ok to ignore that, I am not sure. From your description it looks like someone is trying to hack your account and know only about the alias. My suggestion makes it impossible to log into account using that alias, so until hacker will obtain your primary account, he will not be able to gain access to your account.
<br />
<br />Sometimes when users are using VPN or Proxy, they will find their recent activity "quite interesting" as they might not even visited those countries and entries will be saved. But I do not think this is your case.
<br />
<br />About IP address you should ask your internet provider.

            I have one more quick question; as I mentioned in my original post, removing my email account/address from my mobile device helped resolve this issue. Should I simply try removing it again - as in, removing Outlook from my mobile device- and see if that
 helps to stop these unsuccessful sync attempts? I've checked my recent activity again and about five minutes ago there are another unsuccessful attempt from someone in Malaysia.<br />

            Dear finlandsberet ,
<br />
<br />If hacker knows your email address and is trying to access it, it would not matter if you have this account on one particular device or on different devices. All Microsoft account can be accessed online via <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/</a> or <a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com</a> .
<br />
<br />At this point you are aware of the fact that someone is trying to access your account , so it is better to disable access through that alias if it is not primary account. You can try to remove account from phone and keep monitoring situation, but it would be much more safer to disable access.
<br />
<br />Please do not share your account and password, pay attention to suspicious emails and do not access links there <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a> and "Help protect your Outlook.com email account" <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-protect-your-outlook-com-email-account-a4f20fc5-4307-4ece-8231-6d4d4bd8a9ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-p...</a>

            Hello finlandsberet, <br />
<br />
I understand that your account may have been compromised. This is very alarming indeed and I know how you are feeling right now. Don't worry! I am able to advise you on this.
<br />
<br />
Here are some articles I find may be relevant to you: <br />
<br />
- How to determine whether your Office 365 account has been compromised: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2551603/how-to-determine-whether-your-office-365-account-has-been-compromised" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/255160...</a> <br />
- My Outlook.com has been hacked: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/my-outlook-com-account-has-been-hacked-35993ac5-ac2f-494e-aacb-5232dda453d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/my-out...</a> <br />
<br />
Essentially, you have to <br />
<br />
1. change your passwords <br />
2. manage your trusted devices <br />
3. enable two-step verification <br />
<br />
You do not have to worry about any recent sign-on activities at all if you have done
<strong>all the 3 steps above</strong>. The "recent sign-on activities" is just a record of failed login attempt, caught by the security, which you can replicate by intentionally setting up a failed IMAP/POP3/SMTP access.
<br />
<br />
Hope it helps! <br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />
Sutharsan <br />

<p>Thank you again for your help. I've got two-step verification on and I've been carefully monitoring my activity all day so far. I've also uninstalled Outlook on my mobile device and I've managed to do a workaround using my Gmail on my mobile phone. I'll
 check my activity later today to see if anything has happened, and I'll be sure to keep an eye on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, if I need to make an alias account, and if I want it to be Outlook, I assume I have to sign-out of my current email account and create one from the sign-in page?</p>
<p>

            <p>You're right about using AutoCorrect. Probably the easiest way is to first find and copy (Ctl+c) the symbol you want so it's readily available. Then go to File&gt;Options&gt;Proofing&gt;AutoCorrect (make sure you're on the AutoCorrect tab, and that the "Replace text
 as you type" box is checked).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click in the "Replace" box and type your "trigger phrase" (==&gt;). Then&nbsp;tab or click into the "With": box and press Ctl+v to paste in the desired symbol. Click the "ADD" button below, click OK twice, and you should be in business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you don't already have a particular arrow in mind, there are several options available in the Symbol, Wingdings, and Wingdings 3 fonts.</p>

<h2>            Website wants to run add-on &#39;name.dll&#39;</h2>
                    Hi, I'm using IE8 on XP SP3 for about 3 months now. Recently, I see a pop up appearing on some of the sites that I visit:
<br />
<br />
"This website wants to run the following add-on: 'name.dll' from 'Microsoft Corp'. If you trust the website and the add-on and want to allow it to run, click here..."<br />
<br />
My questions are:<br />
1) what does this add-on do?<br />
2) I never had this&nbsp;issue previously, why the sudden change?<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />

            It depends on the site you are visiting.&nbsp; There is a file named name.dll that is part of Windows and is used on Sharepoint Sites.&nbsp; However, there is also a version of this file that sontains the PadonokTrojan.&nbsp; It really depends on the site you are visiting
 and since you didn't provide the site name or a URL my best advice would be to NEVER allow an activeX control or Add-on to run from a site unless you are 1000% sure that it is a reliable, reputable site.&nbsp; Better to err on the side of caution then to find yourself
 trying to remove a nasty virus or malware/spyware infection.

<div style="text-align: left">It seems that the&nbsp;frame is too long. If I go up to the bar where the picture is after a fashion I can get the bar to move to get the sign out picture but then the email information on the left side half disappears so can't read
 anything. I tried the + and - and it worked. Thanks for that tip didn't know that. But I don't know a lot about computers didn't have them when I went to school. Always delete cookies and data when I'm done and before I shut down. It just does this in Internet
 Explorer. Works fine in Chrome. Any other tips to try?</div>

It works in Chrome Browser&nbsp;but not in Internet Explorer Browser. The horizontal screen seems to be too long and I can't shorten it. If I move it from one side to show all items then stuff on the other side disappears. I reset Internet Explorer and that did
 nothing. Zoom does not solve anything and it is set at 100%. This is Windows 7 with Internet Explorer 11.

            Ok that gave me everything back but I can not use the beta now. If I click on beta it goes back to the ends disappearing. I sure liked beta better. I may just give up on internet explorer and go to using chrome for everything. It seemed to work in chrome
 ok. And a lot of sites are not working well in internet explorer any more. Too bad Microsoft isn't keep Windows 7 and Internet Explorer up as many people have them and like them.

            GOOD to  hear that your issue is resolved actually Microsoft is going to end support for windows 7 after jan 14 2020  and IE they  are more focusing on win 10 and edge browser ..and they are working a lot on it..i am sorry to say but its a harsh truth 
<br />
<br />as IE has become old and  and our websites today  comes with many features and has become heavy to handle ..i would suggest you to go with updated browser to have flawless experience with outlook.. 
<br />
<br />hope it resolves most of your query feel free to comment ,best regrades

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures:
<br />
<br />Try working with the Word Safe mode and check if it helps.
<br />Hold the windows key + Letter ‘R’ on the keyboard to launch the Run command &gt; Copy and paste the following command line in the open box and click Ok.
<br />
<br />For Excel: Type excel /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Outlook: Type outlook /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Word: Type winword /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For PowerPoint: Type powerpnt /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Publisher: Type mspub /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Visio: Type visio /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />If, word works properly do you need to disable add-ins:
<br />Go into Word / Excel/ PW:
<br />Click on File menu.
<br />Click Options.
<br />Click Add-ins.
<br />Click on Go button besides Manage: Com-Add-in.
<br />Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox to disable them.
<br />Close the Word and restart it.
<br />
<br />In the link below explain how disable add-in:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-manage-and-install-add-ins-in-office-programs-16278816-1948-4028-91e5-76dca5380f8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-m...</a>
<br />
<br />If, the procedures above didn't work, I refer to repair Office in the following link for more information:
<br />
<br />Go to Control Panel &gt;&gt; Add and Remove Programs and highlight Microsoft Office. Click on Remove. A menu will pop up allowing you to choose repair or reinstall. Try a Repair Online and verified after repair it fix.

<h2>            Proof of delivery - SMTP log</h2>
                    <p>Greetings!&nbsp; For messages sent out from Outlook.Com, how do I access the SMTP log showing proof of delivery?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is:&nbsp; Some recipients&nbsp;tell me they have not received my message.&nbsp; I have asked them to check their inbox and junk mail folders.&nbsp; I have verified the message is in my Outlook.Com sent folder.&nbsp; I did not receive a non-delivery (bounce) message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the problem is on the recipient's end.&nbsp; I would like to provide the third party recipient's postmaster with the SMTP server log showing the message was handed off from Microsoft to their server.&nbsp; Let me know, thanks.</p>

</p><p><span><span>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please be informed that we don't have an option in Outlook to check the delivery status.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As a workaround, we recommend that you&nbsp;use&nbsp;Windows Live Mail for it has the said feature.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you don't have Live Mail, you can download it&nbsp;from the below link:</span><span>&nbsp;

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you add your Outlook account to Live Mail, everything&nbsp;will be&nbsp;synchronize between your&nbsp;mail client and Outlook. Therefore, whatever you do on your mail client, like delete an email, add an appointment, update one of your contacts with a new number,
 send messages, or create a folder&nbsp;will also be reflected on the web, and vice-versa.
<br />
<br />
Once done, please follow the steps below on how to enable read receipt feature: </span>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to your Live Mail account. </li><li>Press <strong>Alt + F</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Options</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Mail</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Receipts</strong> tab. </li><li>Under Returning Read Receipts, tick on <strong>Notify me for each read receive request</strong>.
</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> and then <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;To receive a notification that your recipient read your email, your recipient should have a mail client read receipt enabled.</span></p>

<p>AFAIK, it will never be available because no one will develope an application for a Dead OS.</p>

<h2>            Pass search keywords through QueryString to Office Online to highlight keywords inside document</h2>
                    <p>When I use SharePoint Online to search for documents, the search results page highlights the matched keywords inside the found documents. When I click on a document from the search results, it opens in an Office web app, like Word Online.&nbsp;Whenever I search
 in Word Online using Ctrl-F, the search keywords are highlighted nicely. I would like that i can pass my original SharePoint search keywords to Word Online, and that the found keywords are highlighted automatically in the same manner as searching with Ctrl-F
 would do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for example, if I click a SharePoint Online search result, I would like to pass the search keyword through a QueryString parameter. See example below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://{company].sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc={sourcedocId}&amp;file={filename}&amp;action=default&amp;DefaultItemOpen=1&amp;search=test</p>
<p>
</p><p>When looking at the document in Word Online, I would like to see the word "test" highlighted. Is this possible?</p>

            <p>Hi Bastiaan. Thanks for your post. While this is a great idea, there currently isn't any way to launch Word Online with the Find pane open and pre-populated with a search. I'll make sure to pass the suggestion on to our program managers for consideration
 in a future release.</p>

    <title>Nokia 2760 and Bluetooth connection problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bearface---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 2760 and Bluetooth connection problem</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Nokia 2760 which is fine for every day use but I decided I wanted to put some photos I'd taken on it onto my desktop PC and laptop. I bought a Belkin Bluetooth adapter from Amazon (100 metres range, v.2.1) and installed on both computers. I then
 installed Nokia OVI Suite which again went smoothly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My desktop PC is Windows 7 and my laptop is Vista. The &nbsp;Bluetooth works fine with the laptop but with the desktop is connects briefly (about 20 seconds) to the phone and then the connection breaks. Same again if I restart the computer. &nbsp;I took &nbsp;2 photos
 today and can't get them off the phone and onto the desktop. Is this cos the adapter doesn't like Windows 7 do you think? &nbsp;On the Belkin packaging it only seems to go up to Vista.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, when you 'sync' can anyone confirm it means only copying pictures from the phone to the PC and not vice versa as I have over 1,000 pictures on the PC!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grateful for any advice/comments as I am a Bluetooth novice!</p>

<p>In fact you don't need OVI Suite to transfer files between PC and 2760. Just pair devices, right click bluetooth icon in systray to send or receive files.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My Nokia E52, since a few days, will simply not turn on!&nbsp;<span>When I press the power button, i get the buzz but that's all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I thought it was the battery (although before this happened, it lasted a full day with heavy use and up to 5 days with light use). Anyway, I replaced the battery but that didn't solve it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Desperate, I tried a hard reset (*+3+talk+power) but also with no success. Buzz and no other signs of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions? Thanks so much...</p>
