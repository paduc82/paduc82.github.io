            <p>I've had this happen to me as well as I opened Gears of War 3. Got 2 "free" achievements right off the bat. Pattern seems to me that this is a glitch rather than foul play. Can't be 100% sure, though. Wish someone a bit higher up on the ladder had a look at this.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

<h3> lrrrac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 crashes when I connect my Xbox One controller</h2>
                    <p>As soon as I connect my Xbox One controller to my PC running Windows 10, wired or wireless, my display drivers crash and potentially my entire computer, leaving me with a black screen in a lower resolution. If I remove it soon enough, it just crashed my
 display drivers and I am able to restart those without issue. I am unable to use my controller without this happening and have reinstalled the wireless adapter driver with no avail, and cannot touch the controller driver as it crashes immediately. Please post
 any help.</p>

            <p>I am having the same issue. When I am streaming my Xbox games through my Windows 10 PC, if my controller is connected to the PC, the PC shuts down completely without notice and then restarts. This happens without fail within minutes every time. The longest
 I've gotten before the crash was 45 minutes. Usually it is less than 10 minutes. I can stream all day without a controller connected. I can play games streaming to the PC but leave the controller connected to the Xbox and it works fine. I have tested 3 different
 controllers and have connected them through the wireless adapter as well as connected them directly via a USB cable. I have&nbsp;reset/reinstalled Windows 10 to no avail. I've updated my MB BIOS and drivers again to no avail. I also replaced all memory and the
 power supply in the PC. (assumed I was dealing with a hardware issue) I've tested USB functionality by connecting an external hard drive and writing enormous amounts of data to it that took hours without failure. I repeated this process 3 times. I tested sound
 by streaming music and TV to it for many hours. My next step is replacing the MB but would hate to go to that extent to continue having the same problem.</p>

    <title>System And Compressed Memory High CPU Usage In Windows 10 -- Usual - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robo4900  say:</h3>
<h2>            System And Compressed Memory High CPU Usage In Windows 10 -- Usual Solutions Not Working. Help, please&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The process "System and compressed memory" is always using between 15 and 25% of my CPU at all times. Before I got a new CPU cooler, this drove the CPU temperature up dangerously high(Sometimes going up to 70<span>°</span>c. The CPU forces a shutdown at
 80<span>°c</span>), which rendered the PC unusable unless I put it into "Power saver" mode, which slows down programs(Making gaming difficult), but System and compressed memory only uses about 8% when I do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, with my new CPU cooler, temperature isn't a problem anymore(Highest it goes under intense load is 45<span>°c</span>), but that's still 25% of my CPU power that's completely locked off. And of course, it's constantly working my CPU and cooler(Never
 drops bellow 35<span>°c</span>), which can't be good for either of them, so I'm worried about their lifespans(Particularly if I have AMD Turbo or whatever it's called enabled in my motherboard, which raises the idle temp from 35<span>°c to about 42</span><span>°c</span>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried every solution I could find online(Including many from this very site), but none of them have worked(Other than power saver mode lowering the usage to 8%, which isn't helpful).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My specs: AMD FX-6300 CPU(6 cores, 3.5GHz), AMD R7 370 GPU, Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD3 motherboard, and an OCZ SSD with Windows 10(64-bit) installed, with 2x1TB HDDs(One of which used to have Windows 10 on it, and it still had this issue). I'm using onboard
 audio(Which makes squeaky paper noises when the GPU is under stress).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have an Edimax 802.11n PCI network card, but I temporarily removed it a while back, and the problem was still present, so it's not the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, suggestions?</p>

            <p>I didn't make any changes before the issue -- I actually did a clean install and the problem still followed me.</p>
<p>I'm using the free version of Avast as an antivirus(Although, Avast isn't causing this. See the end of this reply for details).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The troubleshooter found nothing, and the issue was still present in both safe mode and clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One oddity that arose out of the clean boot was that I disconnected and reconnected to my router, then I got a bluescreen error saying "PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA". Also, Avast refused to be disabled as part of the clean boot, so I temporarily disabled
 my internet(Then realised I should download an installer so I could reinstall it quickly later, so I reconnected, and got that bluescreen error. Regardless, I rebooted, and all seemed to be fine, so I continued on) and uninstalled Avast, but the problem was
 still there.</p>

            <p>Well, I haven't had that Bluescreen error since, so I'm guessing it was a one-time thing? I'll run a memory check when I can to make sure(It could take a while, as I have 8GB of RAM, so unless it's absolutely necessary, I'm going to have to hold off on that
 -- I have studying to do which requires my PC).</p>
<p>I looked through the system logs, but I didn't find any criticals, although about 4 errors come up every time my PC turns off(I'm guessing that's to do with some programs being abruptly stopped on shutdown).</p>
However, there is both a MEMORY.DMP and several minidump files, so would you like me to upload those?
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The memory compression issue is still present(At this moment using 19% of my CPU).</p>

    <title>Update of Network card drivers of an ISCSI Windows 8 Installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tornhoof  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update of Network card drivers of an ISCSI Windows 8 Installation results in Inaccessible Boot Device</h2>
                    System:<br />
Windows 8 Pro Installation on an ISCSI boot device<br />
Ethernet device is Intel Gigabit CT Desktop Adapter<br />
<br />
Steps to reproduce:<br />
1. Install to ISCSI (works fine)<br />
2. Update with Windows Update<br />
3. Add Optional Intel Gigabit Driver Update<br />
4. Reboot<br />
<br />
Result:<br />
0x7B - Inaccessible Boot Device<br />
<br />
I suspect (as usual) that Lightweight Filter Driver, the fix from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2507616 does not work, apparently it does not add a second network card.<br />
<br />
This is kinda annoying and I would have hoped that Microsoft would have fixed that in Windows 8, since similar Bugs (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2487376/en-us etc.) are well known for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008.<br />

            <p><span>Hi Tornhoof,</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I gather that you have installed Windows 8 Pro on an ISCSI boot device and then you try installing the Optional Intel Gigabit
 Driver Update from Windows Update and rebooting the computer – which result in the error: 0x7B – Inaccessible Boot Device.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to resolve this issue please try this step:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As the installation of the Optional Intel Gigabit Driver Update causes the 0x7B – Inaccessible Boot Device error, I would suggest
 you to try installing the motherboard/hardware or any driver related updates from the manufacturer’s website and reboot the computer and check if you are able to boot normally to the ISCSI boot device.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the above step works to resolve your issue. Please try the above step and let us know the result.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.

            Hi,<br />
I tried to install the Intel Gigabit CT Desktop Adapter Drivers for Windows 8, Version 17.4 from downloadcenter.intel.com, after an initial ISCSI installation. Same 0x7B error occurs with this driver. I'm quit certain that this is not a driver problem, it will
 probably happen with every ISCSI driver. Probably some necessary setting for the ISCSI boot support is not set during the update of the driver (e.g. starting the LWF or similar).<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Tornhoof<br />

<p>I'm runnin the windows 7 evaluation copy right now. Windows tells me that I need to configure a device, so I go to "configure a device" in the Control Panel. What happens next is a message appears telling me that I need to re-install a driver for&nbsp;the "Realtek
 RTL8168B/8111B Family PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet NIC (NDIS 6.0)".... so I click "Install Driver" which is an option on the pop-up message. Almost immediately I recieve another message telling me that the "Driver did NOT install successfully" and I should try it
 again. I've tried finding the driver and installing seperate from the Control Panel functions, and I've tried updating the Ethernet thing individually through the Device Manager but it's causing some compatability issues and I've blue-screened several times
 in the past 12 hours. I'm incredibly frustrated. Any ideas???</p>

            You need to go to the Realtek Site and actually get the latest drivers. I suggest you do the same for all your other drivers, go to maker's sites and DO NOT RUN LOOK for DRIVERS in Device Manager as that will only find OLD certified versions and you are
 now ahead of the curve.<br />

<h2>            Acer 7551 no WiFi</h2>
                    <p>Hi I'm having a problem with my Acer Aspire 7551-3650. It has a Broadcom 802.11 card. One day my internet access (wifi) indicator failed to load and of course..no internet. Upon checking my device manager it showed my wired connections were all there except
 my wireless adapter. Something I thought was strange also...all my restore points are gone and any back up records! Just seems strange. Anyway...one or two times I have been able to get it back again thru re-booting and one time re-installing the driver...now
 this time nothing seems to work...the total times it's dumped has been about 4. This last time it lasted for 23 days. First time was about 2 weeks after upgrading from W7 to W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for your reply... I have the "a" version of the file <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<em>k57nd60a.sys </em>and followed the instructions, rebooted, to no avail. What I did notice was the message regarding the fix, referred to a loss of all connectivity... I still have hardwire internet and no wireless. Just the wireless adapter is affected
 and is not showing at all in the device manager. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The wireless adapter has dropped so many times that I'm not sure anymore if this is the info you need...but I guess we have to start somewhere.</span></p>

            <p>Ah, the PC with the problem does/did have AVG, I uninstalled it but there are some bits still floating around.&nbsp; Cheers bud, I'll have a go at removing it properly and see if that sorts it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: Yep, AVG had reinstalled itself somehow, and after removing it properly this time, File Explorer works fine.&nbsp; Thanks dLighta, spot on.</p>

            <p>Hello and thank you for the reply!, as far as recent soft or hardware,&nbsp; no recent adjustments aside from&nbsp; downloading a few FTP clients (Filezilla, CuteFTP, SmartFTP, and the one with the duck?) which I shortly removed all incase they were the issue as well
 as with various "antimalware" and VPN's all freeware that I suspected could be the issue so I have uninstalled them ALL, along with VUZE which I've had forever and never gave me problems but&nbsp;now will open but&nbsp;shut down with these errors as soon as I try to
 do anything&nbsp;No hardware changes what so ever, Troubleshooting I have so far run System File Checker twice bringing up nothing, most recently ran the Memory Diagnostic Tool, disabled all&nbsp;add-ons, made sure everything as far as I can tell is uptodate and ok
 according to windows defender. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing I have noticed though is that for some reason my recovery drive is almost full but my drive C is only a 3rd full, the compouter is&nbsp;4 months old&nbsp;and I don't remember having anything at all in the recovery drive. that seems to have happened
 quickly and recently. the errors keep changing numbers and minor characteristics the most recent now saying something "the exception privileged instruction.... and they all seem to refer to memory though and there was one that hasn't popped up in a bit that
 was different: browser_broker.exe which was not a werfault.exe. So&nbsp;I thought I was booting in safemode but now suspect I wasn't doing it right with the new instructions i'm going to try again, and will&nbsp; keep you posted ... so thank you sooo much&nbsp;for the help
 and consideration. I greatly appreciate it, and wil be keeping a tentative eye on this thread. - Nico</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried twice today to report the same problem.</p>
<p>On a multi boot system with Win10 and Win7 installed on different hard discs.</p>
<p>Win7 invokes a CHKDSK of every disc on the system, following the use of Win10.</p>
<p>If Win10 is not used, Win7 just starts normally.</p>
<p>A chkdsk run manually from a Win7 dos session on the win10 disc shows 24,419 reparse records processed</p>
<p>errors, when checked today following a win10 1703 build "repair in place upgrade".</p>
<p>I have now been told to do a clean install on Win10, but I am not convinced it will make any difference to the problem.</p>

            <p>Yes, but you will need an additional Windows 10 licenses. You can't use the same license in the Parallels VM and Boot Camp.</p>

            I infer from your reply that I cannot buy one retail version of Windows 10 and install this one retail version in Bootcamp and Parallels on the same computer. &nbsp;I assume I will have to "buy" an additional license. &nbsp;Am I correct?

            The Boot Camp install can be used in Parallels, but you will need an additional license to activate. The answer is yes.

    <title>Installation Stuck at 64&#37;&#33; &#40;Restarting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> living chicken  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installation Stuck at 64&#37;&#33; &#40;Restarting Loop&#33;&#33;&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So I was factory resetting Windows 10 on my old HP Pavilion g6 laptop and it was stuck on the "Installing Windows" screen with the circle and percentage in the middle. First it was stuck on 10% now is 64% but at that 64% it keeps restarting! I don't know
 what to do, this is my only computer. When it restarts, it restarts the whole system, goes to the screen where it has the blue Windows 10 logo, then black screen with the loading circle and then back to the blue Windows 10 logo but it said "preparing" at the
 bottom, and last, it went to the "Installing Windows" screen but flashes very fast to restart and it repeats over and over in a loop. If you help me, thank you!!!</p>

            Is there an optional way instead of the Windows media creation tool? Like maybe on the BIOS or safe mode? My only working computer is a 32bit Windows XP desktop. I need help with the ISO 32bit file. What does it actually do? I mean, what to do with it?

            <p>Well, starting a clean install from within a running version of Windows is the only way to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you can't do that, you will need to configure your BIOS to boot from the install media. If you are unsure about to how to do that, you could try asking someone you trust to help you.</p>

            I am having this same issue.&nbsp; I have tried using 3.0 and 2.0 usb ports...seems like the 2.0 gets me somewhat farther in my problem.<br />
<br />
I have tried swapping USB cables, making sure mine works with other devices.&nbsp; No issue there with that.&nbsp; So I used your recommendation above.<br />
<br />
When I connect it to my computer it recognizes the device, just gives me no option of selecting it unless I go to my Device and Printers area.&nbsp; I right-click, troubleshoot and it tells me, "There is a problem with the driver for USB Mass Storage Device, Reinstalling
 the driver might fix this problem."&nbsp; I hit "Apply this fix" and then it comes up and says, "Troubleshooting was unable to automatically fix all of the issues found.."&nbsp; and the "Explore additional options" button is beyond a waste of my time for help.<br />
<br />
I am extremely disappointed about this.&nbsp; I connected it fine earlier and then re-connected it later to put my music on my phone, and nothing.&nbsp; Reasons like this are what made me become a mac user in the past.&nbsp; I have to use windows for my schooling/work and
 would love to be able to do a basic task, like this, to get the most of both of my devices.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Also, I have updated all drivers for my phone and laptop..so don't waste my time with that.<br />

            <p>My husband and I are having the same problem.&nbsp; We both have Samsung Galaxy Notes
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We have a Surface Pro 2 (Windows 8.1), an Asus all-in-one (was Windows 8.0, upgraded to Windows 8.1) and an Asus Gamers Laptop (Windows 7).
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When you connect the phones via USB to the Windows 7 laptop the phone shows that it is charging and on the PC the phone&nbsp;shows up under My Computer as removable storage.&nbsp; You can select the phone or the SD card in the phone and&nbsp;open&nbsp;/ rename /&nbsp;delete / create&nbsp;folders,
 drag &amp; drop content (photos, music, etc),&nbsp;etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Asus all-in-one behaved exactly the same when it&nbsp;was Windows 8.0, but on upgrade to Windows 8.1 this functionality disappeared.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On both Windows 8.1 PCs, when you&nbsp;connect either phone&nbsp;via the USB cable the phone shows it is connected and charging, sometimes it says it is connecting as an MTP device&nbsp;but it does not always.&nbsp;You can go into settings and&nbsp;under USB utilities select "connect
 storage to PC" but nothing happens. On&nbsp;both the Windows 8.1 PCs &nbsp;there is not indication that the phone is plugged in. I cannot find it as a device on "MY Computer" and I cannot find it as a device under Device Manager.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I contacted Samsung and they suggested it is a problem with a Windows 8.1 driver and that I would need to get help in Microsoft land.&nbsp;

            It seems to be a problem with windows 8.1 pro and Samsung devices only. Because it will work fine when I plug my friends ate phone in. Also I plugged my galaxy s2 into a windows 8 laptop and no problem . It seems to be Samsung devices only on windows 8.1
 . If you figure this out please help because I can't root my device without this working

<h3> kspaa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar on left side&#59; Few issues.</h2>
                    <p>For productivity reasons, I have locked my taskbar to the left side of my screen. There are two issues I'm facing now:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) A few of my notifications will pop up in very incorrect places. Since my icons are now in the bottom left corner I expected my notifications to pop up in the bottom left corner. A few of my applications will have notifications popup &nbsp;in the top left corner,
 sometimes getting clipped by the top of the screen where I can't even read them. Am I going to people able to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) The charms window button that appears in the bottom left corner is most definitely in the way; how do I get rid of it? I have trouble clicking the "Show Desktop" button because the charms button pops up. &nbsp;The calendar is hard to access as well. Any way
 to get rid of the charms Windows button?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like these problems should have easily been addressed by Microsoft. Unfortunately it feels Windows 8 wasn't even properly tested or configured to have the taskbar anywhere but the top or bottom.</p>

            <p>Before any reply, there will be no updates to Windows 8.1 to address these.&nbsp; Windows 8.1 is a finished operating system and is locked in stone as terms of functionality.&nbsp; Only security and issues causing data loss/crashes will be addressed from this point
 forward.&nbsp; Any behavior changes -- even those obvious and egregious and demanding of attention -- will only occur in the next version of Windows.&nbsp; So I encourage you to either submit Windows 10 feedback, or join the Windows 10 preview program to help shape
 it.&nbsp; You'll be getting it July 29th.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em><strong>A few of my notifications will pop up in very incorrect places</strong></em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">As you noticed, the notification bubbles from your Taskbar notification area icons will still appear out of the correct place (the bottom left corner).&nbsp; You're few you're seeing are apps&nbsp;notifications.&nbsp; You can go turn those off
 if you want, but they're hard-coded to appear there because they're built for tablets and touch screens, so sorry to report it can't be changed, only turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"The charms window button that appears in the bottom left corner is most definitely in the way"</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">For this one the only thing I can think to try is either
<a href="http://classicshell.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Classic Shell</a> or <a href="http://www.stardock.com/products/start8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Probably not.&nbsp; They only test the default configuration completely because it serves the 99.9% of the population.&nbsp; It's likely that no one in their beta program ever mentioned this.&nbsp; This is also why I beg you to get your voice heard
 by submitting Windows 10 feedback.&nbsp; Trust me, it needs it.</p>

<div><br />
Try this example from a Command Prompt. XXXX is the actual computer name and is surrounded by quotes.</div>
<div>wmic /node:"XXXX" product list</div>
<p>Windows comes with a command line version of the Management Instrumentation (WMIC).<br />
<br />
To get the list of all installed programs in a text file, simply enter the following command in a prompt:<br />
<br />
wmic product &gt; c:\product.txt <br />
<br />
C:\windows\system32\wmic is the command<br />
Below syntax is to execute this command<br />
<br />
C:\windows\system32\wmic \output:C:/installed.txt product get name, version <span>
</span></p>
        </p>

            Arya, thanks for your reply. &nbsp;I have run that command as well as exporting the output of the regedit command and parsing through the results but neither one displays all the programs shown in the Programs and Features window.
<div><br />
<div>Is there anyway to learn the commands used to create the exact list shown in the Programs and Features window?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!!</div>

<h2>            Xbox &#38;quot&#59;freezing&#38;quot&#59; during game play </h2>
                    
<p>Basically the problem I've been noticing is that my game lags. It's not the internet connection due to the fact that it does this in single player.</p>
<p>It freezes for 5-15 seconds and then returns to the normal speed of the game.<br />
It's not the disc all my disks are in almost perfect condition.</p>
