<p>Just copy a few out of the larger files and rename them to .JPG, and then open the renamed copy. If they are the pictures you want, then you can set that folder to be your slideshow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I don't think W10 will do it automatically as/when the pictures are updated, only as you manually copy them in.<br />

            <p>Hi - possibly when you saw the option it was via a different app. The <strong>
'Dynamic Theme' </strong>app which is a free download from the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Windows Store</span> allows you to use Spotlight images on the desktop... (plus you can scroll through dozens of them in the viewer and save any you like directly). There are also daily Bing images available.</p>
<p>Cheers, Ric.</p>

</p><p>I'm attaching two screenshots here ... One screenshot &nbsp;from my freind's laptop. In that screenshot for the option 'desktop background slideshow, there is a provision to select "<strong>desktopbackground</strong>" for choosing album.</p>

            <p>No worries! - If you check with your friend I'm pretty certain you will find that 'DesktopBackground' is a sub-folder created by them... it's not a folder that exists within the system.&nbsp;Your friend&nbsp;has probably selected it from&nbsp;their own folders using the
 'Browse' button below where yours says 'Pictures'. &nbsp;In my settings for example, you would see 'Spotlight' but that is a folder I created (containing spotlight images I put there) rather than a system option. That's why I suggested you try the Dynamic Theme
 app because you can access and save all those pictures easily to create your own slideshow... check with your friend and update. - Cheers, Ric.</p>

</p><p>Interesting fact is no pictures is &nbsp;in my friends desktopbackground folder, but when we click the next background option while right clicking on desktop, the desktop background changes.....</p>

            I don't use either Camera Roll or Saved Pictures and have hidden them in my Pictures folder. I'm guessing a bit here, but I wonder if the reason you don't get a change of image when r-clicking on the desktop is that the slideshow is not directed to one
 specific folder. Test this by creating a folder called 'Showtime' as a sub-folder in 'Pictures' and throw some random landscape orientation pictures into it. Then use the Browse button and select 'Showtime' for your slideshow... see what happens then.

            <p>Yes... now slideshow works.....</p>
<p>I know that ....... This feature is not a new thing... It is already in previous versions....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Actually what I'm talking about is the new feature that was added while upgrading from Windows10 to
<strong>windows10 Anniversary Edition.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In this feature if you select desktop background to slideshow option,(Even without selecting specific folder,Default folder- Pictures) Check the screenshot &nbsp;1 above.....When we click the Browse button it directed to Pictures folder, but you can't see a folder
 named <strong>Desktopbackground</strong> there nor any image files. yet the desktop background changes with the desired &nbsp;time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my laptop, there is no Desktopbackground folder for slideshow (check screenshot 2 ),why is that ...?</p>

    <title>&#91;SOLVED&#93; Can&#39;t connect to internet&#58; Windows7 can&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> me and my computer  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93; Can&#39;t connect to internet&#58; Windows7 can&#39;t see, connect to, or otherwise acknowledge any form of internet connection</h2>
                    Computer: Win7 Pro 64-bit<br />
Fresh install, can't register or get updates due to lack of internet <br />
<br />
I performed a fresh install just tonight. It absolutely does <u>not</u> see any type of internet connection
<u><i>at all</i></u>. It does not detect the wireless router (my Nook tablet and iPhone see it &amp; can connect). Direct line from wall to computer or cable modem to computer yields no indication by Windows that anything was even plugged in. All built-in troubleshooting
 yields nothing (because it has to connect to the internet to get any results!). Missing drivers, maybe: Windows says to go download them via Automatic Updates....great, except
<i>I can't get online</i>! All stock "recommended settings" are turned on. All personal attempts to troubleshoot result in nothing, tells me to do everything I already have tried, and other dead-ends. The connection wizard gives me the option to connect via
 dial-up or broadband (DSL), but the DSL option only allows me to either enter in ISP info (not applicable to me, I have none) or install from an Install CD (again, not applicable to me, I don't have one). I'm not on dial-up, I have cable internet and all you
 do is plug a hard wire straight from the wall into your computer. As far as Windows 7 is concerned, the internet doesn't exist.
<br />
<br />
Windows XP never gave me these problems (I miss XP), and Linux doesn't give me these problems (I am posting via Linux). Both of those
<i>just worked</i>. The response by <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/new-pc-built-for-gaming-is-having-trouble/3a0a76b5-06c9-4977-850c-0605cd6678a3">
Mohammed Raieed, and the links he provided to the original poster did not work for me</a>. I still have no internet. The same ethernet wire plugged into my fiance's WinXP computer gives him immediate internet access. The same wire put back into my computer
 and booted into Linux provide me with immediate internet access. Linux auto-detected my internet connection from First Boot-up after install, and WinXP could also connect with minimal fuss on First Boot-up after install. So what's so horribly wrong with Win7
 that it can't even do the most basic task of getting internet so that it can even register itself? It would love to install updates &amp; drivers too, but those all require internet...which it can't connect to and does not see. I have ruled out hardware problems;
 it is purely an OS or software problem. If Win7 is this bad, I'd really hate to deal with Win8. Good thing I only wanted Windows 7 for gaming on....
<br />
<br />
Please, I am begging for help! This is ridiculous.&nbsp; &gt;:-(<br />
<br />
Sorry for the bits of rant in there... it's late, I'm sick, and I'm terribly frustrated.

            A clean install of Windows does not mean, that every driver was installed. I wish it was, but that can not happen today. Does your friend have the same computer (everything but the serial number) or is it different in any shape?<br />
<br />
Making sure the Network Drivers are installed:<br />
1. Open the Start menu.<br />
2. Type in "device manager" without quotes<br />
3. In the hierarchical list, expand, "Network adapters and Unknown devices<br />
4. List the names of items under Network adapters.<br />
5. On all the items list under Unknown:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Right-click and select Properties<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) In the properties window, click the Details tab.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)&nbsp; In the properties field, select Hardware Ids<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) List the everything the Value section<br />

<h2>            I can&#39;t install Ark&#58; Survival Evolve onto my laptop.</h2>
                    I have had Ark since it was in Game Preview on X-Box, I want to host a dedicated server on my laptop now but whenever I go to "buy" it in the Microsoft store on my laptop, it won't let me. It shows that I own it but it keeps trying to make me download
 onto other X-Boxes, but not my computer. My laptop is up-to-date on updates but it still won't let me. Help would be very appreciated, thank you! :)

<p>Hi Carmin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Having a corrupted game file is one of the possible reasons why you're unable to install the game Ark: Survival Evolved on your computer. To help you resolve this concern, I suggest that you perform the steps below:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several factors that we can consider why this error occurs on your system. It could be an issue related to the Group Policy service or how Windows 10 was installed to your system. For us to identify the exact cause, kindly provide us with the following
 information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your system connected to a domain or corporate environment?</li><li>Did you install Windows 10 using an installation media, a free upgrade tool from previous version of Windows, or a system image deployment tool?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>I don't really know what type of UUID windows use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The customer support of the application developer asked me to use wechoid.exe for diagnosing the licensing problem (wechoid's UUID check box -among others- was disabled). He then instructed me to use powershell command "wmic" (to find out if UUID is really
 unavailable on the system), and finally concluded that he can not resolve this kind of problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I searched here in the community, and although I found a few threads on similar problems (for earlier versions of windows), I didn't found any solution for my very problem.</p>

            Hi Kyle.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />How was WIndows 10 originally activated?  
<br />
<br />What does it say now at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation at the top of the page under Activation Status and Edition?  If not activated run the Troubleshooter just below that and report back results.
<br />
<br />Compare the Install you did with the gold-standard  Install in this link which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br />
<br />The reason I suggest this is because no one of the several million consumers who have performed my Clean Install tutorials over the past ten years has ever come back to report an issue if they stick with the tools and methods given.  What you report normally would arise from some hack, modification or activation ploy because there's no history at all of Activation failure causing crashes on fresh installs.
<br />
<br />If you don't want to do it over then you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>Why can't I delete a ghost (empty) folder/file, which remains in its place after I've moved the original?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am having lots of "file cannot be found" error messages when I try to do some housekeeping in the My Documents folder.&nbsp; When I try to delete or just rename it (I use "zzz" for un-deletables),
<span>I get this message:&nbsp; "Could not find this file. This is no longer located in..."&nbsp;
<span>I get this message:&nbsp; "Could not find this file. This is no longer located in..."&nbsp;
</span>(Is this run-time error 5174, which I see in other community postings?) <span>
&nbsp;</span>I am using Word 2010 in Windows 7.&nbsp; I am not positive it only happens when the file/folder has been previously moved and a ghost (empty) file remains? The original folder/file and contents
<i>do</i> exist elsewhere.<span>&nbsp; </span>I've reorganized a lot lately.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I have tried to delete and rename to no avail.&nbsp; BTW, I am not a developer but am somewhat computer literate; don't know HTML or macros.&nbsp; So speak English in reply, please.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; Thanks, Donna<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, close all Office applications and then try to delete or rename the folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue occurs with all folders created on the system, then I would recommend you to also post your query at the Windows Forum for better
 results:</p>

            I was having the same problems and now I'm currently doing my Win XP updates.<br />
This is how I got it to work<br />
So you have SP2....did you download SP3 from here <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24</a><br />
Do so then and install it.&nbsp; After that download and install the .NET 3.5 framework
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21</a><br />
Then download and install Internet Explorer 8 but when you are in the process of clicking thru the installation,
<u>un</u>check the box that says "INSTALL UPDATES" <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/downloads/ie-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/downloads/ie-8</a><br />
After all this was done I went to Windows Update and the browser asked to install ActiveX. I installed it.&nbsp; Then I went to my Automatic Updates page in my security center in the control panel and shut of the automatic updates.&nbsp; Applied the changes.&nbsp; Then I
 turned them back on.&nbsp; Applied changes.&nbsp; Then I did a PC restart.&nbsp; Went to Windows Update and my update shield popped up in my desktop tool bar.&nbsp; Had patience while it started downloading.&nbsp; Seem like it took awhile because there are so many updates but it is
 working.<br />

            Do you have two PCs or are you just on the one you're trying to update? I don't know...this may stink... but if I were you, I would start over with a fresh install of Win XP.&nbsp; Make sure you enter your product key.&nbsp; I would only install my network driver
 to get on the internet.&nbsp; Make sure your time and date are in sync with the internet.&nbsp; I would then download and install a browser like Firefox so you can navigate without crashing and then try down loading SP3.&nbsp; If you have a second PC you could download SP3
 there and save it on a flash drive or disk and install it on the other PC.<br />

            They are pushing us in that direction.&nbsp; Out with the old and in with the $$$ new.&nbsp; Please don't get mad at me if it still won't work. I reinstalled mine around 5 time before I got it to work trying different things. What I described from my previous suggestions
 did work for me though.&nbsp; I'm sorry if I wasn't able to help you.&nbsp; Also once Microsoft quits it's support for Win XP, you're not going to want to be online with it because of all the hacks that will be released to infiltrate you PC :(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FYI I hate Win 8.
 7 is better. :)<br />

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f20ce2a9-f6bd-4aeb-beab-3f4972ebf5af" title="Lys.Fashion">
<p>
</p><p>What is the exact error message when the invitation is being accepted on the end of the new member? There is a possibility that he is already a member of an existing Skype Manager, thus it will get an error or there would be no option to accept the invitation.
 You can refer to the screenshot below on how you see it on your end:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. On this first screenshot, ask the member to select or click on "<strong>Learn more</strong>".</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/231c985e-5689-4552-bcbb-d386f7d1e0cd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/231c985e-5689-4552-bcbb-d386f7d1e0cd?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If the person you invited was already a member of an existing Skype Manager account, the only option he/she will have is to decline the invite as shown on the image below</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d6732b7-3eb6-4715-8d2f-8ebc900484e6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d6732b7-3eb6-4715-8d2f-8ebc900484e6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is different from your case, kindly ask the person to take a screenshot of the error message and please it here for us to further check the issue. Let me know if you have updates.
</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>With Simple File Sharing (enforced on XP Home), there are three levels of sharing between users.&nbsp; Level 3 is Read-only to other local users that physically log into the machine.&nbsp; Level 4 is Read-only to local users and network users.&nbsp; Level 5 is Read/Write
 to local and network users.&nbsp; How to set up the level you desire is described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base Article:</p>

    <title>Moving SP2.CAB and SP3.CAB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xleanone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving SP2.CAB and SP3.CAB</h2>
                    
<p>When it creates a bootable recovery CD image&nbsp;(ISO) file&nbsp;Retrospect copies the entire contents of the i386 folder to the CD, along with some other stuff. My i386 folder contains both the SP2.CAB and SP3.CAB files and their size makes the ISO file created
 by Retrospect too large to fit on a CD (by about 40 MB).</p>
<p>Can I temporarily move these files (and other CAB files?) from the i386 folder and then move them back after the ISO file is created? Seems to me it shouldn't create a problem, but thought it best to ask.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your response. I will test the bootable CD after creation. I should have been more clear in my question.</p>
<p>Will Windows XP care if I move those CAB files before creating the image file? That is to say, does Windows XP use those files during a session? Will it even notice if they're (temporarily) not in the i386 folder? I'm (initially)&nbsp;not as concerned about the
 ability to boot from the CD and do a restore as I am about crashing Windows while trying to create it! One problem at a time.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

            Hi, Donna,
<br />
<br />This is related to Logitech Download Assistant
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager
<br />Go to the Startup tab and find LogiDA
<br />Right click on LogiDA  &gt; Click on Disable 
<br />This temporarily disables the  Logitech Download Assistant from starting with the computer. 
<br />Next, Delete the Entry
<br />Press Win + R &gt; Type REGEDIT
<br />Create a Backup of Windows Registry using these steps. This makes it easier to Restore the Registry should anything go wrong.

<br />Once you've completed the backup, navigate to the following key
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run key
<br />
<br />Find Logitech Download Assistant in right pane
<br />Right click on the key &gt; Select Delete
<br />Reboot the computer for changes to take effect.

            It assists when downloading/installing software from Logitech however, when causing errors, it is safe to uninstall. You can download any Logitech Software without the assistant.

<h2>            Can I use my xbox 360 Wireless Adapter on my xbox one&#63;</h2>
                    Can I use my xbox 360 Wireless Adapter on my xbox one? I hooked it up to my PC running windows 7 Enterprise. It finds it in device manager but I can't get it to update the driver. In device manager it is listed under "Other devices" and lists it as follows:
 "Xbox Security Method 1, Version 1.00 / 2005 Microsoft Corporation. All Rights reserved". Is there still a driver out there for this Adapter?

<p>Hi Jamie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Xbox forums. I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you referring to the Xbox 360 wireless network adapter, or the Xbox 360 wireless receiver to connect controllers to a PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way any adapter made for the Xbox 360 can't be used on an Xbox One console.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess it doesn't matter which one it is if neither can work on my xbox one...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, to answer your question, it's a Microsoft Wireless Networking Adapter used on my my xbox 360 for wireless connectivity to my network. I'm not using my 360 anymore so I thought I would use it on my xbox one to boost the signal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 900 Mbps per second wireless network, but my xbox one only shows moving at about 80 to 95 Mbps and just thought the 360 adapter might help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any suggestions on how to speed up my x-one (other than having a wired connection), I'd be interested in knowing what you think...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's a negative. You can use Xbox One controllers on an Xbox One console and using the newer
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/xbox-wireless-adapter-for-windows-10/91dqrb97l130?SilentAuth=1&amp;wa=wsignin1.0&amp;activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
wireless adapter for Windows 10</a>. The X360 controller is programmed to work on Windows PCs, but relies on its own 'Xbox 360 Controller for Windows Wireless Adapter'. These can be found cheaply, second hand. Here are some useful links, for you:</p>

<p>I bought the Fallout 4 Season Pass on February 22nd after I picked up the game in order to take advantage of the price before it went up; I redeemed the code through the Microsoft Website and now am unable to access the content.</p>
<p>Am I out of luck or is there a way that this can be rectified? Thanks!</p>

<p>You will not have a legal copy of Windows 10 if you use one of those keys. They probably will not activate Windows 10 as they will be blocked.</p>
<p>The only way is to purchase a licence key.</p>

<h2>            Windows Hello not working</h2>
                    Recently purchased an Asus VivoBook S15 with Windows 10. Everything was working fine with Windows Hello until today when I tried to unlock my laptop after being in sleep mode, the fingerprint sign in option was not available all of a sudden and I had to
 enter my PIN to unlock the laptop. Upon checking my sign in options, it now says "Windows Hello isn't available on this device". Help please?
