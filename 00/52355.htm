    <title>Win 10 image backup hangs at 97&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Win 10 image backup hangs at 97&#37;</h2>
                    I see this same issue being reports starting in 2016 with additional post in 2017, but I have not seen a resolution.&nbsp; Talking to the PC manufacture and Microsoft support resulted in no resolution. Yes, 3rd party software works, but I can't buy that for
 every system i sell. The solution I use at the moment is attaching a 2nd hard drive and then doing the image backup. This works. So, is the issue using the USB ports? I'll try the esata ports next.

<p>System Image Backup was deprecated with the April Creators Update, which means it's not being developed any longer and might be removed in a future update. Microsoft recommends using third-party image software instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you saying that you include image backup software with every computer that you sell? Bravo! You have the right to charge for it, unless you want to include a free image backup program, like the

            Thanks for the reply. I may just have to include a 3rd party software (which of course I will charge for ;-). At least for now, using an attached 2nd drive for the backup works. The images are for my use at this time.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the windows finishes installing, we add antivirus and applications to the system. Before we deliver the system(s) to the client we do image backups. We use the File History route. And, so far we have been able to create them by attaching a 2nd hard
 drive. We create the restore CD and if the client has a serious issue, we can put them back to day one and restore their data backups</p>

<p>File History is not an image backup. It's a file and folder backup. It was designed to backup individual files and folders as they changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your method of setting up and imaging computers is just ... strange. You should be making an image of the complete install and including it in a hidden recovery partition on each computer, including a utility for re-installing the factory image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are special tools for doing this. You don't do it with consumer applications.</p>

<p>I was having the same problem.&nbsp; I was finally successful by removing a USB hub and connecting my external drive directly into the USB port.&nbsp; I'm kicking myself for not doing that first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through the list of suggestions</p>
<p>1) run chkdsk /f = no affect</p>
<p>2) run sfc /scannow = no affect</p>
<p>3) empty Recycle Bin = no affect</p>
<p>4) disable Hibernation&nbsp;= no affect</p>
<p>5) set Pagefile to 0&nbsp;= no affect</p>
<p>6) install the latest Windows Updates&nbsp;= no affect</p>
<p>7) disable Norton AntiVirus&nbsp;= no affect</p>
<p>8) install an HP Hardware diagnostics UEFI update&nbsp;= no affect</p>
<p>9) bypass USB hub and connect directly to (front) USB port&nbsp; ***SUCCESS***</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like such a fool because it should have been an obvious variable and so easy to remove.&nbsp; On the other hand, I'm glad that I persevered because I preferred to use the built in backup in the hopes that it would make any Restore easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps someone.</p>

    <title>Blue Screen in the middle of installing windows updates. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beauh22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen in the middle of installing windows updates.</h2>
                    Hello. Today at school my computer randomly shut off and forced me to start updates, something it does whenever I postpone the updates for too long. Everything went smoothly up until it got to 30%, where it blue screened, and went into recovery mode. Sadly
 I was unable to write down the error code or do the QR code. When it finished recovery mode, it said it couldn't be helped, and the source of the error was system32. This is where I freaked, I thought my computer just killed itself before my eyes. I clicked
 continue to Windows 10, and when it booted up, it said installing windows updates, and it was at 65%. I was so relived and thought everything was fine. Now, I went into settings and it still says I have more updates to install, but of course I am now terrified
 to do so. Is it a common problem with a simple fix? Or should I just ignore it and install the rest of the updates, or take it as a sign something is very wrong and take it to get worked on?

            Hey Beau.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Never fear that even with the most troublesome Updates that Windows 10 has given us, this is still only software so nothing is going to "kill" your computer which is made up of hardware.  Software you can always reinstall.  
<br />
<br />So be sure your files are backed up at all times.  I'd set Onedrive to Autosave your Desktop, Pictures and Documents in OneDrive &gt; Settings &gt; Autosave tab so that it's all synched in the cloud in real time.  Then I'd sort all files into those folders and at the same time copy them out externally to an external USB drive.  
<br />
<br />You can also save a System Image backup of Windows so if it ever becomes irreparable you can restore it in 20 minutes:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>. 
<br />
<br />Here are steps to go over your Windows Updater to make sure it's solid:  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt by typing CMD in Start Search, right click result to Run as Administrator, copy and paste or type the following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) Complete Guide to Managing Updates after Version 1803: <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-update-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-up...</a>
<br />
<br />6) If Updates still won't run go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thank you for the help! I ran the troubleshooter and it recommended installing updates, but I am too nervous to do so right now. It also said that a "Potential Windows Update Database Error" was detected, but I am not sure what that means. Would it be
 okay if I waited just a little while to install more updates? I need my computer for school, so if it deleted system32 on a school night or during school, it'd be bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Sure, focus now on backing up using methods I gave.  Then on the weekend you can complete the steps to repair and bring Updates to date.  I will be here to help as needed.  
<br />
<br />If you want to be sure Windows Update cannot take over again then set a Metered Connection which will turn off Updates but not affect anything else:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>

            <p>LOL! &nbsp;Don't worry. &nbsp;Your kids aren't looking at cat porn! That stands for category = PORN. &nbsp;In other words the page was blocked due to porn content. &nbsp;By the looks of that URL it seems harmless however there could be pornographic advertisements or links to
 porn content on the macsoftwaresfree.blogspot.co.uk webpage. &nbsp;Hope that helps.</p>

<h3> jamesherd  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Default Gateway Is Not Available constantly.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 15 5000 Series with Intel (R) Dual Band Wireless AC 3160, running Windows 10.</p>
<p>The problem is that my internet keeps disconnecting, but my WiFi is still connected, no internet. I have run the troubleshooter and this message comes up: "The default gateway is not available. Fixed" (with the green tick), which does fix it, but after about
 two hours it disconnects again (WiFi still connected, no internet). I have uninstalled the adapter, reset the network settings, checked my firewall, but still won't work. Please help.</p>

            Hi there,
<br />
<br />If the default gateway is unavailable, that means there is most likely an issue with connecting to your Wireless Router. The default gateway is the technical term for that router.
<br />
<br />It could of course be your WiFi Adapter inside the Laptop, but that should be simple enough to test, just try using your laptop elsewhere and see if you have the same issue,
<br />
<br />If this router is provided by your Internet Service Provider, then I would suggest contacting them and asking them to send out a new one.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps!

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>My son just tried to download a game for his Xbox One. He's entered our address, card details etc but he can't get the game to play&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It shows up in his store, but when he clicks "play", he gets a message saying "This game can't be purchased at this time, please try again".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>He's tried several times, but it's the same outcome...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Tekoa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here on the Xbox forums. So if I'm understanding this correctly, you guys were able to add your payment information to the Xbox account but are un able to make a purchase for a specific game. Is this correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a child account or an adult account that your son is using? If it is a child account, then his account may not have the correct permissions to make purchases. You can find instructions for managing child accounts here :&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4482922/xbox-one-online-safety-and-privacy-settings-for-parents-and-kids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox
 One online safety and privacy settings for parents and kids</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from that, have you tried making the purchase from Xbox.com? Just make sure you are logging into the same Xbox&nbsp; account when you try on the website.</p>

<p>Hi ,&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's Skate 3. It has a "play" button but when he clicks it, it says something like "If you have the disk, please insert it&nbsp; If you do not have rights to this game, please go to the Microsoft store"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when he does, he just gets the "This item cannot be purchased at this time" message.&nbsp;</p>

            Since that is a backwards compatible game, he would need to purchase it from a 360 console if he is on a child account. Otherwise, you could purchase it from a parent account and share it with his account via the Home setting.

<p>Yes, my son went to purchase the game, put in all the details including my card details, but when he clicked "submit" nothing happened.</p>

</p><p>He went to see if he could play the game - there is a "play" button but when he clicks it, it tells him to go to the Microsoft store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When he does that, he gets the "This item cannot be purchased at this time" message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(No payments have been taken out of my account, so I know it's not gone through properly&nbsp; But there's now no option to enter the details again.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think my son is using his account, but he plays Fortnite on there, so I don't think it's an age issue ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and he's tried downloading it from Xbox.com but he gets the same message.</p>

<h2>            File System error &#40;-2147219196&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Over the last couple of days I've been getting the file system error (-2147219196), which is preventing some functionality.&nbsp; I'm not sure it's connected, but within the last month I've been getting the message "Low Disk Space. You are running out of disk
 space on Local Disk (I:). Click here to see if you can free space on this drive. Windows Explorer."&nbsp; I should mention that I don't know what Local Disk "I" is.&nbsp; It's listed when I go into File Explorer, but it shows "This folder is empty" and under Properties
 it shows that only 36.3 MB free space of 449 MB.&nbsp; I've run Disk Cleanup.&nbsp; Does anyone know that cause of these problems and how to fix them? Thanks.&nbsp; Lloyd&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Lloyd, these are two known bugs in Windows 10 . . .
<br />
<br />1.
<br />
<br />Drive l running out of space:
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />In the second Command Window, run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />select volume I
<br />
<br />In the second Command Window, run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />remove letter=I
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt 
<br />
<br />That's It
<br />
<br />
<br />2
<br />
<br />File system error (xxx-xxx-xxxx196) in the Photos App:
<br />
<br />This is caused by a bug in the latest Windows 10 update
<br />
<br />Hundreds of users have been reporting this over the last few days
<br />
<br />Hopefully Microsoft will release a patch for this bug soon as there is no fix currently
<br />
<br />Please report this on the Feedback Hub, the more users that report this, the quicker Microsoft will come out with a patch
<br />
<br />On your PC, press the Windows Key + F to open the feedback Hub

            Microsoft is aware that previously-hidden partitions are improperly being assigned drive letters after installing the April 2018 Update.  As a result, they now appear in Disk Management and File Explorer.  These partitions are typically recovery partitions used by the Windows Recovery Environment or by the Original Equipment Manufacturer.  It is not recommended that you attempt to delete or reformat these partitions as this may have adverse effects on your ability to recover Windows.  Microsoft is currently working to address the issue in a future Windows Update, and weâ€™ll update this thread when a solution becomes available. 
<br />
<br />(Update 5/14/18:  The solution that will soon be released via Windows Update will only prevent this issue from occurring for devices that install the April 2018 Update after the solution is released.  If you've already installed the April 2018 Update and are experiencing this issue, you'll need to follow the steps below if you want to hide these partitions.)
<br />
<br />Although you can safely ignore these partitions, if you prefer do away with the low disk space warnings and hide the partitions so they no longer appear in File Explorer, you can do so by manually removing the partitionâ€™s assigned drive letter.  To do this:
<br />
<br />1. Select the Start button, type cmd and then right-click Command Prompt in the search results and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />2. In the Administrator:  Command Prompt window, type diskpart and press Enter.
<br />
<br />3. Type list volume and press Enter.
<br />
<br />4. Make note of the volume number for the drive letter you want to remove.  For example, if the drive letter you want to remove is Drive â€œiâ€, note the volume number for Drive i.
<br />
<br />5. Type the following command, and press Enter. 
<br />
<br /> select volume &lt;volume number&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;volume number&gt;, substitute the volume number you made note of in Step 4.   In the example above, if the volume number for drive i is 5, you would type: select volume 5
<br />
<br />6. Type the following command and press Enter.
<br />
<br />remove letter=&lt;drive letter&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;drive letter&gt;, substitute the drive letter you want to remove.  In this example, you would type: remove letter=i
<br />
<br />7. Close the Command Prompt window.

            <p>
</p><p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.
</span><span>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue. I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing. I would like to ask you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>When was the last time your computer was working fine?</span></li><li><span>Do you remember making any software or hardware changes prior to this issue?</span></li><li><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></li></ul>
<span>
<p>Try the following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Step 1: Try
<strong>Safe Mode with command prompt</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is the configuration of Windows, when it is running on only basic set of drivers and all the startups are disabled. To know more about
 safe mode, follow the article below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Run the SFC scan in safe mode with command prompt and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore
 corrupted files. It will scan your system files and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Step 2:
<strong>Run the System Maintenance troubleshooter</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Run System Maintenance troubleshooter to diagnose the exact issue.
</span><span>This troubleshooter will detect and resolve the basic issues or settings which might cause this issue.</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><br />
Follow the steps mentioned below.<br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>a. Press â€œWindows key + Wâ€.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>b. Type â€œTroubleshooterâ€ without quotes in the Search box and hit enter.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>c. Select â€œSystem and Securityâ€.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>d. Select â€œSystem Maintenanceâ€ under System options.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>e. Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>You may try to add a new administrator user account and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>Create a user account</strong></span>
</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: </strong></p>
<p>When such errors occur, usually reinstalling or doing a repair installation is the best choice of action. However, we can try to repair these files and check if it helps. To do so, refer to the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the start page and type "<strong>cmd</strong>"</li><li>Right click on the command prompt and click on "<strong>Run as administrator</strong>".</li><li>Type the following commands and hit enter after each.</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you run these commands, restart the system and try the update again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also refer to,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Fix Windows corruption errors by using DISM or System Update Readiness tool</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>To clarify, I still have sound as I'm using USB Audio and not the 3.5mm jack. Since this issue, my CPU usage has been extremely loud and my CPU making relatively louder noises. Even restarting on it's own and freezing up on a daily basis, which is really
 annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Updated driver via the "Driver" tab -&gt; both "Search Automatically" &amp; "Browse my computer".</p>
<p>2. Uninstalled the driver and restarted my PC.</p>
<p>3. Disabled the driver and restarted my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I still have this error. How do I fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, according to the System Information, the manufacturer of this audio device is Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Hi Julian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have sound&nbsp;and you have been using USB audio, just a sound driver which has code 10 cannot hamper the performance of the PC. You can uninstall that driver as you are not using it. When you restart the computer, Windows will find appropriate driver
 automatically. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can place the computer in clean boot state and check if the performance of PC is better.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup
 is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow
 the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

            <p>Catherine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that you are asking whether or not to install Windows 10 on your existing Lenovo Ideapad Z565 (as opposed to buying a new computer with Windows 10 pre-installed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned screen freezes and blue screens. Before installing a new version of Windows, make sure that you do not have any hardware problems/issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, be sure that your computer supports Windows 10, verify that there are Windows 10 drivers for all of your hardware, and make sure that your key software runs on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check various sites that discuss the pros and cons of installing Windows. You can search on: reasons to install Windows 10 and reasons not to install Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Full Disclosure:&nbsp; I am not in favor of installing Windows 10. My main objection is that updates to Windows 10 are forced (you cannot easily pick and choose which updates you want ... like you can with Windows 7 and 8) ... Other reasons for not installing
 Windows 10 at this time can be found <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2972298/microsoft-windows/10-reasons-you-shouldnt-upgrade-to-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> and <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3017197/microsoft-windows/why-im-holding-off-on-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. A site that discusses Windows 10 issues can be found <a href="http://www.askwoody.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, the sites I reference above are not in favor of installing Windows 10. Other users here may post links to sites that are in favor of Windows 10. There is no right or wrong answer to your question .... the answer depends on what you want (assuming,
 of course, that your hardware, drivers, and software support Windows 10).</p>

    <title>Skype lost connection, corrected, audio never missed a second but - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype lost connection, corrected, audio never missed a second but video lost &#34;Not watching the presentation&#34;</h2>
                    <p>During a Skype for Business intertal meeting (no live&nbsp;video connections) I was listening to a presenter and watching a Powerpoint presentation&nbsp; when I received a "connection was lost" error.&nbsp; My audio was not interupted, but the PowerPoint presentation screen
 went black.&nbsp; Then I noticed that in the participant list my video was grayed out.&nbsp; When I moused over my name it said that I was "not watching the presentation".&nbsp; Everyone else in the Skype meeting was still watching the presentation and I could hear the audio
 just fine, but I could not find any way to rejoin the video review.&nbsp; I did not want to share video, I wanted to watch what someone else was sharing without interupting them.&nbsp; I had a coworker share his screen with me in a separate window which worked out.&nbsp;
 But there must be a better way to rejoin the meeting once you have lost the video connection.&nbsp; Any advice?</p>
<p>By the way, I did try to rejoin the meeting from the original invitation but nothing happened at all.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

</p><p>Thank you Carlos.&nbsp; I followed the steps you provided by was unable to complete them.&nbsp; I could not delete the sip folder.&nbsp; Something was using a file from that folder even though I logged out of Skype and closed it.&nbsp; The OS (Windows 10) is a week old so I
 don't think there is too much history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The was no "error" other than what I reported as a mouse over message of "you are not watching the presentation" and my screen icon was grayed out.&nbsp; I could hear audio but could not reconnect to the presentation.</p>

<p>Hello Carlos,</p>
<p>I apologize that I do not know how to answer your question about On-premises, Hybrid or Online environment.&nbsp; Furthermore, I have your instruction for repairing Office, but I don't what package to repair.&nbsp; Office has become so convoluted, I now have Office
 365, Excel &amp; Word 2016 professional, OneNote, OneNote 2016, Skype, Skype for Business, OneDrive, OneDrive for Business and the list goes on.&nbsp;

<p>Hi NaomisPapa77,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, please make sure all the Windows updates are the latest in <strong>
Start </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong>. Also, please check if your Skype for Business is the latest version via
<strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>About Skype for Business&nbsp;</strong>(please provide a screenshot of the version for us). To learn the latest version of Office, please take a look at
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/update-history-office365-proplus-by-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
update history</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you mentioned you cannot delete the sip folder, please make sure there's no process of Skype for Business running in
<strong>Task Manager&nbsp;</strong>at first. You can right click <strong>Start </strong>
menu and select <strong>Task Manager </strong>to confirm the processes in the background. Those folders are caches stored in local, after you re-sign in Skype for Business, they will be re-built. If you're worried about data loss, you can try to move those
 files to another location in your computer in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, if it's convenience, you can try to change the network to check if it helps. For example, try to connect the hotspot of your mobile phone. Moreover, please disable the firewall and antivirus software to check if the issue persists. If the issue
 still exists, please perform an <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Online Repair</a> of Office. Since all Office apps are stored in one package, there's no easy fix to repair Skype for Business alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the further investigation, since you're not familiar with Skype for Business environment, I suggest you contact the admin in your organization to confirm the environment of Skype for Business. It's important for us to narrow down the issue and do the
 further analysis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            I have tried all the OPs tricks also yours I created new accounts made sure accounts was full admin and had access and still no go on gathering info near the end it just fails no real details part from 0x80070005 I have a acer Iconia W3&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I am getting pretty miffed about this now as some basic apps no longer support 8 and only support 8.1 so your making us use 8.1 but failing to provide a update and this 0x80070005 error has been around for a bit now, provide a full download that will run
 independent from the store with full admin rights and then I am sure some of us will get somewhere</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have wasted two days of my life trying yo update this is NOT acceptable at all, this needs sorting not one reply has fixed this problem so far,&nbsp;</div>

            I'm having the same problem. &nbsp;I have a Lenovo Ideapad Lynx. &nbsp;I tried to upgrade from windows 8 to 8.1 via the windows store a week or so ago. &nbsp;The update said it was completed but when it rebooted and tried to load the first time after inputting my password
 it locked up and got stuck in a loop with blue screen instead of loading Metro/Desktop. &nbsp; The only option that worked was to startup in safe mode. &nbsp;I did a full factory reset, and figured I'd wait a week for Microsoft to work out the bugs. &nbsp;I retried o update
 a few days ago and now it I get error code 0x80070005 "something happened and the windows 8.1 could not be installed" when the update is 72% complete in the "gathering info" stage. &nbsp;I've tried the following methods: 1) uninstalling antivirus and disabeling
 all firewalls, 2) clen boot, 3) wsreset.exe, 4) creating a different user account, 5)&nbsp;
<div>changing permissions to full control for everyone in program files/windowsapps folder. 6) used "free windows registry repair tool". &nbsp;My friend also purchased the same computer Ideapad Lynx and his upgrade went off without a hitch so it's not a laptop mfgr
 specific program either. &nbsp;I also tried to download the 8.1 update outside the store via&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only</a>&nbsp;but I was told
 I my software key was invalid ,then I looked and the webpage says the upgrade is only for windows 8.1 preview not from windows 8. &nbsp;So I'm still stuck. &nbsp;I already did the factory reset once and really don't feel like installing all my programs again, and it
 may not even work anyways. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

            I found out that the actual problem is having a third-party anti-virus program installed period. Don't just shut them off, remove them completely, upgrade to 8.1, then re-install.<br />

            IT Worked! &nbsp;I guess that would have been a logical thing to try, I just assumed disabling the av software was performing an equivalent function. &nbsp;(avast).

    <title>KB3097877&#58; remove using Remote Desktop or PSExec - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dalemahalko  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB3097877&#58; remove using Remote Desktop or PSExec</h2>
                    <p>I have a bunch of computers in an organization that are all set to install Windows Updates automatically, and today I am getting hit by&nbsp;KB3097877 breaking several of them all at the same time, flashing at the logon screen over and over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately I have discovered that even if the main logon screen is broken, you can still logon to it from another computer via Remote Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there: Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Programs -&gt; View installed updates -&gt; Windows updates -&gt;&nbsp;KB3097877 -&gt; Uninstall</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Home or Ultimate I don't think this will work as Remote Desktop may not be available on those editions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't know the machine's name or network address this is going to be quite difficult to locate, because you can't find the machine name via the usual route at the logon screen. I was able to find it by rebooting the computer and then checking our
 organization's DHCP server to see what network address leases were renewed recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option for removing it is using PSExec from another computer. Here too you need to know the machine name, and you need to be able to find it over a common network connection such as a wired LAN:</p>
<p>Psexec -d -s \\remotemachine wusa.exe /uninstall /kb:3097877 /quiet /norestart</p>
<p>
</p><p>PSExec is available from Microsoft SysInternals, and should work for Home / Ultimate:</p>
<p>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/psexec.aspx</p>
<p><br />

            <p><span>Information and question for all. I have a similar problem after the update KB3097877 and KB3100213...</span></p>
<p><span>In ago a few day, November 11, 2015 I made 16 updates for Windows 7 Ultimate (32 bit). After that I lost the sidebar on the desktop, or is blocked by updating and could not appear. Thanks to Microsoft
 update for Windows. I lost a whole afternoon to find out about any update in question. These are 2 updates from 16, Security Update for Windows 7 (<strong>KB3097877</strong>) and Security Update for Windows 7 (<strong>KB3100213</strong>). When I uninstall
<strong>both updates</strong> sidebar returned. Both are to blame for the current situation. I wonder what Microsoft is doing and what the goal of this? I deny automatic updates to me that both updates do not come back. What remains? Now my PC constantly informs
 that it has to hold the two update. That drive me crazy. Any help from anyone is welcome. Gentlemen from Microsoft please work it on this issue and best regards.</span></p>

<h2>            how do i create an association in the Folder Option control panel in order to play videos attached to emails</h2>
                    Sometimes when i receive an email with an attachment i get an error message that says the following: This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. Create an association in the Folder Option control panel. My question
 is what steps do I take to do this?
