            This in the classic version.
<br />
<br />I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            Hi, gerhardheine
<br />
<br />Try uninstalling and installing the new version of Skype, if this does not work, you can try to reinstall the classic version, which was extended until a new warning, I hope you can solve the problem.

    <title>Outlook.com contact editing problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> unclenick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com contact editing problem</h2>
                    <p>In Outlook on line (my former Hotmail account) I tried to edit in a new personal email address for an old contact.&nbsp;
 In the Edit menu, Outlook allowed my addition of the new personal email addy, but the old personal email addresses for this person are grayed out and I cannot delete or edit them.&nbsp; I thought this may be because there is email on the system sent by others in
 a group that uses this no-longer-valid email address, but when I tried to reply to a group that included this person, the obsolete address insisted on being the one in the email.&nbsp; My attempt to change it failed, so I wound up sending to the bad addy and getting
 the expected bounce notification.&nbsp; I can't seem to forward to the correct address, either.&nbsp; How do I get rid of these obsolete addresses?&nbsp; Do I need to delete the contact and start over?&nbsp; Why are they even grayed out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I have only a name and email address for this person and no other information and no Skype or other contact information about them.

            <p>Nathaniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>iDeepakB's URL above leads to a thread that describes my problem exactly, and it doesn't appear from that discussion that there is any resolution at this point.&nbsp; It's a bug.&nbsp; I'm just going to let that thread play out and see if they can correct outlook.com
 or find a work-around to rectify it.&nbsp; The contact I am having trouble with is old, so this was migrated over from the old Outlook.com which migrated it over from hotmail.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why there would be any legitimate reason for contact information having grayed-out, un-editable areas.&nbsp; If the gray area were just a note to show what address you last used for this contact, that would be fine.&nbsp; The problem is that the
 grayed-out address persists when I try to create a new email for this person, and resists all efforts to be corrected or edited on the fly, stubbornly jumping back to the defunct email addy every time.&nbsp; To email this person I now have to type out their current
 valid e-mail address at each instance.&nbsp; To include this person in a mass reply-to-all,&nbsp; now have to delete their name as provided by the contact list and type out their new address, as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose you could consider this a form of counter-automation.&nbsp; Perhaps the AI thinks we have it too easy and wants to send us back to basics, like typing.</p>

            Well, this is interesting.&nbsp; Yesterday I could find the Edit option, but today is disappears on this contact.&nbsp; On all other contacts nearby, if I click on them the Edit and Delete options are at the top.&nbsp; The main window to the right displays the contact
 name, email address, and the option is there to use the calendar to schedule a meeting.&nbsp; With this contact, when I click on it the Edit and Delete options disappear, with option to Add to Favorites sliding over to the left where those two used to be, and two
 personal email addresses appear, the original and the one I added when editing yesterday.&nbsp; There is no calendar option to set up a meeting.&nbsp; Seems like this file is locked in and corrupted in&nbsp; some way.<br />

<h2>            Send recurring meeting invite to only new attendees</h2>

We no longer get that option now and when we add a new person to the meeting invite it goes out to every attendee on the list.&nbsp; Folks are not like having to accept/decline the same meeting invite several times.&nbsp; The list is very fluid and we don't want to have

<h2>            Excel 2016 crashes with Windows 10</h2>
                    
<p>&lt;Split from this thread&gt;</p>
<p>I have also exactly the same problem:</p>
<p>- Excel crashes when i select any cell and change font e.g. to italic or change font colour. This happens even with clea new file</p>
<p>- in similar way powerpoint always crashes when i save to pdf</p>
<p>This has never happened before and for first 2 months Windows 10 and office365 worked fine.</p>
<p>What i have tried:</p>
<p>- I have reinstalled Office 365 totally from control panel with online install, did not help.</p>
<p>- i used officeCAT to check for errors, but also that stops scanning powerpoint, in excel it did not find anything except complaint about printer driver update that should be done, but i have only one driver update in windows update listed waiting and it
 does not dowload (HP printer dirver)</p>
<p>It really seems to relate to printer driver since OfficeCAT complains about it. I have following error in windows update:</p>
<p>"HP driver update for HP LaserJet Professional CM1410 Series PCL 6 - Error 0x8024001"</p>
<p>I try now to remove the printer totally.</p>

                    I have a OneNote notebook section created by importing a .pdf into the desktop version of OneNote 2016 (on Windows 7) and it refuses to synch successfully to the OneDrive-housed copy or to any other OneNote-equipped devices I use. &nbsp;When I try to recopy
 the section to give it another try, it invariably hangs with an 0xE4010645 or similar error, "We can't synch the notebook because you're offline or because the network location is unavailable." &nbsp;This is, to put it politely, incorrect. &nbsp;I am not offline, and
 the network location is not unavailable. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The outcome of this is that some of the pages of the .pdf file come through cleanly, but most display a "Content not yet available" message. &nbsp;I want all of the pages to display correctly as they do in the desktop version of the notebook. &nbsp;Thanks in advance
 for any suggestions you have.

            <p>It was the failure of these suggestions which prompted me to post my help request in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This condition (see second attachment below) is a permanent condition of certain pages of the OneDrive stored version of the notebook. &nbsp;The pages above this page look fine, the pages below this page display "Content Not Yet Available," and never synch/change
 no matter what I do. &nbsp;All of the notebooks which try to contain this converted .pdf immediately go into an Incomplete Synch state and become useless to me (see first attachment below). &nbsp;I have tried to copy the .pdf-derived notebook pages into various notebooks
 and it always kills the notebooks.</p>

            <p>Hi Jonathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you encountered problem when using OneNote. I'm one of the OneNote engineers. Couple more questions to you for me to trouble shoot your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) How many pages are there in the pdf?&nbsp;Is the pdf a&nbsp;big file with many pages that you&nbsp;were&nbsp;trying to import into OneNote?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) If it is a big file, is it possible that&nbsp;you were not&nbsp;leaving the app up connected to the network long enough time while it was trying to sync a large amount of data&nbsp;with multi-roundtrips?</p>
<p>3) Can you try importing just one or couple pages instead of the entire pdf to another notebook that currently syncs fine, and see whether it still syncs fine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and let me know.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Thank you. &nbsp;The notebook was created by importing a very large, 200+-page .pdf file into the desktop version of OneNote, and then doing substantial manipulation to the individual pages. &nbsp;Since each song spans multiple pages, and I only want one page per
 song, I manipulated the notebook by:</p>
<p>1) adding a table to the first page of each song;<br />
2) cutting and pasting the .pdf page on that page into the first cell of that table;</p>
<p>3) cutting and pasting each of the successive pages of that song (on the successive pages) into the remaining cells of the table, then;</p>
<p>4) deleting all of the now-empty pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This process was completed successfully on the desktop version of OneNote, but the resultant notebook has never successfully synched to the OneDrive-housed version of OneNote. &nbsp;The initial attempted-synch OneDrive notebook version contained all of the pages,
 but most of the pages contain the Content Not Available message as embedded above. &nbsp;When in the Desktop OneNote version I copy pages to a brand new notebook one at a time, those pages sometimes synch correctly, other times not, but invariably the notebook
 corrupts eight or ten pages in, and stops synching at all. &nbsp;I have allowed the OneNote notebooks to synch for hours, and the outcome is the same. &nbsp;I have also tried to create the initial notebook on the OneNote online version, but that version lacks the ability
 to embed tables, without which I cannot organize the .pdf images on each page tab. &nbsp;So I am stuck.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply, Jonathan. A 200-page pdf is indeed a good chunk of content.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, can you go to <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?v=managestorage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?v=managestorage</a> to check your storage space? How does that look like? If you don't have enough storage space on OneDrive, it will prevent you&nbsp;from uploading
 your content&nbsp;on your local drive to the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the storage space looks good to you, what I suspect is that your notebook "Music" might be in a weird state. Something was messed up when you were doing re-arrangement to the pages while the content was being synced&nbsp;onto OneDrive&nbsp;at the background.&nbsp;Notebook&nbsp;"Music
 -&nbsp;New" was created after you&nbsp;finished page manipulations and copied manipulated pages to, right? Try create a new page in "Music - New" notebook, and type something on the page in your OneNote desktop, and&nbsp;force sync. Does the new page show on your OneDrive?
</p>
<p><br />
Thanks and let me know.</p>

            <p>Hi Yan:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 1TB of space available on OneDrive and have used only a fraction of it. &nbsp;That is not the constraint.<br />
<br />
I took your advice and added a new page to the "Music - New" notebook. &nbsp;After adding the page, I changed the page name to "New test page" and then typed "Let's see if this synchs up to the OneDrive copy." in the body of the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OneDrive copy of the new page did eventually synch, and eventually displayed the correct text in the page. &nbsp;What are your further suggestions?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply, Jonathan. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's good that your newly created page in notebook "Music - New" syncs. Do your other pages in this notebook which weren't synced to OneDrive eventually sync to OneDrive now? Is there still a sync icon on your notebook indicating that&nbsp;it's still syncing
 or there's an error?&nbsp;If the un-synced pages&nbsp;aren't many, you might want to copy them to new pages and they should sync like what you've done in the last reply. Thanks and let me know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            No, the other pages never synch. &nbsp;Once the "Content Not Yet Available" message displays on any page, it never goes away again. &nbsp;Once this happens, the notebook never again displays that synching is up-to-date, and the "We can't synch the notebook because
 you're offline or because the network location is unavailable (Error code 0x4010645) never again goes away. &nbsp;Pressing the "Synch Now" button has no apparent impact.

            <p>I think these pages will never sync.</p>
<p>I assume the reason behind are orphaned "partial file locks" from an aborted sync process. And I assume that the Onenote clients are all unable to recover from this intermediate protocol state. I think they even don't know who the lock owner was.</p>

            <p>Copy all un-synced pages to new pages (hope they are not too many and you've mentioned in your previous post that the number is eight or ten), wait for them to appear on OneDrive, and delete all un-synced pages in your OneNote desktop. The sync error on
 notebook "Music - New" should go away. If you are not unblocked by those steps, let me know.</p>

            The code is OK, but you can't use Ctrl to unselect cells. If you want to select a discontiguous range, you have to select the first area, then hold down Ctrl and select the second area etc. If you make a mistake you have to start over from scratch.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
We understand that you'd like to set up signatures on your Outlook emails. <br />
<br />
For us to properly assist you with your concern, we'd like to ask some questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using an Outlook application or Outlook.com online?</li><li>When you say set up a signature for internal and external emails, are you referring to your personal emails and work emails?</li><li>Are you using an Office 365 subscription?<br />
</li></ul>
<p><br />

            <p>Hey, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for that info, yes Xbox Music will let you delete the play list on Zune as well, however You will need to firstly have membership for Xbox Music and Zune. Seccondly you will need to own an Xbox 360 console, otherwise you will not be able to access
 it appart from through the main sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is on the Xbox 360, I would like to recomend these steps on clearing syustem coatch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, go to your xbox 360 dashboard and sign in to your account you use for xbox music</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Systems Hub</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click onto <strong>System Settings</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click onto <strong>Memmory/ storage</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hover over the storage device that xbox music is downloaded to</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hit Y</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then click onto <strong>Clear System Coatch</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should work, please go back onto xbox music and try deleating your playlist again. PLease post any resuylts here, thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SunkNath</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 wont give me an option which partition to choose.</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 8 (evaluation) and windows 7 (activated) dual booted on my computer, I wanted to get the windows 10 Technical Preview too, so I created a new partition for it, but when I go to install windows 10, it does not give me an option for which partition
 to choose, it just goes straight to the installation stage, I cancel it at that point because I want to put windows 10 on a 3rd partition I created on my hard drive. Also, it asked me what I wanted to save, nothing was the only choice so does this mean it
 will delete the other partition with windows 7 and 8? any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>My Computer is an HP Pavilion dv5 - 1235dx</p>
<p>I will note that I downloaded the image right from the sign up of the program, I did not download it from the TechNet Evaluation Center, when I downloaded windows 8 it let me choose a partition, but also if I install the windows 10 preview will it delete
 the other operating systems?</p>
<p>And would it make a difference if I ran the installation from the application in the folder? in other words, I did not boot from the USB the operating system is installed on, I opened the contents on the drive, and started the application.</p>

            <p>I think I know what went wrong, I think I chose the in place installation over the clean install. I'm going to&nbsp;re-download the Windows 10 but do the clean install download instead of the in-place upgrade and see if this works, I will get back with Microsoft

<h2>            MS Word Online- Page footers and headers different on page 7</h2>
                    <p>I am a novelist and have been using Word for a long time. I have never had the problems I am having today with Word Online. I am working with a document on One Drive. I am attempting to add a footer and page number where Chapter One starts. I do not want
 a footer on my title page, copyright page ect. In Word I can give the Header/footer different sections and click, "do not link to previous"&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHERE is the on Word on line???? I can't find it. I am about to decided that I do not want to renew my subscription in January.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Word Online has a subset of the features available on the desktop versions. The ability to restart numbering (or otherwise add Section breaks) is not one of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do what you want, you'll need to edit on a desktop.</p>

<p>Hi King,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>According to what I've searched, the music files are usually synced through your OneDrive. Try to check on the OneDrive website through this
<strong><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and see if it's there. Also, you can try searching for the files through Files Explorer.&nbsp;Open
<strong>File Explorer </strong>(<strong>Windows key + E</strong>)&nbsp;from the taskbar or
<strong>Start&nbsp;</strong>menu, then select a location from the left pane to search or browse. For example, select
<strong>This PC</strong> to look in all devices and drives on your computer, or select
<strong>Documents</strong> to look only for files stored there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll be waiting for your updates.</p>

<h2>            I have custom forms in Outlook 2007. How can I export the data in that form to a CSV or flat file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all experts out there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise me on the following.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Situation:</p>
<p>We have created forms in Outlook 2007 and will be migrating some of the task to SharePoint Online in the future.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, we wanted to export all the data in the forms that we have created to a flat file or CSV to do analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone advise what is the simplest way to do so without much coding/programming?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>If we are unable to extract, we are not able to migrate to SharePoint and upgrade to Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Joshua</p>

<h2>            Mail Merge- If Not Blank, then</h2>
                    Hi, I was able to easily do what I am needing now on earlier versions of Word, but can't figure it out on 2007. There used to be drop down menus to choose from. Can someone help?<br />
<br />
Mail Merge- I am going to write this like how I would say it out loud:<br />
Dear "First Name" --then, if "Spouse_First" is not blank, insert(space)&amp;(space) "Spouse_First",<br />
<br />
So the finished product would look like<br />
Dear Bob,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or, if Bob had a partner:<br />
Dear Bob &amp; Lucy,<br />
<br />
Would love some advice! Thanks.<br />
<br />

            The functions are exactly the same in Word 2007, but the commands are placed differently. From the mailings tab &gt; Write and Insert Fields Group &gt; Rules &gt; If...Then...Else.<br />
<br />
However it is much simpler to build your own field construction using CTRL+F9 to create the field brackets { }<br />
<br />
Then you would insert <br />
<br />
Dear { MERGEFIELD "First Name" }{ IF { MERGEFIELD "Spouse_First" } &lt;&gt; "" " &amp; { MERGEFIELD "Spouse_First" }," "," }<br />

            Thank you so much for your response, Graham. I would love to try what you suggest, to teach myself, but--dumb question--why would the Write and Insert Fields Group be shaded out? I cannot select anything in it. I tried creating a new document as well as
 editing an existing mail merge letter.<br />

            The items in the Write and Insert Fields Group will become enabled when you have set the type of mail merge main document (Letter, E-mail Messages, Envelopes, Labels, etc.) AND have attached a data source to the main document.

            You need not pay up anything. You just need to activate this. I think that very first option should solve your problem.
<br />
<br />1. First try to repair your installation - First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. You may have 2 MS Offices installed on your system
<br />A. Run FIX IT tool to remove previous version - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninst...</a>
<br />B. Perform Online Repair of new Office. Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />3. Try Activation Troubleshooter and other troubleshooting steps
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Unlicensed-Product-and-activation-errors-in-Office-0d23d3c0-c19c-4b2f-9845-5344fedc4380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Unlice...</a>
<br />
<br />4. Try to activate through telephone
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/-Telephone-activation-is-no-longer-supported-for-your-product-error-when-activating-Office-9b016cd2-0811-4cb3-b896-5a6a13177713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/-Telep...</a>
<br />
<br />5. Talk to support
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/...</a> (Click on the starting alphabet of country name. Hence for US, click U)
<br />
<br />6. You may try chatting with MS Support to resolve this issue 
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/msa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>

            <p>Hey there, <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/8a8b098a-471b-4491-b394-b58545210517" title="S  HeiselWilliams">
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft community forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a scam. If Microsoft are doing upgrades on their system servers, this would impact you, but they would never close your account if you did not update your information on your Microsoft Account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another note, this email would have been sent to all Outlook.com users, and I have not received any such email from Microsoft. They would also have an announcement on these forums, notify other members.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This email is designed to get the user to click onto the links, and the links will lead you to a made to look site, tricking the user to enter their Microsoft Account credentials. After the credentials have been entered, their software logs and saves the
 email and password the user has entered, allowing the hacker to gain access onto your account on the official Microsoft site.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What you can do to protect yourself from these types of emails. </strong>
</p>
<p>If Microsoft does send you an email, then look for a green shield icon next to the name the sender.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do research what they are telling you. Look on the Microsoft Community for some sort of announcement about any changes they are introducing, or asking you to do.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Report any sort of scam to Microsoft, you can also report via this link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows/outlook/abuse-phishing-junk-email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows/outlook/abuse-phishing-junk-email</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hover your mouse over any links they give you, but <strong>do not click onto them</strong>, and you will see an address appear on the bottom of your screen. Does it match an official site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they do ask you to change your details, don't follow any links it provides you within the email. Instead, I go to
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com</a> and update my account information from there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If in doubt, ask! We are community members like you, who love to help each other the best we can. We can also answer these sorts of questions. You will be&nbsp;shocked&nbsp;at the amount of spam I receive :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps, </p>
<p>Regards, </p>

            The battery saver application doesn't say it is "running". it says that it is capable of running and how much it has run in the past XX hours. it is not a real time indicator of what is going on.

<p>I am definitely not great with VB and would appreciate guidance from this community.&nbsp; I recorded a macro as I created and formatted a graph, but I need to build upon it:</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; I need the row number to be a variable, so that I can loop through rows 2 through 241</p>

            <p>Hi All,<br />
<br />
@ Edson Please try the following command and see if you can assign license successfully:<br />
<br />
<em>$license = "organization: STANDARDPACK"</em><br />
<br />
<em>$LicenseOptions = New-MsolLicenseOptions -AccountSkuId $license -DisabledPlans TEAMS1,FLOW_O365_P1,POWERAPPS_O365_P1,PROJECTWORKMANAGEMENT,SHAREPOINTWAC,SWAY, YAMMER_ENTERPRISE</em><br />
<br />
<em>Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" -AddLicenses $license -LicenseOptions $LicenseOptions</em><br />
<br />
Note: You can change the <em><strong>organization:STANDARDPACK, SkuID &amp; UserPrincipalName</strong></em> according to your situation.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, please provide the following information:<br />
<br />
1. A screenshot of your account SKU. You can get it using the command: Get-MsolAccountSku<br />
<br />
2. Use <em>(Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName *** Email address is removed for privacy ***).Licenses[0].ServiceStatus</em> to get&nbsp; your Office 365 licensing plans and provide a screenshot for our reference.<br />
Note: Please check it using a license assigned user. <br />
<br />
3. Check if the affected user has been assigned license via the command: <em>Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"</em><br />
<br />
4. Go to Office 365 admin portal &gt; Billing &gt; Licenses &gt; check whether you have spare licenses to assign.<br />
</p>
<p>5. Does this issue happens to this specific user or all new users?<br />
<br />

@ Leo To troubleshooting this issue, please provide the following information:<br />
<br />
1. The detailed commands you used to remove and add licenses.<br />
<br />
2. The script you used to pull from CSV.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Custom Advanced Properties of Excel not updated in an Outlook Public Folder when using .XLSX format</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using :</p>
<p>- Excel and Outlook from Ms Office 365 ProPlus and from Office 2016</p>
<p>- Excel files are stored in Public Folders on Office 365</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use extensively Excel 'Custom Advanced Properties' displayed in Outlook views. With Excel, this is a great feature ! For instance, our templates have a cell with the Customer name, this cell is published as an 'Custom Advanced Property' and is viewable
 in the Public Folder view where the Excel file is stored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything works fine since (a lot of) years ... until we changed from .XLS to .XLSX file format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Excel files are now stored in .XLSX format, Excel 'Custom Advanced Properties' are correctly published when we store the file but not any more when we update the Excel file (in the Public Folder).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is clearly a problem between Excel and Outlook : the 'Custom Advanced Properties' in correctly stored in Excel, but not published in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone find a trick to correct this behaviour ?<br />
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi SHStéphane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding “Custom Advanced Properties,” do you mean the setting under Excel &gt; File &gt; Info &gt; Properties &gt; Advanced Properties &gt; Custom? If I misunderstand your meaning, please give us more details about this feature and give us a screenshot for a better understanding.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fef0e9ba-79a4-41a8-a277-27e937cfca24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fef0e9ba-79a4-41a8-a277-27e937cfca24" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I want you to check if you save the Excel file after you changed any value in the “Custom Advanced Properties”. About “not published in Outlook,” I’d like to know whether this is your scenario:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You opened the .xlsx file in “Public folders”, changed some values in this .xlsx file’s custom properties, and saved the file. After that, another user opened this .xlsx file and find this file’s custom properties are not changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my assumption is right, please provide us the following information for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1. Does this problem occur on all the .xlsx file in your Office 365 Public Folders?</p>
<p>2. Upload a new test Excel file into the Public Folders, will this problem occur?</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-version-of-Outlook-do-I-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
The detailed version of your Outlook client</a>. </p>
<p>4. A sample of the affected Excel file. To protect your privacy, please provide it for us via link below:</p>

<p><span>Thanks for your information. In order to reproduce this problem on our side, please give us some detailed screenshots about the entire process. For example, how you change the “DESCRIPTION

<p>Hi <span>Stéphane</span>,</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your information. I noticed that your Outlook client is 16.0.4498.1000. Try updating your Outlook client to see if it helps. Meanwhile, I followed your steps but I can’t see the “Description” value of your test XLSM
 file. According to my test, the “Description” value of your XLS file will change after I edited the value. For troubleshooting, I recommend that you upload the test files in the public folder’s subfolder and sent us the PST file via
</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Private Message</span></a><span> again.</span></p>
