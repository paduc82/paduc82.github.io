<h2>            App not compatible. This app only works on devices with the following screen resolution LUMIA ICON</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so here is my issue.&nbsp; A friend gave me a VERIZON NOKIA LUMIA ICON which is larger and better than my T-Mobile Lumia 521.&nbsp; As laws and policy have&nbsp;made it so I can port this Verizon
<em>built </em>windows phone over to my carrier, I brought it into a T-Mob store and had them help me set it up for T-Mob use.&nbsp; I was informed of some of the Spectrum/Band limitations, but was told that it would work just fine&nbsp;even if it could not take advantage
 of some of the LTE speeds.&nbsp; I brought the ICON home and proceeded to launch the many Windows updates that it required.&nbsp; After the upgrade to 8.1, I found that the ICON would not send MMS messages.&nbsp; It would send and receive SMS txt messages, make and receive
 voice calls.&nbsp; I could use all the other features including full use of cellular and WIFI internet.&nbsp; But, Multimedia, Pictures/videos/voice tag text messages&nbsp;does not work.&nbsp; Trying to send a MMS&nbsp;msg&nbsp;results in:
<strong>CANT SEND MEDIA CONTENT, CONTACT YOUR MOBILE OPERATOR TO ADJUST YOUR SETTINGS</strong>.&nbsp; Searching through the community, I see that this is a common problem with porting the VERIZON NOKIA LUMIA ICON over to T-Mobile.&nbsp; Many of the posts and how-to-videos
 suggest that to correct the issue, you need to setup an&nbsp;ACCESS POINT NAME&nbsp;with the T-MOBILE specs by going to
<strong>SETTINGS=CELLULAR+SIM=SIM SETTINGS</strong>.&nbsp; But, when I do, I do not see the fields the support pages say I should.&nbsp; So, I dug deeper and see that there is a way to automatically populate the proper APN fields by downloading and using an app from
 the&nbsp;WINDOWS STORE called "NETWORK SETTINGS" under the&nbsp;Nokia collection.&nbsp; The problem is that I cant even download the app to see if it corrects my MMS TEXT sending problem.&nbsp; Under the app tile in the&nbsp;WINDOWS STORE there is&nbsp;an exclamation point and&nbsp;a "greyed"&nbsp;out
 message stating: <strong>THIS APP USES FEATURES YOUR PHONE DOESNT HAVE, LEARN MORE</strong>.&nbsp; When I tap on this message, I get this:
<strong>APP NOT COMPATIBLE.&nbsp; THIS APP ONLY WORKS ON DEVICES WITH THE FOLLOWING SCREEN RESOLUTION: WVGA(480X800).&nbsp;
</strong>I know full well that this phone has better than 480x800, so ****?&nbsp; Have no idea that even if I could D/L this NETWORK SETTINGS app to setup T-MOBILE APN SETTINGS&nbsp;it would solve the MMS text problem in the first place.&nbsp; But that I cant even get it due
 to this ridiculous screen resolution issue had charged my frustration level to up and over 11.&nbsp; I know that the WP forums are littered with this&nbsp;CANT SEND MMS&nbsp;text messages on ported LUMIA ICON.&nbsp; It is an extremely common problem.&nbsp; So, if anyone has another
 resolution, I would be happier than hell to hear about them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I've tried to send&nbsp;a MMS msg to my own number to see if it something other than the&nbsp;T-MOBILE multimedia server. Under
<strong>SIM, NETWORK SELECTION</strong>, it&nbsp;is set to <strong>T-Mobile</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>MANUAL INTERNET APN&nbsp;is set to ON</strong>.&nbsp; Though I don't have all the fields under INTERNET APN the forums say I should have, I do have in the
<strong>APN field set to: FAST.T-MOBILE.COM</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no MMSC FIELD or any of the other fields that are supposed to be there according to innumerable WINDOWS PHONE&nbsp;pages.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>As you have already found out yourself, this is a common issue when using Verizon-exclusive handsets on other networks in general, not just T-Mobile USA. I expect you should have also come across the general reason for that - a carrier-exclusive handset
 model is produced to specific requirements and specifications laid down by the carrier, who is ordering this bespoke model from the OEM. In my opinion such handsets should not even carry the brand of the OEM, as they are effectively not part of the OEM's range
 - what Google does with the Nexus range of products makes much more sense to me - they are all Nexus, regardless if they are actually made by Samsung, LG, Motorola or ASUS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Coming back to your Verizon Icon - even though it has been unlocked for use on another network carrier, there are still parts of the firmware which are locked down as per Verizon's requirement and which cannot be seen, accessed or modified. It seems that
 the MMS settings fall into that category and I am not aware of a solution for this issue even after following it for over a year.</p>

            I concur. With all that u have said. I guess the only thing that is still nagging me is that the proposed solution of D/Loading the Nokia Collection app "NETWORK SETTINGS" can't be attempted because of the screen resolution issue. If I were able to download
 this app and it did not successfully install proper APN settings and the can't send MMS txts problem persisted, then I would just chalk it up to the limitations of an OEM proprietary phone. However, that I cannot even get this Nokia Collection app due to the
 480x800 screen issue seems an additional and entirely unrelated problem. Shouldn't the ICON be quite capable of stepping down to this lower resolution? I will go ahead and post that question w/ a new heading, never mentioning the MMS text msg issue to see
 if anyone just has some thoughts on this screen resolution issue alone. In all the posts, here and elsewhere, people are in fact fixing the MMS prob under identical setups. Do u know how to force 480x800 out of the Nokia ICON to at leas

    <title>Word does not show cursor insertion mark nor displays any text - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word does not show cursor insertion mark nor displays any text selection in Simple Markup in Track Changes</h2>
                    <p>I have been having this problem for a long time. When working with Track Changes 'Simple Markup', I scroll down to the next page, then the cursor insertion mark disappears, and I cannot see any text that I have selected. Turning on and off the hidden formatting
 symbols used to work to resume the display and get it going again, but recently, this, too, does not work anymore. I am using a laptop with a 3840x2160 screen resolution.<br />
The only way that I can resume the cursor display is to scroll down to the end of the page, make a selection, and then scroll up again. Then only the cursor insertion mark can be displayed properly when set, and text can be selected so that the selection can
 be seen. But this whole problem is just one big nuisance.</p>
<p>It all displays properly in "All Markup" mode, but when switching back to "Simple Markup" from "All Markup" the cursor insertion/selection display disappears again at the the top of each page. I can't see where the cursor insertion mark is, and when mouse
 button is held down and dragged across the text, no selection is shown. If there has been any text selected before, it is moved inadvertently to some haphazard location (only so in "Simple Markup" mode).</p>
<p>Changing to Draft View makes the selection visible, but then, changing back to Page Layout view, it switches to All Markup, but when switching to Simple Markup mode again, the selection as well as the cursor insertion mark disappears again, but only in the
 top half of the page; when the bottom of the page is displayed, the issue does not occur.</p>
<p>I am using Word version 1803 build 9126.2116 but the above problem has already been happening for years on my PC.</p>
<p>The current version of Windows that I am using is 10.0.17133.1 <br />

            Just to be clear, scrolling in itself does not move the insertion point, so if you scroll beyond the page where the cursor is located, it is to be expected that you won't see it.

<p>Thank you for your reply. This problem only seems to happen in long documents. As most of my editing work is confidential, I will have to look for a document that I can send&nbsp; you. Please allow for 2-3 days.
<br />
The document that I am working on now displays this issue. However, when I changed the display language of Word to that in which the document was created (from English to German), this issue was no longer apparent. So I wonder if the default display language
 setting has anything to do with this.</p>
<p>I will try to create a German Word file on another computer and then try to edit using the English display language on this PC.</p>

<p>You may be interested in knowing that I routinely work with a proofing language (Swedish) which is different from the display language (English) and that isn't causing any crashes in Word (version 1803). In other words, whatever is causing the issue you
 are experiencing, display and proofing languages may not be part of the problem.</p>

            As I mentioned, I have found that this issue happens in practically all long documents (150~200 pages) that I work on. It also occurs in the German mode, so the display language is not an issue here.
<br />
Today, it even occurred that Word crashed while working on a document. I could recover my work using a defective .asd file.

            <p>It is an Exhange email server. Users are trying to drag and drop the emails to the pst folders. I figure something out and this is to move the folders out of the pst to a folder under the inbox. I hope this fixes my issue.</p>

</p><p>I' really dont like working with pst files.</p>

    <title>Nokia N82 - WiFi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eovf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia N82 - WiFi</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
How can I get my N82 to use the home WLAN Network as the default to access the internet, as opposed to going through my Network Service Provider?<br />
<br />
Also, how can I get the phone to remember the WPA-PSK Key to access the net via my WLAN? It works after I enter it, but they key is so long I cannot be bothered to have to type it each time I want to go online!<br />
<br />
Any tips greatly appreciated!

            Go to Web in you menu, options, settings, general, access point - here you can choose your home wlan or always ask (I choose this one)<br />
<br />
If you setup your wlan with the wizard it asks for the wep key during the setup and that should be the last time you need to enter it.

            Not meaning to sound rude, but you could always read the manual that comes in the box. That normally covers such questions.

    <title>New Tile Size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> windowsphone8.1user  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Tile Size</h2>
                    <p>Absolutely need a half horizontal rectangle tile. The size of 4 small tiles lined up horizontally<br />
</p>
<p>The large tile size is great but the not all the real estate in the tile is used.&nbsp; All the messaging apps show only one line of text so the large tile just clutters up the phone real estate unnecessarily.&nbsp; The medium size tile is ok but is useless for text.&nbsp;
 Heres an example</p>

<p>I suppose that the solution would be for the messaging apps to properly use the space available in the tiles and not invent new tile sizes.</p>

            Well it wont just be for messaging apps.&nbsp; this new tile size would save on space and make room for more tiles.&nbsp; Would also add a more cleaner look.&nbsp; The medium tile is too small and the large tile is too big for most apps<br />

            Drag your tile onto another tile and they will both show up in the same tile... the tile becomes a folder which you can name.&nbsp;&nbsp; Very convenient if you wish to have several email folders pinned to the start interface.&nbsp; For instance, I have my inbox, and
 two work folders, along with linkedin, twitter, and facebook all in one folder.&nbsp; tap it and it expands below the icon.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have one folder for all photo apps and one for all map apps.&nbsp; It really is convenient.

            Yes its called Live Folders.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp;post is about a suggestion for a new tile size, not about a feature&nbsp; Windows Phone already has.&nbsp; ...and even so, Live Folders are still the same size of any tile

<p>that only works if you have "Windows Phone 8.1 Update", which hasn't been released to existing phones yet - only on new models like the htc one or via the developer preview.</p>

                    <span>Outlook 2007 STOPS always on the receiving emails.</span>
<span>I
<span>I
 report a problem I have at least 1 year on all computers (fixed and portable) with different operating systems (Windows XP, 8.1) that have not yet been able to solve and that is really unbearable .<br />
<br />
</span><span>When you open Outlook downloading the mails from
 my various accounts it stops several times and I'm obliged to to&nbsp; close Outlook with the command " ctrl alt del" , otherwise it remains open and does not receive any email.&nbsp;
</span><span>Upon reopening after such "forced" termination&nbsp;it starts to download again some emails but then after a short while and few emails it&nbsp;stops
 again&nbsp;! </span><span>and so on ad infinitum !<br />
</span><span>Unsustainable and unacceptable .<br />
</span><span>I have not uploaded any add-in in Outlook 2007;&nbsp;the&nbsp;Service Pack 2 is installed , I have&nbsp;15 pst files
 of no more than 2-2.5 GB each one. </span><span>In total I<br />
</span><span>I have&nbsp; 30 GB splitted
 on several email accounts on different hosts ( my domain , Fastweb, Outlook.com, GMail , ...) and I verified that it doesn't stop on any particular account but indifferently on all the accounts in turn on only one or on more than one at the same&nbsp;</span><span>time
 ; of course as the program is not working the prepared sending messages are not sent.
</span><span>Sometimes it even&nbsp;stops only on messages sent, after he had&nbsp;stopes and restart&nbsp;maybe 10-20 times on receipt of e-mail!<br />
<br />
</span><span>I'm&nbsp;" desperate " and I'm considering
 to use another e-mail client ... but after twenty years I'm using outlook with satisfaction I would like to have the possibility to continue using Outlook, but without troubles and interruptions!</span>
<span><br />
<span><br />
</span><span>Should&nbsp;the Total size of all the pst file&nbsp; about 30 GB be responsable to&nbsp;stop the program ?<br />
<br />
</span><span>Is there&nbsp;any sure solution, already satisfactory used&nbsp;&nbsp;for similar problems matched by other users&nbsp;?<br />
<br />
</span><span>thank you very much<br />

<h2>            A New thread is created on gmail &#40;in a threaded conversation&#41; when I reply using WP7 email client.</h2>
                    I found a thread for this issue but my question was not being answered there so sorry for creating a new one.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I use my samsung omnia 7 to reply to a gmail thread a new thread is created. This issue is also prevalent in Outlook threads. This is an issue since the beginning. Even Mango didn't fix the issue. A new thread is created always if you are replying
 to a thread with a lot of emails. With newer threads (which have fewer emails) it seems like a random issue. Sometimes a new thread is created and sometimes it isn't. Also when replying through my WP7 RE is in capital and I have noticed that it is "Re" when
 replying through a browser on the PC. Email is one of the most important things on this phone and I can't use the default client, but have to tediously use the browser which is very inconvenient.

            First try to delete all the browsing history. If it still doesn`t &nbsp;work try to disable some adds on. But if the problem continues then reset the browser. After resetting the browser if the problem is not solved then you should uninstall and re-install
 the browser. Hope this helps

<p>To reset the browser go to the ex trim right and click on it then select SETTINGS, the scroll to the bottom of the page (make sure you click on show advance settings) and click Reset "Browser Settings". If no success then you have to uninstall and then install

<h2>            Microsoft outlook hotmail connector password pop-ups</h2>
                    How do I stop the pop-ups from outlook hotmail connector that ask for my password?&nbsp; They happen anytime I open outlook, messages come in, or if I'm sending a message.&nbsp; And 2 pop-ups happen each time, I think because there are 2 e-mail addresses. &nbsp;This
 problem just started about a week ago as I was trying to resolve a problem I was having sending e-mails from outlook.

            Was't a new document. Just changed wording in an old document. Was able to make pdf from previous files. Something seems to have changed just recently and I don't think it matters what font is used. All the Word documents are being affected and unable
 to print to printer or file. Think it started when I tried to create a pdf from a document with a table in it. This current document has only text and one graphic, which has always been there. I sent the Word document to another computer (Mac) that has a new
 version of Word on it and they were able to create a pdf for me and e-mail it back to me. Tried to email the Word document to myself, open it and try to print ... and it still show a blank page in the "print preview".

            It is an old file that I tried to modify by changing some text ... which I do on a regular basis with the document. Didn't use a new or different fonts. I tried saving it as a different WORD document ie rtf, but it still does the same non-printing to file
 or printer. Not sure if something may have gotten changed in the preferences that is affecting viewing in Print Preview. I can save the document and e-mail it to another computer. Just can't create a pdf from it on this computer - which I used to be able to
 do. And it isn't just one particular document ... it is any WORD document. I even tried creating a new blank document ... put text on it and it still wouldn't print to file or printer.

            Eleanor, if one or more fonts used in the document are corrupt in <u>your</u> system, then everyone else will see the document perfectly, but not you. That's why both Phillip and I suggested changing the font.
<div><br />
<div>If the text that won't print is within a text box, there's a Word preference to
<u>not</u>&nbsp;print such document elements. If it has been accidentally enabled, everyone else will be able to print, preview or create a pdf from it, but you. (These three are actually the same operation.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>The fact that others can see the document correctly clearly indicates that it's a local problem at your computer. Thus, emailing the document to yourself serves no purpose.</div>

            In Word 2004 go to <b>Word&gt; Preferences - Print</b>. In the <i><b>Include with document</b></i> group is a check box for
<b>Drawing Objects</b>... Make sure it's checked.<br />
<br />
If the problem persists it may be a matter of lacking updates. Confirm that;<br />
<ul>
<li>Your version of OS X is fully updated,</li><li>Office 2004 is fully updated (11.6.6) &amp;</li><li>Check the mfr's web site to see if there is an newer version of your printer's driver software.</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;We&nbsp;have issue with Current Channel build and Insider Outlook&nbsp;2016 build.</p>
<p>When we Open outlook for the first time and then go to information worker(i.e create a new email) Then go to attachments and then click on Browse this PC at the end.</p>
<p>it opens the&nbsp;location C:Windows\System32</p>
<p>When I click on Cancle and close the&nbsp;information worker and then go through the same steps&nbsp;it opens the document folder fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to repro this issue with a lot of&nbsp;System and it seems that Current Channel as well as Office Insider build is having the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe it is&nbsp;already known to Outlook PG. Let me know if&nbsp;I'm the only one who is affected&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Glenn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you post anything in yammer you need to specify at least one group from your yammer network.
</p>
<p>Mentions in Yammer utilize the same @ functionality present in other social networks. By typing the @ symbol, a drop down list will appear with people and group names. This allows you to tag a person
 or group in your post. Using the @ mention will notify the person and will show this post in their inbox. Mentions are a great way to include other people or â€œccâ€ people in a conversation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding only the user and not the group will not allow to post in yammer. You will be able to see the post button if you have a group list.</p>
<p>You may send&nbsp;private message for the users
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please feel free to revert if you have any queries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Moinuddin</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumina Phone</h2>
                    Well I have a number of phones that promised everything and delivered nothing ... What a waste of money and time ... I think your missing the point of a phone ? &nbsp; Firstly it should take great pictures , play music that would make any other phone brand
 envious . Have a speaker level that would rock the world ... game playing only comes into its own when the screen is big enough to appreciate the work that has gone into it &nbsp;.... Your phone should be a work of art .......... but sadly i think your to late
 to do this ... you have missed the bus ... When I looked at your latest phone I thought they where rubbish .. Picked one up and it had lost that Nokia feel / build and quality &nbsp;... So I am sorry to say We will not be buying any more windows phones .... R.I.P&nbsp;

    <title>Rename worksheet with formatted date - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danc_2128  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rename worksheet with formatted date</h2>
                    I have created a macro that renames the worksheet with the contents from cell A1. &nbsp;The data in A1 is 2013-10-30 and is displayed as "Wednesday 30 October 2013" using custom number format "dddd dd mmm yyyy". &nbsp;Unfortunately, the macro renames the worksheet
 as 2013-10-30 (unformated) and not Wednesday 30 October 2013 (my preference). &nbsp;Is there any way to force the macro to use the formatted date? &nbsp;Is it possible to force copy the formatted date to a different cell (such as B1) to use in the macro? &nbsp;I also intend
 to use the &amp;[Tab] element in the header to pull the formatted date worksheet name.
<div>Thanks, Dan</div>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>try using a variable in VBA. Write the formatted date into the variable, using the Format() function in VBA. Something like this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim TheName As String</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; TheName = Format(Range("A1"), "dddd d mmmm yyyy")</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Sheets("Sheet1").Name = TheName</div>

Use the Text property of the cell not the value property...<br />
x = Range("A1").Text<br />

<p>I am having a problem adding an email account hosted at 1and1.com.&nbsp; I found a previous post from last month from a user with the same problem.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He solved it by sending a private message to 'messaginghelp' and having his account reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>'messaginghelp' is no longer accepting private messages.&nbsp; Is there another way to get my email address reset so I can add it to my NM account?</p>

<p>Try your local Nokia Care is the standard advice, but good luck with that. They responded to me once but never answer my replies. My E72 is crippled and not working as advertised and sold due to an innactive NM account* and they just ignore me even after
 asking for further information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* - aside from all the other major bugs on the E72 that is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh and good luck trying to find how to contact Nokia Care also. It's not obvious, especially from the Nokia Messaging page (email.nokia.com) which has no 'contact us' option.</p>

<p>To contact Nokia Care, go to <a href="http://www.nokia.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.nokia.com/support</a> and click on the Contact Us&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nokia.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">l</a>ink on the top right. &nbsp;You can then call or email. &nbsp;They normally do a little better if you call them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Nokia Messaging Nokia Care has tools to delete your Nokia Messaging account, fix up your subscription, and make other changes. &nbsp;If they can't resolve the issue, they should escalate it up to folks that can dig deeper.</p>

<p>*Should*, but all I get are promises to get back to me and nothing. Try following up and no reply. Though I'll admit I've only contacted them by email. I don't have time to be passed around in a call centre re-explaining everything when calling.</p>

 updated onto the PC. Also I have tried two PC's.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear you have had trouble connecting your devices to the PC. Have you both tried a hard reset which involves you to back up before hand, because it will delete all data from the device. Then by entering *#7370# into your device, when prompted for
 a passcode, the default is 12345.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, make sure you have the latest software by entering *#0000# and there will be an option for software update if it is available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on after a reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>haZey</p>
