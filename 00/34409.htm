<p>I'm sorry, but I've never seen or heard of any Apple error message like that.&nbsp; Perhaps it has something to do with sync'ing your Outlook calendar (if you use Microsoft Outlook's calendar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as iPhone battery issues are concerned, each time that Apple introduces an update to iOS (the operating system for iPhones and iPads), there are some iPhone users who experience battery issues.&nbsp; If there is an Apple store near you, you might consider
 making an appointment with Apple's "Genius Bar" to have someone check out your iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other possibilities are looking for help at Apple support (<a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/geniusbar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.apple.com/retail/geniusbar/</a>) or (<a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.apple.com/iphone</a>)

    <title>email address and sign in to msn account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billhezlep  say:</h3>
<h2>            email address and sign in to msn account</h2>
                    <p>When I first downloaded and installed Windows 10, I had to provide an email and set up a password. Then when I turned on my pc the opening screen, the blue window, came up with that email address and a photo of me and asked for my password.&nbsp;I had to enter
 my password, and then my desktop popped up.&nbsp;At that point I was not only on my desktop, I was also logged into msn, which was my home page. Of course anyone using my computer was in my msn account too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I no longer use that email,&nbsp;so I tried to change my msn account to a new email. I was able to set up a new email account and create a new password, but I was unable to delete or change the original sign in email and password. I now need two email&nbsp;addresses
 and two passwords to&nbsp;sign in to msn. One gets me into Windows and&nbsp;to my desktop, the other lets me sign into msn; except, two thirds, or more,&nbsp;of the time it does not work, all I&nbsp;get is "This Page Can Not Be Displayed", if&nbsp;I try Bing "This Page Can Not Be
 Displayed", so...shut down, reboot, "This Page Can Not Be Displayed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get that old embedded email and password out of my computer? Better yet, how do I get&nbsp;both emails and both passwords out of my computer? At this point I am so tired of this that I just want to start over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. I hope.</p>

            <p>Hi BillHezlep,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are using two MSN account, one for login to the desktop and other for MSN account. If you will use any of the Microsoft account the MSN.com will automatically get synced with that account until and unless you sign out from
 MSN.com and use&nbsp;other&nbsp;MSN account to sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to use the new one you can do that by creating new user profile as an administrator and using the new MSN account and password.&nbsp;However, if you use new MSN account&nbsp;to login the newly created account then also it will sync your MSN.com and it
 will sign you on that automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are willing to&nbsp;login your computer without using Microsoft Account, which is not recommended. If still you want to login without Microsoft Account then you may&nbsp;do that by creating new user profile with admin permission without Microsoft account. Here
 are steps which might help you to create new user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Press Windows key + R</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Type control userpasswords2 and click OK</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click on add under users tab </span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click the option, "Sign-in without a Microsoft account

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, but I think I did not clearly state the problem and you misunderstood it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to change the email address associated with the administrator account on my pc. I would like to use the email address associated with my MSN account as the administrator account email also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a private pc, I live alone and&nbsp;I am the only user, no children or family members, just me.&nbsp;The administrator account is both my account and the only user account. When I try to change the email address on the Administrator Account (my account) I
 get a message saying that it can not be changed. </p>

            <p>A November 2, 2015&nbsp;answer by "Divya M"&nbsp;to someone else's question about local and account pass words provided most of what I needed. I now have one local and one MSN account and they work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the old discontinued email is still embedded in the MSN system. While the old address does not show&nbsp;in my account profile, when I log into MSN with the new email address both the new and old email addresses come up as suggestions. And, I believe the
 old email and password are still locked into Bing. Since changing my email address and MSN password, searches run on Bing do not show up as "rewards." As a test I noted the "rewards" number and then ran ten searches on&nbsp;an obscure topic I have been researching,
 the "rewards" number never changed -- searches no longer register.</p>

</p><p>1) When I go to "My MSN" I can sign in to my account. I have full access to and can edit my profile, preferences, etc.</p>

 can send and receive messages through there, but please note, they are not affiliated with Microsoft. :)</p>

            <p><span><strong>Hi Danco57,</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1) Are you referring to .</span><span><strong>exe</strong></span><span> instead of .</span><span><strong>ext</strong></span><span>?<br />
2) What </span><span><strong>exactly happens</strong></span><span> when you try to
</span><span><strong>play</strong></span><span> the </span><span><strong>file</strong></span><span>?<br />
3) Is this issue limited to a </span><span><strong>particular file</strong></span><span>?<br />
4) Have you made </span><span><strong>any changes</strong></span><span> on the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>I would like more information regarding the issue.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1-</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the article-</span></p>

<strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2-<br />
<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I would have you use your </span><span><strong>favorite search engine</strong></span><span> to look for
</span><span><strong>third party</strong></span><span> </span><span><strong>software</strong></span><span> over the internet that might help you open the
</span><span><strong>.ext file.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong><span>: Using </span><strong>Third Party Software</strong><span>, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from
 the use of </span><strong>Third Party</strong><span> </span><strong>Software</strong><span> can be solved. Using
</span><strong>Third Party Software</strong><span> is at your own risk.</span></p>

            You need the program installed that created files with the .ext extension in order to be able to use these files, and theres nothing native to winxp that can use these files

    <title>External Hard Drive Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jason3466  say:</h3>
<h2>            External Hard Drive Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having an issue with my external hard drive that I use to keep all my movies and tv shows on. The problem is that when I try to copy a file of any kind onto the hard drive from my Surface Pro 4 that it just stops and gets stuck on copy. There is
 no response at all and eventually windows explorer has to restart.<br />
<br />
I know the drive is good because I have used it on 2 other laptops with no issues at all. The problem only arises when I am copying a file from the Surface to the hard, but when I'm copying a file from the hard drive to the Surface there are no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried updating the USB drivers, I've formatted the drive several times, I've even reset the Surface and tried again. I don't know what could be wrong with it and I'd rather not go and buy a new hard drive if I don't need to.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
P.S the surface will not format my hard drive or error check it. Everything just frezzes and I have to restart windows explorer same as I said above. I've had to format it on other laptops.&nbsp;</p>
<p />

            Hi, Jason,
<br />Is this drive with or without power supply?  If the second is correct, may be there is not enough power due to drive or Surface aging. Try an active USB concentrator (with its own power supply).

            the hard drive does have a second USB plug on the cable for extra power if its needed but I've never had to use that before on any device that I've used the hard drive on. I have tried plugging that into the power brick for the laptop to give it that extra
 boost but still have the same issues.

            Please, try to connect to USB 3.0 port if you did not do this before.
<br />Does the problem appears when you red files from drive? Recording requires more power than reading.

            There is only one port on the Surface pro 4 and it is usb 3. As i said the problem only happens when I try to copy a file from the tablet to the drive and not the other way around. It also happens if I try to format or error check the drive&nbsp;

            Both formatting and writing files require more power. That's why I suppose the reducing power the Surface can provide. 
<br />You may bring Surface to service center to test a port. Or try to use active USB 3 concentrator with its own power supply.

            Fair enough. I assumed that the port on the Surface would have enough power to run the drive. I'll try that

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            If you have Boot Camp setup, yes, you could. The instructions I provided are for clean install only. If you don't want to do that, perform a custom install instead.
<br />
<br />If there are files on the drive you want to recover, see -  How to: Perform a Custom install of Windows 10

<br />
<br />You can then recover your files from the WIndows.old folder:

            I thought you said you were using a Mac. 
<br />
<br />The Aptio Setup Utility is for ASUS computers.
<br />
<br />Try the following and see if it resolves the problem.
<br />
<br />1. In the Aptio Setup Utility, select the "boot" menu and then select "Launch CSM" and change it to "enable".
<br />
<br />2. Next select the "Security" menu and then select "secure Boot Control" and change to "disable".
<br />
<br />3. Now select "Save &amp; Exit" and press "yes".
<br />
<br />4. Once you have done this, hold down the "power" button until the laptop turns off completely.
<br />
<br />5. Now you want to power it back on and continually press the "F9" button for about ten seconds or until you are taken to the "Windows Recovery Menu".
<br />
<br />6. In here select "Advanced Start Up" and then, once the recovery menu appears, select "Advance Options".
<br />
<br />7. Choose "System Restore" and select a date prior to when the problem started.
<br />
<br />The computer should now go through the restore process and then start normally for you.

            So, you are trying to make bootable media on your Mac so you can reinstall Windows 10?
<br />
<br />It can be done, but its often fraught with failure. If you can find another Windows PC, I would try making the bootable copy there.

<p>
</p><p>I have tried to get in restore point, or a safe start but it will not accept the function keys.&nbsp; I have also used a recover thumb drive that I made, and it will allow me to get a bit further and I can open the file display but will not allow any files or

            It appears this application is not originally designed for Windows 10 and might be experiencing compatibility issues. 
<br />
<br />I would try uninstall it completely then reinstall using compatibility mode to see if it resolves the error. Try using Windows XP as the supported operating system.

            Hi Lobo JDD,
<br />
<br />Yes it is possible to install Windows 10 on a Chromebook
<br />
<br />Install the 32bit version, it is a lot less stress on the CHrombook
<br />
<br />You will be able to run a couple of apps comfortable, but if you like to have 15 Tabs open in a Browser, don't expect it to perform well on the Chromebook

<p>It might be possible, depending on the model.&nbsp; It's not a simple process, and performance is likely to be substandard.&nbsp; Storage space will also be a perpetual problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>That model has only 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, which is not even close to being enough space to sustain a Windows installation.&nbsp; I would forget about it if I were you.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth Driver Errors</h2>
                    Greetings,<br />
I have a Asus X202E Vivobook<br />
I have an issue connecting any Bluetooth Device. Whenever I turn on bluetooth it flashes the words "driver error" then flashes back to "not connected".<br />
I've tried deleting the drivers and reinstalling it yet it does not fix it. I contacted Asus Support and they told me the way to fix it was to Restart my computer to factory settings. I think that will be too much of a hassle. I also get Blue screen errors
 of System Exception (BthHfAud.sys)/(ks.sys) and Worker_Invalid. I researched on it and it may be a resitry error How do I fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            <p>Hi Denny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your efforts to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The PKU2U protocol in Windows is implemented as an SSP. The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows media and file sharing feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain.
 Similarly the rest of the errors displayed are related to HomeGroup. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you face any issue while connecting to HomeGroup? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to check if the issue occurs on a New User Account or not.
<span>To create a new User Account, refer to the article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Create a user account</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't face any major issues while connecting to the Homegroup. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a new user account and the errors still occur when I log onto that account. How can I stop these errors from occurring every time I log on:
</p>

    <title>XBox one Problems &#47; missing features - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fireballs  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox one Problems &#47; missing features</h2>
                    
<p>Here is a list if the most common problems I have been having and features that are missing and sorely needed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Problems I have run into.</p>
<p>1. Games crash and or will not resume. Fix: Hard Reboot*</p>
<p>2. Unable to search for gamer tags in Friends app. Fix: Hard Reboot*</p>
<p>3. Unable to turn&nbsp;on party chat channel. Fix: Hard Reboot* (as a side note my NAT was fine I was able to join the party but not turn on the chat channel)</p>
<p>4. Achievements are not showing up as unlocked and there is no notification. Fix: Hard Reboot* (as a side note they did&nbsp;show as being completed after reboot)</p>
<p>5. The smart glass app not showing info for the game or being locked up. Fix:&nbsp;Hard Rebooting the Xbox1, the device, or the app&nbsp;(this has happened across several devices most notably with Dead Rising 3)</p>
<p>6. Xbox will show that it has found and match when you&nbsp;select go to party it still says searching and will not load the match. Fix: Reinstall the Game (side note this happened in Dead Rising 3)</p>
<p>7. Console stops signing you in through Kinect and asks for your password every time you sign in. Fix: Hard Reboot* ( side note I do have a passcode to sign in. It always asks for this and will normally say hey please&nbsp;finish signing in with&nbsp;the controller&nbsp;after
 which I put in the passcode and I am signed in. It shouldn't ask for the live ID password after this but it was every time.)</p>
<p>*Hard Reboot is holding down the glowing Xbox Logo on the front of the XBox1 until it powers off. Then restarting it.</p>
<p>Now for features that are missing.</p>
<p>1. The ability to see the battery level on your controller (what is this 1998?)</p>
<p>2. Notifications as to when your friends get on line. (at least the ability to enable and disable this if so wanted)</p>
<p>3. Storage management and external drive support for storing games etc.</p>
<p>4. Xbox.com (and Xbox rewards) need to track the activity on the&nbsp;Xbox one. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In summery these are all the problems I have experienced personally with a functional none defective console. Most of the "fixes" being a Hard Reboot. Really that is not a fix but a work around. A fix would be a patch so that these problems don't happen
 again. Instead I find myself faced with them day after day. When I first got my Xbox1 I was impressed and loved the device but now as more and more problems are rearing their ugly heads I feel like this is a Windows ME release. In spite of what Microsoft may
 say the instability and lacking features make this feel like an alpha release instead of retail.&nbsp;Now I'm&nbsp;NOT saying buy a PS4 or don't get an Xbox1&nbsp;what I am saying is be prepared for the early adopter pains and that they are very much there. I have had my
 Xbox live account for almost a decade and I have no intention of jumping ship anytime soon. But I am not going to lie I feel very disappointed and let down and I hope they fix these issues soon. disappointed</p>

<p>I onestly don't know if they're reading all this post but i'll give it a try, and i think i will post this in other threads as well, maybe one post will pass through.</p>
<p>After more than a week of using my XboxOne I have to say, i'm disappointed.</p>
<p>As others have said, it's really a great machine, i have mostly no complains about the hardware, but the software...oh the software really needs some QUICK (QUICK!!!) adjustments.</p>
<p>I've been using my 360 from day one and the improvements made up to the final Dashboard were amazing, we had an almost flawless online system, with extremely useful functionalities, that went inexplicably missing in this new dashboard.</p>
<p>I mean, Microsoft had years of experience with the 360, so I honestly don't know what were they thinking when they made this one, the only thing that comes to mind is that this is an extremely early version, released just to have something ready for launch
 date.</p>
<p>Anyway, apart from the usual bugs fixing, which i hope is already being worked on, this is my personal FIXING list:</p>
<p>- <strong>CONTROLLER BATTERY LEVEL</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;This one is amazing, i don't even know how they missed it. Also, and i think this could be done whit a software update, i would quite like if the led on the controller would start flashing when the battery is low (really low, not half done like the flashing
 leds on the 360).</p>
<p>- <strong>ONLINE FRIEND NOTIFICATIONS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Another big one, and it think that for now, the easiest and fastest way to implement this is to make notifications available only to your Favorites.</p>
<p>- <strong>PARTY CHAT!!!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;This is probably the most important. We had an amazing party chat system on the 360, completely changed in this new version, and i'm sorry to say, it is a mess. I mean, we don't want to be forced to link our party to a specific game, gives us the option
 to do so. Also, the game SHOULD NOT PREVENT US TO PLAY ONLINE if we are not in the right "party condition" (es. FIFA, Ryse...).</p>
<p>- <strong>INVITE SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;What happened here? It was so easy to go in our friends profiles, and have to option to INVITE or JOIN them, one click away. Now every game has a different system, usually party related, and every one works worse the the other. Come on.</p>
<p>- <strong>STORAGE MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;I want to be able to see how much space i have left on my hard drive, and what it is actually on there. I also want to know exactly where my stuff is, and be able to manage it. For example, savegames, are they on Cloud only? Both on console and cloud and
 they sincronize with the most recent? I HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE MY STUFF.</p>
<p>- <strong>RECENT PLAYERS</strong> / FEEDBACK</p>
<p>&nbsp;Where is the list of recent players? How can i send them my feedback, or add them as friends, if i can't find a list of the players i've recently played with? I have to do it in game? Why??</p>
<p>Anyway, this are my personal BIG ONES. I've seen others explain my points better in this forum, so i think i made my case. I really hope they read all this feedback we are giving them, and they will fix this stuff soon, or at least let us know they are working
 on it.</p>

<p>About the controller... when the Area One tour came to town, I wound up digging around the dashboard a bit and there was an application called, "Controller Settings". &nbsp;I see this is clearly not in the app store or on the console. &nbsp;Agree, there needs to be
 a battery level indicator. &nbsp;Mine just died and I wasn't sure if it lost connection or was dead. &nbsp;I had enough juice to power it back on, stayed on for a minute, then dropped. &nbsp;I would have settled for LED indicators in the Xbox Logo that showed "yellow" for
 low and "red" for about to die. &nbsp;Something. &nbsp;Anything! &nbsp;Also, storage is a big one. &nbsp;There are just some things I am scratching my head about right now. &nbsp;Did they forget?</p>

<h2>            gray screen with horizontal lines windows 7 start up or after sleep</h2>
                    <p>My daughter's hp pavilion dv6-6163cl entertainment notebook has begun to show a gray screen with horizontal lines at start up and after sleep (opening the laptop cover).&nbsp; This lasts for a few moments, then her log in screen appears.&nbsp; There is no sound when
 the screen appears and no mouse visible.&nbsp; It does not happen every time the computer starts or wakes from sleep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No new software installed; nothing downloaded.&nbsp; Microsoft Windows is updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I have done already:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Essentials virus scan</p>
<p>sfc /scannow</p>
<p>chkdsk /r</p>
<p>hp diagnostics test on hard drive and memory (via BIOS screen): both passed</p>
<p>safe mode and restart</p>
<p>selective start up</p>
<p>uninstalled McAfee and installed Microsoft Security Essentials</p>
<p>updated to latest Intel graphics driver </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Haven't been able to tell if the problem happens in safe mode because it happens so intermittently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts are appreciated.</p>

    <title>windows 7 and a hardware change CPU and Motherboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denzii  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7 and a hardware change CPU and Motherboard</h2>
                    My work computer has a dual boot system. I have an install of XP Pro and an Install of Windows 7 Pro. My old Dual Core Duo is out of date and I'm in need of an upgrade with faster Memory and a more efficient CPU. I have decided to go with an i7 950 with
 4gigs of ram on both of my 32bit systems. <br />
When I upgrade will I run into problems using my original Hard drives with the same operating systems? I ask this because it would be too much of a hassle to reinstall all of my software again since this is a work computer and I have major money wrapped up
 in my software and it's a pain to re-register all of these expensive programs. I would end up loosing more money than I would make in a day just to do this upgrade. It would be nice just to install the motherboard with it's new CPU connect my HDD and update
 a few drivers and go right back to work. Activating windows isn't a problem of course but I just want to know if windows is just going to crash and I will end up having to do a fresh install of windows and all of my programs.<br />

            <p>Just to echo Carey, because the motherboard will be different, it will not boot when you connect your old hard disk, Windows 7 will need to be reinstalled..
</p>
<p>This will mean you will need to gather all your installation disc for your programs and prepare to reinstall them.
