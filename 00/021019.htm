    <title>copy-paste styles in Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            copy-paste styles in Word 2010</h2>
                    It seems like after 20 years of developing this product doing something like copying and pasting a style from one open document to another, or even dragging and dropping a style between the styles windows in different documents, would be fairly straight
 forward.<br />
<br />
Instead I have to go to the Organizer, which is itself buried, go through opening two files that are already open (and the Open dialogue has no memory of where the first file was located, it goes right back to the templates directory to open the second), and
 then the source style I'm looking for, which is very clearly in the source document, is nowhere to be found in the list of styles in Organizer.<br />
<br />
Sigh. For the 1000th time. Why does everything have to be a trial? Do Word PMs ever even use their product? Not surface junk, really use it like people out here have to.<br />
<br />
I guess my question is, how do I make copying styles between already open documents easy? Is there something I'm missing?

            Styles should be set up in Templates and to change the styles in a document, attach the template that contains the desired styles to that document via the Developer Tab&gt;Document Template.

            I'm creating a document based on the normal template. It is progress, well underway. I discover I don't have a style in that document I need. I have that style in another document. I go to that document and use Organizer to add it to the normal template.
<div><br />
<div>How do I get the document in progress to see the new style I have added to the normal template? Or do I have to create a completely new template?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>With respects, it seems like would be a commonplace thing to do, to share styles between documents. Even using templates, it is difficult. For example, it is through the developer tab that I attach a template to a document, a tab that isn't even there
 by default, and I have to take the time to figure out how to add it. Just the name of the tab indicates that it is something that a normal user wouldn't use. In the end, I create the new style manually, hoping I've remembered to set every property. This is
 what I mean, msft doesn't get how to make their stuff usable, or they don't care.</div>

Possibly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use&nbsp; nslookup&nbsp; (in a cmd window)&nbsp; to check.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FWIW my nslookup shows that it is an alias of a server in another domain, so whatever it is that is giving you a message could be commenting on that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Etc.</p>

<h2>            MS Project 2010- Change the order a Task is Displayed &#40;Same Start&#47;End Dates&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a number of activities in a (milestone) plan that have the same start dates/times and end dates/times. &nbsp;I have sorted the project by the Start time and all of these activities group together, as expected. &nbsp;However, the tasks could be better ordered
 when viewing them so that they read logically. &nbsp;Is there any way I can change the order in which tasks with the same start end dates/times are shown?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing the priority but this doesn't see, to do anything. &nbsp;I've given an example below. &nbsp;The tasks shown are not dependent on each other but have separate dependencies. &nbsp;I want to order the table so that Task A displays first, Task B second
 and Task C third.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Task &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Description &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Start Time &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>100 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Task B &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25/11/15 08:00 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>200 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Task A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25/11/15 08:00 &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>300 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Task C &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25/11/15 08:00 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your friend needs to go back for a PowerPoint (and Windows) refresher course, I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use ALT+TAB to switch between pretty much any window and any other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start the first presentation, start the second (Alt+Tab back to PPT if necessary to do so), then use Alt+Tab to switch between presentation windows.&nbsp; It might take a bit of fiddly to get things in order but once you've tabbed to one presentation then the
 the other, they'll keep switching back and forth (not to other windows) when you Alt+tab.</p>

<h2>            slow browsing in Lumia.</h2>
                    I'm facing very slow browsing in my Nokia Lumia 720, i don't know why. Contracted service provider, they said its fine from their side, you reset your device. Resetting is very difficult and time consuming so i tried resetting my advertising id, it also
 didn't work out. I'm facing this for two weeks, and last time i reset my device in December

Farooq Awan</a>. Thank you for posting on the community. Are you also experiencing the same behavior when browsing the internet using Wi-Fi? Have you tried checking if the phone system apps are up to date?&nbsp;You can do that by going&nbsp;to
<strong>Store</strong>&gt;<strong>...</strong>&gt;check for updates. What is the software version installed on your phone? Go to
<strong>Settings</strong>&gt;<strong>phone update</strong>&gt;<strong>check for updates</strong>. We look forward to your reply. ^_^

<p>Hi Shaneh204,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes. Your understanding is correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How the message appears to the person receiving <strong>it depends on their email program</strong>. If the recipient's email program is set to convert messages, for example, then a message you send formatted as HTML could be converted to plain text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check the description of the three formats in Outlook.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the issue happens on two users who are using Outlook with the same version, please share the detailed version and build with us. You can get it via

    <title>Mac Excel&#58; Empty Cells Plotted As... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mac Excel&#58; Empty Cells Plotted As...</h2>
                    I am making a graph for one of my students to plot her grades across classes. I have an area graph at the back, where red shows failing grades, yellow shows passing grades and green is for As. Then I have line graphs for each of the subjects. My only problem
 now is that the empty cells are being plotted as zeros and I'm not sure how to fix this. I clicked on the graph and went to Preferences, but it only allows the selection of "Zero." Any ideas how to fix this?<br />

            Not tested for your situation, but for most versions of Excel, use =NA() in the "empty" cells.<br />

<p>Hi. Nokia 2680 specifiaction guide says that it has memory enhancement</p>
<p>that allows a 4G microSD card to be added. I don't see where this can be inserted?</p>

here</a>, this is correct. There is no provision for extending the phone's memory with a memory card.

            Sky Drive is just a cloud file storage system which maintains a local copy on your system - i.e., it mirrors the local copy so that others can share it. Or so I'm assuming ;-)<br />
<br />
Are you opening the local copy? Or are you opening the copy from some web browser?<br />

<p>Hello xiomym1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that all recurring payments are taken 3 day in advance to ensure the continuity of the service. If you want to cancel the recurring payment, this must be done before the renewal date or the subscription will continue to renew and charge
 you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Skype number is considered as used upon purchase. As defined by Skype's refund policy, the nature of a Skype Number means that you can use it to receive calls from the moment it is purchased; therefore, no refunds can be made for Skype Numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But to further assist you regarding this, please check the private message I sent you.</p>

<p>I have a problem with my N95, i turned it off while it was chargirging, and when i try to turn it on, the screen doesn't display anything, it just gets stuck on a black screen and freezes,the turn off button doesn't work and i have to take off the baterry.
 Although when i turn on the phone it vibrates as usual. I have search the forum and i didn't find anything helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already tried hard reset,and taking off the memory card and SIM and open it without them and nothing happened.</p>

<p>I doubt whether these NCC agents are really skilled and committed to carry on the Nokia brand name! I too have my phone in a very similar situation. For this I had taken it to a Lvel 2 NCC and they said that the phone is in an irrepairable condition. I've
 spent close to 8 days to bring the phone back to life.But I'm convinced that everything is repairable, or why should Nokia have "re-cycle" bins?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, the phone is just a mass of junk material, with which my little child can try the phone's durability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HATS OFF TO NOKIA CARE!!!</p>
<p>Now, they've started (Dis) Connecting People!!!</p>

<p>My N95 too is stuck on a black screen. At first, it would show the white screen, but now, it only shows the black screen. The phone still vibrates and the navigation keys (not the number pad) still lights up and stay light-up.</p>

<p>Has anyone managed to reset their phone with similar symptoms aside from taking it to repair? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>Well, I took the phone to a "Level 2" Customer service center. After explaining the logical reasoning to the center manager, I got the phone resurrected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: You need to have lot of persuasive skills to push the Nokia care people to go the extra mile.</p>

<h2>            Work in teams&#47; onenote not saving</h2>
                    I am a teacher and have used teams to setup individual channels for different lab groups, and then have students collaborate on a lab report pasted into the class notebook created by teams, one per each channel.&nbsp; Only one student is working in the channel
 and on the page at a time, but it is not saving their work.&nbsp; The changes they make turn pink, and they get an "unable to save changes" error message.&nbsp; It isn't the wireless, because it happens on my account and it is hardwired.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any idea why or what to do
 about it?

<p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, you can sign in to Company Portal from another device. You can refer to the following article about the detailed steps.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune-user-help/sign-in-to-the-company-portal#signing-in-from-another-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Signing in from another device</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need further assistance about this, I would suggest you post a new thread in our
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=microsoftintuneprod&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;searchTerm=company+portal+sign+in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Intune forum</a> on TechNet which is a specific support channel for Intune related queries.</p>

<h2>            How to contact office 365 support&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>We have been trying on many occasions to get some sort of reply about our Office 365 trial and to convert to to a full system.</p>
<p>I have been told that there are private messages but there are not after an earlier response about it being referred to the correct team and then nothing more.</p>
<p>Is there a telephone number to call as this online forum does not seem to be working?</p>
<p>The overall support process worries me as to what will happen once we go live if we ever get there - especially if the internet goes down.</p>
