<h2>            SKYPE&#58; Sennheiser Bluetooth Headphones work with everything but Skype.</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">Hi, ever since I installed the latest Skype version, my headset (Sennheiser) does no longer work: I hear the ringing sound through, when dialing -- however, once
 someone picks up, the sound is transferred to the computer's (Apple MacPro) speakers, not the headset. When I video call, sound seems to work. It is strange. Can you help?</span>

<p>
</p><p>That is weird as the sound is&nbsp;transferred from your&nbsp;Bluetooth headphone to your device speakers&nbsp;when the call got connected. Before we further investigate this issue, can you tell us your
<strong>exact </strong>Skype version please?</p>

<h2>            GTX 970 dropping fps in all games, youtube.&#47;WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    So ive recently just build my own pc, first build. Ive had it for about four months now and just 5 days ago all games have become unplayable as in all games cant get past 20-30 fps. Specs: 16g ramm, z170A gaming m7 msi mobo, msi gtx 970 4g, i5 6600k, after
 market closed water coolant. It started when windows firewall had blocked something from overwatch and asked if i would "allow access" of course i did. After that the frames begin to stay very low and wouldnt pass 20. Im not to tech savvy but i know how to
 watch my task manager and i also have a CPUID to monitor utilities and temps of everything. And everything is is where it should be according to the components online stats and maxing of temp, volts, and utilities. I have tried updating gfx and mobo drivers,
 reinstalling them completely, and even going back to a certain poiont. One thing i noticed when looking for drivers manually you have to specifiy which gfx you have mine did not have the option for W10 drivers download from gefo

            <p>I did the first method and nothing seemed to change. Are those drivers any different than the gfx or msi drivers I downloaded? And for the second method it mentions a "previous version of windows" but also mention 8 and 8.1 being the version. Is windows
 7 ok? And is this the same as seeing if my pc ran differently as if I had W7? I was going to buy W7 soon to see if it changes.</p>

            My uncle is putting the Windows 7 on DVD and mailing it to me. For future refernce, what is the difference between dragging and dropping files into a usb and using the creator tool? I see it wipes completely before downloading new files onto it. And do
 you just do the same creator method with dvd, like usb.

<p>Office 2007 works perfectly well with Windows7 - so you have no problems there.</p>
<p>If you would prefer to try to fix your current&nbsp;Office program (if possible depending on the version) than buy another copy (though the upgrade is very nice to have), then post your problems in the Office Forum at;<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/officeinstall/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/officeinstall/threads</a>&nbsp;where

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>P.S. There is no windows 2007. You mean Microsoft Office 2007.<br />
<br />
As to your question....<br />
Depending on <strong>why</strong> do you want to install Office 2007. If you reason is to be able to<strong>OPEN</strong> doc and excel attachments and
<strong>NOT working</strong> on Word or Excel programs, then you are wasting your money. You could have<strong>2 FREE Viewers</strong> which will open doc and excel attachments.<br />
To open doc attachments, you need Microsoft Word VIEWER : Download link below.<br />

    <title>Wi-Fi Problems in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> remolanot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wi-Fi Problems in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Wi-Fi doesn't work on this Samsung RV411, since I removed the Wi-Fi card (Broadcom) 2 years ago because of Windows 10 installation problems and I installed Wi-Fi card (Atheros) last year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I installed Windows 10, it can't detect any Wi-Fi networks. Earlier, I manage to install Windows 10 Creators Update using Ethernet cable (using my old router as a repeater).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I update this computer, I tried to fix it by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reinstalling Driver&nbsp;</li><li>Re-enabling Driver</li><li>Reinserting the Card</li><li>Typing commands in Command Prompt to fix it (like ipconfig, netsh, etc.)</li><li>Temporarily Disabling Windows Firewall</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>And guess what? It doesn't detect any Wi-Fi networks - even I put the router next to it! And it can't detect any Bluetooth Devices</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated it earlier to the latest version of Windows 10. Using Wired connection (Ethernet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the mobile hotspot setting, and when I enable it, I found the hotspot on other devices. (Shown at the first network)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/21bd8050-5b3c-40c6-adf5-b7ca8e3b0166" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/21bd8050-5b3c-40c6-adf5-b7ca8e3b0166" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(P.S. I erase the names of other networks just because of privacy)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also I tried to connect Bluetooth to other devices - and it detects my devices (iPhone 5; iPad 4).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I tried to fix it, even I reset the network adapters by Network Reset setting, it didn't detect any Wi-Fi connection at all! My router and this laptop are closer, but it didn't detect the Wi-Fi connection...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, I want to fix it as soon as possible to connect this laptop on Wi-Fi.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
We can sense the urgency. You've stated that it worked right after you installed the latest updates for your system, and this gives us the clear sense of hope that the issue is workable. Please check these additional methods:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 1 - Disable auto <em>turn-off</em> of WiFi device:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: If your laptop is in Power saver mode, it is highly recommended to switch it to Balanced (recommended) first before proceeding. Also ensure that you're logged as Administrator for the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to the<span> </span><strong>Device Manager.</strong></li><li>Under the Network Adapters, look for your WiFi device, <strong>right</strong>
<strong>click</strong> on it and hit <strong>Properties</strong></li><li>Go to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Power Management</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>tab.</li><li><em><strong>Uncheck/disable</strong></em><span>&nbsp;</span>the radio button for&nbsp; "<strong>Allow this device to turn off this device to save power</strong>".</li><li><strong>Restart the PC</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(Important)</li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>

            <p>Thanks for updating.<br />
<br />
We still have a few methods that can possibly help us resolve or at least diagnose and dig down to the root cause.<br />
</p>
<p><em><strong>Note: The first method to fix the issue will have Registry modification. Before you modify the Registry, make sure to back it up and understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. Please refer to this link:</strong></em><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 153, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 153, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 153, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 153, 1); text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How
 to back up and restore the registry in Windows.</a></span></span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Run Command Prompt (Administrator)</strong>. You can find it when you right-click on the Start button.</li><li><strong>Enter this command</strong>: <em>reg delete HKCR\CLSID\{988248f3-a1ad-49bf-9170-676cbbc36ba3} /va /f</em></li><li><strong>Restart the PC.</strong></li></ol>
<p>This process will delete a registry key which is present in most PCs and is known for possessing a bug that affects the WiFi network detection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try modifying the power settings of your Wireless Adapter:<br />
<br />
Got to <strong>Control panel &gt; Hardware and Sound &gt; Power Options &gt; Change Plan Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>Scroll down to find <strong>Wireless Adapter Settings &gt; Power saving Mode &gt;</strong> Change it to

<h2>            &#91;NEWS&#93;&#91;CRYSIS 2&#93; - Retaliation Map Pack</h2>
                    
<p>A circa due mesi dall'uscita di <a href="http://www.spaziogames.it/recensioni_videogiochi/console_multi_piattaforma/11449/crysis-2.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>Crysis 2</b></a>, i ragazzi di <b>Crytek</b> rilasciano su Xbox Live e sul redivivo Playstation Network l’immancabile espansione a pagamento, interamente dedicata al comparto multigiocatore: al prezzo di 800 Microsoft Point ovvero circa 10 euro,
<b>Retaliation</b> offre quattro nuove mappe, che vanno ad aggiungersi al <i>carnet</i> offerto dal titolo principale, naturalmente utilizzabili per tutte le modalità previste dal comparto. Il discorso, come sempre in questi casi, è: il gioco varrà la candela?<br />
<br />
<b>Park Avenue</b><br />
Park Avenue riprende un’ambientazione ben nota a chiunque abbia completato la campagna singolo giocatore del titolo originale: la celebre strada di New York, famosa per la sopraelevata e l’accesso alla Grand Central Station, offre una mappa simmetrica, con
 la parte sollevata a farla da padrone nel mezzo, le due strade parallele ad un livello più basso ed i palazzi tutt’intorno ad offrire ottime
<i>chance</i> di fiancheggiamento e cecchinaggio. Le generose dimensioni e le molte zone al chiuso, tra cui un Diner posto sotto la sopraelevata ed i locali dei palazzi sventrati, offrono nel complesso un ambiente molto eterogeneo, dove starà al giocatore decidere
 se cercare lo scontro ravvicinato o appostarsi dalla distanza. In sostanza, una <i>
Location</i> ricca di spunti a prescindere dalle preferenze personali, ed adatta ad ospitare scontri anche numerosi.<br />
<br />
<b>Shipyard</b><br />
Un cantiere navale che offre una struttura simile a quella già sperimentata in Park Avenue, con una sezione centrale rialzata, due ali sottostanti e diversi caseggiati ottimi per il tiro dalla distanza e le manovre di aggiramento. La fregata ormai pronta al
 varo spicca nel bel mezzo dell’ambientazione, offrendo numerose possibilità di appostamento grazie alle alte torrette ed al ponte di generosissime dimensioni. Le due ali si rivelano ricche di possibili coperture, così come le finestre, che dai palazzi circostanti
 si aprono sull’area centrale, ottime per i cecchini. Buono per gli appostamenti è anche il bacino d’acqua in cui si trova la nave, dal quale saltare fuori per sorprendere il nemico. Nel complesso, un’ambientazione caratterizzata da specifiche simili alla precedente,
 ed anch’essa adatta a scontri numerosi.<br />
<br />
<b>Compound</b><br />
Ripresa da uno degli ultimi livelli della campagna singolo giocatore, Compund ospita gli scontri tra i diversi edifici di un’installazione militare, caratterizzati da strutture basse, così che le sparatorie tendono a consumarsi solitamente al livello del terreno.
 Labirintica nei suoi percorsi interni, la <i>location</i> si rivela ottima sia per le modalità a squadre che per il tutti contro tutti, offrendo buone
<i>chance</i> di mimetizzazione per chi desiderasse giocare in solitaria, e una navigazione dell’ambiente interessante anche per le squadre. Non manca un percorso sotterraneo a complicare ulteriormente i percorsi interni, oltre ad offrire interessanti possibilità
 di aggiramento, così come diversi tetti, ottimi per i cecchini, chiudendo il quadro su una mappa destinata a fare la gioia di molti, con l’unica pecca rappresentata dalla generale anonimità visiva.<br />
<br />
<b>Transit</b><br />
La mappa visivamente più ispirata: tra le macerie di una strada collassata al punto da mettere a nudo i binari del metrò sottostante, con i pezzi della Statua della Libertà a fare da corollario, si combatte divisi tra ciò che rimane dei tunnel della metropolitana
 e una vasta depressione centrale. Il rischio di dominio per la squadra che si trovi nella posizione sopraelevata è naturalmente molto alto, rendendo gli scontri per il controllo del rialzo molto accesi. Nonostante le dimensioni meno generose rispetto alle
 altre <i>location</i>, Transit risulta molto bella da vedere ed adattissima a scontri in squadra, possibilmente con team ben bilanciati quanto a numeri.

<p>I have the same problem too after updating from Windows 7 to Windows10. <strong>
Xbox 360 accessories doesn't show me the battery status</strong> of my 360 wireless controller. It just says "Connections" "Click for Help". Plus i don't know if the
<strong>Play &amp; Charge Kit is still working, 'cause the green/red light doesn't turn on</strong>, so i can't see the battery status and now i don't even know if the battery is charging or not.</p>
<p>Really upset no one from the support is answering here. I think i will go back to Windows 7.</p>

    <title>Epson V39 freezes up when Web Browser is open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> igorsandler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Epson V39 freezes up when Web Browser is open</h2>
                    <p>OK, I got all Win 10 drivers and updates, did it together with Epson tech support. Scanner works fine if I don't have any other app open. As soon as I open Adobe or Web Browser(tried with Mozilla and Chrome), the scanner freezes up almost immediately. Epson
 etch support told me to call Microsoft (what else is new?). Anyone experienced something like that? I had to scan using two laptops: one for scanner, the other one for Adobe and Web Browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated</p>

            There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>Hey Andre,</p>
<p>appreciate your time and effort to help me. Can't downgrade the Windows, that's what I got with the laptop. And it works when I have nothing else running on this laptop, how is that web browser can freeze the scanner??? Or even Adobe? Just driving me nuts</p>

            Rollback is different from downgrading.

<br />Are you saying, it came preinstalled with Windows 10 1803?

            If you bought it two months ago, it likely had Windows 10 1709 installed. But you likely upgraded to Windows 10 1803 but the 10 day rollback option has since passed.
<br />
<br />Your option is to stick it out and hopefully Microsoft issues a fix or downgrade to Windows 10 1709:
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, you will have to perform a new install. This appears to be a serious bug many are encountering with the new version of Windows 10.
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1709.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1709 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1709
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>

<h2>            Microsoft rewards e game pass</h2>
                    <p>Olá estou com um problema e uma dúvida, quando tento entrar no app MICROSOFT REWARDS on xbox, ele me retorna uma mensagem pedindo para atualizar as opções de localidade para o lugar onde estou porém já está tudo configurado para o Brasil como deve ser, por
 esse motivo não consigo acessar as Solicitações do Xbox game pass, já que ao tentar me pede pra abrir o app microsoft rewards, daí nada feito,esse é o problema.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A dúvida é, será que só fazer as Missões do GAME PASS os créditos caem direto na conta do rewards,tipo baixa o jogo, faz as missões e pronto, ou tem que abrir o tal app microsoft rewards? Não dá pra resgatar pelo app android ou pelo site do Microsoft rewards??
 Desde já agradeço a todos que responderem.&nbsp;</p>

                    I am trying to add 3 SATA devices to my new computer (Dell i660) which had two SATA devices already. I bought a PCI Express to 2 internal SATA ports card from SYBA. &nbsp;I can see that the software driver is installed. How do I get the computer to see a Blue
 Ray internal drive and give it a drive letter? &nbsp;I have also tried to get it to see a DVD RW drive as a 5th SATA. Both the Blue Ray and the DVD RW drives work when I have their SATA data cables attached directly to the mother board,&nbsp; but I can not get either
 to work when their SATA data cable is attached to the PCI card.&nbsp; I have tried F2 during setup (boot) and tried to add devices, discover devices from Windows control panel. My new computer has Windows7 home premium 64 bit. My five SATA devices are a terabyte
 HD (Windows 7 Professional 32 bit) and a Blue Ray internal drive from my old computer,&nbsp; a terabyte HD&nbsp; and a DVD RW from the new computer,&nbsp; and I am adding a 120GB solid state drive (Kingston Hyp

            <p>When&nbsp; I am in Device Manager via Control Panel, what I see is </p>
<p>Disk drives&nbsp; Kingston (my SSD) and two&nbsp; devices which are my hard drives (ST... and WDC...)</p>
<p>DVD/CD-ROM drives I see my DVD RW drive (no Blue Ray drive)</p>
<p>under IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers I see </p>
<p>ATA Channel 0</p>
<p>ATA Channel 1</p>
<p>ATA Channel 4</p>
<p>ATA Channel 5</p>
<p>Intel(R) Series/C216 Chipset Family SATA AHCI Controller - 1E02</p>
<p>which I think is my PCI Express to 2 SATA II controller. When I right click on it to check for driver I get a message that Windows has determined that the driver software for your device is up to date.</p>
<p>My card is a SYBA PCI-Express to SATA II controller card&nbsp; SD-SA2PEX-2IR. What I am trying to do is to get my computer/Windows to see my internal Blue Ray drive using the SYBA card. When I had the SATA data cable to the Blue Ray drive attached directly to
 my motherboard it worked OK (I watched the Blue Ray version of the extended version of THE HOBBIT using this new computer). How do I get Device Manager to see my Blue Ray CD ROM when it is attached to the SYBA controller card?</p>
&nbsp; My motherboard only was 4 SATA connection&nbsp; which is why I am having this problem.

            <p>Are the devices attached to the SYBA PCI-e card seen by the BIOS at boot? You may need to configure the BIOS to recognise devices attached to an add-in card. The Dell BIOS may not be configurable to do that. You should check the BIOS configuration options
 and ask Dell if it possible to do what you want.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Did you install the RAID or the non-RAID driver? You need the non-RAID driver for your configuration.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Details for the card are at <a href="http://www.sybausa.com/productInfo.php?iid=536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sybausa.com/productInfo.php?iid=536</a>&nbsp;. It uses a Silicon Image chipset so is not at present shown as a standard disk controller in Device Manager. I think you installed the RAID driver.</p>

            <p>Not all add-on SATA interface cards will recognise optical drives, they will only support SSD/HDD drives. This also applied to PATA cards as well. This would be a limitation of the card, not Windows. It arises because the disks have no permanent data areas
 and are classified as removable.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You need to attach the optical drives to the on board interfaces with the SYBA card removed. Boot Windows and use Disk Manager to set the drive letter to a high value (I use X and Y). Then shut down, reinstall the card and attach your HDD drives to the card.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Boot and check the drive letter assignments in Disk Manager. Although the optical drives will have lower disk numbers the letter assignments will set the order in Explorer view.</p>

            <p>I believe others answered you, but&nbsp;just a general&nbsp;"for what it's worth"&nbsp;to anybody viewing, if your computer has various card readers, windows 7 won't show them (by default, you can change that) if there's nothing in the slots.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, you go to add a drive, and wonder why you can't assign a drive D.&nbsp; That's because drive D is actually taken by one on the card readers.&nbsp; That's why, as HairyFool said, it's generally a good idea to use higher (later?) letters when installing drives.</p>

<p>Note: If you are OverClocking or use any automatic overclocking or power saving BIOS features, start out by disabling them: Intel EIST, Turbo Mode, Cool and Quite&nbsp; and drop back to the stock speed as a starting point.</p>

Disconnect any other (additional) internal hard drives and external USB devices.<br />
Check for any loose hard drive power or SATA cables, Graphics card or other power cables.</p>
<p>First run Memtest86+:&nbsp; <br />
This runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or confirm if your one or more of your memory<br />
sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours (at least 3 full passes), if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />

Hard drive Testing:<br />
If you don't know your drives make and model, Try "Speccy",<br />
it provides System/computer Information in detail:<br />
OS, CPU, RAM, Motherboard, Graphics, Hard Drive, Optical Drive, Audio, Peripherals, Network.<br />
Note: RAM option will show number of slots, DRAM Timing,<br />

<p>Test your drive - Create a Bootable CD:<br />
Anywhere from 5 to 20%, (depending on the manufacture) of new hard drives are defective.
<br />
Test your drive using the drive manufacture's utility. <br />
If you have a new Seagate hard drive the very next thing would be to download Seagate's Seatools<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 causing excessive CPU heat while gaming &#40;BF4&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Prior to installing Windows 10 I was running Windows 7.&nbsp; CPU temperatures stayed&nbsp;well below 70C while playing BF4.&nbsp; After installing Windows 10, CPU temperatures reached as high as 77C while playing BF4 and making no other changes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is only 3 degrees from the max temperature of my CPU (FX 8350).&nbsp; This has caused my entire room to be overheated thanks to my tower becoming a space heater.&nbsp; It's so hot it hurts to touch the case.&nbsp; I'm worried it's a fire hazard now.&nbsp; What is going
 on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>CPU usage looks the same as always, about 60-70% while gaming on all 8 cores.&nbsp; Nothing is overclocked, and I even have a quality air cpu cooler installed.</p>

            <p>I am having issues as well with CPU spikes. I was using Windows 8.1 without any issues. I have an AMD quadcore A10 (FM2+ socket) with a GTX970 graphics card. I'm not using the onboard AMD 7850 graphics.
<br />
<br />
Running BF4 is a joke in Windows 10... unplayable. <br />
<br />
Battlefield 4 runs perfectly in Windows 8.1 and 7.<br />
</p>
<p>All drivers updated after upgrade, yada yada... CPU spikes at 100% and I start losing frames. This never happened prior to 10.<br />
<br />
Boo Windows 10 - What a disappointment. I have subsequently reinstalled my old version of Windows 8.1 on a separate drive. I'm having no issues. CPU runs in the 70 to 75% range. On 10 it runs much higher, as if the OS is simply not optimized the same.
<br />
<br />
What to do? <br />
<br />
Originally I was blaming NVidia, but the more I screw with this, the more issues I'm seeing with Windows being a giant resource hog and consuming all the CPU cycles.
<br />
I'm thinking I'll have to go modify my Amazon post since it seems to be the fault of Windows 10 instead.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course to make things even MORE irritating, if I DID go and upgrade my MB and CPU, Windows would complain that I was breaking their license agreement.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Windows 10 for being a giant FAILURE!<br />

            <p>I get about the same results with both Win7 and Win10 ( i5 3570 / GTX770)</p>
<p>BF4, depending on what's happening on a server with 60+ players, will hit 85 cpu use.</p>
<p>The max temp on the hottest cpu core (2) is 56C +/- (varies with ambient air temp, of course).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not all motherboards have specific Win10 chipset drivers, but I did install Win10 drivers on my AsRock MB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I did have to do some tweaks and run the Steam 'verify game cache' tool for some games, performance</p>
<p>between the two OS's is pretty much a case of -&nbsp; Six of one... Half dozen of the other.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Win10 is an 'upgrade' from an almost six year old Win7 install which has previously been cloned (three yrs ago)</p>
<p>from a machine with an AMD PhenomII 965 / GTX560ti to a machine with an Intel i5 3570 / HD7970
</p>
<p>(changed to a GTX770).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Not saying I don't ever have issues. PC's always have something stuffing up, and this is my second</p>
<p>attempt at Win10. </p>
<p>- I only ran the first one two weeks before reformatting that HDD. </p>
<p>Had the common Start Menu/Taskbar lockup issue, and the cumulative updates install/uninstall reboot loop issue,
</p>
<p>so I said 'stuff it', but couldn't resist trying again (don't like being beaten by the machine :D ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgraded again two weeks later, and then did the 1511 'update' maybe four weeks after that.</p>
<p>- R/click on the Taskbar File Explorer icon to select an item from the Jump List still hangs occasionally,
</p>
<p>Some games still show a message that the game had a problem and has to close - After I close the game.</p>
<p>This happen with Win7 occasionally, but far less often.</p>
<p>- There are a couple of other things with Win10 that I hate, and while DRM blocking does not affect me</p>
<p>(I've always used noCD's) I still reckon it is the worst, most dictatorial feature of Win10,
</p>
<p>and it's impost on Win7/8/8.1&nbsp; is even worse in some ways as it affects many unsuspecting innocent casual gamers who didn't ask for it, and get 'run as admin' error messages that send them on a wile goose chase.
</p>
<p>Nothing short of a sociopathic attitude from the MS Poobahs.</p>

            <p>UPDATE: Since the bottleneck seemed to be CPU usage, I've been on an epic hunt to get that under control, I found this tidbit of information about getting the CPU spiking down and it worked. (FYI - This did NOT fix my issue, btw). But it DID fix the CPU
 spiking:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The article below basically turns off some of Microsoft's crappy "screw your system" unhelpful memory stealing, CPU killing applications:
</p>
<p>http://fossbytes.com/how-to-fix-high-ram-and-cpu-usage-of-windows-10-system-ntoskrnl-exe-process/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Microsoft... ARG!!!! (Oh I dream of the day when Linux can run these games so I can totally DUMP Microsoft on my home systems and only have to choke them down at work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I don't have to pursue the issue of the spiking CPU, because turning this service off dropped my in-game CPU usage by from 100% to 85%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the result is that my FPS went from 25 to 35. Now I'm back to figuring out why my $350 video card can't run the game, because YES, it's unplayable. I'm thinking it's a crappy GTX-970 video driver, but this is a guess.<br />
<br />
So the current solution for gamers is: DON'T USE WINDOWS 10, unless you can rollback to your previous operating system. This is the way I see it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no, I don't have malware, bla bla bla on the machine. No I haven't installed anything stupid. I do technology for a living, and I've built 500+ machines. This is a Windows 10 / NVidia Driver issue.
<br />
<br />
Note: Chipset drivers are up to date. </p>

<p>After reinstalling Windows yesterday, I have about 80 updates to install. After the download screen is displays a message saying that ALL 80 UPDATES failed with an error code of "800FFFF"<br />
<br />
I've looked at troubleshooting options, the problem is NONE of the troubleshooters will open, not even Microsoft Fix It.<br />
<br />
All I wanted to do was install NET framework 4.0 but it failed due to a catastrophic error and now I'm stuck...<br />

            Hello<br />
<br />
I'm not the same person that wrote on Jan 7, but I am having a similar issue.&nbsp; This is the second time I've encountered this error code, 800FFFF.&nbsp; Last time it happened (after installing some software from Best Buy), not only did I receive this message, but
 many of my documents were inaccessible with "insufficient access".&nbsp; I ended up having to re-build my home built system.&nbsp; Now it has happened again out of the blue.&nbsp; Updates were working for 2 weeks after my last re-build and then all of a sudden, they didn't.&nbsp;
 I've tried uninstalling recent software and fixes around that time, but to no avail.&nbsp; Thus, I'm here looking for support.&nbsp; Answers to the questions:<br />
<br />
1. Home built computer from 2010 with windows 7 Pro<br />
<br />
2. Yes &amp; Windows 7 Pro 64 bit<br />
<br />
3. Norton Security Suite with Constant Guard (offered from Comcast)<br />
<br />
4. No pre-installs<br />
<br />

<h2>            Importing photos from a folder &#40;not a card&#41;</h2>
                    I am using a single onedrive folder to upload photos taken from our families iphones so I can go through them and decide which ones to keep. I want to be able to then import them into the normal folder structure which happens automatically when you import
 from a memory card. Is there anyway to "import" photos from a local folder?

            Hi Dav1d,
<br />
<br />In Windows File Explorer, you can simply copy the photos from that folder into the OneDrive folder manually by dragging the photos into the OneDrive Folder

            Thanks for the reply. I didnt explain the question clearly. I am trying to automatically copy the photos (of multiple dates) into the existing My Pictures folder and put them into separate date folders. This is what happens when you plug in an SD card.
 I am trying to replicate that but from a local folder not an SD card

            If you want to automate you will need to use a Powershell script to do this.
<br />Below is a link to a technet script that you can download and tweak it to work for you.
<br />Other than that it is like Dave suggested, drag and drop.
<br />Hope this helps.

Also do this so you can see the likely bluescreens.<br />
<br />
Windows Vista automatically restarts if your PC encounters an error that causes it
<br />
to crash. (also Windows 7&nbsp;and 8)<br />
<a href="http://www.winvistatips.com/disable-automatic-restart-t84.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.winvistatips.com/disable-automatic-restart-t84.html</span></a><br />
<br />
====================================================<br />
<br />
This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</p>
<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs can also cause
<br />
these issues.&nbsp;Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check
<br />
in Windows Updates to&nbsp;see if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This <br />
could also be caused by a loose card&nbsp;or cable and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control
<br />
Panel -&nbsp;Device Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - <br />
double click Display&nbsp;Adapter - NIC and WIFI - Sound and others - Power <br />
Management tab - uncheck Allow&nbsp;computer to turn off power. Maybe only one <br />
has an issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>(Use RUN&nbsp;instead of Start - Search as used on Vista or Windows 7)<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in MSCONFIG.exe<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, <br />
Sound, or......(and it still could be video interacting with something else). <br />
See&nbsp;troubleshooter link&nbsp;above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. <br />
Also check with MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can analyze it.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update your major drivers <br />
and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set
<br />
VIEW&nbsp;to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names. <br />
(Also update&nbsp;the BIOS and&nbsp;chipset drivers.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created
 the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.&nbsp;Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version
 info. Now click&nbsp;UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right&nbsp;Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device&nbsp;Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually&nbsp;shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers&nbsp;particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure
 it is installed and repeat as&nbsp;needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check&nbsp;manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I meant to include these in the original reply (it has been edited to include them).<br />
<br />
We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the SkyDrive or other file
<br />
sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps copy
<br />
them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there. (This is NOT<br />
likely to help a lot on a new build).<br />
<br />
Zip or upload the contents of C:\Windows\minidump&nbsp; (Only AFTER you have performed<br />
all the initial suggestions at the top of this reply and IF the BSOD issues persist).
<p>Use SkyDrive to upload collected files<br />

<h2>            Caution ATI&#47;AMD Radeon 3000 Windows 10 Upgraders</h2>
                    <p>AMD&nbsp;is apparently not updating older drivers. I used their auto-detect tool, and it said there is not an available driver. As a result, I cannot maximize the resolution on my display, there's a lovely 2" band running around all edges of the display after
 upgrading to Windows 10. Thanks, AMD. Guess it's time to think about upgrading hardware now. &nbsp;</p>

            <p><span><span>Hello,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let us know what is the make and model of the computer?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check what happens in different web browsers, you may check in other web browsers apart from your default web browser. Check if the issue occurs in the other web browsers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To resolve this issue
</span><span>make sure to run the ATI/AMD Radeon 3000 driver in compatibility mode for your earlier Operating System. For example if you upgraded from Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, you may run the driver in compatibility mode
 for Windows 8 or Windows 8.1.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do so you may follow the steps as per the following Microsoft Article:
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</span></a></span><br />
<span><br />
In case the compatibility mode as suggested above does not work contact AMD Support. Check the following link for support options:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amd.com/en-us/who-we-are/contact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.amd.com/en-us/who-we-are/contact</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the above steps help.

<p>sorry folks.&nbsp; you need to purchase a new graphics card as AMD is unwilling to make any Windows 10 certified drivers for the ATI/AMD Radeon 3000 graphics (whether desktop or laptop/mobile).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too have an ASUS M5A78L-M LE/USB3 board with onboard ATI 3000 graphics and the latest driver version I can use there on Win10 is v8.970.100.9001 dated 1/13/2015 (a Windows Update based driver).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check out this Computerhope forum topic "Windows 10 Discontinued Driver AMD ATI RADEON 3000" and see if you guys want to buy a new video card or not to replace the onboard ATI 3000 graphics hardware:</p>

<p>
</p><p>For me, I am considering installing a higher graphics card; anything better than the Radeon 3000.</p>

<p>This may help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After W10 "Update" some time ago my display went crazy: screen panes froze, changed colours, when dragged left thousands of copies across the display etc etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My six year old HP desktop has a Radeon graphics card. Apparently AMD are not supporting it but have a pro-bono driver to cope with this problem - it's:</p>
<p>
</p><p>non-whql-64bit-nieg-radeon-crimson-16.2.1-win10-win8.1-win7-feb27.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>on their website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found that it works fine and the display is as it should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, occasionally and especially after a booting, the display goes wonky again EVEN THOUGH THE DRIVER HAS LOADED&nbsp; during the reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely, going to Devices &gt; diplay adapters &gt; and selecting the Radeon driver then DISABLING it - yes, DISabling it! - makes everything come good again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Loading the Crimson driver seems to reset everything the way W10 expects, then diabling it gets rid of whatever causes the issues while leaving the bits working as they should.</p>

            I now have this problem after the build 1709 update this morning. The problem is with the graphics driver, yet the directions you gave are for running compatibility mode on a program. It's not a program, it's a driver - how do you set a driver to run in
 compatibility mode?<br />
<br />
I have an ATI Radeon 3000, which is NOT supported by AMD anymore (and I've only had it 18 months!). So far it's looking like I'm going to have to revert to my last build, save the driver, update again, and install the saved driver. Since it's build 1709 which
 has caused the issue, can you look into the problem with build 1709? Not really happy about the amount of work this is going to cause (working for the last 18 months, then all of a sudden broken this morning after the update).

<p>Same as donaldnp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked reasonably OK until today.&nbsp; Now Windows 10 won't recognize a second monitor and gives only 3 resolution settings.&nbsp; For a graphics card that's not really old the lack of support from ATI/AMD and MS is pathetic.</p>
