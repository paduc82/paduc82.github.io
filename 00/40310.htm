    <title>After windows 10 install and update PC will shutdown but then restarts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julian clarke  say:</h3>
<h2>            After windows 10 install and update PC will shutdown but then restarts automatically after about 5 minutes switched off. How do I cure this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo Desktop, recently upgraded from Windows 8.1 Prop to Windows 10 Pro. As a matter of course, I update regularly and since a recent update I have found it impossible to keep my PC switched off without using the power button after closedown.</p>
<p>The PC appears to shutdown normally, but after about 5 minutes, restarts itself - as if a delayed restart is taking place but there has been absolutely no activity during the intervening period.</p>
<p>I have already tried uninstalling Windows 10 and reinstalling it - which worked for a while, until once again an update was installed.</p>
<p>I have tried uninstalling the updates but this does not seem to help.</p>
<p>I am reluctant to re-install Windows 10 again but fear this may be my only option.</p>
<p>Does anyone ahve any ideas what might be causing this and how it can be prevented?</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation.</p>

            <p>Hi Amit,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply, unfortunately neither solutions has worked - having returned to normal the problem remains.</p>
<p>In answer to your 2 questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>the issue only arose after I upgraded to Windows 10 - I didn't have any problems with previous versions of windows (7, 8 or 8.1) and I haven't made any other changes to the PC or software running on it;</li><li>there are no external devices plugged into the PC - I have a wifi connection to a Brother printer scanner but have had that running on the PC for over a year without problems.</li></ul>
<p>Is this a common fault with windows 10? I haven't heard of it before and am struggling to understand how the PC could restart automatically after a period of time during which it has apparently been completely shut down - presumably the Power Off link on
 the windows start screen is not doing what it says for my PC - is this correct?</p>
<p>If I power off with the button on the case after signing out will this do any damage? I was once told to press and hold the power button but only from a cold restart. I need to be able to fully shutdown.</p>
<p>Thanks for any furtehr help you can give me.</p>
<p />

            Hi OK.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you sure it hasn't created a shortcut there?  What happens if you hover your mouse or try to click on it.
<br />
<br />If not I'd just change the Theme at Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Themes.  
<br />
<br />You could use this as the chance to sample some of the spectacular free Windows 10 Theme slideshow packages which include some of the most expensive scenic pictures ever taken, downloaded from the Store here:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collections/windowsthemes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collectio...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails then Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Action Center does not detect Kaspersky antivirus</h2>
                    <p>This is really ridiculous. I am currently running Windows 8.1 64-bit. I have never ever gotten a message from the Action Center before that my Virus Scan software, anti-spyware and firewall are all inactive. I take a look at my Kaspersky Security Suite and
 it tells me that it is protecting me. This all started yesterday when I ventured out to the library yesterday to start some studies. I connected to the Library Public Wi-fi without even visiting any web pages, and then all of a sudden the Action center message
 appeared. I quickly disconnected from the library public Wifi (do have Kaspersky you know) ran a virus scan whilst disconnected from all wifis, and no Virus or Malware was found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon seeing this, I reboot my computer decided to log onto a tethered smartphone connection encrypted with WPA2 with AES. The same message appears again from the action center. Till today, it is still on. What I am saying is that Microsoft needs to think
 about its customers first before working with any criminal agency. Here is a picture as proof.</p>

<h2>            Windows update error&#58; Synaptics - Pointing Drawing - Synaptics SMBus TouchPad - Error 0x80248007</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep getting this error when running windows update : "Synaptics - Pointing Drawing - Synaptics SMBus TouchPad - Error 0x80248007"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried removing a every driver that uses a synaptic device - but still - it keeps giving back errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One suggestion I found was this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html</a></p>
<p>to reset the whole windows update data/configuration - but I am afraid that this may break even more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do now, or is there a way to hide only this update?</p>
<p>I have tried to do this with the <a href="https://www.petri.com/manage-windows-updates-with-powershell-module" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PSwindowsupdate</a> - but this update does not appear anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Since the driver is affecting the Windows update, we suggest that you try to roll back the driver to it's previous version and check if it there will be any changes. Here are the steps to roll back a driver:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click on the Windows icon and select <strong>Device Manager.</strong></li><li>Right click on the device for which you want to roll back to the previous version of the driver, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Drivers </strong>tab.</li><li>Click <strong>Roll back Driver</strong>.</li><li>In the Driver Package roll back dialog box, click <strong>Yes</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you run the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/512a5183-ffab-40c5-8a68-021e32467565/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Unable to connect, detect, remove bluetooth mouse - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to connect, detect, remove bluetooth mouse</h2>
                    I have a bluetooth mouse that shows up in Devices and Printers but I cannot connect to it.
<div>This is what I have tried.</div>
<div>1. I tried searching (Add a device) and made the mouse discoverable/visible. Windows did not detect it.</div>
<div>2. I removed the mouse from devices and printers. Restarted laptop, and again tried step 1, still windows did not find it.</div>
<div>3. When in device manager I scan for hardware changes, it automatically adds the mouse to devices and printers. I am not able to uninstal this mouse from my system.</div>
<div>4. I viewed the hidden devices in device manager and removed the mouse, and all bluetooth HID devices, even Bluetooth enumerator. Then I restarted. I tried step one again. Windows did not detect it. When i scan for changes in device manager it add the
 mouse again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I cant figure out how to remove this mouse. I think if can remove it from the registry or somewhere, I can add it again. So I'm unable to remove it or connect to it.</div>
<div>I have been using bluetooth devices for a long time time now. I know that to connect/pair the device, it has to be visible. The mouse is also fine, I can connect it to other systems, I can use it even with my mobile phone.</div>

            <blockquote>Has that same issue with the same mouse. Somehow, found that using Local System account indicates that the Bluetooth service has started, but it does not seem to work. I changed to Local Service as user to start the Bluetooth
 Support Service and voilà. Everywhere it is documented to change to Local System account, and this does not work! It did not even detect my BB phone! Now everything is fine with Local Service.&nbsp;</blockquote>

<h2>            &#39;Access Denied&#39; on previously accessible encrypted files</h2>
                    <div>Hello all,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 8 about a month ago. I&nbsp;encrypted&nbsp;3 folders and created a backup key. I was able to access all three with no problem until yesterday. I tried to open a file from 'Folder1' in Adobe and it gave me an&nbsp;access&nbsp;denied message.
 I tried an Excel file 'Cannot Access...document may be read-only or encrypted' followed by another message '...cannot be accessed. The file may be corrupted, located on a server that is not responding, or read only.' This is true of&nbsp;encrypted&nbsp;'Folder2' as
 well, but not&nbsp;encrypted&nbsp;'Folder3' which I can access with no problem as before. It may be worth noting that I encrypted 'Folder3' at a different time than 'Folder1' and 'Folder2', though everything was done under the same primary,&nbsp;administrative&nbsp;user account.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have already taken the following actions</div>
<div>1. Removing the read-only attribute from 'Folder1' making sure to&nbsp;propagate&nbsp;changes to all files and subfolders - the attribute&nbsp;remained&nbsp;the same, no error messages though.</div>
<div>2. De-encrypting 'Folder1' also&nbsp;propagating&nbsp;to files and subfolders- the folder itself turned black (un-encrypted), but all the files remain green and&nbsp;inaccessible.</div>
<div>3. Tried to de-encrypt individual files in 'Folder1' - access is denied</div>
<div>3. Checked the permissions for every group listed plus effective access on both files and folders and found 'Full Control' granted and no denies listed&nbsp;anywhere.</div>
<div>4. Created another user account which denied access to 'Folder1', 'Folder2', AND 'Folder3' even though I granted administratively myself full control under the new account.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone have any suggestions?</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Caps Lock is On message remains in center of screen</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP All in One desktop with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the PC starts, a rectangle message appears in the middle of the screen saying "Caps Lock is On". This message remains on the screen and half the time, I can't make the message go away. Sometimes I can touch the box and the message goes away, other
 times, the message remains in the center of the screen and on top of all the other windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not press the caps lock key. The message just appears on it's own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I keep this message from appearing?</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
It is an automatic method of checking the hard drive.<br />
<br />
It can be Enabled in the BIOS (Setup/Settings as you boot up so watch the screen for<br />
the keys).<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker's Support (Motherboard Maker for custom systems), <br />
their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums (if any),<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

    <title>W10 SCREEN RESOLUTION - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> louis james  say:</h3>
<h2>            W10 SCREEN RESOLUTION</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><strong>I AM HAVING THE SAME ISSUE; W10 SCREEN RESOLUTION.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ALL of a SUDDEN, since a few days ago, my screen resolution went SMALLER. I did what I remember on how to change it back, but to NO AVAIL. SEEMS like&nbsp;about a week ago, MS&nbsp;updated their OUTLOOK, which I use w/both HOTMAIL. Perhaps when this happened,
 something else went wrong. I CANNOT GET my screen resolution back to "RECOMMENED" size. It goes back to a "1", which makes my print smaller to read, and not on the RECOMMENDED scale. I read quite a bit of info on the forum, regarding my issue, but it just
 does not compute w/my computer. My HP is an original W10 and has been working fine, until a newer version of OUTLOOK 'suddenly' appeared in my W10. I did the test&nbsp;that is recommended on fixing, but it still does not work.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">THIS MAY BE AN ISSUE FOR A MS PROGRAMMER (S).</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>THANKS, NEED HELP.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Hey there Parallel!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to sign into Live with your 360.
</p>
<p>I split your comment into it's own thread so that we can help tailor support to your situation's need.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you're having this problem but do you mind telling us if you've tried any troubleshooting steps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are getting these weird errors while signing in, it could be&nbsp;a problem with a recent update or your account itself, I would try to remove and redownload your account if you haven't already as outlined in
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-profile-xbox-360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to add or remove an Xbox profile on Xbox 360</a>. If that does not help, then it would probably be best for you to try and roll back your console updates like denoted in

<p>
</p><p>If and when you get a chance, give those steps a shot and let us know how that helped.

<h2>            &#40;0xc0150004&#41; Error will be the death of me</h2>
                    <p>Hello All</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks ahead for any responses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So essentially I am unsure what actually happened. All I know is that I am now unable to open anything I download from chrome to firfox to the media creation tool. It will download but once I go to open the file I am told the application will not open and
 I get that error message. Then I got a 101 blue screen error and was forced to erase all my applications. This at least got me back to the home screen. I still could not open any new downloaded files then I did a clean system reboot erased all my personal
 files after backing everything up of course. Still no dice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It feels like I am locked out of my computer.&nbsp;<span> I did a chkdsk to see if I has any disk errors and there was one .mui file. So to see further I did a sfc/scannow. It found a few errors it could not fix.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be apricated. I did contact support who stated that I just need to update by downloading and installing the media creation tool however every time I do to open it by saying yes I get that error message that the application could not open the
 file. I am at my wits end. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi BB&gt;  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Can you get into Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode accessed by one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a> ?
<br />
<br />If not can you get into Repair Mode by one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a> ?
<br />
<br />If so try to System Restore to a point before the Problem happened, or if that fails do a Reset.  
<br />
<br />You may need to create bootable media to access Repair Mode or do the Clean install:
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then System Restore.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.  
<br />
<br />If you have files that aren't backed up you can use the same bootable media to try to rescue your files using this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            batch files to copy file with date extension - doesn&#39;t work in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>In XP, I had a batch file to copy files every day and rename them with the date, like:</p>

<p>Project_Tracker_Copy_2012_01_17.mdb&nbsp; - it would put the current day in YYYY_MM_DD format</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>next day, via scheduler, it would run the batch and I'd end up with </p>

<h2>            Family Accounts&#58; Cannot link to my family&#39;s accounts &#40;Website not issuing email invite&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having real difficulties setting up Family Accounts. A more detailed summary of my issues are set out in the link below (hopefully that is public), and so far (3 months), Microsoft seem to be simply ignoring me. Does anybody know how I can resolve this
 - or at least where the problem might be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/family-accounts-cannot-link-to-my-familys-accounts/bf2859e0-bfe4-46a4-9d27-66126a93b9ec</p>
<p>
</p><p>The text of the first post is: Ihave set up three MS Accounts. My account (let's say "NJ"), and two for each of my children (let's call them "1" and "2"). I control the email accounts for all three accounts (all of the type *** Email address is removed for privacy ***), each with
 the respective name for the MS account holder. The dates of births for all three accounts are correct (NJ is an adult, 1 and 2 are both entered with birthdates that make them less than 10 years old)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, I cannot set up a Family group.&nbsp;I log in to my account, navigate to the "Family" section, seek to add a new child, enter the email address that is linked to their MS account, and the browser updates to advise that an invitation has been
 issued to the child by email. The reality is that NO email is being issued... and as such the accounts remain unlinked / not in a family group (for the avoidance of doubt, spam filters are turned off, the mail is not going into a junk folder, and even through
 a browser based mail client, no email is there).&nbsp;I have waited at least 24 hours, as suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried removing each of my children and re-adding them. I have tried logging in to my children's accounts and linking with me as an adult (same thing happens). I have tried 3 different browsers on one computer, and 2 on another computer. I have spent
 an inordinate amount of time on MS LiveChat, phone lines, remote access and with emails..... and after over 2 weeks of relatively constant attempts, I seem to be no further forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The purpose for wanting to set up Family Groups is, in the first instance at least, around an Xbox One that they received at Christmas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody help me to resolve this please?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

                    <p>Bonjours a tous,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Je rencontre depuis une semaine un problème, en effet, lorsque je lance un <span>
matchmaking dans </span>PUBG, celui ci cherche et ne trouve rien pendant plus d'une demi heure. pire lorsque je lance titanfall 2 le jeux multijoueur m'indique que "jeu en ligne non autorisé avec ce profil". Lorsque je veux lancer une campagne solo sur ce titre,
 un ecran de chargement indéfini apparait alors que lorsque je déconnecte ma console d'internet, aucun problème, l'écran de chargement dure quelques minutes et le jeu se lance sans problème. Je peux également jouer a d'autre jeux multi sans problème tel que
 sea of thieves ou battlefield 1... J'ai déjà essayé tout les tests internet, multijoueur et NAT. J'ai également essayer de désinstaller/réinstaller les jeux, supprimer/récupérer mon profil ainsi que supprimer l'adresse MAC et relancer ma console. Je signale
 également que j'ai essayer de jouer a ces jeux sur une autre Xbox avec mon profil, je peux y jouer sans aucun probléme. Je suis à court d'idée, j'en appel donc a vous!!!</p>
