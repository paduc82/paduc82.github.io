<h2>            Trying to install microsoft office 2016 brings error message 30175-11</h2>
                    <p>I've got a brand new install of Windows 7 I'm trying to install Office 2016 onto.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing installed so far but the operating system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Trying to install Office 2016 causes the error message 30175-11 to appear.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've run the uninstall fixit for 2016 which says that the click-to-serve is installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fixit uninstalls this,
 I know it's worked because if I run the uninstall fixit again it says no Office products are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone through the list of things on Google to try which includes me turning off Windows Defender, I've checked I'm not on a proxy, I've tried installing in another location and finally I've downloaded the offline install package.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've also double checked
 that no version of office is installed by going through the manual uninstall instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite all of this, the installer still causes the 30175-11 error message to appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an idea which isn't one of the above on how to get Office installed on a brand new Windows 7 install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for everyone who suggests upgrading to Windows 10, work use 7 and they have some software which only works on 7, so I'll be sticking with that until work upgrade to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I tried that and it got to the same 40-51% complete mark it had failed at before. &nbsp; I kept trying the install/clean and once got it to go as far as 91% before it failed with the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there details somewhere of what it's trying to do at 91%?</p>

            <p>Fixed it on my own eventually.&nbsp;&nbsp; For anyone who Googles the problem and ends up here...</p>
<p>I had two services which were popping up in the error log</p>
<p>Windows Search</p>
<p>Diagnostics Tracking Service</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running</p>
<p>WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diagcab</p>
<p>(which you can search for and get the latest version of) fixed Windows Search.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this was an unrelated problem but I'm not sure so I'll include it here</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I think was the main problem was </p>
<p>Diagnostics Tracking Service</p>
<p>This is Windows Update KB3022345 and wasn't showing in</p>
<p>Programs and Features</p>
<p>View installed updates</p>
<p>but was listed in service manager as </p>
<p>Automatic (Delayed start)</p>
<p>but which wouldn't start on it's own and wouldn't start manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled it the service and the install worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Diagnostics Tracking Service is a data mining service that sends stuff about your computer to Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people think it's evil, some don't care, that's for you to decide.</p>
<p>

            <p>This is not helpful in the slightest, that uninstall tool was one that I tried and didn't work, as I said.</p>
<p>I couldn't do a clean install as there was nothing installed to uninstall.</p>
<p>Thanks for not reading anything but the headline and answering the question by saying do the things I'd already done which didn't work.</p>

            <p>Hello MeidaBrainers,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your inquiry. When is comes to the product ads there are requirements for pricing options. I can provide you with general details regarding the requirement of pricing in the feed file. This information can be found in our article titles
<a href="http://help.bingads.com/#apex/3/en/51084/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How a feed file is organized.</a>&nbsp;I have also listed the information below. </p>
<ul>
<li>The price from the landing page of your offer must be the same price as indicated in the feed.
</li><li>For the US, exclude tax in the price. For the UK, include any value added tax (VAT) in the price. See
<a href="http://help.bingads.com/#apex/3/en/56731/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Bing Merchant Center catalog tax policy</span></a> for more details.
</li><li>Uploading an item for the first time will be pending review until the price has been successfully reviewed. Updating the price of an existing item will be reverted to the pending review status until it has been processed again. The pricing update can take
 up to 6 hours to process. </li><li>For mobile devices or tablets, the price can be 0, as the subsidized price with a contract is allowed. For such items, you must include the phrase "only with contract" (or similar) in the title with the product_category value of "Electronics &gt; Communications
 &gt; Telephony &gt; Mobile Phones" (267) for mobile devices or "Electronics &gt; Computers &gt; Tablet Computers" (4745) for tablets.</li><li>For mobile devices or tablets, the price can be 0 when payment options with multiple installments are allowed (US only). For such items, you must include the phrase "with installment plan" (or similar) in the title with the product_category value of "Electronics
 &gt; Communications &gt; Telephony &gt; Mobile Phones" (267) for mobile devices or "Electronics &gt; Computers &gt; Tablet Computers" (4745) for tablets.</li></ul>
<p>I will be more than happy to review information regarding a particular product. Would you like to provide the details regarding what type of product you are questioning?</p>

<h2>            JPG attachment not showing in Outlook but can see in OWA</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>We are using Outlook 2003 and 2007 clients on Exchange 2007 Server. We have XP svcpk3 and Windows 7 users. We are experiencing an issue when we send an MMS text from a phone(AT&amp;T) with a JPG image attached to it. Outlook clients cannot see the attachment,
 nor can we do a "save attachments", but if we look at the properties of the email message it says their is an attachment. Also if I print the email message the image does not print but it shows "attachments:_preview_.jpeg" in the header.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If we open OWA we can see the attachments just fine.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If we forward the message from Outlook to other Outlook users we still have the same issue. So I don't think its the AT&amp;T or phones.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I have tried setting the Outlook settings that say "download pictures from internet" and everything else I can think of, but still no fix.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>I am certain that it is an Outlook setting/security issue.. just can't figure out what. I have seen similar posts on this regarding "embedded images not showing, but this is not that issue. These images are not embedded.</p>
<p>We use Trendmicro antivirus clients, and I have ruled that out.</p>
<p>I have users with IE7 and IE8 and that does not seem to be the issue.</p>

<h2>            Dialog boxes open between monitors and behind taskbar</h2>
                    <p>In excel, dialog boxes always open split between my two monitors.&nbsp; You always have to move it on to one screen to see it well.&nbsp; Can't these pop up on one screen or the other?&nbsp; Having half a dialog box between two screens is silly enough, but I keep my start
 menu snapped to the right of my main monitor which is on the left.&nbsp; This makes this behavior extra annoying, as the dialog box appears behind the taskbar.&nbsp; Unlike normal windows, dialog boxes never remember their position.</p>

            OK.&nbsp; well I guess it just has to do with the fact I was working in the far left cell, and trying to edit that hyperlink using the right click menu.&nbsp; if you just click the hyperlink button (or others) on the ribbon it works as expected.

<h2>            Tap to Pay on Mobile</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>So it's been a year since Microsoft actually had a Wallet on Windows 10 Mobile that could do tap to pay. Years after everyone else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How has it progressed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well it's still US Only and nowhere else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft claim they want to get back into mobile. The first step is compelling apps that people use in their daily lives. Unless a key issue like mobile payment is addressed they remain one million miles from the starting line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; • How do I uninstall Internet Explorer 9 Release Candidate?<br />

<p>Does the behavior persist if you uninstall IE9 RC, reboot twice and do NOT reinstall it?</p>

<p>Thanks, Robert, but I don't want to uninstall IE9 RC, I just want to disable the, in my opinion, annoying and redundant prompt if I want to open or save a downloaded file.</p>

<p>Part of your beta testing is seeing if IE9 RC uninstalls properly. If it does and the behavior still persists, we'd have a better idea of what to check/look for next to resolve your problem.</p>
<p>Suit yourself.</p>
<p>[There was an MS MVP program in '94? Thought it started a few years later.]</p>

<p>IE9 RC uninstalls fine. But what has uninstalling to do with a typical IE9 RC feature, I wonder? I guess, that I didn't make myself clear enough describing the problem. So lemme try again :)</p>
<p>When I attempt to download a file from a website using IE9 RC, at the bottom of the (IE9 RC) screen a prompt shows up, asking me whether I want to open or save the file I just downloaded. I'd like to get rid of this 'feature' as I don't like it at all.</p>
<p>When I uninstall IE9 RC, of course, this feature doesn't show up in IE8 as IE8 works without the mentioned alert.</p>
<p>In 1994 the MVP program was kicked off, I was one of the first to be part of it.</p>

<p><br />
Please answer all of the following diagnostic questions by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. Have&nbsp;you uninstalled IE9 RC and are you currently running IE8?</p>
<p>2. Did you upgrade to Win7, was Win7 preinstalled when you bought the computer, or did you do a clean install?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?<br />

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit</a></p>
<p>2. Is it a Win7 64-bit computer?</p>
<p>3a. What anti-virus application or security suite is installed and is your subscription current?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>3b. Were any of these applications running in the background when you installed and/or uninstalled IE9 RC?</p>
<p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> ever been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>6. Is the computer currently fully-patched at Windows Update?</p>
<p>&nbsp; • How can I tell if my computer is up to date?<br />

            You answerd with a question. It was&nbsp;a simple question that has nothing to do with your question.&nbsp; I guess you don't know how to disable "do you want to save or open this file" message in IE9&nbsp;that appears everytime you try to download something.

            Carol this issue is such a pain.&nbsp; I had that occur so many times thgat the frustration level was intense.&nbsp; I took the advice of a friend that has worked out to be the best alternative solution.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I now use tasks for my notes and have created a category called Notes.&nbsp; It works perfectly and I have had NO ISSUES at all.&nbsp; I still use notes but DO NOT sync them with my PC but rather use them for temporary reminders when using my device.&nbsp; It works!

<h2>            Invisible Track Changes in Word 2003</h2>
                    
<p>I have a document in Word 2003 that contains what appear to be hidden track changes markings.&nbsp; When this document is opened up from the network it looks like there are no track changes yet you can navigate to each of them using the track changes toolbar.&nbsp;
 When the document is emailed to an outside recipient the track changes markings show up in grey.</p>
<p>I've checked the track changes setting in Tools | Options and they appear to be set properly (red strikethrough/blue underline) and any new changes show those markings.&nbsp; The view is also set to "Final With Markup".&nbsp; The only way to see the grey markings
 is to email it to an external email address.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on what these "hidden" markings are and how to avoid them in the future as you can realize that can be very dangerous if you're sending a document to an adverse party, etc. and all of a sudden all the changes are showing up.</p>

    <title>Bulk printing of password protected Word documents - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erikdrakin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bulk printing of password protected Word documents</h2>
                    <p>I have thousands of Word documents on my server that are each protected by the same password. &nbsp;They aren't highly sensitive materials--the password protection just helps our small office avoid editing a template or form without actually intending to do so.
 &nbsp;In any event, I often need to print a series of about 10 documents. &nbsp;I highlight them in explorer, right click, and select "print". &nbsp;I then have to type in the password or click "read only" once for each and every document. &nbsp;Is there a better way of handling
 this, or am I stuck with the mess of a system we've created here? &nbsp;I would love to avoid having to click "read only" 100 times per day just to print documents. &nbsp;Thank you in advance for your time and thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS - We run Windows 7 Professional with Office 2013.</p>

            <p>in order to be able to perform table manipulations several features would be required that are currently not in Office for Mac.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Excel ODBC add-in. &nbsp;This add-in provided the added functionality you are seeking, but the add-in has not been updated since Excel version 5. The old add-in does not work with Excel 2011.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Read/write ODBC drivers. The current ODBC drivers from Actual Technologies are read-only. I am pretty sure the drivers from OpenLink are also read-only. This makes a chicken vs egg problem where Microsoft can't build an ODBC add-in unless there's a driver,
 and the driver makers can't make a read/write driver unless there's an ODBC add-in.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. Enough customers wanting to make resolving #1 and #2 economically feasible for Microsoft would need to be in existence. The way to let Microsoft know you want to see #1 and #2 resolved is to tell them by using the feedback web form you will find using
 Excel Help menu's Send Feedback option.</p>

<p>Greetings subhasganguly!&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Owners Circle forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WM device sales are limited to specific&nbsp;geographic areas with an appropriate language for that area.&nbsp; Unfortunately, you are not able to change the language of a device at a later time.&nbsp; So if you bought your device in France, then you'll only
 ever be able to use the French language on that device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This causes any number of problems for those users who buy a device on vacation and learn later (much to their surprise) that they are unable to change the language.&nbsp; As you were not aware of this fact, I can only suggest that you speak to a
 representative of your Wireless provider [Orange] and see if they would be willing to exchange your unit for another that carries a license for an English speaking country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry that I am not able to provide a more positive response.&nbsp;&nbsp; Best of luck in your endeavors!</p>

    <title>Groove Music not displaying any album artwork, but reading Tags - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Groove Music not displaying any album artwork, but reading Tags</h2>
                    <p>Hello<br />
<br />
I have been using Groove Music for more than a year, and I never had an album artwork issue that a relaunch wouldn't sort out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, last week, I started to notice that, as I added some new songs, Groove failed to add any music art. I reloaded the entire music library into Groove, and now it is not showing any art at all, even on those songs that previously had artwork showing
 properly!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Groove reads the Tag data (made with Mp3Tag) properly (album name, artist, track all are read), but it fails to import the artwork. WMP does not have this issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have turned off the Automatic tag finding feature, as I don't want it to modify anything. I tried turning it on, still didn't find the album art.</p>
<p>I have also tried deleting the Image cache and Database in Users/AppData...Microsoft.Zune, and still nothing.<br />
</p>

            Here are some solutions you can try:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/musicandvideo/forum/all/groove-does-not-display-any-album-or-artist-art/a9f3b2ba-aec8-4caa-8229-acd2d4d75009">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/musicandvid...</a>
<br />
<br />I would also try launching Windows Media Player, try updating the album art work through that program then see if it does the same in Groove.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting Groove to see if it resolves the problem. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />		Scroll down to Groove
<br />		Select it
<br />		Click Advanced options
<br />		Click Reset
<br />
<br />		Restart
<br />
<br />		Check the Store for updates

            I tried all your suggestions, and only Resetting Groove partially worked, but that is because it started downloading artwork from online (incorrect artwork) for whatever it could find.

            Hi Ariel,
<br />
<br />Sorry the solution was not successful in resolving your problem.
<br />
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />At the prompt, type the following:
<br />Get-AppxPackage *zunemusic* | Remove-AppxPackage 
<br />
<br />Restart then redownload Groove from the Microsoft Store:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/groove-music/9wzdncrfj3pt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/groove-music/...</a>
<br />
<br />But, if the above does not work...
<br />
<br />I would also recommend you file a bug report; send me the short link so I can vote on it and bring it to the attention of the Groove engineers.
<br />

<h2>            Excel cells don&#96;t calculate my formulas</h2>
                    I am using Excel 2011 for Mac and for some reason most of the times when I write a formula I can't see the result on the cell. I only get the text I wrote. When I evaluate the formula all the values are OK and even when I am writing it Excel identifies
 the formula and highlights the fields I should be filling. This doesn't seem to happen in older versions of Excel. Anyone been here before? I appreciate any help.

    <title>Where is my music&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rosi.a  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is my music&#63;</h2>
                    I connected my Lumia 920 to my computer, successfully copied music from iTunes with Windows Explorer (WinXP)&nbsp;to the phone but music+videos is empty. Keeps telling my "It's lonely here. Connect to your computer....blah, blah." The music I copied is not
 DRM protected and it shows up in Windows Explorer; it's there.&nbsp;I copied the music to the phone's "Music", "Album" folder so&nbsp;it would know exactly where to look.&nbsp; Actually, it doesn't matter where I copy the music to, the phone just does not find my music.
 What am I missing?

            Thank you for responding.&nbsp;I use the iTunes app to get music from CDs I purchase onto my iPod.&nbsp; I'm not trying to transfer songs purchased in the iTunes Store.&nbsp;My music is
<u>not</u> DRM protected, therefore, I believe DRM can be eliminated as the issue. You mention adding the music to the "Music" folder - did that, same disappointing outcome. Such a dilemma. I wonder if this is a bug. Of course, who knows if it's an OS bug,
 a hardware bug or a MS doesn't like Apple.....

            <p>I have not seen this problem, here or on the Nokia forum.</p>
<p>If you PC is Win7 or Win8 you could try the desktop sync software</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a soft reset on your phone, no data is lost. Like removing the battery.</p>
<p>Press the volume down and power buttons until the phone vibrates, then release. The phone will turn off and restart.</p>

            <p>Seems I never have problems that have been seen before!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to recap:</p>
<p>PC OS - WinXP (therefore, no desktop app possible)</p>
<p>Phone - Lumia 920 WP8 (OS up to date)</p>
<p>Connected phone to PC via cable</p>
<p>Copied music via WinXP Explorer from iTunes folder to Music folder on phone</p>
<p>(None of my music is DRM protected or purchased from iTunes Store)</p>
<p>Copy was successful and I could see the files on the phone in Explorer</p>
<p>Disconnected phone from computer</p>
<p>Tapped Music+Videos tile</p>
<p>No music found</p>
<p>Turned phone OFF/ON in the conventional manner</p>
<p>Still no music found on phone</p>
<p>Did a soft reset as you mentioned above</p>
<p>Still no music found on phone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going back to carrying 2 pieces of hardware; phone and iPod (couterproductive at best). But I'm still going to try and resolve this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you or anyone else has any thoughts,&nbsp;they'd be much appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, just to be clear, the media format is M4A which is supported by the phone, per Nokia. I would rather not convert to MP3 format.</p>

            At last! Found someone with exactly the same problem.
<div><br />
<div>
<p style="margin-left: 0">I have a Nokia Lumia 920, running Windows Phone 8. A great device and a super operating system... or so I thought. My desktop runs Windows Vista Home Premium Service Pack 2 and up until last week
 co-existed nicely with my Lumia. Please read on......</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">I have just taken delivery of a replacement Lumia 920 after I managed to smash the glass on the first one last week. I have tried transferring albums and songs (in mpeg layer 3 or 4 format from
 my pc's Windows Explorer, using the USB connector. In just the same way that I am used to.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">In the space of 3 days, my pc and my Lumia 920 have decided that they are no longer going to co-operate in the Music + Video department.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">So far I have experimented with the transfer of two albums from the CDs I have bought, transported via iTunes (like everything else I have transferred without a hitch to my ‘old’ phone) so there
 should be no DRM problem...correct? Windows Explorer indicates that the files have copied correctly into the phone's music folder but when I try to run the Nokia Music app it tells me that nothing has been transferred. So I check back on the pc with USB connector
 and, surprise, surprise, Windows Explorer tells me that the folders and files ARE there after all. I have tried moving the folders from the parent ‘Music’ folder to the ‘Albums’ sub-folder – whilst in Windows Explorer on the pc and it makes no difference.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">I have also asked somebody to email me a music file attachment. The file downloaded ok. The file opened ok with a player with a sort of ‘greyed-out’ background – and it even played! I checked what
 it would look like when connected to my pc’s Windows Explorer. There was the file sitting in my phone’s Music folder. BUT – yet again, the Nokia Music App (now upgraded to Nokia MixRadio which has usurped Nokia Music from my Lumia) is calling my pc a liar
 – when it patently isn’t.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">Incidentally, &nbsp;I have no intention of creating mixes but I tried the Nokia MixRadio upgrade because I stupidly thought it would make a difference.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">What's happening with my Windows Phone 8? (By the way the X-Box Music App also tells me that I possess no music on my Lumia).
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">Absolutely no problem transferring photos by the USB connector route (or by SkyDrive for that matter)..
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">I have tried a soft reset but that had no effect.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">This operating system problem was never a difficulty for me with my first 920. The Music app could read and play and organise music files with ease.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">WhatsApp is also telling me that there is a problem with my device's push notification system and that I should reboot. That has no effect on the problem at all. (This also plagued my first Lumia
 920/Windows 8 as well).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
Microsoft and Nokia are now the same company. I’m waiting for some brains to be engaged on what seem to be the myriad of software (and hardware?) glitches.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">I was really excited and happy about Windows 8 at first but the experience has gone downhill. Even worse, is the shame of having to admit to all my smug iPhone friends that they were right!!!!!</p>

            well, if I were you I would send it in and get a replacement unit!<br />
<br />
Or you could flash your device, but BEWARE! As far as I know flashing the device means you will lose your warranty!<br />

            <p>I believe that the phones are faulty. Perform a full phone reset and then ask for a replacement.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is not a widely reported issue and I am convinced that, the issue is not a OS problem. It is device specific and replacement is the way to go.

<h2>            OneDrive for Business &#40;Windows 10&#41; &#34;There was a problem connecting to OneDrive&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>
<p>My Onedrive for Business (Next Generation Sync Client) has stopped syncing. I tried to add the account again in settings, and it comes up with the error&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a problem connecting to OneDrive".</p>
<p>This may be related to this thread, as my onedrive files url is like&nbsp;<a href="https://xxx-my.sharepoint.com/personal/xxx_xxx_com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">xxx-my.sharepoint.com/.../xxx_xxx_com</a><span>1</span>/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/153/t/432902</p>
<p>How can I resolve this?</p>

<p>Hi Frederick,</p>
<p>As LingYu said in that thread, to solve this issue,we'll need to remove the incorrect personal site and recreate the one without the "1" suffix. I've sent you a private message to collect this URL address and your account for further investigation and also
 assist you further according on your case.</p>
<p>Please access the private message via

<p>Thanks for your cooperation,</p>

            It is just a build reference, not a download, so it doesn't matter. &nbsp;It is listed on Buildfeed as an "rs-prerelease" (rs = redstone). &nbsp;The IoT build leaked in the last few days was 14997. &nbsp;I think the download link for that has started coming back error404
 (resource not found).

            Yes it does. &nbsp;We knew that from the download choices on the website. &nbsp;It is not a build but rather a traditional installation disk image. &nbsp;But it appears to be problematic for some burners, which has not been the case with installation .isos in the past
 due to its size.

<h3> de-saint-loubert martial &#40;engie sa&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 file online refresh issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know how to avoid the warning message in the screenshot below ?</p>
<p>I don't understand why it appears as all the data to refresh are native. They are all stored directly in the workbook itself (so no external data connection should be required). We choose the query mode to load data in the data model instead of a direct&nbsp;
 connection to the table in order to load only the necessary rows and columns.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi De-Saint-Loubert,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't need to change anything about the query. I also can't refresh it by my side.
</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/refreshing-data-in-a-workbook-in-a-browser-window-89560193-0c11-420b-b7d8-744766ccdc94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Refreshing data in a workbook in a browser window</a>, “If you run into a situation where you can’t refresh the data in a browser window, try opening the workbook in Excel”, the best practice is to use this feature in Excel desktop client app.
</p>
<p>For your concern about this, I suggest you vote this UserVoice: <a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/274580-excel-online/suggestions/14750388-query-and-refresh-warning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    <p>I have office installed and with it Bradley Hand ITC was installed on my PC, I am currently developing a game and wanted to know if I can use this font or if I would need to license it again. I found some general discussion about other fonts but I wasn't
 sure if the fonts inside windows or office are all licensed the same way that is why I ask. Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Glance Screen On Pluggin Only - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Glance Screen On Pluggin Only</h2>
                    
<p>Is there any chance that Nokia would consider allowing Glance Screen to only come on when plugged in? With my current usage, having it on peak or glance with my Lumia 920 kills the battery too fast, but I would love to use it as a night clock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunatly, there is no way to have glance only come on during night hours, or when plugged in and not also intermitantly or on peek.</p>

<p>Good question. I turned on peek and it definitly degraded my battery preformance. I hadnt made any other changes, installations or otherwise that would have caused the change.</p>

            I did some more playing around and realized that the glance is constantly activating in my pocket and on my desk. I assume this is not supposed to happen?
