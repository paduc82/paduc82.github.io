    <title>Windows Update changes Network Adapter MAC address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abbeyjaye  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update changes Network Adapter MAC address</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are a software publisher who uses DRM service that checks your local network adapter MAC address (and other flags) to verify your software is activated to the legit machine. We have noticed that a recent Windows update changed network adapter MAC addresses
 and so all of our customers who did this update now must REACTIVATE our software to keep using it. In some cases, this continually is happening. I have witnessed several customers who with each Windows Update they must then reactivate our software. Our activation
 server logs the MAC address which is showing this as a different value with each reactivation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea why this would keep happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>

    <title>How to connect 2 computers to the same monitor - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to connect 2 computers to the same monitor</h2>
                    Original Title: 2 Computers &amp; 1Monitor?<br />
<br />
I am using Windows 7 now but have a Win Vista that was problematic. Tried several reformats before buying this one. Can use both together and use the 1 monitor with routers somehow and switch back and forth? Would like to keep plating with the Vista to see
 if it will eventually work again.<br />
Please give specific details and not too techie, never even used a router before. Also I don't like wireless because of security issues.<br />

<p>Look at using a KVM switch. Here are <u>examples</u> from Newegg just one of many suppliers including local bricks &amp; mortar stores like Best Buy.</p>

    <title>Mouse Clicking not working on Windows 10 UI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kal nook  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse Clicking not working on Windows 10 UI</h2>
                    <p>I can't click on any of the new Windows 10 UI elements, I can open start menu, calendar, notification, settings, mouse &amp; touchpad setting and all those won't let me navigate with my mouse, i have to use my keyboard. Same with the start menu. Here is a picture
 with several UI elements opened all of these are example of thing my mouse cant click:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://i.imgur.com/2um34Wa.jpg</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can use applications though like Chrome. I installed Classic Shell for now to be able to use some form of start menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was working when Windows 10 first installed. After windows finished installing drivers it stopped. I can't pinpoint where but i know its not a mouse driver issue as I have installed generic drivers and my mouse functionally works on other windows. I uninstalled
 drivers, i tried a second mouse. I thought it was my video controller so i disabled that and just left my primary and visa versus used my intergrated instead of primary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is extremely frustrating and bizarre. I did a minimal boot too and still didn't work and disabled all non Microsoft services in msconfig and still not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help cause I hate rollingback after this much effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>I am experiencing the same issue.&nbsp; Yesterday everything was working perfectly,&nbsp;except for the sound; I&nbsp;just had to reinstall that driver and that was that.&nbsp; This morning I had sound and nothing to complain about.&nbsp; Now I can't even tell the computer to turn
 off without holding the physical power button.&nbsp; It is definitely the UI that is the problem.&nbsp; I can still use my mouse and touchpad, but the clicking part is the issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hahaha well I'm not too sure what happened but I can click on everything now!&nbsp;I haven't done anything besides type this up and now it works, idk. &nbsp;Uh I guess just give it some time and it will come back.&nbsp; Oh I upgraded from Windows&nbsp;7&nbsp;on a 4 year old basic&nbsp;Sony
 Vaio laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going to restart my computer and see if it happens again.&nbsp; Hope your issue gets solved soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:&nbsp; While I was experiencing that issue I tried using Chrome, and noticed that a single left click was closing out of the tab, much like it does when you click using the wheel on the tab.&nbsp; Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>I am having mouse issues too. Problem is always the same when it occurs, the mouse pointer can move but I cannot click on anything, It just starts giving the default system beep with every click.</p>
<p>Seems to occur after the PC has&nbsp;woken from&nbsp;sleep. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unplugging and replugging the mouse or USB is no help. I have had to restart each time then it works fine for hours again. The mouse is plugged into the keyboard, and the keyboard continues to function as does mouse movement. Just no response&nbsp;and BEEP when
 clicking on anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check drivers, it says I have the best drivers.</p>

            Having same issues on a surface pro 2. Using power keyboard and razer naga or logitech performance mx mouse. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes some apps accept mouse input while other don't. Sometimes mouse works but touch doesn't, sometimes
 only the digitizer pen works but not the mouse.&nbsp; Tried unplugging external mouse when this happens but to no avail sometimes the app receives input but not the windows minimize,maximize,close buttons.it's frustrating because it only recently started happening
 last few days and has been working fine since windows 10 release.

            <p>Same here. Most times right after I turn on PC mouse clicking in start menu does not work but after CTRL-ALT-DEL and Lock (using TAB) and re-enter mouse clicking works for a while.</p>
<p>The original post is a bit old now and I have seen a lot of reports on this issue but no real solution. Why is Microsoft not commenting with some real solution (don't give me "update driver", please).</p>

            Ctrl-Alt-Del and signing out and back in works but is making me start to look at Linux more seriously than ever. Edge is also a problem on a couple of machines and have now abandoned it entirely. Only machine which shows no problems is an AMD Athlon II

<p>Here it is, September 2017, and this issue, for me, seems to have been radically worsea of late.&nbsp; Since recent updates, my impression.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win10, latest version, Surface Pro 4 w/ Type Cover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my experience, seems like it occurs more after computer has been to sleep or hibernated, wakes up confused about whether the Type Cover is attached (sometimes), whether a mouse click should be executed (the UI visually indicates a click, but nothing happens),
 etc.&nbsp; A very frequent experience lately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting or signing in/out fixes, sometimes just reattaching keyboard helps (not always).</p>

    <title>Xbox One controller problems&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haze brody  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One controller problems&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I received my Xbox One for this past christmas and ever since day one of opening and trying to play it, i always have an issue with the controller disconnecting randomly. &nbsp;It really has no rhyme or reason, it is completely random. &nbsp;Before I get the same
 response as every one else, I have gone through 
this forum post&nbsp;&nbsp;SEVERAL times now and the issue is still happening. &nbsp;I have checked batteries, updated, etc. etc. &nbsp;I tried moving my xbox's location down into my room and it still happens. &nbsp;I applied to get a new controller and sent it in for a new one
 and I have received the new controller. &nbsp;I updated it and made sure I have new batteries in it and the same issue happens, but not as often. &nbsp;There is nothing obstructing the xbox and I am sitting no more than 5 feet away from it. &nbsp;I have my iPhone and Macbook
 Air 2014 on my desk sitting next to me, which is also around 5feet away from the xbox one. &nbsp;My same exact setup worked completely fine with my old Xbox 360, but for some reason now my controller doesn't want to stay connected. &nbsp;This is very frustrating because
 I hardly can play any games online because it will disconnect and make me lose a game or something like that. &nbsp;At this point I feel that maybe something with my xbox one is broken that works with the wireless connectivity of the controller. &nbsp;Please help me
 because I really loved my old xbox 360 and I have always liked Microsoft, but with these issues I might just have to get rid of it. &nbsp;I researched a little bit and noticed that MANY other people were having same issues. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Same issue here. &nbsp;I've noticed that if I turn my controller off twice (which I have to do often because of the insane amount of times my headset is mucking up, which is another annoying issue entirely), two seems to be the magic number where my controller
 goes on strike. &nbsp;Then I can't do anything until I unplug the console, remove the batteries from the controller, plug console back in, power up console, put batteries back in controller, turn on controller and pray that my stupid headphones will work this time
 around AND that the controller responds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean for real....ain't nobody got time for all that! &nbsp;But yet that's pretty much a daily struggle lol. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have an issue with my Day One Edition controller's "A" button not working with the main system menus(home screen,sign in,power off etc) but works fine in any game menu and gameplay but then wont work right in apps like Amazon Instant Video or Netflix to
 select a title or exit playback. &nbsp; &nbsp;Has anybody had this issue?</p>

<p>To ease &nbsp;this is a problem with the controller but there is a controller update coming to Xbox one. But first make sure you goto to settings Device &amp; accessories and sign the controller to someone and click on update controller to the Xbox one. then accept
 the new update to fix this.</p>

<p>Yes, I have updated my controller. &nbsp;I updated the controller that was first having the problems that came with the xbox one. I also updated the new controller that I received from microsoft and the issue still occurs. &nbsp;Like I said it's not as common but
 still happens enough where I can't play anything. </p>

<p>Freaking same thing is happening to me, it happens on every controller I have. &nbsp;I have updated both controllers and I think the problem is with the adapter. &nbsp;I have astro a-40s with the stereo headset adapter and it never fails if I'm in a party my controller
 will shut off randomly shuts off, I get disconnected from the party. &nbsp;My friends use the headset that came with the xbox and haven't had a problem

                    <p>Ok, I have a very odd issue. I cannot rename existing folders, create new folders and name them anything other than "New Folder" then "New Folder (2)", or cut/paste folders.

<p>
</p><p>I CAN copy/paste folders, but I cannot rename them or create new ones. </p>
<p>I CAN manipulate the files within the folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) uninstalling all Windows Updates since the time when I know that I could create them.</p>
<p>2) downloaded the registry key: "right-click folder_desc.reg and choose Merge"</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) deleting registry keys:</p>

</p><p>4) Merging the "Hide_Known_File_Extensions.reg"&nbsp;"Show_Known_File_Extensions.reg" registry keys as suggested by another person in the forums (I had high hopes for this one because the issue seemed to correlate with hiding/showing a couple of very large folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) System Restore</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) chkdsk C: /f</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm open to any suggestions because my next step is a Windows Refresh and I reallly don't want to lose all my Microsoft Word settings and autocorrects as well as settings/tweaks within several other programs.</p>

            <p>Hi Mayank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the fast reply. Unfortunately, I'm not quite sure that I know the answers to your questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Are you connected to a domain network?</span></p>
<p>I don't believe so? I did right-click on "My Computer" and under "Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings" I see Computer name: the name, Full Computer Name: the name, and "Workgroup: &nbsp;WORKGROUP". I don't see anything that refers to a domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Are you logged in as an admin?</span></p>
<p><span>I believe so. (See pic)</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe67e9ac-a4c0-46bf-a9d2-2d269cd2c748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe67e9ac-a4c0-46bf-a9d2-2d269cd2c748" /></a></p>
<p><span>3. How are you trying to rename folders or access?</span></p>
<p><span>Just click the folder one time so the name is selected and change the name. Or just cut/paste the folder from my directory to another directory. It doesn't matter if it's on the same drive
 or to an external USB.</span></p>

            <p>I still have this same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find another interesting quirk: </p>
<p>If I'm extracting a .zip or .rar file, WinRAR <em>can </em>create new folders!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can then copy/paste the new folder...buuuut!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to cut/paste that new folder somewhere I get:</p>
<p>"Can't find the specified file. Make sure you specify the correct path and file name." "Skip/Cancel"</p>

    <title>Screen Time - No more option for child to request more time from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kcyarcho  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Time - No more option for child to request more time from parents</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to Windows 10, my child on longer is given the option to ask for more time when their Screen Time is up for the day. On Windows 8.1 when the time expired they were given 2 options 1) log off or 2) request more time, which in turn would give
 them options to 1) email parent or 2) if parent is present, select parent account and enter password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now on Windows 10, they get a message there time has expired, followed by&nbsp;the text, "Try logging in on 11/04/1015 (being the date of the next day) at 12:00am or ask your parent for more time." and the&nbsp;option is a button with text reading "log off or turn
 off computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked everywhere on Family Safety, but no luck finding any mention of how to allow my child to ask a parent for more time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Still not working. Email requests no longer being received by me when my child asks for more screen time. Even changing the account by disabling this stupid feature does not work either. Seems as if though laptop is either not receiving nor transmitting
 to Microsoft site. I even locally changed account to admin but it still acts as a user account still. This whole experience has been retarded by Microsoft. Fix this stupid error!!

            <p>Seriously?<br />
<br />
Are you really trying to tell us that we now have to use email or log into a Microsoft web site OURSELVES in order to grant our children extra screen time because we can't use our own Admin User Privileges? (Remember those?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really, Microsoft?!? Can you honestly say you thought this one through on a PC platform?!? You've turned a 5 second job in to something so stupid it shouldn't exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens if I don't actually have an internet connection at the time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time my autistic child punches my monitor to bits because our internet is down and I can't grant extra time because I can't get online, do you mind if I send the bill to you?<br />

 but that didn't help.&nbsp; The only way I can get readable (for me) text is to reduce the resolution to 1360 x 768 which totally defeats the purpose of getting a high resolution screen.&nbsp; Is there any other way other than adjusting the screen resolution such that
 it can be max'ed out and yet provide readable text?&nbsp; I don't want fixes like the magnifier or similar devices. &nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>When you increase the screen resolution, things are smaller. Fundamentally the only way to get things bigger again at higher resolutions is to have a bigger screen. Magnifier, zooms and increasing font sizes just allow you to tweak around the edges of what
 kit you have to make the best compromise.</p>
<p>I use 1920x1080 and I have my text size set to 125% (and IE9 zoom=200%), but I have a 24" monitor which is much bigger than a laptop screen.</p>

            <p>Really???!!! Been using Edge since upgrading to Windows 10 and I have finally decided to give it up. I have a couple of websites that display graphs which are not even visible because of the limited capabilities of Edge and its crappy color schemes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add to that the fact you can't even sort your bookmarks and that about does it for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No problems with these features in Firefox or Chrome browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more nail in the coffin of Windows for me. </p>

            I'm about to give up using Edge for same reason, too many little options to change settings.&nbsp; The most annoying is that the AdBlocker is not even available for general public YET.&nbsp; Talk about not wanting to compete with other browsers.&nbsp; It saddens me,
 it appears MS just gave up to even try.&nbsp;

                    Microsoft's advice on this subject is here:&nbsp; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Add-or-change-an-input-language" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<div>What they fail to mention is that every time you switch input language, you must also switch the physical keyboard. This isn't terribly helpful... you can easily enter (say) German using an English keyboard, but as this feature is currently implemented,
 if you want the German spell-checker, you must also switch to a German keyboard.</div>

<div>I've also read that the&nbsp;keyboard&nbsp;mapping is held in the registry, so my other idea is to set Input Language to EN (which will force me to choose an English keyboard), and then change the mapping so it corresponds to the actual (AZERTY) keyboard.</div>

<h2>            Xbox Rewards Support</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ich habe gestern vor einer Woche meine Xbox Live Gold Mitgliedschaft mit einer Pre-Paid-Karte verlängert. Allerdings wurden mir immer noch keine Points bei Xbox Rewards gutgeschrieben. Jetzt wollte ich mich an den Support wenden, jedoch finde ich den Rewards
 Support nicht mehr... Kann mir jemand helfen?</p>

<p>Es kann bis zu 30 Tage dauern, bis die gesammelten Punkte deinem Konto gutgeschrieben werden. Wenn du insgesamt weniger als 100 Punkte hast, werden die Punkte als wartende Punkte gespeichert, bis du 100 Punkte erreicht hast, und dann deinem Konto gutgeschrieben.</p>

<p>Man bekommt die Punkte auf dem Rewards Konto leider nur gutgeschrieben, wenn man zu dem Zeitpunkt der Einlösung der Goldmitgliedschaft bereits Goldmitglied war. Man sollte auch berücksichtigen, dass die Punkte erst gutgeschrieben werden, wenn die neu eingelöste
 Mitgliedschaft tatsächlich beginnt, Beispiel: Deine alte Goldmitgliedschaft läuft bis 1.7., hast aber heute bereits eine neue eingelöst. Dann werden die Punkte dafür erst ab dem 1.7. in deinem Rewards Konto auftauchen.</p>

 das halten was sie versprechen, von wegen zum gewiessen Zeitpunkt Punkte gutschreiben. Hätte so schon fast 1000 MS bekommen müssen. Aber leider nicht, daher, was bringt es einem, wenn die nix gutschreiben?</p>

<p>Die bei Twitter geben auch nur Antworten auf Fragen, die eh schon in den Geschäftsbedingungen beantwortet werden und rühren hier und da mal die Werbetrommel.</p>
<p>Bei Problemen mit dem eigenen Rewards Konto muss man einen Thread im offiziellen englischsprachigen Rewards Support Forum erstellen. Da kann es einige Zeit dauern bis sich ein Supportler um das jeweilige Anliegen kümmert. Man muss momentan leider eben noch
 manchmal seinen Punkten nachrennen. Aber dafür kost´s ja nix, außer Zeit. :P</p>

    <title>Windows 10 &#38; Kaspersky Internet Security - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicholas258  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 &#38; Kaspersky Internet Security</h2>
                    <p>A bit of a strange issue which I'm also working on with Kaspersky.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm running Windows 10 and have Kaspersky 2018.&nbsp; When I go to&nbsp; "Control Panel - System &amp; Security - Security &amp; Maintenance -Program Compatibility Troubleshooter&nbsp; - Test compatibility settings"&nbsp;
 the system tells me that:&nbsp; "Setting applied to Kaspersky Internet Security,&nbsp; Windows compatibility mode:&nbsp; Windows 8";&nbsp; but I'm running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kasperky works just fine; no error messages are ever present, but I did have to delete another security package in its entirety to make sure there were no conflicts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far the Kaspersky folks do not believe that the issue is on their side, but they are still working it.&nbsp; Any thoughts on the Microsoft side?&nbsp; Why would Windows 8 show up vs. Windows 10 for compatibility?</p>

            Hi Nicholas.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />No expert in forums where we see the most cases by the thousands recommends Kasperksy.  I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, best Windows performance, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.   
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Its possible certain parts of Kaspersky's Antivirus engine might not be fully compatible and require running in compatible mode in order to work. 
<br />
<br />If you upgraded from a previous version of Windows such as Windows 8 to Windows 10 with Kaspersky installed, it might have applied these changes automatically. 
<br />
<br />You can of course uninstall and reinstall Kaspersky to resolve the problem.

            Thanks for the responses. &nbsp; My intention is to stay with Kaspersky as I've&nbsp; run it on many different platforms over the years; its always been reliable.&nbsp; In this case I added it to a brand new computer running Windows 10.&nbsp; I used the McAfee removal tool
 to completely remove all traces of this pre-loaded product.&nbsp; Kaspersky runs just fine; there are no issues and I never get any error messages, so the compatibility mode of Windows 8 has me stumped.&nbsp; The Kaspersky folks are continuing to take a look at what
 the issue may be as they say that they have not seen this situation in the past with their product &amp; Windows 10. &nbsp;

<p>Well there is a resolution.&nbsp; Apparently Microsoft launches the compatibility troubleshooting module using Windows 8 for testing an application's compatibility; that's why Windows 8 appears even though Windows 10 is the O/S. &nbsp; To verify this proposition,&nbsp;
 I went and tested other apps on my system and sure enough, every one of them came up with a Windows 8 compatibility standard; not Windows 10.</p>
<p><br />
So, unless Microsoft comes back and states this should not be the case, I think I'm done with pursuing this topic, but it does raise the question:&nbsp; Why would Microsoft set this up in this manner?&nbsp; Bit of a rhetorical question.</p>

<h2>            Quick question about auto renual, I dont need any help though.</h2>
                    
<p><span>Ok, I called xbox support to turn off my auto renual because i dont plan on being a gold member any more after this year. And i must say, It was veary easy to turn it off it only took like 5min on
 the phone and the women i was talking to was veary nice. But my question is, Why do you need to call support to turn the auto renual off/on? It's easy enough to call support to turn it off/on, But wouldent it be even more easy to just have the option to turn
 the auto renual on/off right through your XBOX 360?</span></p>

<p>Hi Donny, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the error message that you encountered during setup, there is a possibility that the media installation tool is either corrupted or there are settings in your operating system that stops the upgrade/installation. For us to better assist you, we
 would like to ask for additional information. Please answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the current build and version of your Windows 10 device?</li><li>Can you tell us what you meant when you mentioned that you are trying to "fresh back" Windows 10?</li><li>Did you create an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>It looks like you are using a Windows Insider build. Since you've mentioned that you'd like to reformat your PC using the setup tool from the website, we would recommend following the steps in this forum article instead:
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">Clean Install Windows 10</a></strong>. Otherwise, we would like
 to ask the website where you downloaded the setup file so we can further investigate from our end.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your response. </p>

<p>Hi Jennifer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to do a clean install following your advice but unfortunately this process was not able to complete on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got stuck in the same vicious cycle while trying to solve the issues with this upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other options?...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Marusik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a possibility that one or some of your existing software installed or hardware device components are preventing from the update to push through due to compatibility issue. We have a few recommendations for you to try out to successfully update Windows
 10:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Make sure that your device has enough space.</strong> Your device requires at least 16 GB of free space to upgrade a 32-bit OS, or 20 GB for a 64-bit OS. For more info, see

Free up drive space in Windows 10</a>. <br />
</li><li><strong>Unplug extra hardware. </strong>Remove all external storage devices and drives, docks, and other hardware you might have plugged into your device that isn’t needed for basic functionality.
</li><li><strong>Remove third-party security software. </strong>Make sure you know how to reinstall your programs and that any necessary product keys are on hand.

<p>
</p><p>We also recommend that you download the latest updates with the help of the Windows 10 Update Assistant tool. This checks for compatibility of the hardware components and software installed to your PC. To run the tool, follow the
 instructions on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>I have tried EVERYTHING above. Spent nearly 40+ hours on this. Windows 10 is already installed. Windows continues to tell me it MUST do an update, but fails. I tried to do a fresh install and received the above errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have an installer that will bypass the requirements? I know this computer meets the requirements, but the installer gets to 55-75% and fails. This means something to you. I have worked in software development as a project manager for my entire career.
 I will sign a waiver. Please send me something that will reset this computer without further time spent on this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can a working computer be crippled by your update and you are not able to do anything but point is all to the same help files we've stated we've looked at? I have a license to use this software. May I please use a modified installer to bypass the system
 requirements, or someone tell me what's happening at 55%</p>

                    Original Title: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL 0xfffff800288b41b<br />
<br />
My HP a6357c pc recently started randomly crashing with the BSOD. It has displayed several different crash reports, the the most common is the&nbsp;IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL with 0.0000000A, (0x000000000000017F, 0x0000000000000002, 0x000000000000, 0xfffff800288b41b.
 I recently reinstalled my windows 64bit ultimate edition in an attempt to fix the problem, however the same problem still persists. I am unable to even update properly. Memtest86 indicated no problems with my 4gb memory. Start up repair can find no root cause.
 HELP!&nbsp;

            Alright, so I finally figured it out. Upon closer inspection of the motherboard I discover bulging and leaking capacitors. This explains the seemingly random BSOD notifications. Thanks for all your help anyway!

            <p><span>Hi Jonbishop,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. What is the make and model of the system?</span></p>
<p><span>2. When exactly are you receiving the error message? </span></p>
<p><span>3. What do you mean when you say "get a beep if I hit a wrong key"? Does the sound work only for&nbsp;some programs?</span></p>
<p><span>4. What files are you trying to download?</span></p>
<p><span>5. Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the system?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click <b>Start</b>, </span><span>type <b>services.msc</b> </span><span>in the start search and press
<strong><span>ENTER</span></strong>.<br />
b. Locate and double click the <strong><span>Windows Audio </span></strong>service.
<br />
c. Click the <strong><span>Log On </span></strong>tab, <br />
d. In the <strong><span>This account </span></strong>text box, type “<b>NT AUTHORITY\LocalService</b>”.<br />
e. Set both <strong><span>Password</span></strong> fields blank.<br />
f. Click <strong><span>Apply</span></strong> and then <strong><span>OK</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>g. Restart the service and check if it helps.</span></p>

<h2>            LifeCam HD-3000 Help</h2>
                    I just purchased this webcam, but when trying to install the driver for it, it isn't giving an option for Windows 10. It does say that for Windows 8 and later that it is not needed, but then when I try to search up my webcam I can't find it in order to
 use it. It works fine with Skype, but I want to be able to record just general videos with it. On the box for the webcam it says that you should be able to plug it in and it works - which it does - but is there any way I can use it without within Skype?

            <p>Windows 8 drivers work in Windows 10, so there is no need to specifically have a Windows 10 driver to use it on Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for using it outside of skype, you will need an application such as Movie Maker in order to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many tutorials on web how to do so:</p>

                    Currently on Windows 8.1 and I will not be updating to Windows 10 anytime soon ! How do I stop the receipt of the unwanted and very annoying IE displays inviting me to take up the free update to Windows 10 ?

            <p><span><span>Select the keyboard shortcut
<strong>Win+X</strong>, Control Panel,&nbsp;Windows Update, Change Settings. Under Important Updates is a box showing the current setting. Click on the Arrow down to the right and change the selection to “<strong>Check for Updates but let me choose whether to download
 and install them</strong>” and click on <strong>OK</strong>. Restart your computer.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Select the keyboard shortcut
<strong>Win+X</strong>, Control Panel,</span></span><span><span>Windows Update,
<strong>Check for Updates</strong>. If optional updates are available click optional updates and make sure that the box before
<strong>Upgrade to Windows 10</strong> is unchecked. Right click on <strong>Upgrade to Windows 10</strong> and select
<strong>Hide this Update</strong>. Check the boxes before the remaining updates. Click on
<strong>Install</strong> and click again on <strong>Install</strong> in the next window and the process of installing starts. You should let the process proceed without interruption. Multi-tasking at the time updating is in progress is unwise. The progress
 window will tell you what is going on. You need to be patient. Restart the computer when prompted to do so.</span></span></p>
