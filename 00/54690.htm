<p>Hi Harish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package installs runtime components of Visual C++ Libraries required to run applications developed with Visual C++ on a computer that does not have Visual C++ 2010 installed. This package installs runtime components
 of C Runtime (CRT), Standard C++, ATL, MFC, OpenMP and MSDIA libraries<br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition makes the list of the software you need to learn how to use if you wish to become a professional programmer. The fact that the future of development relies on the .NET Framework (and Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express
 Edition concentrates on this platform) should be reason enough.<br />
<br />
To sum up, Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition makes the time you spend with it worthwhile. Programmers who wish to build applications based on the .NET Framework are advised to rely on this development solution, as it is stable and does not put a strain
 on your computer’s performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, we suggest to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition besides with the one that you already have which is Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, feel free to get back to us. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            What you have is an obscure problem. If you can live with it for now, that is what I would do until something more major happened where a re-install would be needed..

<h2>            Your folder can&#39;t be shared.</h2>
                    <p>Well, I just fixed my own issue... I was unable to share a folder on a USB external HDD (local disk) for no apparent reason... I am a local admin on a Win7 Pro 32-bit PC on a Windows Server 2003 domain in native mode. I was finally able to share it by right-clicking
 the folder, selecting Properties, and then the sharing tab and then Advanced Sharing. Every other way I tried to share it resulted in the error message in the title of this post.</p>
<p>I hope this helps if anyone is having this same issue.</p>

            <p>Dear Flux,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It worked! I owe you one. This saved me considerable cursing and hair pulling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried to share a folder I kept getting the message "Your folder can't be shared". Using the method you describe I was able to share the folder and map a drive to it&nbsp;from another workstation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crazy thing is I have other shared folders on the same PC that I did not have trouble sharing a week before. I also noticed when I use explorer to view folder properties the folders I shared last week show&nbsp;all&nbsp;the users I&nbsp;have them shared with. When
 I look at the properties of a folder shared&nbsp;with your method&nbsp;it does not list all&nbsp;the users as&nbsp;shared parties but I can still&nbsp;map to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to post this.</p>

            <p>What if there is a padlock icon when you right click a folder to 'share with'?</p>
<p>I've been trying everything I find on the Inet, no avail, even Seagate is stumped. My external will simply not share.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the topography: 3T seagate external is USB to my PC running Win 7 Pro 64, which is cat6e'd to my router. My Seagate media center is cat5e'd to my router. Media center can see the folders, but says they are empty. Win 7 says they are shared, until
 I right click them, a padlock is icon is next to the folders. I can find nothing on the net about these dreaded padlocks.</p>

<h2>            cannot connect to google on wired connection</h2>
                    
<p>I moved my desk so I could connect my desktop directly into my Ambit router/modem.&nbsp; I had been using a wireless connection and the performance was spotty.&nbsp; When I am direct wired into the router/modem I am unable to access Google.&nbsp; When I disconnect the
 ethernet cable and connect the wireless adapter I can access Google again.&nbsp; I took the router/modem back to the cable company and exchanged it, but that did not solve the problem.&nbsp; So somewhere in my Vista network settings it is blocking my access to Google.&nbsp;
 I can connect to any other webpage I want, just not Google.&nbsp; I can access Google Mail, but not Google.&nbsp; I was certain the problem was with the modem/router, but that proved not to be the case.&nbsp; Now I'm convinced that it has to do with my network settings somewhere,
 but I can't find it.&nbsp; The problem occurs whether I use IE or Firefox.&nbsp; I have reset my cookies, history etc.&nbsp; I'm convinced the problem lies somewhere in Vista I just don't know where.</p>

<p>Hi Barry,<br />
<br />
What type of security software do you have on your computer? Can you try to disable it temporary while connect to the wired network to see if it will work.<br />
<br />
Windows Live OneCare.&nbsp; I have run a scan and nothing shows up.&nbsp; Here's my question.&nbsp; If it was the security software, why would I be able to access Google when I'm wireless?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
After printing out Praseetha's answer and trying to follow it I realized it wasn't going to work, which ultimately it didn't.&nbsp; I said in my original email that the problem occurs both in IE and Firefox, so I fail to see how going through all these steps with
 IE is going to solve the problem.&nbsp; Plus, the way she lists the steps is very confusing.&nbsp; On step 2, and 3 it should say do either a or b instead of listing it like you are to follow a then b then c etc.<br />
<br />
I'm not an IT guy but I do know something about computers and this problem tells me that the problem lies somewhere in my Vista network setup.&nbsp;Something in there is not allowing my computer to access Google.&nbsp; It can't be a problem with IE or Firefox, otherwise
 how do you explain the fact that I can acess Google if I go to a wireless configuration?&nbsp; Same thing with the security software.&nbsp; The key to the problem lies in the fact that I can't acess Google ONLY WHEN I'M USING A WIRED CONNECTION.<br />
<br />
All this flushing cookies and stuff is what I originally tried before I realized the problem only occurs when I'm in the wired configuration.&nbsp; Once I found out I could access Google if I switched to a wireless configuration I realized that all that flushing
 stuff didn't matter.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Somewhere in the wired network configuration is something that is not allowing the computer to go to Google.&nbsp; Where?&nbsp; I don't have any clue.&nbsp; I can ping Google from the command line and it works.&nbsp; It's not blocked.&nbsp; 4 packets sent, 4 returned.<br />
<br />
I'll give you a history of the problem.&nbsp; Sunday after I moved the furniture&nbsp;and connected via the&nbsp;ethernet port I realized I couldn't connect to Google.&nbsp; I uninstalled a program that my daughter had installed earlier since that was the only change to the computer
 that had been made&nbsp;between the time I could acess Google and I couldn't.&nbsp;&nbsp;That didn't work.&nbsp; So I did all the cookie flushing and all that stuff then to no avail.&nbsp; After I went to bed I thought about the problem and then realized two things had changed since
 Google&nbsp;was working.&nbsp;&nbsp;My daughter installed the game, and I changed my connection.<br />
<br />
The next morning I went to the computer and changed back to a wireless connection and voila!&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp; I could connect to Google.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime I spent some time with my ISP trying to figure out the problem and we decided I needed to swap out my router/modem.&nbsp;
 I went to the cable office and got a new router/modem which I then connected to my computer.&nbsp; The problem was still there.&nbsp; So obviously the problem lies somewhere in the WIRED network configuration in Vista.&nbsp; Everything else has been eliminated as a cause.&nbsp;
 It can't be Firefox or IE since the problem occurs with both, and is solved in both by changing to a wireless connection.&nbsp; It can't be the router/modem since the problem wasn't solved by swapping it out.&nbsp; If it was a virus/malware problem I would think it
 would occur in either a wired or wireless configuration.&nbsp; The problem could be the Ethernet card which I can test by hooking my router/modem up via USB which is what I will do next, although I can't imagine that would fix it but stranger things have happened.&nbsp;
 If that doesn't fix it, the only thing left I can think of is the network setup.&nbsp; Unless you can think of something else.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I will also try booting in safe mode, but if that works, what does that tell me?&nbsp; All the scan things seem to me to be a waste of time and I think I'll leave all that stuff as a last gasp measure.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
Barry<br />
<br />
PS.&nbsp; Just booted in safe mode and the problem remains.&nbsp; I can access other web pages but not Google.<br />
<br />
PPS.&nbsp; Just changed to a USB connection and the problem disappeared.&nbsp; I can now access Google.&nbsp; I'm guessing the problem is in my ethernet card somehow.&nbsp; As I said, stranger things have happened.&nbsp; I wonder if I buy a new card if that will fix the problem???<br />
<br />
PPPS.&nbsp; Before I went to the trouble of buying a new card I swapped out the ethernet cable and that didn't work.&nbsp; I went to Best Buy and talked to the Geek Squad and no one thought that replacing my ethernet card would work.&nbsp; Having pretty much eliminated everything
 else I went ahead and bought a new card.&nbsp; I installed it and hooked up the cable and everything now works.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way I would ever have thought replacing my ethernet card would have solved this problem, but like I said stranger things have happened.&nbsp;
 Anyway thanks for the advice and now you've heard of something new.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Skype id</h2>
                    <p>I have somehow screwed up my setup of skype. I think it is connected to my Microsoft account because I have a strange, very long skype id which is very impractical. My main problem is actually that I cannot seem to send anyone an invite on Skype and I don't
 know why. So, why can I not send people requests eventhough I can find them easily enough?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I think my SKype account is linked to my No.1 Microsoft account, therefore the unfortunate Skype id, although my No.2 email address is shown as the primary email.. and I remember when signing in that it was confusing. So, is it possible that the two
 accounts have somehow gotten intertwined in Skype?</p>

<h2>            No driver for Mass Storage Devices or UFD</h2>
                    Hey guys,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm on an HP Pavilion DV6 laptop, and can't seem to use any sort of USB flashdrive. They don't show up under Computer at all. When I look in the Device Manager, they're there, but under the wrong heading. I've tried two different flashdrives and they both
 show up under "Other Devices." However, one shows up as "Mass Storage Device" and the other as "UFD". Neither of them have drivers, and Windows cannot find any drivers for them when I tell it to search for them.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>These are the hardware ID's for the Mass Storage Device:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>USB\VID_058F&amp;PID_6387&amp;REV_0141</div>
<div>USB\VID_058F&amp;PID_6387</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and for the UFD:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>USB\VID_1B1C&amp;PID_0A60&amp;REV_1100</div>
<div>USB\VID_1B1C&amp;PID_0A60</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you could, could you focus on the UFD first? That's the flashdrive I really need, the other was just to see if it was the drive or the computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
                </div>

            Hi  Susan, your Display Driver will need rolling back . . . Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If the rollback option is greyed out:
<br />
<br />Right click on your display adapter, click 'Uninstall device' 
<br />Choose 'Delete the driver software for this device' then click 'Uninstall'
<br />Restart the computer (myst be a restart, not a shut down) 
<br />Windows will then download the correct driver       
        </p>

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. 
<br />
<br />Yes, there is a problem with the latest Windows Updates. 
<br />
<br />Right Click Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - double-click the adapter - Driver's tab - use Roll back driver. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work or is unavailable do the below.
<br />
<br />Updating to the latest video driver or possibly reverting back to an older version usually corrects the issue. 
<br />
<br />Download the latest and any other older driver you wish to try from the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and also check the actual video device maker (such as Intel, Nvidia or AMD/ATI). Do not install yet. 
<br />
<br />Make a Restore Point : 
<br />
<br />Start - type in --&gt; Restore ......... find at top and click on - then use Create 
<br />
<br />Use this method to remove the present video drivers. 
<br />
<br />Display Driver Uninstaller 
<br /><a href="https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dr</a>... 
<br />
<br />Then install the desired driver you previously downloaded. 
<br />
<br />Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Make sure recommended settings are selected for Scale and Layout and Screen resolution.
<br />
<br />
<br />Another thing you can try:
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try performing a system restore before this problem occurred. 
<br />
<br />I recommend you uninstall the KB4048955, KB4048954 (Windows 10 1703)
<br />
<br />Microsoft issued an update for several versions of WIndows 10: KB4048954, KB4048955 that has caused issues with display drivers. If you know the make and model of your computer, you can try manually reinstalling the driver from the manufacturers website for your video driver.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />(This is the update you want to uninstall KB4048955)
<br />
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart then see if stability is restored. 
<br />
<br />The update might try to install again. So, try blocking it.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />If its the icons and toolbars, then Go back to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Click in the Scale and layout list box, try another scale such as 125 to see if that works or play around with custom scaling. 
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Perform a repair upgrade
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>

            Option 1.Try Rolling back if you have an option:

<br />Option 2. Remove AMD drivers completely and Install the legacy ones from the AMD site:
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of AMD using this: <a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMD-Clean-Uninstall-Utility.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/...</a> and reboot
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the legacy driver from here(You might have to do a bit of exercise to locate the driver:
<br /><a href="http://www.support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.
<br />Option 3: See if Windows itself has some history of the Older Driver:

<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-10-set-display-resolution-to-1920x1080/8ad4adc6-7cc1-494e-b296-e6c4dd8caefa?messageId=913d5c97-7dd7-4780-b735-1026da383882">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />Please note all the steps need temporarily disabling of Windows update or driver updates so that newer driver doesn't install automatically.

<h2>            Error Code 80154017</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>Has been more than a year since I can't sign in with my Xbox live account. Now I bought a game on steam that requires microsoft account. When I try to sign in with my account on Games for Windows Live client, I get this error:</p>

<p>"There is a problem with your account that you need to resolve before signing in. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Code: 80154017"</p>
<p>Ok, so I go to xbox live web page and try to login with my account to see if there is any thing to resolve.</p>
<p>After logging in, it shows a page to update my acount. I choose "Update Online". Then it redirects me to a screen with the acceptance terms. I accept and go to the next page which contains a big ugly error:</p>
<p>Looks like you found a glitch in the system.<br />

<p>Hiya Dig,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about the account troubles. Let's see if we can get you back online. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Alright, there is not a lot of info on this particular error code, but I do know it is related to your region settings. I see your account is set in Brazil. Are you currently physically in Brazil? Also, does the billing address on your account match that on
 your method of payment?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let us know, and we can go from there. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Mister Ohnaka. </p>
<p>Yes, I'm physically in Brazil at this moment. Regarding the Billing Address and the Method of Payment I'm not being able to verify, because I'm having the same error as when updating the account.</p>
<p>Looks like it's really screwed up.</p>
<p>Thank a lot for your answer!</p>

<p>Hey there digaomatias,<br />
<br />
When you're looking online to change your billing information, where are you looking that it's giving you that error?<br />
<br />
You can update your billing information either through the My Account section here on xbox.com (located in the upper right hand corner by your profile) or through commerce.microsoft.com. You can select your payment options and edit their billing information
 individually.<br />
<br />
<br />
You may also want to make a post in our <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/gfw/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Games for Windows LIVE forums</a> and our PC gurus may have some expert tips for that error.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know how that goes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Mister Fizzle,</p>
<p>The error is happening when I click on "My Account" in Xbox Live Web Site, which redirects me to this link:</p>
<p><a href="https://live.xbox.com/pt-BR/Account?xr=mebarnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">live.xbox.com/.../Account</a></p>
<p>It's the same error as the one when finishing the "Update Online":</p>

<p>Try to visit this page <strong><a href="https://live.xbox.com/AccountMigration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> and see if you can change your account region to Brazil.<br />
<br />
This error code corresponds to your account region being in a country where Xbox LIVE is not available. You may physically be in Brazil but if you're getting this error it could mean that the account you've created is not registered there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok, let me tell the steps when I click in the link you sent me. </p>
<p>- First, it required login. Done.</p>
<p>(all text in quotes below were actually written in portuguese, I'm translating for you guys to make sense :P)</p>
<p>- Now it's in this url "<a href="https://live.xbox.com/pt-BR/MigrateWebOnlyAccount&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">live.xbox.com/.../MigrateWebOnlyAccount"</a>, with the title "Update to a XBox Live Account", and in the body "Now available in your region".
 in this screen there are 2 buttons "update later (exit)" and "update online". I go ahead and click "Update online".
</p>
<p>- It redirected me to "<a href="https://live.xbox.com/pt-BR/MigrateWebOnlyAccount/Migrate&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">live.xbox.com/.../Migrate"</a>, with first name and last name fields (they both are correctly filled). There are also some checkboxes
 for newsletter and a button to accept. When I click accept:</p>

<p>Hm that is quite weird, you may need to contact phone support if you're not able to do this yourself due to this error. I can only suggest trying a different web browser if the one you're currently using isn't working.<br />
<br />
This glitch message can also occur if you have a parental e-mail associated with your account that hasn't accepted the terms of use. I'm not sure if you do, or not but it's good to check that out to before reaching out to phone support

<h2>            Intel&#40;R&#41; HD Graphics display driver not compatible With Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have multiple machines that I am upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10, and many of them fail the upgrade due to incompatible software. some digging around showed that there are some Intel(R) HD Graphic display drivers are not compatible with Windows
 10. On a test machine I got the latest driver directly from Intel, however the upgrade still failed. The issue does not seem to be with a specific Intel driver nor is it all of them. The commonality between the machines is that they are Lenovo AIO Thinkcentres.
 The only driver that is guaranteed to work is the Standard VGA adapter in windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is there a way to Automate the changing the of the display driver through a SCCM task Sequence, a batch file, or PowerShell script? Or if you have another solution I can test I am open to suggestions.</p>

<p>This is for PCs in the medical field, and there are insurance implications if we are not on Windows 10 by Jan. 2020. Windows 7 is favored because people do not like change. Windows 10 is a good OS though they need to work out the Settings and Control Panel
 differences so you do not need to always go back and forth between the two.</p>

<p>If you have old hard drives, then you should diagnostically regularly run HD testing software.&nbsp; Both WD and Seagate have specific testing software that tests their hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of people think that doing Windows disk scans is adequate.&nbsp; It is not.&nbsp; Those scans scan the integrity of the data stored there.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not the physical hardware itself.&nbsp; I do regular checkups using that software on machines with older HD's.</p>

<p>I thought this made more sense here as i am looking into a Windows 7 problem not an SCCM problem. I know how to deploy a .bat or .ps1 via SCCM, but i need to know what those would be from a Windows 7 expert.</p>

<h2>            Геймпад xbox one теряет соединение с windows</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(219, 219, 219, 1)">Здравствуйте. Проблема заключается в том, что недавно приобретенный геймпад теряет соединение с ПК. Происходит это с разными временными
 промежутками, работеает 40 минут, а может и 2, а затем начинает мигать кнопка xbox и геймпад перестает работать. В разделе "bluetooth и другие устройства" так же пропадает значок геймпада. Восстановить связь помогает лишь отсоединение адаптера с последующим
 подключением его или перезагрузка ПК. Window 10 обновлена до последней версии, драйвера геймпада также. Пробовал с более старой версией windows. Устранил все помехи между адаптером и геймпадом, убрал его с железной поверхности, в общем применил все рекомендации
 которые описаны на сайте microsoft, разве что остался телефон и беспроводная мышка как помехи. Результат тот же.&nbsp;</span>

</p><p>My surface is not working with external speakers. I did not know I could use ex. Speakers until my daughter said I could. The speakers work on her computer but not on mine. My computer is one year old nut not used much. I am older and like to listen to music
 with it because of the ease and ability</p>
<p>&nbsp;to hearing anything I wish to hear. It will be great to have the speakers if you could tell me how to make them work. I can not afford to buy a new computer after just one year. I am on a fixed income.</p>

            Hi. 
<br />My name is Edward M. 
<br />I hope to help.- 
<br />
<br />         Before performing these steps, check the date and time of your computer sometimes the downloads produce errors due to the configuration of the system, and once updated or purchased the update of the date, time and time zone where you are, try these steps to solve activation errors:   
<br />
<br />1. Confirm that the device is up to date and running Windows 10, version 1607 or later. Learn to update Windows 10. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-do/help/4027667" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-do/help/4027667</a> 
<br />
<br />2. Use the Activation Problem Solver to solve simple errors. See the following instructions for more details. 
<br />
<br />3. If the error continues, review the following list of error codes and follow the suggested steps to resolve it. 
<br />
<br />4. Make sure the error has not changed. Sometimes, when you run or try to activate the Activation Troubleshooter, they change the error code and the message. If you have changed, look for the new code below and follow the recommended steps.

<p>3 Bug_Checks in those - BCCode: 3B, 18, and c2.</p>
<p>Use the methods such as SFC, CheckDisk, Driver Updates, and others in the troubleshooter<br />
referred to in this link as they will help solve or at least narrow down the issues. After those<br />
you can post the information from BlueScreenView and these other utilities so we can offer<br />
more specific advice. Of course checking with a real computer shop or System Maker's<br />
Support would be a good idea however I would try the possible solutions you can first.</p>
<p>Check this thread for information using BlueScreenView, MyEventViewer and other methods<br />
to troubleshoot BlueScreens - top 3 replies (+1 other).<br />
<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/sometimes-i-get-a-blue-screen-when-using-ie-8/c675b7b8-795f-474d-a1c4-6b77b3fcd990">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/sometimes-i-get-a-blue-screen-when-using-ie-8/c675b7b8-795f-474d-a1c4-6b77b3fcd990</a><br />
<br />
You can use BlueScreenView to paste the BSOD info into a message here.<br />
<br />
VIEW - HTML Report ALL ITEMS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp; Right Click on a BSOD line and select same. Then<br />
copy and paste the lines in to a message here. Be sure and check the filename section.<br />
Also check the time in MyEventViewer for other possible information.<br />
<br />
<br />
===========================================================</p>
<p>Check with these utilities to see if any information can be gathered :<br />
<br />
This is an excellent tool for posting Blue Screen Error Information<br />
<br />
<strong>BlueScreenView</strong> - Free -&nbsp;scans all your minidump files created during 'blue screen of<br />
death' crashes, and displays the information about all crashes in one table.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html</span></a><br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
MyEventViewer can be checked at the time of the BlueScreen (BSOD) to within a second<br />
or so of the time of the BSOD to provide more information as to possible cause - see TIP.<br />
<br />
<strong>MyEventViewer</strong> - Free -&nbsp;a simple alternative to the standard event viewer of Windows.<br />
<strong>TIP</strong> - Options - Advanced Filter allows you to see a time frame instead of the whole file -<br />
set it to a bit before and&nbsp;after the time of the BSOD.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/my_event_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/my_event_viewer.html</span></a><br />
<br />
------------</p>
<p><strong>AppCrashView </strong>- Free -&nbsp;a small utility for Windows Vista and Windows 7 that displays<br />
the details of all application crashes occurred in your system. The crashes information<br />
is extracted from the .wer files created by the Windows Error Reporting (WER) component<br />
of the operating system every time that a crash is occurred. AppCrashView also allows<br />
you to easily save the crashes list to text/csv/html/xml file. <br />

<p>Try removing and reseating all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) - actually<br />
remove and replace - do not just snug (on a PC) and clean out the dust bunnies and&nbsp;vents. On<br />
a laptop about all that can be done is reseat the memory and clean the vents.<br />
<br />
<strong>3b is usually a graphic's driver (display adapter/video driver), other possibilities include<br />
but are not limited to antivirus/antispyware/security programs and even memory (mapping).<br />
<br />
BCCode: 3b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000003b<br />
<br />
Cause</strong></p>
<p>This error has been linked to excessive paged pool usage and may occur due to user-mode graphics drivers crossing over and passing bad data to the kernel code.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 3b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000003b&nbsp; &lt;-- read this link<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.faultwire.com/solutions-fatal_error/SYSTEM-SERVICE-EXCEPTION-0x0000003B-*1074.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.faultwire.com/solutions-fatal_error/SYSTEM-SERVICE-EXCEPTION-0x0000003B-*1074.html</span></a><br />
<br />
==========================================================<br />
<br />
This most often a driver problem so try updating the major drivers, BIOS, and others as you.<br />
Other possibilities include malware and even antivirus/antispyware/security programs and<br />
others. See the driver update methods in the next message when you get to that part of the<br />
troubleshooter and return to the troubleshooter if needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000018</strong></p>
Cause
<p>The reference count of an object is illegal for the current state of the object. Each time a driver uses a pointer to an object, the driver calls a kernel routine to increase the reference count of the object by one. When the driver is done with the pointer,
 the driver calls another kernel routine to decrease the reference count by one.</p>
<p>Drivers must match calls to the routines that increase (<em>reference</em>) and decrease (<em>dereference</em>) the reference count. This bug check is caused by an inconsistency in the object's reference count. Typically, the inconsistency is caused by a
 driver that decreases the reference count of an object too many times, making extra calls that dereference the object. This bug check can occur because an object's reference count goes to zero while there are still open handles to the object. It might also
 occur when the object's reference count drops below zero, whether or not there are open handles to the object.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that the driver matches calls to the routines that increase and decrease the reference count of the object. Make sure that your driver does not make extra calls to routines that dereference the object (see Parameter 2).</p>

<p>The BAD_POOL_CALLER bug check has a value of 0x000000C2. This indicates that the current thread is making a bad pool request.</p>
Important Information If You Have Received a STOP Code
<p>If you have received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer,
 call the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact information for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Contact

<p>The following actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors. </li></ol>
BAD_POOL_CALLER Parameters
<p>The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen. <strong>Parameter 1</strong> indicates the type of violation. The _POOL_TYPE codes are enumerated in<em>Ntddk.h</em>. In particular, 0 indicates nonpaged pool and 1 indicates paged pool.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Items&#47;icons clicked won&#39;t stay on the screen</h2>
                    <p>This is difficult to explain, but here goes,&nbsp; Example if I open a site and then open something else I used to be able to point my mouse to&nbsp; the second item and click it and it would now be on the screen and stay there until I clicked it off or clicked something
 else,but now when I click the item is shows but it won`t stay on the screen</p>
<p>Same thing in the notification area if I put my mouse on an item and click it will show but when I go to touch the item it goes back to the notification area.This just started happing a day ago after Microsoft Tech Support fixed something on my computer
 so they must have made some changes.When I asked them to put everything back the way it was when there through, they must have missed this one thing.I hope someone knows what I`m talking about.</p>

            I'm going to guess that you got a phone call from MS Tech Support? If this is the case, you got scammed! If you didn't call them, but paid this company you will need to call your credit card company and explain the situation to them and hopefully they
 can reverse the charge.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;You will need to reformat and reinstall your computer...AND...you will need to change all your passwords and if you do any online banking you will need to call them too.<br />
<br />
If you search these forums you will find that a LOT of people get these phone calls.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but hope this helps.<br />

<h2>            Child turned 13 and is locked out of live.com account.  Password reset not working</h2>
                    <p>My child turned 13 yesterday.&nbsp; The night before, about 45 min before midnight,&nbsp;I received an email from MSN Parental Controls team (posted below).&nbsp; Since then, neither my daughter, nor I can sign into her account.&nbsp; When we are at the sign in screen, we get
 a message saying that the email account does not exist or the password is incorrect.&nbsp; We have tried the password reset, which lets us choose a new password, but we get the same results when we attempt to sign in again.&nbsp; How can I resolve this issue without
 having to create a new account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear parent or guardian:<br />
<br />
According to the birth date provided for your child's Microsoft online account,&nbsp;[name] is now 13 years old. You are therefore no longer able to manage permissions for the&nbsp;[name] account through Account Services, and your child may create a new account without
 your permission.<br />
<br />
United States law requires websites and services to obtain parental permission to collect, use, or share personal information from children under 13. Because this child is now 13, you can no longer manage permission for this child for Microsoft online services.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Updating to Windows 10 from 8.1 fails both in WU and MCT</h2>
                    <p>I had reserved my update and am now trying to update. The WU (Windows Update) downloads 2.3 Gb and then brings a failure, usually some 0xC1...... or 0x80....... error which doesnt show anything useful in the help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a few tries and following all the steps mentioned in various help topics (deleting download folders, running diagnotic and repair tools, etc) no success at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I am trying the Media Creation Tool, with pretty much the same result but different errors. Last one I got is 0x80200001 - 0x90017. I tried both updating and downloading the ISO. Neither works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine is a pretty new Dell which came with Windows 8.1 installed. All recent windows updates are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am getting pretty tired of downloading a dozen times 2.3 Gb just to have it thrown away by badly designed tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I proceed now? Or is that the point where I install whatever-Linux?</p>

<p>Well, I have to say that it is your choice to go down the Media Creation Tool path. The conditions for using MCT are made quite clear by Microsoft: this is only for "tech savvy" users. So use it, by all means, but don't complain afterwards if it takes some
 time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My advice would be to first run the&nbsp;Windows Update Automated Troubleshooter (see&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/windows-update-issues/en-us), and let it fix possible Windows Update errors. If all's well, you can then continue downloading and installing
 Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend this road, as I don't consider you to be a&nbsp;"tech savvy" user. Don't feel offended, but my argument is that if you were, you would have gotten that download link a long time ago and certainly not have unsuccesfully downloaded the image twenty
 times.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Haha! Not even born then; you make me laugh! I'm from far before Windows even existed, far before DOS existed, but that's nothing to be boastful about. But if you have worked with previous versions of Windows, you must know that things have hardly ever worked
 as advertized in the past. So your assertion that you "still expect tools to work as announced" is, frankly, preposterous.</p>

</p><p>I don't care much about reputations, but go by the facts. It took me a few seconds to find out how to download the offline installer for Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hint 1: use the internet to find Microsoft's download page. It is&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO</p>
<p>Hint 2: using a PC for the download you might be redirected; to access the downloads you have to trick the server into thinking you're on a mobile platform. &nbsp;If you use Google chrome press F12, then Ctrl+Shift+M to change the device to a mobile phone, e.g.
 the LG OPtimus 70. Then press F5 to refresh. You will not be redirected to the MCT (Media Creation Tool) any longer but can download the iso.</p>

            Quick internet search on that file vbocsot.eptiliv shows that it is used for a game called Pokerstars.net.
<br />Did you have it installed at one time and then uninstall it?
<br />It might have not removed all the files properly.
<br />What are you trying to do when you get the "Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file."?

<p>Sarah:&nbsp; Thanks for the reply, I have never installed a game called Pokerstars.net.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do play some of the Microsoft games.&nbsp; As you may&nbsp;know Microsoft runs "ads" for other games maybe Pokerstars.net was in that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message has been coming up for about a week when I go to start Windows.&nbsp; I deleted the Nmus folder as well as the file and restarted my system, but it is still giving me the error.&nbsp; I double checked programs featured in the control panel, but did not
 spot anything.</p>

            This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.<br />You can try a couple things.<br /><br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.<br />Restart the computer.<br /><br />If that doesn't work then try this, <br /><br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.<br /><br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. <br />Press Enter key after each command:<br /><br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth<br /><br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth<br /><br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. <br />Restart your computer.

            If you simply deleted the Nmus folder, that's probably why you're getting the error. The file is referenced in the registry and you've deleted the file, but not the registry reference.

    <title>Username folder replaced with Username Documents folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlrcraw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Username folder replaced with Username Documents folder</h2>
                    <p>My PC: Up to date Windows 8.1 Lenovo Laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I moved my Documents folder from C: \Users\Carl to my G:drive (USB) using the properties/location tab in the Documents Folder. After a few minutes, I decided that I did not want it there and went to the Documents properties/location tab again to
 relocate it back to its default location. Instead of pressing the 'Restore Default' button, I selected to have it move to "C:\Users\Carl" - my username, then pressed the 'Move...' button. &nbsp;The system alerted me that "If you proceed with redirection you will
 not be able to separate them or restore default location". I selected 'Yes' to the move... Big mistake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It changed my &nbsp;'C:\Users\Carl' username to 'C:\Users\Documents' and combined all folders and files in both directories into the C:\Users\Documents directory. When I eventually tried to undo the problem by going to properties/location and pressing the 'Restore
 Default' button, it would not allow it with the alert "Can't move the folder because there is a folder in the same location that can't be redirected. Access is denied". I also tried the "Move..." button to a different location on the drive but got a failure
 message as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user C:\Users\Carl still exists when I check the file path and check with command line 'dir' and 'cd'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I correct? Is there a symbolic link somewhere that can be reset so that I can separate the two directories and their folders and files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Carl</p>

            <p>The root problem is that you specified <em>C:\Users\Carl</em> as the documents location, but the correct location would have been
<em>C:\Users\Carl\Documents</em> (a <em>Documents</em> folder inside the <em>Carl</em> folder).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to fix this is to run a quick system restore.&nbsp; This won't hurt any of your files, nothing will be moved. Only the correct shell storage and location settings will be fixed and resolved.&nbsp; It only takes about 2 minutes, and you can even undo it
 if you don't like the result, so it is by far the easiest, safest, and fastest way to fix it. See
<a href="http://cmdrkeene.com/quickly-repair-pc-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">option #1 here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want to do that, it's also available as a registry edit. But I really recommend using a RSTRUI command described there first.</p>
