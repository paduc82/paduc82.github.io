    <title>I can&#39;t delete folders in outlook 2010 and when I move a - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I can&#39;t delete folders in outlook 2010 and when I move a subfolder, all of the subfolders in that folder disappear and reappear later</h2>
                    <p>When I delete an empty subfolder, it goes to trash. &nbsp; But when I try to delete from trash, I am asked to review the properties, because I can't delete it, and the alternatives in properties don't seem to even apply,. much less do anything.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, when I
 move a subfolder, the entire folder disappears, and then after closing and opening outlook, it returns.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not good at all. &nbsp;&nbsp; The underlying email account is gmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this program for years, with no problems like this.&nbsp; I searched for help on outlook and found nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I searched on google and some people in 2011 had this problem of not being able to delete folders, and got the same prompt of going to properties,
 which didn't help.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; One person responding on this issue (Russ Valentine) asked specific questions on what the person with the problem had done, and seemed to think the person did some kind of improper upgrade. &nbsp; My answer to any question on what I did
 is "Nothing as far as I know, but probably something."&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever I did, I want to undo or fix.&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't understand or implement his suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think he assumed more knowledge of the system than I have.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>I also have what is apparently a more current problem of disappearing emails and folders.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I don't get a message about syncing.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, that could be the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; A month ago my iphone said it couldn't sync something, but that seemed to go away
 when I got a new software update for the phone.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <p>This is the way it was set originally, with IMAP and POP enabled.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know why.&nbsp;&nbsp; It apparently has worked up till now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, now, as I said, I have no duplication, only the problem when I try to delete.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you read what I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No problem
 with duplication, only a problem with deleting folders.&nbsp;&nbsp; What does the IMAP POP issue have to do with this.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may have something to do with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I supposed to guess.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there is no "Reply" link below the post that is identified as a reply link.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, it says that the reply can be viewed on Microsoft Community.&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't say that is how to respond.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another way to respond would be to hit reply on the email.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 It turns out you can only reply by first looking at the reply on Microsoft Community.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fine, but there is nothing on the reply that says to do it this way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Does Readyboost work and for what PC&#39;s&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have a pc with 12 gb of RAM installed with it, But I could use some more, And then I heard about virtual RAM with ReadyBoost,</p>
<p>So I grabbed myself a 16gb Flash Driver and used it for Readyboost and it said I could use 15139 mb aka 15gb for Readyboost on that Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my question is, If I use it for Readyboost, What will it do to my Computer? Will it harm my PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will it actually give me 15 gb Additional RAM?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it actually work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Dear Regards,</p>
<p>Vince.<br />

            Hello zenfluer, <br />
<br />
I do not have the information with me, but it sounds like you are very new to Outlook.com, thus, you have a very low sending quota of just 10 emails per day.
<br />
<br />
<strong>How can I raise the limit? </strong><br />
<br />
1. add phone number, alternative email address and enable two-step verification in your Microsoft account
<br />
2. continuing to use your account normally <br />
3. building a good reputation within Outlook.com e-mail algorithm system <br />
4. upgrading to ad-free Outlook.com <br />
<br />
<strong>What is the sending limit?</strong> <br />
<br />
It is anywhere from 10 to 300 e-mails per day varies by account, but maximum 100 recipients per e-mail.
<br />
<br />
<strong>So how can I get my privilege restored?</strong> <br />
<br />
You have to wait until the (invisible) time count down that limits your sending limit is over or do the aforementioned verification:

            more importantly, is there anyway to copy the sms to the pc and save them there? i mean be able to read them (and not just for back up) without the need to plug the phone everytime. we do have important messages we need to keep.<br />
<br />
i hope they add a feature like that in the pc suite.

            You can copy the sms's to your memory card by selecting the memroy card as the preffered memory in use for messages in message settings.<br />
<br />
Measages&gt; options&gt; settings&gt; other&gt; memory in use.<br />
<br />
If you use the back-up/restore option on PC suite nd bak up your messages you can view them later in the file back-up used to store the files in. The file path will display just before the backup is made so take note of it then later go into it, fnd the messages
 folder and you should see all your sms's there and you can open them and read them individually.

    <title>PC-suite and new phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elukka  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC-suite and new phone</h2>
                    I have been using a 6610 with the DKU-5 cable and I have the PC-suite 5.1. This all works OK. Now I have a new phone: 6300 and the data cable DKE-2. I'd like to transfer the data from my old phone to my new phone. The question is how.<br />
<br />
It says on the download pages, that the high numbers of the PC-suite version number must be the same as the cable diver's, but the latest DKU-5 driver is 5.1. I haven,t found the DKE-2 driver 5.1.<br />
<br />
Does the latest version of PC-suite understand the backup data produced by PC-suite 5.1? Is there a way to get both cables to work with the same PC-suite version? Even if different times? I have no IR nor Bluetooth available.

            CAn you link me to the download page where it states something about the cable version etc. sounds strange?<br />
<br />
Ayways, if you still have both phones, my suggestion:<br />
<br />
1)Make sur eyou keep the DKU-5 cable drive rin you pc<br />
2) uninstall PC suite 5.1<br />
3) install PC Suite 6.85.14.1<br />
4) backup your old phone with new pc suite<br />
5) use the new pc suite to transfer the backup up data from old phone to new one.<br />
<br />
(BTW, you are right, backup made with 5.1 is not most likely compliant with pc suite 6.85 whic you need withyour new phone)<br />
<br />
AND before you update pc suite, make sure you move all the data you can with old pc suite to pc (are there some files in old phone gallery, move them, sync your contacts to outlook or windows address book etc. don't only rely on the backup function.You know,
 better be safe than sorry.

<br />
Have you ever come across any download site of the older versions of the PC-suite? I just wonder if there is some old enough version that still happens to support DKU-5 while already supporting DKE-2.<br />
<br />
Any idea why the PC-suite download is started by selecting the phone? Do I need to install PC Suite 6.85.14.1 for 6610 to download stuff from the old phone then uninstall it and install PC Suite 6.85.14.1 for 6300 to upload the data to the new phone? If so,
 do you think that the PC Suite 6.85.14.1 for 6300 understands the backup data from PC Suite 6.85.14.1 for 6610?<br />

I recommend you uninstall first the new one properly through add and remove programs<br />
<br />
(ensure you uninstall PC Suite, PC Connectivity Solution and even Connectivity cable driver)<br />
<br />
Boot pc, then install suite5.8

            It doesn't seem to support 6300 nor DKE2.<br />
What's the idea?<br />
Is there a DKE-2 driver ver. 5.8 somewhere?<br />
Does PC suite 5.8 accept the latest cable driver that includes DKE-2?<br />
Does PC suite 5.8 accept 6300 even if not specified?<br />
<br />
I know, all would be much simpler if I bought the CA-42.<br />
It's just that the phones and the cables are owned by my employer, so I'm not very keen on investing my own money there.

            I haven't tried it yet. Do you mean that the newest PC Suite loaded for 6300 can also handle 6610, and both DKE-2 and DKU-5 (drivers separately installed beforehand)? It says somewhere on the PC suite web pages that version 6.4 (was it?) onwards the DKU-5
 is no longer supported.

            Yes...just try it.<br />
(I think that PC Suite update/install DKE-2 cable driver but DKU-5 cable driver must be installed beforehand)

            Hi BalamuruganGanesan,<br />
<br />
Sorry to have kept you waiting.<br />
<br />
Based on our research, there is no official information released to introduce the concurrent calls limit for a pure Cloud PBX environment. However, we do have an official article about the concurrent calls in a Skype for Business Cloud Connector Edition deployment:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt605227.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Plan for Skype for Business Cloud Connector Edition</a>.<br />
<br />
And if I could find the detailed information about the concurrent calls capability for a pure Cloud PBX environment, I will update this thread to let you know.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for your understanding.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Allen

<h2>            access to my live.be blocked</h2>
                    <p>Hi gentlemen,</p>
<p>
I'm desperate in trying to recover access to my email account @live.be. I was using the authenticator app and apparently that one sent wrong code while I was trying to connect. I then tryied to get a code via sms or gmail, but a pop up window said that the
 system was temporarily unavailale and I had to try again later. This last now for 2 weeks and my account is blocked apparently because I tried to connect too many times with a wrong password!!! and in addition to that, because I was using the 2d authentication
 level, filling the form to recover the account is useless! I used that account for probably 15 years and now I cannot access any of my contacts nor the old emails.
<br />
I think I read all pages available&nbsp; in trying to find a solution, and found no real answer. Thank you to the community for the help you could bring!<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Teams website stuck in Continuous Loop</h2>
                    <p>We have enabled Microsoft Teams for our O365 tenent. &nbsp;When I try to go to&nbsp;https://teams.microsoft.com from IE, and Edge, &nbsp;it creates a continuous loop of a page "Loading Microsoft Teams" than pages flashes white than starts the process all over, this is
 never-ending.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use Chrome it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's quite strange that all the documentation indicates how to turn it on yet I had to find out in a forum the actual site where you can use teams is&nbsp;https://teams.microsoft.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess an icon will not be published in the 365 portal until its final?</p>

            <p>Hi Bzwart,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, Microsoft Teams supports the web client on Microsoft Edge 12+, IE 11+. You may check the version of browsers.<br />
And until now, you need access Microsoft Team via the link, the channel icon will be released in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the problem of login to Microsoft Team with ADFS in Android, we need do some test. Any update will be post back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi Bzwart,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you login to Microsoft Teams with ADFS in Android now?</p>
<p>I tested my account with ADFS 3.0, when I logged in to Teams in Android, the screen kept loading, then I closed the Teams App from backend, then re-open it, it worked. You can try it to check the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, you may test whether this account can be logged into Microsoft Teams website via this link:</p>
<p><a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://teams.microsoft.com/_</a></p>
<p>If the above don’t work, please provide the following information for troubleshooting:</p>
<ol>
<li>The version of Android.</li><li>A screenshot of “white screen”. Is there any prompt?</li><li>The version of ADFS.</li><li>If you cannot log into Microsoft Teams website, have you enabled Microsoft Teams of your organization?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Hans</p>

            <p>Having the same loop issue here. Not sure what IE setting is causing it in the first place, but removing the IE policies that our domain has resolves the issue. Placing the computer back under the policy after does not cause the issue to return.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, it's not realistic for all of our machines to be removed from the corporate policy, hit the teams.microsoft.com site and be placed back under policy.</p>

            Hi Thomas,
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your sharing.</p>

<p>
</p><p>About the issue of log into Microsoft Teams with Android mobile app, I need collect the following information, please reply when you have time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you login to Microsoft Teams with ADFS in Android now?</p>
<p>I tested my account with ADFS 3.0, when I logged in to Teams in Android, the screen kept loading, then I closed the Teams App from backend, then re-open it, it worked. You can try it to check the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you may test whether this account can be logged into Microsoft Teams website via this link:</p>
<p><a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://teams.microsoft.com/_</a></p>
<p>If the above don’t work, please provide the following information for troubleshooting:</p>
<ol>
<li>The version of Android.</li><li>A screenshot of “white screen”. Is there any prompt?</li><li>The version of ADFS.</li><li>If you cannot log into Microsoft Teams website, have you enabled Microsoft Teams of your organization?</li></ol>

                    How do I make up&nbsp; a group list, like "neighbors"?&nbsp; When I tried to link them I could link some, but the screen disappeared.&nbsp; All the names I linked are no longer on my "people" list, so it appears they were removed to be linked.&nbsp; Problem is I can find

<h2>            How to delete all the standard Templates in Word and Replace them all with bespoke temps</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry if this is in the wrong topic..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I work for a small organisation that wants to delete all the standard Templates in Word and Replace them all with bespoke temps for our company. My question is how woud I remove the original templates and save our own..... Also are you able to set the default
 location for templates to a network location instead of locally on each machine?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Win7&nbsp;and word 2010 but our users are on XP and word 2003, we are migrating them over to&nbsp;2010 very soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

            <p>I assume that you can uninstall Microsoft's templates via Office setup in Control Panel, but I haven't tried doing so. Note, however, that you cannot get rid of the Normal template (the blank document template).</p>
<p>If you store your custom templates in the user templates folder, you can get access to them by adding the
<strong>New Document or Template</strong> button to the Quick Access Toolbar.</p>

            Following up on Stefan's post, in Office 2003 it was possible to uninstall the built-in templates through the Control Panel (Add/Remove Programs on Windows XP, or Programs &amp; Features on Vista or Windows 7). That version has a subcategory under Word for
 "Wizards and Templates" that you can mark as Not Available. Office 2007 and 2010 don't have that subcategory, and the capability is gone.<br />
<br />
To add to Suzanne's comments, there's a reason you should never assign the User Templates location in Word to a folder that's common to two or more users: Word requires the Normal.dotm template to be in that folder. Because Normal.dotm is a sort of personal
 scratchpad for all sorts of styles, macros, and possibly building block entries, and there can never be more than one Normal.dotm file in that folder, each user's changes will step on the toes of the other users. For a common collection of templates, use only
 the Workgroup Templates location.<br />
<br />
It isn't necessary to add the Workgroup Templates folder's shortcut to the User Templates folder -- any templates in the Workgroup Templates folder will automatically appear in the File &gt; New &gt; My Templates list, mixed in with those in the User Templates folder.<br />

            Unless it was something on my end (though Mike P had the same issue), it looks like this is fixed in Build 10122. &nbsp;My system just finished updating to it and I did another System Image Backup. &nbsp;This time, it took 22 minutes.

    <title>the new Windows 8 phone cannot open Excel password protected files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fritz69---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            the new Windows 8 phone cannot open Excel password protected files</h2>
                    
<p>When trying to open password Microsoft Office 2007 Excel protected files, the new Lumia 920 simply displays the message: "<strong>Can't open</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Password-protected files can't be opened"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this is a serious issue, as I am trying to use this phone for work mainly...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way around this? Maybe we need to purchase a special app to be able to open such files.</p>

            Not too sure if there are any alternative Office apps in the Store, but don't think there is....<br />

            Nope! I just gave up. I am still using the phone, and I still can't open Excel files with a few cells protected by a password. I didn't even bother to try to open a file that requires a password to open it.

 night I had an epihany, Microsoft will never do this, they want to hook you into Office 365 and the cloud...............so you clever people out there, show them that there is another, no MS way........please don't let me down&nbsp; ;-)</p>

<p>I don't want to nitpick and all, but it's actually the other way around, the Nokia Suite method is a hack and basically modifies the Outlook data files directly, it's not the 'right' way&nbsp;nor does it actually sync with Outlook at all, the way Windows Phone
 does this is. Both Outlook and Windows Phone sync with and between the same source. This is exactly the way Outlook is supposed to be used as in the end Outlook is a client for a service just like the phone is and not a server in and of itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You do not duplicate your Outlook to the cloud, you sync an account in Outlook with it's server which is outlook.com (or any other Exchange Active Sync server). Unless your data/items are linked to this account they do not sync to this account at all, just
 like&nbsp;this works on the phone where, while shown in a merged list, all contacts and calendar items still only sync with their respective accounts. Remove an account and all data relating to that account goes away too, just like it should.</p>

                    <p>I am running Window 7 64 bit with ie 10 on a computer with an I7 chip and 16 gig memory.&nbsp; I have been making comments on Foxnews.com and there is usually a "LOGIN" option on the right hand side of the top of the page of their web site.&nbsp; Starting today, when
 I select foxnews.com, that "LOGIN" option is missing.&nbsp; I can't login to the site to make comments on articles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I use my wifes computer, the "LOGIN" option is there and everything works fine.&nbsp; Something must be configured wrong in IE10 but I can't figure it out.&nbsp; I use CCleaner and have cookies from foxnews enabled.&nbsp; I have Norton Internet Security 2013 installed

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Did the issue started right after installing Internet Explorer 10?<br />
<br />
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to follow the steps provided below and update us on the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Let’s turn on the compatibility view in</span></b><span> <b>
Internet Explorer and check.</b></span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the following link.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-10</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above method does not work, go to next method.</span></p>
&nbsp; <br />
<p><b><span>Method 2: </span></b><b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Try to open Internet Explorer 10 in no add-ons mode and check if can access the website.</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Start</span></strong> button, and select
<strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">All Programs</span></strong>.</span></p>

<strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">System Tools.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If your browser appears to be working properly in Internet Explorer (No Add-ons) mode, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will allow you to figure out
 which add-on is causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Refer to this link:</span></b><span> Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer</span></p>

<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If the above method does not work, go to next method.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 3: Reset Internet Explorer settings and check the functionality.</span></b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</span></a></p>

<p><b><span>NOTE:</span></b><span> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings.
 We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply Babu V.&nbsp; No, I had not just installed Internet Explorer 10.&nbsp; That had been installed for months.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried all of your suggestions and the problem still exists.&nbsp; I went back to my second computer and logged off of the foxnews.com site and have the same problem on that computer also.&nbsp; It is a Dell All in one, using IE 10 and windows 7 64 bit also, same
 as my primary.&nbsp; Based on that, it appears that it might be something that Fox news is doing and I have sent them a query.&nbsp; I don't expect to get a response until Monday at the earliest and maybe later.&nbsp; I will let you know if they are aware of a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Desktop IE10 doesn&#39;t display Bing animated wallpapers or Amazon Cloud player</h2>
                    I'm using IE10. In the Modern UI it shows the Bing page for today as an animated background image fine. On the Desktop version of IE10, it's just a large grey box. I also have other sites like Amazon's Cloud player, which recommends using Internet Explorer
 for uploading songs, but nothing shows up on the web page but a top header. If I use the Modern UI the whole page displays but when I try to upload the music, it switches to Desktop IE but nothing is there. I can listen to the music in IE10 Modern UI, but
 if I go to the desktop it stops playing until I go back to the Modern UI again. I tried doing a reset of Internet explorer as suggested with some other answers in this forum, but still no difference. You'd think Bing would work in Internet Explorer 10!

                    I have a Dell Inspiron and recently had a harddrive failure that required a new harddrive and for windows to be reinstalled from the back up disk. I did that, then immediately updated to Windows 10, since my backup disc only installed Windows 8.1. Now

<h2>            I E 11 freeze on opening</h2>
                    <p>Following Windows 7 updates on 15th August on opening IE 11 a dialog box "Choose your homepage and search settings" now opens with buttons for either Microsoft settings or Your current settings, a link to "Learn more" and a greyed out box for "Done", but
 no close button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The settings buttons can be selected, but neither the Learn more link nor the Done box (which remains greyed out)&nbsp;will respond. As there is no close button the dialog box cannot be removed and IE is effectively frozen.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>i have not been able to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>the windows troubleshooting view all panel does not have Internet explorer performance in the list and nothing else seems appropriate.</p>
<p>i can't access the what to do when internet explorer isn't working because it needs to access internet explorer to work and it then opens the window which freezes up!,</p>
<p>i can, incidentally, open internet explorer from the bottom bar whilst the frozen one is still open so that 2 are open at the same time by this is not ideal.</p>
<p>i think the problem arose since one of the recent windows updates, possibly the one on the 15th August.</p>
<p>Can you suggest what else I can do?</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>shirley</p>

            I agree with you Alan. Microsoft's suggestions to fix it didn't work, they didn't seem to understand the problem which they should have been able to straight away and that it was&nbsp;one of their updates that caused it in the first place. I wasn't impressed!&nbsp;

<h2>            iexplore.exe runs in background</h2>
                    
<p>Is this normal?</p>
<p>I use win 7 HP x64 HUN and IE 8 x86 HUN (this opens from taskbar), installed with Windows 7.</p>
<p>When I close IE, everything seems OK, but I see in the task manager, that the two iexplore.exe*32 processes are still running, with zero CPU usage, and a normal RAM usage (the bigger is about 14-15000 K). When I open IE again, other two processes open etc.
 These can be shuted down from the task manager only, or with reboot. When I open IE after reboot, IE almost every time tries to open the last opened webpage because of an irregular exit from IE last time, but it's a blank page - this my "home" page too.</p>
<p>I'm using the newest Norton 360 v4 permanently, and I often scan the PC with free Avira, ESET online scanner, Spybot S&amp;D, Ad-Aware, Malwarebytes Antimalware and Windows Defender, and everything looks clear. I uploaded all four iexplore.exe found in the PC
 (libraries: program files, program files (x86), system/syswow (or something like that) system/amd64 (or what, because I have Intel Core i5) to virustotal.com, but all four seem to be clear.</p>
<p>The IE8 x64 doesn't do that, but it has no add-ons at all. Can an add-on cause it? I have nothing special: Norton IPS and toolbar, Java, Flash, Reader, add-ons for MSI and Gigabyte update etc. McAffee siteadvisor was installed on my PC too, but I uninstalled
 it. All of them was installed after installing IE8 with windows.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>I know, that one iexplore.exe*32 runs for each tab and one for the frame. My problem is that sometimes (not always) two of them (the frame's and one tab's) keep running in the background after I close Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>The HP's webpage printing utility was the guilty add-on. I killed it, and now everything seems OK.</p>

    <title>Paste Special Problem - Mac PPT 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markpriest5910  say:</h3>
<h2>            Paste Special Problem - Mac PPT 2016</h2>
                    
<p>I've recently upgraded to Office 365 and Office 2016 for Mac.<br />
<br />
In my job I am required to put together a lot of PowerPoint presentations, which have a lot of images, to email out daily, but since upgrading from 2011 Office, the option of "Paste Special &gt; JPEG" has disappeared, leaving only the options to paste PDF or TIFF.<br />
<br />
This means that even when compressing all images in the file, the size of my presentations is now almost 10x larger than last week when using Office 2011. Any advice on how to get "Paste Special &gt; JPEG" or how else to get my files back to a manageable size?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
When you Copy, it's the source program in combination with the OS that determines what variants are placed on the Clipboard [a service of the OS].<br />
<br />
When you go to Paste, the program being used assesses what's being presented on the Clipboard &amp; in which ways it can interpret that information.<br />
<br />
The 'change' you're experiencing could be due to a difference in either or all of the 3 participants -- Source data format, Target program interpretation (in this case, it's Office), OS Clipboard management.<br />
<br />
As an example of this behavior, I tried copying a JPEG via the Preview app and used Paste Special in PowerPoint. The only option I got was to Paste the image as TIFF.<br />
<br />
But when I first paste the image normally into Word, and then re-copy the image from Word to PowerPoint, the option to Paste Special as a JPEG showed up.<br />
<br />
As a workaround, you may first copy the image into an Office document and then re-copy and paste it into PowerPoint using Paste Special.<br />
<br />
I know that this is not a perfect workaround; if you are unsatisfied, we’d suggest posting to the

Office 2016 for Mac forum</a> as this is a client related issue and they are experts in this field.</p>

<p>So I tried your method of first pasting the image into word, and copying and that (finally) enabled to me paste the image as a jpeg. So it must be an issue with Powerpoint. You are right that it is not a perfect workaround, when adding this process will
 triple the time this previously simple step took (which I need to do dozens of times an hour with work).</p>
