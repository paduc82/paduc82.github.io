    <title>Limit number of records in a report - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Limit number of records in a report</h2>
                    <p>I am using a report to show the top records based on a value in a field. I would like the report to limit the results to the top 50. &nbsp;I am getting the data from a query, and the query is used by other reports and forms, so using the query to limit the results
 is less than optimal. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to limit the results of a report with-in the report it self?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this is much appreciated.</p>

Hi, today i topped up&nbsp; with&nbsp; skype account&nbsp; with 10 euro. Later i&nbsp; tried to login but something appeared to be wrong. After several resets of my password i can log in again. But now it appears that i have 0 euro. So, i lost the 10 euro. How to get that back
 again and how can i prevent that the same happens next time? Thank you!</p>

<h2>            3G&#47;4G data stops working all of a sudden</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have a lumia 640 LTE that after 6 months started having the issue on topic.</p>
<p>During normal operation,&nbsp;I can tell the internet traffic is ok&nbsp;from the tiny arrows on the mobile signal reception bars. All of the sudden the data transfer stops working,&nbsp;I can't surf any web page and those arrow disappear: not even one bit of data gets
 transferred anymore!</p>
<p>Switching the internet data off and back on, or toggling the flight mode on and off doesn't work: all I&nbsp;can do is turning&nbsp;off the&nbsp;phone and restart it and everything starts working again.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed is that this failure happens when I'm moving, so when the phone switches from a cell to another (like while I'm on the bus, on my car or even taking a long walk). If I'm not moving (e.g. I'm at home) the internet traffic never fails.</p>
<p>I guess a poor man's attempt to fix this easy is to do a hard reset of the system, but I can't even back up my phone: the backup procedure fails at 99% because&nbsp;is says that it can't access OneDrive...needless to say, when I log in OneDrive through the app,&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I
 can.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anybody have a good hint for me? Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hi Lex, thank you for answering!<br />
Sorry, I forgot to mention that I left the stock Windows 8.1 Update 2 OS.</p>
<p>More precisely, the OS version is 8.10.15148.160</p>
<p>The data transmission started failing less than one month ago and I didn't do any change in the settings before, as in general I've never done any after the first set-up.</p>

Note that you should not
 touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears).</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I've already tried that before and it didn't work.</p>
<p>I have to report that in this combination of device/OS the soft reset can be performed holding down just the power button; holding it down together with the VOL- button doesn't change the outcome.</p>
<p>The good news is that the automatic backup system succeeded in creating backup file and save it to onedrive! Now I am&nbsp;going to try&nbsp;a deep reset: crossing fingers!</p>

            <p>Bummer not even deep resetting works :(</p>
<p>I think another attempt could be&nbsp;deep resetting&nbsp;the system again and not restore any backup: if the issue doesn't show up again with the factory configuration, then it's&nbsp;up to the&nbsp;settings.</p>
<p>In that case though, I wouldn't know how to do to retrieve all my stuff, because I don't have a backup older than 10 days! I'd have to start all over again from the jump...</p>
<p>Do you have anything&nbsp;less destructive&nbsp;to suggest?</p>
<p>It's amazing, sometimes&nbsp;I see it happen in real time: you have a full 5 bars&nbsp;intensity of&nbsp;signal, it keeps on telling you if you're&nbsp;connected to&nbsp;a 3G or a 4G network, but the upstreaming/downstreaming arrows disappear in a blink of an eye and you get no
 network traffic! The only way to make it come back is to reboot, and you know this is not the fastest rebooter of the west!</p>

<p>By the way, I restored the phone to the factory settings and now it's all right; I had to re-do all my settings manually, as If I restored a backup I would have restored the issue too, but it hasn't been long. All my data was in the SD card!</p>
<p>No clue on what caused that...</p>

            <p>I have the same issue with Rift. &nbsp;I can run Archage without issue, and Trove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not think the problem is with Glyph.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really want to play Rift, and can't... &nbsp;so I did some "digging" and I have some ideas. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One theory I have is version numbers: &nbsp;this new build of windows went from version 6.4.* to 10</p>
<p>but that is not the only thing that changed it's version numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the directx dll files in the system32 dir updated their driver version too. &nbsp;From the old 6.3.9600.0 to 10.0.9926 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if that is the exact problem or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I actually copied all the directx dll files from a Win 8.1 System32 folder into the Rift folder hoping they would get loaded instead of the default ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if Trion Worlds "hardcoded" the version of the directx library's and that is the issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, &nbsp;these are just my thoughts and ideas... I could be completely wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have other ideas ?</p>

            <p>Ok, I think I have the problem figured out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied all my DIrectx dll files from the Syswow64 folder to my Win 8.1 machine running Rift.</p>
<p>I put the dlls in the Rift directory so the game would load my newer files, and an error came up.</p>

<p>Well, there is news and maybe a reason why we are still waiting for the software update...Nokia is supposedly scrapping Maemo 5 and going with the new MEEGO. Hopefully we WILL get something by the end of the month. &nbsp;I really expect a lot from this mobile
 device and I think finally Nokia will not let us down! &nbsp;BRING ON THE MEEGO!!!! &nbsp;check out this link to the info...</p>

<p>That's good news, there was some deliberation amongst users that n900 would be ditched for meego so it's nice to see we'll get the update (provided it doesn't cause a bunch of problems).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This won't happen this month though... it won't happen this half of the year i'm certain of that, and i doubt it's the reason the UK hasn't had the firmware update because meego will be worldwide, not just for the UK, and nokia has given uk updates months
 later than the rest of the world for quite some time now</p>

<p>Interesting article, however i agree with rich in that i don't believe this is the reason behind the UK not receiving existing firmware upgrades.&nbsp; I also agree we're not going to see this alleged new OS on this phone anytime soon either...maybe at the end
 of the year (fast approaching June and i doubt we'd even see it by then)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing i am wondering though, as this is a new OS, doesn't this mean everything on our phones will be wiped???&nbsp; and what does that mean for any existing backups we've done?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guess y'all better start making notes of what you've been installing!!</p>

<p>I would imagine it depends how closely linked to maemo 5 it is. If it's maemo + some other pieces, it shouldn't impact our backups, like the Symbian advancements didn't affect the predecessors. But if it's a whole new OS like maemo was to symbian, then yeah,
 we'll be starting from scratch again in which case noting apps would be pointless because there wouldn't be any to download! But from what i've gathered, it's Nokia and intel, Nokia are bringing maemo 6 to the table so with any luck it would be an easy transition.
 Actually i'm not sure it would be possible to do an update OTA to a whole new OS that isn't closely linked to maemo 5, but i could be wrong on that.</p>
<p>Either way, we'll have plenty of time to learn. Me saying not this half of the year was extremely conservative, i wouldn't be at all surprised if we get told this won't happen until 2011. Personally, i'd be happy with that too. This will be a major, major
 update and i'd rather they take all the time they need to get it as market-ready as possible, especially as this will be THE first time it gets used publicly and bugs will be apparent from day one</p>

<p>I bet my only £1 in my right cheek pocket that it will never greet the N900. Just look at the timescales of nokia bringing new phones out.</p>

<p>Meego will run all current Meamo apps so yes it will be a whole new OS, but we will not have to "start over". &nbsp;That is the beauty of MeeGo....it is a hybrid or a blend of Maemo and Moblin technologies and will run current and a whole new breed of apps and
 services. &nbsp;I dont know how it is in the UK...I am living in the US and updates are pretty good. &nbsp;I think we will see something this year because they really want to get this started and going, so I believe they are working really hard to at least test MeeGO
 1 out on the N900 users...it will be exciting...hope for the best...Nokia might surprise all of us...</p>

<p>I'd be surprised/concerned if MeeGo arrived that early at the party... unless it had been cooking for a long time before the announcement, it would seem unlikely that it's ready yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then again, if it's just a case of taking the best bits from the two systems, then nothing new's really being created (bar a few bits inevitably) so I guess it wouldn't be
<em>that</em>&nbsp;long 'til it's ready for the public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much more than that, though, I'd like to see decent Ovi Maps Navigation for the Maemo/MeeGo platform, plus the other obvious improvements needed (maybe they're just gonna build them into MeeGo and give us that, rather than build them into Maemo and then
 replace it with MeeGo, which would make more sense....?)</p>

<p>At first it will not be a finished, fully functional MeeGo replacement for Maemo, no. Actually, the initial MeeGo build for the N900 may be (likely will be) so basic as to not include a GUI at all, be CLI access only. At most maybe a basic GUI and some simple
 apps. It won't be anywhere near ready for end users.&nbsp; It's meant <em>only</em> as a starting point for software developers and/or a community-supported MeeGo for the N900, should an 'official' Nokia-built full release of MeeGo for the N900 never happen (it
 could, yet-to-be-determined).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this is still <em>very</em> good news and <em>very</em> important.&nbsp; Even though Nokia has not yet committed themselves to releasing a
<em>fully completed</em> 'official' MeeGo OS on the N900, it's still good news because Nokia is doing the heavy lifting of getting the basic MeeGo OS running on the N900, saving the MeeGo/Maemo community a
<em>lot </em>of work. And it gives software developers interested in writing MeeGo apps an actual device (N900) to work with that has MeeGo actually loaded on it. So it's a big step towards both MeeGo on the N900 and more software on the N900.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In reality, MeeGo on the N900 is overhyped and not really needed as far as the usefulness of the N900 is concerned. From a N900 user point of view Qt 4.6 being ported to Maemo 5 is the really important thing.&nbsp; That enables basic compatibility between Maemo,
 MeeGo, Symbian - any apps written with Qt 4.6.&nbsp; And that will happen very shortly with the next update to Maemo 5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much more information: <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/What_can_we_realistically_expect#The_MeeGo_project_has_announced_support_for_the_N900.__What_does_it_really_mean_for_my_N900_.3F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for all those whining about navigation - it's in the works right now.&nbsp; My guess is it will not be in the next update, but be available a little later as porting Ovi maps 3 to the N900 is a big job and takes time.&nbsp; But I could be wrong and maybe we'll
 get surprised very soon.</p>

<p>That interview was conducted on 16th February, so probably not worth reading too much into.&nbsp; He was an Intel Moblin guy and although he talked about MeeGo 1.0 for Q2, he was probably all bulled up on conference fever.</p>

<p>I'd be more interested in hearing something recent from a Nokia representative.</p>

<p>Just to be clear - all my mail is on Gmail servers. In the previously working version, I could see all the mail that there was and be notified when new ones arrived. Since my post, there's still no sign of any mail in the Google Inbox. There are three new
 messages on this account which Outlook does not appear to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second Gmail account (which is configured using IMAP) is working as it did before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will remove the google account, clear the cache and then add it back in again and see if that makes any difference.</p>

            Yes - I've tried creating a new test profile. It made no difference. No mail is 'downloaded' (and by downloaded I mean I am not able to *view* any mail in Outlook). &nbsp;Note that this is version 15.36 (170613) - there's a newer fast build version (17062000)
 - I shall try that version and see what happens.

<p>Ok - new version (with a test profile with only one GMail account) doesn't work properly either. This *was* working !!! See the attached images:</p>

<p>JDM_UK,</p>
<p>Can you check whether you have IMAP enabled in Gmail settings for the "All Mail" folder? &nbsp;This is under the "Label" page in Gmail settings. &nbsp;Please also see this page for latest known issues with the new Google account type: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/outlookformac/2017/03/01/support-for-google-mail-calendar-and-contacts/<br />

            Also, BTW, the Gmail and IMAP equivalent of "Empty Cache" is called "Repair Folder" and is accessible by right-clicking the folder in the left pane of the Outlook window. &nbsp;However, since your problem is you haven't downloaded ANY messages, it probably
 won't apply in this situation.

<p>Hi - I have done this and it has now got visibility of *some* of the mail on the server. However, not all of it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now worked around this issue by setting up that gmail account TWICE - the 'preview' version allows access to the calendar &amp; contacts; the standard IMAP setup up then gives me FULL access to my mail which the preview version does not.</p>

                    How do I, or can I, synchronize my Office 365 outlook running on my laptop with the Outlook that runs from Skydrive?
<div>It seems the two applications are separate.</div>
<div>I understand I can add my yahoo account to the outlook running from Skydrive, but that does not synchronize with e-mail, calendar, and contacts with my Outlook 365 running on the PC. A little help will be greatly appreciated.</div>

            So I should setup an Outlook.com email (the old hotmail thing) that checks my various email accounts? And then have my outlook 365 and the outlook web app on the skydrive use only the outlook.com account?
<div>What I really want is for my local Outlook 365 (Home premium) that checks three different accounts (yahoo and another 3rd party pop) to synchronize with the skydrive web app outlook.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think one of my problems is that everything has such similar Outlook names that I am not clear on which product uses what.</div>

            Thank you for the clarification.
<div>However, that is unfortunate.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I run a business e-mail and other e-mail accounts like yahoo in my local Outlook 2013.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It would be nice if that just synchronized with the outlook on the sharedrive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did try setting up the share drive outlook to check the other accounts, like I do my local outlook, but there was some issue with checking a pop account. I got tired of hassling with it. But maybe I will get back to it if there is any real value in doing
 that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again</div>

<h2>            String Lookup and return</h2>
                    HI
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a column which contains strings ranging from 1-5&nbsp;characters&nbsp;in&nbsp;length&nbsp;derived from any combination of &nbsp;B,X,G as shown below:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Column 1:</div>
<div>B</div>
<div>GB</div>
<div>GXGG</div>
<div>XBGBG</div>
<div>G</div>
<div>BXG</div>
<div>....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In Column 2 I have strings which correspond to the string in Column 1:</div>
<div>
<div>Column 1:<span> </span>Column 2:</div>
<div>B<span> </span>eerty</div>
<div>GB<span> </span>kjh</div>
<div>GXGG<span> </span>vhj</div>
<div>XBGBG<span> </span>oj</div>
<div>G<span> </span>vhj</div>
<div>BXG<span> </span>bjk</div>
<div>....<span> </span>....</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need to search column 1 for a certain string but I do not care about any of the x&nbsp;characters&nbsp;nor the the total number of&nbsp;characters.</div>
<div>eg: I'm looking for B</div>
<div>so B, BX,BXX,BXXX,BXXXXX,XB,XXB,XXXB,XXXXB are all valid matches.</div>
<div>And then return corresponding column 2 string.</div>
<div>eg I search for B</div>
<div>and the column 2&nbsp;entries&nbsp;for &nbsp;B, BX,BXX,BXXX,BXXXXX,XB,XXB,XXXB,XXXXB are returned in&nbsp;separate&nbsp;cells.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do However care about the order of the B,G&nbsp;characters&nbsp;in that BG is not the same as GB. So if I search for BG I would like the corresponding column 2 entries of BG,BGX,BGXX,BGXXX,BXG,BXGX,BXGXX,BXXG,BXXGX,BXXXG returned and not GB,GXB, GXXB...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've been stuck with this for days, even in splitting the strings in column 1 into multiple cells and trying to find matches in that way, all with without any&nbsp;success.</div>
<div>Your Help Is greatly appreciated!</div>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>This can be done through a UDF (user defined function), in the workbook you are working press Alt+F11 / right click in the Project - VBAProject field / Insert &gt; Module / then insert this code:</div>
<div><br />
<div>'---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>
<div>Function ConcatIf(ByVal compareRange As Range, ByVal xCriteria As Variant, Optional ByVal stringsRange As Range, _</div>
<div>Optional Delimiter As String, Optional NoDuplicates As Boolean) As String</div>
<div>Dim i As Long, j As Long</div>
<div>With compareRange.Parent</div>
<div>Set compareRange = Application.Intersect(compareRange, Range(.UsedRange, .Range("a1")))</div>
<div>End With</div>
<div>If compareRange Is Nothing Then Exit Function</div>
<div>If stringsRange Is Nothing Then Set stringsRange = compareRange</div>
<div>Set stringsRange = compareRange.Offset(stringsRange.Row - compareRange.Row, _</div>
<div>stringsRange.Column - compareRange.Column)</div>
<div><br />
<div>For i = 1 To compareRange.Rows.Count</div>
<div>For j = 1 To compareRange.Columns.Count</div>
<div>If (Application.CountIf(compareRange.Cells(i, j), xCriteria) = 1) Then</div>
<div>If InStr(ConcatIf, Delimiter &amp; CStr(stringsRange.Cells(i, j))) &lt;&gt; 0 Imp Not (NoDuplicates) Then</div>
<div>ConcatIf = ConcatIf &amp; Delimiter &amp; CStr(stringsRange.Cells(i, j))</div>
<div>End If</div>
<div>End If</div>
<div>Next j</div>
<div>Next i</div>
<div>ConcatIf = Mid(ConcatIf, Len(Delimiter) + 1)</div>
<div>End Function</div>
<div><br />
<div>'---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div><br />
<div>Press Alt+Q to close VBA and return to your workbook.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now assuming that the list you have is in Column A, then the lookup value is in B2, then enter this in C2:</div>
<div><br />
<div>=ConcatIf(A:A,"*"&amp;B1&amp;"*",A:A,", ",TRUE)</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>This should be the result:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<table>

            More concrete examples would have been useful.&nbsp; But from your examples and description, it would seem that if Column 1 has only a B, you would want returned all of the strings that contain a single B, and so forth.<br />
<br />
The following macro assumes that your strings are in column 1 and column 2 as you show; and that the results will start in column 3 (C) and extend rightward.<br />
<br />
To enter this Macro (Sub), &lt;alt-F11&gt; opens the Visual Basic Editor.<br />
Ensure your project is highlighted in the Project Explorer window.<br />
Then, from the top menu, select Insert/Module and<br />
paste the code below into the window that opens.<br />
<br />
To use this Macro (Sub), &lt;alt-F8&gt; opens the macro dialog box. Select the macro by name, and &lt;RUN&gt;.<br />

            HI Jaeson and Ron!
<div>Thanks for all the help!</div>
<div>Unfortunately my excel skills are a bit limited in that I've never used VBA before.</div>
<div>I didn't manage to get your module to work Jaeson as excel reported an error when I pasted the formula in the cell or when I tried again, it treated it as plain text.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The macro worked well thanks Ron!</div>
<div>However I see you're point about more concrete examples.</div>
<div>I've pasted some of the data below with some completed return values as examples.</div>
<div>Col1 is the list, col 2 is the lookup value and col 3 onwards is the returned values.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The lookup values characters and order matter but not their position in the string in that BG is the same as BGX and BGXX=BXXG=BXGX.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Xs are completed ignored in the search, but required in the return.</div>
<div>As an Example:</div>
<div>Looking up the value BGBG in the list it has the following valid matches:</div>
<div>BGBG (exact match)</div>
<div>BGBGX</div>
<div>BXGBG</div>
<div>BGXBG</div>
<div>BGBXG</div>
<div>XBGBG</div>
<div>All of which are exactly the same as the original BGBG sequence if the Xs are ignored.</div>
<div>But for BG, the following are matches:</div>
<div>BG</div>
<div>BGX</div>
<div>BGXX</div>
<div>BXG</div>
<div>BXXG</div>
<div>BXGXX</div>
<div>ect</div>
<div>as, when the Xs are ignored the same sequence appears.</div>
<div>But</div>
<div>GB<br />
GXB</div>
<div>GBXX</div>
<div>GXBX</div>
<div>aren't as the order of B and G has changed (from BG to GB) so that when we ignore the Xs the original sequence does not match anymore.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I know I'm not the best at explaining things but I hope this has cleared some things up.</div>
<div>Thanks again for all the help and support!</div>
<div>-H</div>

            <p>I thought I understood what you wanted.&nbsp; But I don't see how to get the results that you list in your "return" columns from the information provided in "List" and "Look Up" columns, or how that relates to your original example where you were looking for
 instances in column 1 in column 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either I'm not understanding your requirements, or your examples do not reflect the actual data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please post a workbook with realistic data, and desired results, clearly delineated, on some sharing site, like Skydrive, and post a link here so I can understand what my macro is doing incorrectly.</p>

            First DELETE THAT KEY! Before some unscrupulous individual steals it!<br />
<br />
Second, NO, you can't use it as is.<br />
<br />
Third, there is a tiny chance MS will replace it:<br />

</span></p>
<p><span>You need 2 things to install Office, your unique personal 25 character “Product Key” and the generic Office installation file / disk for the matching Office bundle.</span></p>
<p><span>The above link describes the formal MS support available.</span></p>
<p><span>To summarize the article, it depends on how you bought Office:</span></p>
<p><span>If you have a 1-computer (online download), “PKC” (Product Key Card), “MLK” (Medialess Kit), “OEM” (factory installed and Activated) type license you cannot transfer the license to a new computer. It is only good on the first computer it is installed
 on and stays permanently with the computer when it is sold or scrapped.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have a 2-computer or 3-computer for Home and Student only (online download), “FPP” (online download), Boxed retail CD/DVD (which is usually the”FPP” type), these types of license may be transferred to new comptuers as required.</span></p>
<p><span>All licenses available to the general public that I am aware of may be re-installed on the same computer, even after limited upgrades like adding RAM, new HD, re-installing Windows, upgrading Windows version etc.</span></p>
<p><span>The link above describes where to look for Product Key numbers.<span>&nbsp; </span>
If you still have a computer that Office was installed and activated on, which you have NOT re-installed or upgraded Windows on you try one of the following tools to extract the key from the HD.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your purchase was through the Microsoft Store, You can contact them at 1-877-696-7786 or login using your credentials in the link below:

<h2>            Text is Randomly Messed Up</h2>
                    I'm having an issue with Windows 8.&nbsp; And it's only been on Windows 8 and 8.1<br />
<br />
A lot of time when Websites Load on any browser of mine, IE, Firefox...&nbsp; The Text sometimes comes up really jumbled.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It looks like sometimes the text itself has been stretched.&nbsp; or other cooky variations of the jumbled text.&nbsp; Only when I highlight or hover over the text does it display correctly.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;i noticed that really rarely does/this has happened before with Previous Operating systems.&nbsp; and is a common but rare issue (like a Crash or something)<br />
<br />
but this has happened way more than normal.&nbsp; it'll happen around 10-15 times a day.<br />

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Some old websites might not display correctly or might appear even blank in Internet Explorer. For example, portions of a webpage might be missing, or colors and text might be incorrect. This might be due to the incompatibility
 of the website with Internet Explorer 10 browser on your Windows 8 computer. This might also happen if you have the Tracking Protection feature enabled on the browser. It would be great if you can answer to these questions:</font></font></font></p>

<h2>            Need to restore messages that were deleted 6 months ago.</h2>
                    <p>I need to recover some important messages from a specific person that I deleted about 6-7 months ago. They are no longer in deleted folder because it was emptied numerous times and these messages are very important to me for a court case. Attorney said that
 messages are recoverable up to few years but the only way to get them is through Microsoft support.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried to contact Live support but was suggest to sign up for Hotmail plus, after I did so, found out there was no member customer service for subscribed members as was explained. After contacting Live support second time, was suggested&nbsp;to post a message
 here for help. Please help, trial is in few weeks and not much time left. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you to whoever is out there to help in advance. </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Insider crash Inspiron Beyond Repair</h2>
                    <p>Looking to see if anyone can relate or give insight to what happened, I have ran a hardware check from dell and everything checks out. I was using the latest windows insider updates and my machine crashed mid use and when I rebooted I was missing a bunch
 of critical files. I ended up reinstalling the OS and am not using the insider preview anymore. I have an inspiron i7579 7000 series dell, I wanted to see if even though all my hardware is testing ok what the possibility is there is still a hardware issue.</p>

<p>If it crashed "mid use" it might be a drive situation.&nbsp; Shutting it down may have corrupted some files, but otherwise that system should not have any problems with the newer Insider Windows Development builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are running a jump ahead build, I have no experience..&nbsp; But since you have reinstalled whatever OS, the info to find what went wrong is probably gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you keep an eye on the Event Viewer to see if anything is showing up consistently.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your Prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as per you, there is no co ordination between Microsoft and App developers for Microsoft to ask the App developers to add this option in the App they developed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an end user , and I do not think things going to work out complaining the App developers and to add this option since I do not know their details etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you know the end users like me are ordinary people who does not much about the digital world and we are comparing with other devices such as Android operated platform, where the downloaded videos in the App are available in Gallery from where they can
 share through whats App etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if possible we would like Microsoft to take an initiative to ask the App developers to do the needful action to give the updates to the App for Windows store.</p>

            Microsoft cant point a gun at developers to force them to make apps in a certain way. Google doesn't tell devs what to do either.

            <p>You need to find an app that supports the features you want, and the developer listens to user feedback. E.g.
<em>MyTube!</em> may suit your needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From a technicians point of view&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57741?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sharing of YouTube videos</a> through social media, email etc. should of course be a link to the video, not the actual video!<br />

<h2>            &#39;send to onenote&#39; very slow from Outlook.</h2>
                    <p>I am using Office 365 and make use of the 'Send to OneNote' button in the Outlook ribbon to send emails to OneNote. I have found that this process can take a very long time, sometimes minutes to transfer one email. If I attempt to transfer several emails
 at once, it can take ten minutes or more.</p>
<p>This issue does not appear to be related to which version of Windows I am using, or to a particular machine- I have several computers and find the same problem regardless of which I am using.</p>
<p>I would be very grateful for any suggestions about this. Thank you.</p>

    <title>Problem pasting into Excel Table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelandren  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem pasting into Excel Table</h2>
                    <p>I have a large table of checks and expenses. Suddenly I'm no longer able to correctly paste data into the table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to paste some cells from another document, the pasted cells are blank. There is a highlighted section where the data was supposed to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I paste the data into the worksheet outside of the table, it appears correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I then try copying the data I just pasted into the worksheet into the table, it only pastes some of the data. For instance, the data is five cells wide by 18 cells high. The selection boundary contains all the data, as normal. But when pasted into the
 table, there is an additional blank column at the beginning and the last column is missing. The first column, IOW, is offset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least that's what it did before. Now as I check it again, it behaves entirely differently! Now it doesn't paste anything at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It did however paste a cut. But then I can't see the paste options after that, which I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I just tried cutting the data from the other document, and in this case it left the first two columns behind in the other document and pasted the last three into the table, with two additional blank columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the heck is going on? I need the table for work and it is very large. How do I fix my table? I've already saved and rebooted and it did not fix anything.</p>
<p />

            OK I fixed the problem, I think. I converted the table back to a range. Then back to a table. This seems to have cleared up the issue.

<h2>            iOS OneDrive app - support for Azure O365 Guest Accounts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to setup a OneDrive for Business account on an iPad. It only appears to work via the Safari Browser. I can open files by initiating a session from Chrome, or the Microsoft Managed Browser, but I can't open a Guest Account guest link received in
 email -- it's supposed to open in OneDrive (the app) but instead complains it can't open OneDrive and proceeds to open in the default browser, Safari -- which is not what I want at all. I want to be able open the guest account link in the OneDrive app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is supported in this scenario? What are the support boundaries for Azure O365 Guest accounts on iOS? Seems they don't work with Microsoft apps - that can't be right?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the error message you encountered, I would suggest you try online repair first to check if the problem still persists:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.
</span><span>Right-click the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span> button</span><span>,
</span><span>and select </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Control Panel</span><span> from the pop-up menu.</span></p>
<p><span>2.
</span><span>From </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Category</span><span> view, under
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Programs</span><span>, select
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Uninstall a program</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>3.
</span><span>Right-click the Microsoft Office product you want to repair, and from the drop-down, select
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Change</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>4.
</span><span>In </span><span style="font-weight: bold">How would you like to repair your Office Programs</span><span>, select
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Online Repair</span><span> to make sure everything gets fixed, and then select
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Repair</span><span>.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem persists, please try staring in safe mode to check if the problem is related to the add-ins:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.
</span><span>Right-click the Start button (lower-left corner) in Windows, and click Run.</span></p>
<p><span>2.
</span><span>In the Run box, type </span><span style="font-weight: bold">winword /safe</span><span>, and click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">OK</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tisky</p>

                    <p>Before I pay a Lot more for a Mac Office 2016 version that comes with Outlook - can anyone confirm that it IS possible to import MBOX files into Outlook on Office 2016? &nbsp; I want to check before I buy - and the posts and responses on this from 2015 are Not
 promising. &nbsp;Any updates please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And MicroSoft - could you hazard a guess and hopefully resolution, rather than outsourcing to the forum?</p>

<h2>            Lost emails in In-box</h2>
                    <p>I use Outlook on my laptop.&nbsp; This morning, I could only see one week's emails in my In-box.&nbsp; All my sent mails are still there.&nbsp; I checked my Outlook account online&nbsp;and now there are only 2 pages of emails in my in-box.&nbsp; I should have around 3,000 emails
 altogether.&nbsp; All my sent emails are still there.&nbsp; How can I find all my lost emails? They are not in my deleted folder.</p>
<p>Luckily, at the moment, I can still see my emails in emClient which I also have on my laptop otherwise I would be stuffed as I need constant referral back to old emails for work.</p>

<p>In the end I contacted Microsoft support.&nbsp; They were really helpful.&nbsp; The girl I spoke to took&nbsp;remote access of my computer - that was a bit worrying!&nbsp; Anyway, she found the emails in a folder called 'POP'.&nbsp; Where that came from, I've no idea.&nbsp; &nbsp; I certainly
 didn't create it.&nbsp; But, I'm just happy and very relieved to have got my emails back.&nbsp; Already would have been at a loss as needed one of my old emails today to show (new) manager he was paying me at the wrong rate.&nbsp;

<h2>            Error code 0xE0000007 in OneNote</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using OneNote on an iPad Pro for the last week. &nbsp;This morning, the syncing stopped working and I was given this error code: 0xE0000007. &nbsp;I have followed the recommended steps to fix, including:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Checking connectivity</p>
<p>2. Forcing a sync (several times)</p>
<p>3. Checking that I had the latest version of OneNote (I do)</p>
<p>4. Looking for changes in OneNote Online (the changes were not there)</p>
<p>5. Close and re-open the notebook affected (this did not help).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is affecting any notebook for which I made any changes (it does not seem to be isolated to a notebook or two). &nbsp;I initially had the problem with wifi at work - but it has not cleared up using wifi at home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help out there? &nbsp;Thanks.</p>
<p />

<p>Hi Cleve,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have tried the recommended steps and without success, you can try reset the OneNote on your iPad.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.
</span><span>On your iPad, tap the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Settings</span><span> app.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2.
</span><span>In the pane on the left, swipe down to the alphabetical list of installed apps and then tap the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">OneNote</span><span> icon.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3.
</span><span>In the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">OneNote</span><span> options on the right, under the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Reset</span><span> heading, tap
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Reset OneNote</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>4.
</span><span>In the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Reset OneNote</span><span> options on the right, tap to enable the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Delete All Notebooks</span><span> option, and then also tap to enable the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Delete Login Credentials</span><span> option.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>5.
</span><span>Restart OneNote, and then tap </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Sign In</span><span> to log in with your own account credentials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you reset OneNote, please backup all of your notebooks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also try creating a new notebook then check whether the changes in the newly created notebook can be synced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you mentioned in the post, you haven't try the wifi at home, we suggest you change to another Internet environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tisky</p>
        </p>

<h2>            microsoft access 2016 - form - recordset not updateable</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm hoping someone can help me figure out why I can no longer update my table, using my form (I can update the table itself but can't use my form). I inherited this database and it was working fine until it crashed and created a backup. The data in both
 tables seem fine, so now I really would just like to be able to use my form again and keep working. I tried to "compact and repair database" using the backup it created and I still can't update any fields and in the bottom left it always says "This Recordset
 is not updateable". I read other posts on this forum and it may be a problem with the way the form is querying the tables? The one form pulls data from two tables. I'm hoping someone can tell me if something is wrong with the query? I'm not sure why there
 is an asterix (the table doesn't have an asterix in its name) but don't know how to fix it. When I try to delete it from the query, it seems to work but then when I open the form, it asks me to enter a "Parameter Value" in a box that says "CSAS Publications
 Metadata" and then has a text box for me to enter a parameter value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Design View:</p>
<p>Field: CSAS PUBLICATIONS METADATA.*</p>
<p>Table: CSAS PUBLICATIONS METADATA</p>
<p>
</p><p>Field: PeerReviewMtg1.Value</p>
<p>Table:&nbsp;CSAS PUBLICATIONS METADATA</p>
<p>
</p><p>Query Builder SQL view:</p>
<p>SELECT [CSAS PUBLICATIONS METADATA].*, [CSAS PUBLICATIONS METADATA].PeerReviewMtg1.Value</p>
<p>FROM [CSAS PUBLICATIONS METADATA];</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Laura</p>

            Hi Laura, I'm an independent adviser and will try to help.
<br />
<br />Please post the SQL for the query that is the Recordsource of the form. The message you are getting indicates something is causing that query to not be updateable. Normally, it is not a good idea to use multi-table queries as Recordsources, but rather use mainform/subform combinations.
<br />
<br />If 
<br />
<br />SELECT [CSAS PUBLICATIONS METADATA].*, [CSAS PUBLICATIONS METADATA].PeerReviewMtg1.Value
<br />FROM [CSAS PUBLICATIONS METADATA];
<br />
<br />is the Recorsource, the asterisk is indicating to use all fields from that table. But the SQL statement has no join between the two tables which would make it uneditable. It seems possible the crash and your using the backup file may have damages the SQL statement.
        </p>

<p>Thanks Scott! I think it is the recordsource. I found it in design view, in the "data" tab of the property sheet, by clicking on the "more info "..." of "record source" and then choosing the SQL view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have advice as to where to go from here? I don't know how to rewrite my SQL statement. It's the same SQL statement in the original Access file, as well as the file that was created when it crashed (I've been using the original and have just kept the
 other as a backup!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!<br />
Laura</p>

            OK, Looking at it more closely, it appears you are only using one table. Where do you get the idea you are using two tables. Also you are using a multi-value field. I'm not sure why that field is listed separately. 
<br />
<br />What I would try is to use the pull down for the Recordsource property and just select the CSAS PUBLICATIONS METADATA table. Not use a SQL query. (Note: make sure you have a backup copy of the original Access file before making changes).
<br />
<br />See if that makes the form editable.
