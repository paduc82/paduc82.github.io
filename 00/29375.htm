    <title>Remote Desktop over Bluetooth Connection - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remote Desktop over Bluetooth Connection</h2>
                    <p>I was just wondering if it was possible theoretically to access a PC or Mac, maybe Mac, from a Phone (Nokia, or iPhone) or Tablet (Surface or iPad) from something like a Remote Desktop App but through Bluetooth instead like VNC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I was going to originally post this discussion on the Apple site but I find it would look horrible if made by Apple and they would probably turn it into a cash grab and price it really high. I also like what Microsoft has been doing with their Metro designs
 of their applications lately. I also don't know <del>a lot</del>&nbsp;anything about coding cause I am more of a think tank so that's why I couldn't just research it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Isn't that what a phone's "Hotspot" does?&nbsp; The equivalent thing on the PC is the Hostednetwork but it is a bit more challenging to use, e.g. involving netsh commands.&nbsp; I think I need to use BT PAN in order to get a non-WiFi connection between my two Surface
 machines but then don't know what I can do with it.&nbsp; It seems to assist local file sharing at least.&nbsp; Remote Desktop sounds like a great idea for another application of it.&nbsp; I'm not sure how to set it up though.&nbsp; Windows messaging (e.g. broadcast by an Admin)
 would be another one that might be simpler to start with but I haven't had much luck with it either.&nbsp; So a first step would be to make sure that I knew how to use those tools in a normal networking environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>

            Hi Leone, 
<br />
<br />This can be problems with the PC settings or monitor settings. Please follow this guideline: 
<br />
<br />Method 1: Try using the monitor buttons and adjust the screen image. 
<br />Adjusting the Screen Image
<br /><a href="http://www.viewsonicglobal.com/public/products_download/32/26814.pdf?pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.viewsonicglobal.com/public/products_...</a>
<br />Make sure that the display scaling is set to 100%
<br />Go to the Settings and click on Display.
<br />On the left pane, tap the Custom Scaling link, which is under "Scale and Layout".
<br />When you are in the Custom Layout page, set a new value for scaling percent from 100 to 500.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />Method 2: Try updating the display driver from Device Manager. You can also try to find a new driver on your device manufacturer's website.
<br />
<br />Write me back if it works or not. 
<br />
<br />Thanks, 
<br />Andrew N.

<br />
<strong>If the system is Windows 7&nbsp;compatible AND there are drivers for your WebCam&nbsp;(and<br />
other devices).<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>References to Vista apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software<strong>"IF"</strong> there are<br />
any for Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Imaging - write down make and model of camera - double click<br />
on it and on driver's tab get version. Now click Update Drivers (which may not do anything as MS<br />
is far behind certifying drivers). The RIGHT CLICK on the camera - UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and download the latest camera driver and other related camera<br />
software (if no newer get the same ones).<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to them and RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN - reboot after each driver.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
<span>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<p>Although the calico cat at <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/personalize/wallpaper-desktop-background" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/personalize/wallpaper-desktop-background</a>&nbsp;is technically for Windows7, I see no reason it wouldn't work on your system (since it is, after all, just a picture).&nbsp; Go ahead and try it.&nbsp; I don't think you'll
 have a problem with the service pack issue with just a background picture.&nbsp; If it doesn't work or you can't configure it to your liking, then perhaps it doesn't fit with the theme you're using (but that isn't likely or needs to have its size adjusted before
 setting it as the background).&nbsp; But I suspect it will work just fine.</p>
<p>I hope this helps (and BTW, I LIKE the picture since I'm a cat person myself).</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Windows in Parallels</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 in Parallels on my Mac. &nbsp;And old copy of windows became too bloated so I reinstalled windows from scratch using a parallels download and my windows 8 product key. &nbsp;It was working great for a few days and then I installed KuTools in
 excel and that made it crash and act funny. &nbsp;I tried to uninstall it completely by using regedit and I think I got it, but I'm not sure. &nbsp;So I'd like to just reinstall windows cleanly. &nbsp;However, when I try to activate it I get an error message. &nbsp;I'm assuming
 it thinks I have too many active computers running Windows. &nbsp;I checked and indeed it shows two parallels installs of windows. &nbsp;How do I delete those activated windows machines so that my product key will be clean so I can activate this new install?</p>

<p>Hi Bryan,</p>
<p><br />
There is no actual deactivation process. However, you can uninstall the product key from other computers by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open a <strong>Command Prompt (Administrator)</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Type <strong>slmgr.vbs -upk</strong>, then hit <strong>Enter</strong>. <br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Once you're done uninstalling the product key, your computer will set back to trial mode, then you may now use the product key on another computer.
<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back should you need further help.</p>

<p>Well, the only problem with this is that I can't uninstall the key from an old install as the image has been deleted. &nbsp;So since I'm getting an error message for too many installs, I'm taking a risk that it won't allow me to install this new one, nor might
 it work if I want to reinstall it on the current image. &nbsp;Is there a number I can call? &nbsp;There used to be a way to contact some Indian guys who would verify this was not a duplicate and then they would give you a new activation code that was very long.</p>

<h2>            In-place Upgrade</h2>
                    I am advised that I need to perform an "in-place upgrade" to my Windows Vista Home Premium Service pack 2 Operating System.&nbsp; When the Operating System was installed at the store (Best Buy), they gave me 3 recovery disks; NOT the Windows Vista Install CD.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 How do I perform the "in-place" upgrade using these recovery disks?

<p>You normally can not do a Repair In-place&nbsp;Upgrade with Recovery disks.</p>
<p>You will have to borrow a Microsoft Vista DVD to do a Repair In-place Upgrade, or do a full Recovery and take it back to Factory Settings.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Sound glitching and stuttering. Worst OS Microsoft have ever produced</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgraded to Window 10 from 7 and that's when the glitching sound&nbsp;started. Playing music locally mp3s or via the web / youtube, results in glitching and stuttering sound and pc slows down momentarily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then upgraded again to the Creators upgrade and that is even worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran Latencymon and it's saying ndis and hdaudbus are the issue? Why? Windows 7 was fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is a nightmare, upgraded all my drivers, software updated, no matter what I do the glitching sound remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attached the latencymon screen. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So sick of Windows 10, thinking of buying a Mac, at least I can then browse the web and listen sound without issue.
</p>
<p>My connection is fine, as I have a Windows 7 laptop, no sound glitching at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is the culprit, yet no fixes at all Microsoft???? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. It's unfortunate to know that you are still having this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are facing the issue in the safe mode as well as in the new user account, it seems there&nbsp;is system file corruption that can only be replaced by new system files. But, you may also try to check your Hard drive for errors as the last step. Refer to
 the following article.</p>
<p><strong>Check your hard disk for errors in Windows 7</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2641432/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2641432/en-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try the above steps and update with the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for keeping us posted!</p>

<h2>            There is a very long folder name is shown in the C partition.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I really got shocked with seeing so long folder name that I couldn't believe it is normal when I checked the C partition.<br />
abcdefghijklmnopqrssttuvwxyabcdefghijklmnopqrssttuvwxyabcdefghijklmnopqrssttuvwxyabcdefghijklmnopqrssttuvwxyabcdefghijklmnopqrssttuvwxyabcdefghijklmnopqrssttuvwxyabcdefghijklmnopqrssttuvwxyabcdefghijklmnopqrssttuvwxy<br />
<br />
<strong>There are six long folder names, each of which is inside the other one which is before it.</strong><br />
<strong>The first five folders have properties when clicking on it right-click, like the first screen shot.</strong><br />
<strong>The final folder doesn't have any properties when clicking on it right-click.</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't know what created it, it was created on 02/12/2014, although I have Microsoft security essentials, and Malwarebytes are installed on my laptop.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
If I am going to delete it, what might be resulting in?<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Thanks a lot,</p>
<p>
</p><p>you meant that I should first rename it by only adding, a number in front or end of it, for instance, with keeping the long name. Thus, if nothing results in, then I will delete it safely.</p>
<p>However, </p>
<ul>
<li>should I restart my computer after renaming it?<br />
</li><li>Should I wait for a day or more after renaming it to investigate no problem will be resulting in the future. ?</li></ul>
<p>By the way, you didn't answer me what created that folder, is it not so long that anyone cannot believe it is a normal folder?</p>

            I have no idea what might have created such a folder. In dealing with it, use your common sense. This common says, for example, that you should wait a week or two before deleting the folders for good.<br />

            <p>Usually a remnant of a .net framework installation or windows update installation that didn't properly clean itself up.

</p><p>You can safely delete it but if you feel unsure, move it somewhere else, reboot and once you feel sure, delete it.</p>

<h2>            Installing Windows 7 on a blank hard drive that has no OS.</h2>
                    I have the full version of Windows 7 and I am trying to install it on my computer I built, but when I set the bios to boot from the installation DVD and restart my computer, it&nbsp;says it can't boot from DVD because my boot manager is missing. Could this
 mean that there is a problem with my copy of windows, or is there some other program I need to get? If anyone could explain what I need to do, I would be greatly appreciative.

<p>If so, I suggest you download Windows 7 again and burn it at the lowest speed possible then try again.</p>

<p>1. Turn on your computer, insert the Windows installation disc, and then restart your computer.</p>
<p>Procedures vary depending on the BIOS manufacturer. Usually, you must press a key (such as F2, F12, Delete, Esc) or a key combination immediately after you turn on your computer but before Windows starts. For more information, check the information that
 came with your computer or go to the computer manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>2. The BIOS setup screen appears. On the BIOS setup screen, select the option called "Boot order," or something similar.</p>
<p>3. Select your CD or DVD drive as the first startup device, save the setting changes, and then exit the BIOS.</p>
<p>Restart your computer, and then start Windows from the installation CD or DVD as previously described.</p>

When you boot your computer, press [F8] on boot and disable driver signing checking. The should be detected.<br />

    <title>Problem With Sandisk Cruzer Glide USB Drive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem With Sandisk Cruzer Glide USB Drive</h2>
                    
<p>I have a 4gb Xbox 360 slim. I recently bought Far Cry 4, and I need more space to save the game on. I tried putting a few flash drives into the Xbox that I found lying around my house, but none of them had the required 3.7gb needed for Far Cry. After that,
 I went out and bought a Sandisk Cruzer Glide 16gb USB flash drive. However, when I try to set it up on the Xbox, it tells me it doesn't meet the system recommendations. I find this very strange, as one of the flash drives that I had tried earlier in the Xbox
 was a Cruzer Glide, and it met the system recommendations, but didn't have enough space.</p>
<p>So what should I do? How should I troubleshoot this? Or is it best just to go out and get one of those Sandisk drives that are made specially for Xboxes. I do know that the 16gb Cruzer Glide I bought works with transferring files, as I tested it on my computer.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help! :)</p>

    <title>Xbox Live Parent Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrfear220  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Parent Account</h2>
                    
<p><strong><span>I need some help.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Some time ago, last year, I removed myself from 'the family' on my Xbox. Before then, I had been grouped as the only child (even though my younger sister was put with an adult account)
 when we were first setting up the Xbox. This didn't bother me and for many years I was not only content with it, but perfectly able to carry on playing my favourite games and talking to friends online, since it didn't impact gameplay or any other aspect of
 the experience. However, leading up to the fateful day when the good ship HMS XboxLive would sink, I noticed that there were a few annoying parts about the parent account which were negatively impacting my online freedom. My parents don't know much about the
 Xbox and only use it to watch the occational movie or Netflix show, but knew that I was responsible and mature enough to not have the 'child' label anymore. I wasn't aware the parent could promote their child's account so I just removed myself from the family.
 It seemed harmless enough (<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">famous last words</span>) so I did it...<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>My Xbox didn't like that very much and wasn't sure it could let me escape the grasp of parental restrictions that easily! It told me if I wasn't under some parent account then I couldn't
 have Xbox Live at all... Great! That was annoying, but it made sense that not just any child could be completely unrestricted with a few wiggles of the left analogue stick and the click of an 'A' button. So, when I tried to sign in to my account it gave me
 two options. I could play offline or set my parent account back up. So, I put in my father's parent account details and it said we were good to go, however, it told me Xbox Live Signup was unavailable and I should try again later. This was a minor annoyance,
 but I was willing to wait.</span></p>
<p><span>After a week of waiting I was getting a bit worried. Xbox Live had gone down before, but only for about a day. I didn't want it to be too long though, becuase I had an Xbox Live Gold subscription
 that still had about 2 months left. I didn't want to waste any of my Gold subscription so I tried again almost every day until eventually it was my birthday, my Gold subscription ended with about two and a half months wasted and my parents bought me a new
 1 year Gold subscription card! I hadn't tried setting back up my account for a few weeks and I thought maybe it would work! It didn't. So, I had to continue waiting...<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Now, I'm not someone who relies on playing Call of Duty online for 12 hours each day to survive, with twenty cans of Mountain Dew and a whole load of Doritos, but I did use Xbox Live quite
 a bit. I enjoyed playing Need for Speed and Minecraft with friends, but that was sadly not going to be possile. Also, I did something with my hardrive some time ago and it meant that some games I bought and downloaded had to be connected with the internet
 in order to be the full game, otherwise they said they were a trial. This was never a problem, unless I didn't have Xbox Live. So, I couldn't play some games full stop. This was very annoying and so I literally spent hours on forums every week trying to find
 an answer to this problem, with no luck! It seemed as though others have had this problem, but nothing has been done. I have now had a 1 Year Gold Card lying around for about 8 months with the hope I'll be able to one day put it to use. What has annoying me
 most of all is that the only real answer I've found involves totally deleting your account and wiping your hardrive... But why?! This shouldn't be necessary, should it? I just want to reconnect my parent account! I've missed out on loads of Games for Golds
 which I absolutely loved. I watched Saints Row 4 (a game series which is one of my favourites) come and go right in front of my eyes, along with many other good games...
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Today I thought I might of had some success, as an article online told me I'd be able to fix it if the parent account was linked to a Hotmail Email adress. I did get further however, as
 it did come up with an error code - 801540FE - but no real indication that I was going to get somewhere. I ask that you please don't just transfer me to a telephone call that is going to get nowhere (like others with my problem apparently have had to do) but
 help me figure out why this is happening?! I may not have Xbox One but don't give up on your Xbox 360 players! I appreciate you taking the time to read this long, boring, annoying and (did I mention) really long forum post which could have been shortened into
 a few lines, but wasn't. I hope you can help...<br />

<p>Assuming you can get access to another PC at the college, go to <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a>&nbsp;and download Malwarebyte which is a 'free' malicious software removal tool.&nbsp; It can be placed on a jump drive (only 5mb needed).&nbsp; Start your PC in Safe Mode then put the jump drive in your PC and run the program.&nbsp; If you don't
 have a jump (USB, Key Chain) drive you can buy them at places like Best Buy for less then $20 for 2 GB drives.&nbsp; Hopefully Malewarebytes will be able to rid your PC of the malicious software.&nbsp; You don't have anything to lose by trying.</p>

            It is false.&nbsp; This is a known problem which will allegedly be fixed in the next version of Windows.&nbsp; You can still clean the Windows update files.

<p>The website is showing you as Gold, so that's not the concern. It could be your network connection, profile settings, and/or console settings.
</p>
<p>Redownloading your profile will help with corruption or if you signed up on the site and it hasn't pushed it to your console.</p>
<p>If it's a new Xbox it likely is the network connection. Try going to Settings &gt; Network &nbsp;and test your connection.</p>

<p>As stated above, most likely its your network settings that will need to be setup. License transfer only applies to anything downloaded from the xbox store (games on demand,dlc, avatar items, etc.). It doesn't directly affect your ability to connect to xbox
 live or play online. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>Memory testing methods are in the section following these driver update methods.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your<br />
system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address<br />
of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and<br />
more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most<br />
current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and<br />
complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the<br />
version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind<br />
certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver<br />
stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if <br />
3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers <br />
you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then<br />
Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest<br />
versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while<br />
there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT<br />
after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing<br />
actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed<br />
(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is<br />
installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER -<br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in<br />
Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
<strong>To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so. &lt;-- best method<br />

<br />
----------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security products are<br />
just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to corrupt or go out of bounds.<br />
The video driver or something affecting it would be very suspect.<br />
<br />
Be sure the drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset driver are all updated by manually checking<br />
at the System maker and device makers's sites. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 0A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000000A</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>This bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high.</p>
<p>The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.</p>
<p>If you encounter bug check 0xA while upgrading to a later version of Windows, this error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If a kernel debugger is available, obtain a stack trace.</p>
<p><strong>To resolve an error caused by a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart your computer. </li><li>Press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices.
</li><li>Select the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option from the Windows<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</li></ol>
<p><strong>To resolve an error caused by an incompatible device driver, system service, virus scanner, or backup tool</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for error messages that might identify the device or driver that caused the error.
</li><li>Try disabling memory caching of the BIOS. </li><li>Run the hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer, especially the memory scanner. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.
</li><li>Make sure the latest Service Pack is installed. </li><li>If your system has small computer system interface (SCSI) adapters, contact the adapter manufacturer to obtain updated Windows drivers. Try disabling sync negotiation in the SCSI BIOS, checking the cabling and the SCSI IDs of each device, and confirming
 proper termination. </li><li>For integrated device electronics (IDE) devices, define the onboard IDE port as Primary only. Also, check each IDE device for the proper master/subordinate/stand-alone setting. Try removing all IDE devices except for hard disks.</li></ol>
<p>If the message appears during an installation of Windows, make sure that the computer and all installed peripherals are listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.<br />
<br />
<strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>Before upgrading to a new version of Windows, remove all third-party device drivers and system services, and disable any virus scanners. Contact the software manufacturers to obtain updates of these third-party tools.<br />

<p>If there are&nbsp;RAID drivers they are very suspect&nbsp;and/or driver problems are very real prospects.&nbsp;<br />
Other major possibilities are Video and other drivers. See the driver section in my generic<br />
bluescreen troubleshooting methods below. BIOS, low level chipset drivers, memory and<br />
antivirus/antispyway/security programs can also cause this. Check the troubleshooter and when<br />
you get to the driver section refer to the generic methods in next message and then return to<br />
the troubleshooter&nbsp;if needed.<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: D1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000D1</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high.</p>
<p>This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.</p>
<p>If the first parameter has the same value as the fourth parameter, and the third parameter indicates an execute operation, this bug check was likely caused by a driver that was trying to execute code when the code itself was paged out. Possible causes for
 the page fault include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The function was marked as pageable and was running at an elevated IRQL (which includes obtaining a lock).
</li><li>The function call was made to a function in another driver, and that driver was unloaded.
</li><li>The function was called by using a function pointer that was an invalid pointer.</li></ul>

<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

<strong>This is an excellent tool for posting Blue Screen Error Information</strong><br />

<br />
<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

<p><span>Hi Carmasterextreme,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
If your computer has all the system requirements required to play Flight Simulator X, then the problem could either be due to bad media or other programs conflicting with the installation.<br />
To check if the media is corrupt, try installing the game in another computer.<br />
If it runs, then the issue is specific to the media.<br />
If it doesn’t install, then the issue is specific to your computer.<br />
In this case, we can try performing the installation when your computer is in clean boot state.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A clean boot loads only those files and programs that are absolutely required by the Operating System.<br />
Hence there will be minimum interference from other third party application during the installation.<br />
<br />
Steps to perform clean boot:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, type
<strong>msconfig</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the General tab, click
<strong>Selective Startup</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the
<strong>Load Startup Items</strong> check box.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Services tab, click to select the
<strong>Hide All Microsoft Services</strong> check box, and then click <strong>Disable All.</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>7)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When you are prompted, click
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>After the computer starts, insert the CD and run the installation. It should install without any hitch.</span></p>
<p><span>Having done so, don’t forget to return your computer to start normally.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, type
<strong>msconfig.exe</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the General tab, click the
<strong>Normal Startup</strong> option, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this resolves the issue.</span></p>
