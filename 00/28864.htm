<p>
</p><p>I use aliases in my Outlook.com accounts and I have created one alias in each account specifically and only for use as the username in my login credentials. I do not want to make this alias publicly known. It's a security measure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2016 defaults to placing my login username in the "From" field for ALL emails created and replied to under this account and there is no way to change that default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This "expected behaviour" is an oversight and unacceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Especially, when considering the use-case for email aliases. An expected behaviour that does not support the use of aliases, which allow for more than one email address for an account, is absolutely broken logic. Any alias should be selectable as a default
 email for the account, regardless of which email address/alias was used to login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix this, Microsoft.</p>

            <p>First, try starting Outlook once with the /resetfoldernames sommand switch.&nbsp; Press WinKey+R or click Start&gt;Accessories&gt;Run.&nbsp; In the Open field, type</p>
<p>outlook.exe /resetfoldernames</p>
<p>Be sure to include&nbsp;the space.&nbsp; Press Enter.&nbsp; If that doesn't work, then close Outlook, use the Mail applet in Control Panel to create a new data file and make it the default data file, then start Outlook and copy to the folders in the new data file the items
 in the corresponding folders of the old data file.&nbsp; Unless the folders are folders you created yourself, you cannot copy the folders, only the contents of the folders.&nbsp; Once you are finished copying the data from the old data file, close Outlook and again
 use the Mail applet to remove the old data file from the mail profile.</p>

<h2>            Setting Up Exchange Server E-Mail Account in Apple iOS</h2>
                    <p>I noted what seems to be an error in the instructions for setting up an error on the online instructions for "Set Up Microsoft Exchange E-Mail on an Apple iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch" at the following URL:<br />
</p>
<p>http://help.outlook.com/en-US/140/dd125429.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the link used by Outlook Web Access for 2010, to explain how to accomplish this setup.&nbsp; These instructions say "You need to enter your full e-mail address in the Email and Username boxes (for example, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)".&nbsp; Actually, at least for Exchange
 2010 R3 (which we have on premises), <strong>the username field requires the network username (not the email address)</strong>, probably tony in the example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link for feedback on at the URL does not appear to work any longer so I thought it might be helpful to post here.</p>

<h2>            Additional email address and forwarding</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I set up office 365 premium for a small business&nbsp;,.</p>
<p>I moved all the mail settings over to exchange and set up</p>
<p>users for all the employees&nbsp; eg staff@.zzz.com.</p>

<p>Now the owner of the company has told me that his wife has an email</p>
<p>address *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and her email is not working and he does not</p>
<p>want her set up as a user of office 365. What he wants is the mail directed to</p>
<p>her existing email client as she is unwilling to change.</p>

<p>I have no ideas how to get around this as far as I can tell</p>
<p>I cannot create mailboxes and forward them on to somewhere</p>
<p>else.</p>

<p>is there a solution or has she lost all her emails?</p>

<p>kind regards</p>

<p>jonathan</p>

<p>hi jonathan,</p>
<p>to clarify the situation, i’d like to confirm if the previous mail system is still working.</p>
<p>if not, it’s not feasible to do it.</p>
<p>if yes, you can enable internal relay so that the email address which doesn’t exist in office 365 can receive emails as normal.<br />
here are the steps:</p>
<p>1. sign in to the <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">exchange admin center</a>.<br />
2. go to mail flow&gt; accepted domains.<br />
3. double click the domain, select internal relay.<br />
4. click save.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=79073391-1eda-4a77-9b0e-f6156498ef66" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d79073391-1eda-4a77-9b0e-f6156498ef66" /></a></p>
<p>note: before you do configure it, you need to verify that a public domain name system (dns) mx resource record for that smtp namespace exists and that the mx resource record references a server name and an ip address associated with your exchange organization.</p>
<p><br />
thanks,<br />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I went in and stumbled around and tried to set up a connection but it failed.</p>
<p>That was trying to point it to the place where the old emails were sent.</p>
<p>I don't know if this was exchange or not. I asked advice form an Office 365</p>
<p>support company and they said it could not be done.</p>
<p>I am a bit lost here. I was wondering is there any way we can get this *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>email address pointing at a Hotmail account. All she wants is her emails back</p>
<p>somehow and does not need all the office 365 premium stuff we have signed up to.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>jc</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>More on this: I set up a rule to forward emails for 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;to another&nbsp; office 365 and this seemed straightforward</p>
<p>and meant she would at least get her emails. Howeever I sent a test email and got this back</p>
<p><b><span>DB3FFO11FD041.mail.protection.outlook.com rejected your message to the following email addresses:</span></b></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span><br />
<span>Your message was rejected by the recipient's domain because your email address doesn't appear in the domain's directory based edge blocking allowed senders list. Contact the recipient by some other means (by phone, for example)

<p>Hi JC,</p>
<p>Yeah, before we enable the Internal Relay, we need to create a connector first.</p>
<p>For “set up a connection but it failed”, could you provide more details about this?</p>
<p>How did you set up the connector? Here is an article for your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn751020(v=exchg.150).aspx#Howdoconnectorsroute" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn751020(v=exchg.150).aspx#Howdoconnectorsroute</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the error message, it seems that your email is rejected by the recipient. I suggest you contact the recipient to ask if he add your domain or email address to the block list.</p>
<p>Could you send us an entire NDR via private message for further troubleshooting?</p>
<p>I have sent you a Private Message. Please perform the following steps to check it:</p>
<p>1. Go to the <b>Your details</b> section on the right side of the community site.</p>
<p>2. Click the <b>Private Message</b>.</p>

    <title>Office 2016 crashing when scrolling through an email - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 2016 crashing when scrolling through an email</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off I'll apologise now if I ramble on, not make any sense and if I've posted this in the wrong place, but I've been working on this issue for the last couple of days and it's both&nbsp;annoying and&nbsp;leaving me stumped.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Issue</span></p>
<p>We have a number of users who have just had the office suite on their&nbsp;computers upgraded from Office 2010/2013 to Office 2016 (downloaded from Office 365). Three were done on last Friday (19/02/16) and&nbsp;another has been using it for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>As of yesterday (24/02/16) they all started reporting issues where they'll receive an email and when they&nbsp;start scrolling down through it to read it, it'll crash Outlook and force&nbsp;a restart. This occurs if they open the email in a pop out window or look
 at it in the reading pane.</p>
<p>This also happens&nbsp;when the email is in their inbox (or sub-folders) or in a public folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Office 2013 on my (fully up to date) Windows 7 machine and have been unable to replicate this (looking at the same emails).</p>
<p>This issue does not happen to every email that comes in and&nbsp;it's not dependant on attachments or on email types (html, text). It will happen to the same emails repeatedly (so it's not a random crash) and these emails will crash for everyone affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our in house developers have developed a plugin for Outlook 2016 so that emails can be moved out of PF into a database system to make it more efficient (lots of customer related data is stored in PF and we need to get shot of it for reasons). This plugin
 requires .Net Framework 4.6.1 to work (which is installed on all these machines). Even without the plugin installed this issue happens.</p>
<p>The users we want to fix first run Windows 7, but Windows 8 and 10 users are also reporting issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Attempts to fix</span></p>
<p>We think this is Windows Update related as we've taken two machines and rolled them back (using Windows recovery) to mid January and it appears to have resolved the issue - for now (though one may now have another issue).</p>
<p>However, on another machine I worked on (last night) this was not the case, and on another machine we rolled back (to Jan) Office 2010 came back (or parts there of) and once manually cleaned off Office 2016 still displayed the same issues after being reinstalled.</p>
<p>As a test I've just installed Office/Outlook 2016 (from Office 365) on to a Windows 10 machine (which has never had office on it) and tried to open one of the known crashing emails and it still crashed - both with and without the plugin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help/suggestions would be appreciated as I might soon&nbsp;be pulling out what little hair I have left.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark</p>
<p />

            <p>After testing a sample email that Mike sent I was able to confirm that the crash issue is fixed in the upcoming 6741 release build.&nbsp; For those that have signed up for the insider builds you can manually trigger the update.&nbsp; In Outlook click File, Office

<p>
</p><p>Build 6741 is expected to go into production for everyone in the next week or so.&nbsp; If the issue is problematic and you need to address temporarily please use the steps in this KB to revert affected users back to build 16.0.6366.2068&nbsp;</p>

Hi,</p>

I'm trying to create a table that is consistent with APA formatting guidelines using Word for Mac 2011.&nbsp; It's all great except that I cannot get the text to vertically align in the table cells.&nbsp; The centre button in the cell tab of the table properties dialogue
 box just won't work!&nbsp; I have also checked that before and after spacing are the same in the paragraph format dialogue box (not sure if that's relevant but it seemed worth trying).</p>

&nbsp;</p>

I have a feeling the problem might have something to do with double spacing, which I have no option but to use.&nbsp; Can someone please help?</p>

            <p>Double spacing does affect vertical centering accuracy. This is because Word considers the height of the line times the number of lines. The result is that the 1.5 lines or double lines appear a bit higher than they should.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/272e7967-e80f-4818-a8ae-5a13feff107a" /></p>
<p>Word also adds any space before and after when calculating vertical centering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way to correct it is to add Space Before to the top paragraph in each cell.</p>

<h2>            Mail Merge with Outlook for Mac 2011 - Outlook not recognized</h2>
                    I am trying to use mail merge with Outlook for Mac 2014, version 14.3.8 (all version of Word, Excel and Outlook are the same).&nbsp; I go through the mail merge process and everything works (eve merging to a document). However, when I try to merge to email,
 I get an error message (see below).&nbsp; I have tied all three email options and get the same error message.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Could it be because I have encrypted email?<br />
<br />

Did that but got the same error message - Word cannot merge documents. Please check your mail program and ensure that it can send mail.

Had to use a PC - which worked fine.<br />

Would still like to figure out why it won't work. <br />

            Hi Christine,<br />
<br />
Phillip's suggestion should have fixed the problem for you. Alternatively, you can go to Outlook Preferences. In General preferences make sure the box is checked to have Outlook be the default eamil client. You also have to have at least email account configured
 in Outlook.<br />
<br />
Restart your Mac to ensure that the default email client setting has been registered in Mac OS X preferences.<br />

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Does the issue occur only when you try to download Google Chrome?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If so, make sure your firewall isn't blocking Google, and try restarting your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Have you checked with your Internet Service Provider (ISP)?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Issue could be related to dropping connection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'd suggest you follow the steps mentioned below and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may want to try clearing the browser cookies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Important! </strong>While deleting the browser cookies may fix the problem, it also removes your saved settings for sites you've previously visited.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Click the Tools menu. If you don't see the menu, press Alt button on your keyboard to show the menus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Select Delete Browsing History.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Select the checkbox for Cookies.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Click the Delete button.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Once your cookies have been deleted, click Okay.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>

<h2>            MS Office 2010 Transfer of License to Another Computer</h2>
                    &nbsp;I have a brand new Windows 10 computer.&nbsp; I have a 3 license MS Office 2010 disc.&nbsp; There is one license installed on a Windows 8 computer, no problem.&nbsp; Another license was installed on my Windows 10 computer,but I don't like the way my computer was running
 so I am thinking about uninstalling it and installing it on another Windows 8 computer.&nbsp;And using the 3rd license on another computer. Can this be done?&nbsp; (BTW, I will be using Office 365 on my new Windows 10 computer.)

            <p>Yes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>With this type of license, what matters is the total number of installs you have active at the same time.&nbsp; When you uninstall from one machine it frees up that license count to be used on another machine.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the uninstall process does not actually
 contact the MS activation system.&nbsp; So if you are at your limit, ie 3 machines, even though you have uninstalled, when you try to activate on the new machine you may still get a "too many installs" type message.&nbsp; In that case you have to do a phone activation.
 When you call in, do not reply to the inital prompt for a prodcut ID.&nbsp; Wait, a long time, until you are offered the option of talking to a live "service" rep.&nbsp; Explain that you have uninstalled and are transferring that license to a new machine. They should
 allow your activation to complete.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Your Dell has a Centrino 1000n card which may relate to <a href="https://communities.intel.com/thread/46128?start=30&amp;tstart=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Miracast is a type of direct connection that uses wireless. AirParrot's</div>
<div>requirements are different. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So based on the information you've provided thus far,&nbsp; your laptop probably has a wireless driver issue (which may or may not be resolvable)&nbsp;and your desktop does not&nbsp;meet the hardware/software requirements for Miracast. Which is why Settings, Devices,
 Project, Add a Wireless Display does not appear for you.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>To do so: Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly.
 Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the
 following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

            we need to know how your generating the TOC. I'm assuming you are using headings, but please confirm.   How many heading levels are you using? 
<br />
<br />I can think of 2 options.
<br />
<br />Using heading styles if you have enough to spare use the lower levels, Heading 6,7,8 ..., for the appendices. 
<br />
<br />The second is to use field codes. You only apply the field codes to the headings in the body of your document, not to the appendicies
<br />TC (TABLE OF CONTENTS ENTRY) FIELD
<br /><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/redir/HA102017492.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/red...</a>

<br />Summary: If you need to create a specialized table of contents, you need to know how to add TOC entries to your document. It's easy to do using a simple field.
<br />
<br />I found a third option, using the "Bookmark" switch as documented in this article

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Each appendix has its own table of contents, which I can't change, as these are reports that have already been submitted.</p>
<p>When I generate a TOC in the main document, it repeats all the TOC for the attachments.</p>
<p>Is there some kind of break to insert that would stop this?</p>

<p>You can select the text range that should be included in the TOC and insert a bookmark. Then edit the TOC field code so that it includes \b "NameOfYourBookmarkHere." Press Alt+F9 to reveal field codes. The TOC would look similar to:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>{ TOC \u \h \o "1-3" \h }</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would then change the code to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>{ TOC \u \h \o "1-3" \h \b "mybookmarknamehere" }</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are done, press F9 to update the field, and press Alt+F9 again to hide field codes.</p>

<p>Solved:</p>
<p>HyperV settings for this VM were for a single CPU core, which got reset at some stage from 2 cores. It worked until a feature update was installed. Changing it back to 2 cores and reinstalling 17735 has fixed this.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I copy the data like this&#63; and how to fix this.</h2>
                    <p><em>My equipment:</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;Microsoft Office 2016 v1901</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;Windows 10 v1809</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,everyone.</p>
<p>I just can't figure it out why does Excel wouldn't allowed me to copy cell(s) like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af0016eb-d744-475b-85d1-fc40fbac8afb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af0016eb-d744-475b-85d1-fc40fbac8afb?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><em>P.S: A1:C1 is a merged cell. (colume is a typo </em><span>*column</span><em>)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>More strange part is I could be able to copy this merged cell when I filtering anywhere only or hiding column B only, but when I do them both, it pops the window like that. &gt;_&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>as the title says, why can't I copy the data like this? and how to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Thanks for any response and please forgive me if I made any grammar mistake.</em></p>
<p>

<p><span>Hello Power Dekor,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have received an update with our advanced support team regarding your concern and we are able to confirm that the application is working
 as expected. The error message will only appear if a mismatched range of cells is being pasted into a merged cell. A good example is, if you merge eight cells and then try to paste a range of six cells into the merge cell, the error message appears. As a workaround,
 we suggest a few steps to achieve the process:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Copy and paste a range of cells that matches the size of the merged cell.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Cut or delete a row or column that includes a merged cell.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Clear the contents of a row or column that includes a merged cell.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Apply a filter to a column containing a merged cell, and then try to delete the merged cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to fix <span>problems with cutting or deleting, split the merged cell and repeat the cut, delete, or clear operation. To split merged cells: ​</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Locate and select the merged cell. ​</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the Home tab, in the Alignment group, click Merge and Center. ​</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Please take note that when splitting a merged cell, Microsoft Excel writes the data from the merged cell into the upper-left or upper-right split cell (depending on your current view direction) and leaves the adjoining split cells
 blank.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bob</p>

            <p>Finally I found the Solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use Windows Device Recovery Tool. Revert Back to Original OS (Eg &nbsp;Windows 10 Down Grade to&nbsp; Windows 8.1
</p>
<p>If you face this give it a try it might help.</p>

<p><span>The description of an update as for "amd64" has nothing to do with the hardware in your device.&nbsp; It applies to AMD and Intel equally.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You have been using "amd64" in every computer you have ever owned that supported 64bit Windows.&nbsp; Here's why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is customary in the chip industry to assign the name of the first chipmaker to introduce a new
<em>class </em>of chips to the whole class.&nbsp; Since AMD was the first CPU maker to introduce a 64bit CPU (the Opteron in 2003)
<em>capable of also running X86 commands natively</em>, AMD64 became the name for the entire class of such CPUs.&nbsp; That means that Intel also makes
<em>amd64 </em>chips because those chips comply with the standard of being 64bit processors that support the X86 32bit instruction set.&nbsp; This is also sometime referred to as X86_64.&nbsp; I can't stress too much that the basic requirement to be amd64 is that the
 CPU can run X86 commands natively. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel's 1999 64bit CPU innovation, the Itanium chip, did not support the X86 command set which had powered 32bit Windows so it is not in the amd64 class.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you're wondering, "X86" means the Intel 8086 chip's command set. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>6230 and Connectivity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rkohler---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            6230 and Connectivity</h2>
                    Probably a very dumb question but I have a 6230, a PC running XP Pro, the latest version of PC Sync downloaded from the Nokia website and a bluetooth connection successfuly created between PC and phone, but every time I try and sync the link is created
 and then immediately disconnected.<br />
<br />
I have done the obvious things like removing and installing the Nokia software, plus turning phone on and off.<br />
<br />
Anything else I might be missing?<br />
