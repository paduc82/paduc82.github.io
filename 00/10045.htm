    <title>Issue to open files from previous versions of Office - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issue to open files from previous versions of Office</h2>
                    Hello everybody. I am unable to open files like doc and docx, for exemple, using my Office 2013. Power point files cannot be viewed either, Bellow, follows the error explanation, but none of the reasons seems to be the problem.
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>This error message can appear for several reasons.</div>
<div>The document may be corrupt or damaged. Use either the Recover Text converter or the Open and Repair feature. Both are available from the Open dialog.</div>
<div>NOTE: If you have opened a file that is attached to an e-mail message, it is recommended that you save the file to a local hard disk first before attempting to recover or repair the file.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Open and Repair feature is available from the Open dialog box. To open and attempt a repair, click the File tab, click Open, and then navigate to the damaged file and click it once. Instead of clicking the Open button at the bottom right of the dialog
 box, click the down arrow to the right of the button and select Open and Repair from the menu. If the file can be recovered, it will open and appear in the document work area.</div>
<div>The Recover Text converter is available from the Open dialog box and appears in the Files of type drop down list. It appears in the drop-down list as: Recover Text from Any File (*.*).</div>
<div>The Recover Text converter has its limitations. Document formatting is lost, along with anything that is not formatted as text. Graphics, fields, drawing objects, and so on, are not converted. However, headers, footers, footnotes, endnotes, and field text
 are retained as simple text.</div>
<div>File permissions may be set so that you cannot access the file (read denied). It is also possible that you do not have permissions to open anything within the drive or folder that contains the file. In this case, contact the owner of the drive or folder
 and request permissions to access the file.</div>
<div>It is possible that you have run out of system resources (disk space or RAM), or that another program on your system has consumed all the available memory. It is also possible for a program to have a memory leak that is using up large quantities of memory.
 The best method to recover memory that has been consumed by a memory leak is to restart the computer. It may be possible to shut down the offending program by using the Task Manager, but it is not recommended since it may further destabilize the system.</div>
<div>There may be a read lock on the file that you are attempting to open. Another user may have the file open, or another application that has a link to the file may have placed an exclusive lock on the file, preventing Word from opening the file. If a custom
 application has opened the file, it may have opened the file using an incorrect method.</div>
<div>The file that you are attempting to open may require a file converter that is not installed on your computer. Most converters are installed by default, but optional converters are available from the Add or Remove Programs utility (in Control Panel) for
 your version of Office (requires performing an advanced customization install and searching the feature tree for Office Shared Features \ Converters and Filters). Other converters are available from the Office Resource Kit. Search the www.microsoft.com Web
 site for "Office Converter Pack".</div>

            <p>Looks like its something wrong with the instalation, My best advise for you is to reinstall the software, I will give you step by step, you should try,
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: Run this fix tool to remove the traces of Office 2013/365 Home Pre. University:

<h2>            In Excel,in vba, with 81 text boxes superimposed on a Killer Sudoku grid, how to detect which text box is selected</h2>
                    In order to preserve cage sizes but still enter 'little numbers' in a cell, I have some code which puts a small text box in each of the 81 cells of the Killer Sudoku grid on an Excel worksheet. When I know the number to be entered in a cell, I want a one-click
 method usin g VBA to delete the text box and change the format of the cell before entering the number. In order to carry out the first part of this task, my code needs to detect which text box is currently selected. Does anyone know how I can do this, please?&nbsp;

            <p>Hello Don,</p>
<p>Is there a particular reason to delete the textboxes rather than set visible to false?</p>
<p>I think that the only way to detect which textbox has been selected is to use the GotFocus Event. GotFocus is not a&nbsp;property that can be tested for True or False and therefore you will need Event Code for each of the TextBoxes. This is the reason I suggest
 not deleting but setting Visible to False so the the code remains and all you will need is a small sub to return the textboxes to visible when required instead of re-creacting.</p>
<p>Following is some example code with the sub to be called each time a textbox is selected. I am assuming that you are using TopLeftCell to identify the cell where the textbox is located.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub TextBox1_GotFocus()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call ChangeCellFormat("TextBox1")<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub TextBox2_GotFocus()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call ChangeCellFormat("TextBox2")<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub TextBox3_GotFocus()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call ChangeCellFormat("TextBox3")<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub ChangeCellFormat(strTxtBoxName)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rngCell As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rngCell = Me.OLEObjects(strTxtBoxName).TopLeftCell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.OLEObjects(strTxtBoxName).Visible = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With rngCell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Interior.Color = vbYellow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following is example code to return all textboxes to visible and remove&nbsp;interior color from underlying cell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub MakeTextBoxesVisible()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Also resets cell format<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim objTxtBox As OLEObject<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Sheets("Sheet1")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each objTxtBox In .OLEObjects<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If TypeName(objTxtBox.Object) = "TextBox" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; objTxtBox.Visible = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; objTxtBox.TopLeftCell.Interior.Color = xlNone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With</p>
<p>End Sub</p>

    <title>Improve the smoothness and clarity - text size and page zooming of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cesare vesdani  say:</h3>
<h2>            Improve the smoothness and clarity - text size and page zooming of text in the next version of Microsoft Office</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes when using Microsoft Office applications like Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint and Publisher in Microsoft Office 2019 or previous versions of Office, the smoothness and clarity of text appearance in all applications looks jagged. Sometimes characters
 are not evenly spaced out when typing out words. This bug causes some characters to have big spaces in between or be truncated so that two characters are joined together or interlock each other. The text smoothness and clarity problem mostly occurs when text
 in documents is very small. Depending on the font you are using this can mostly happen with font styles similar to
<strong>Times New Roman</strong> and other serif fonts. Also when making text bold, italic or underline, it can further impact the display of text. Text sometimes appear as jagged so improved smoothness and clarity is needed in the next version of Microsoft
 Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fdf0d293-5b72-4010-b969-ae3c51b5c87e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fdf0d293-5b72-4010-b969-ae3c51b5c87e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>In the text sample above, I typed text in point size 2 and zoomed to the maximum zoom level of 500% zoom. Users must have the freedom to zoom documents in all Office applications from 10% to 1000% without being restricted to the current maximum zooming level
 of 500%.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d478fe2-57db-4610-bd07-50b26f984c17?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d478fe2-57db-4610-bd07-50b26f984c17?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when using <strong>Clear Type</strong> in Windows, it does not help fix this text bug in Microsoft Office applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the next version of Microsoft Office, developers must improve the smoothness and clarity of text. Also, text must be possible to be made bigger than
<strong>1638 points</strong> in size. When zooming into text, the maximum zoom is 500%. Please allow users to
<strong>zoom to 1000% times</strong> for all Office applications so that text sizes of
<strong>0.5 and 1</strong> can be fully readable in all Office applications in <strong>
Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint and Publisher </strong>without any clarity and smoothness problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Meredith,</p>
<p>If the issue persists, could you provide the above info?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as a workaround, I would suggest you check whether you can download Office 2016&nbsp;directly via this URL:</p>

            <p>I use a MacBook Pro and found that, this help me. It may help, or it may not.<br />
If not reset everything back as it was before trying:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Quit Office applications.<br />
</li><li><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb009b3d-7f63-40bb-acda-7f970adc8131" /><br />
Go to ï£¿ menu &gt; System Preferences &gt; Energy Saver &gt;<br />
uncheck <strong>Automatic Graphics Switching,&nbsp;</strong>if your Computer has this feature.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Now Restart Computer after shutting down all applications.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Now Open Excel 2016.<br />
(<strong>note:</strong> the First time may take a long time to open after doing this)<br />
<br />
</li><li>Now see how responsive Excel is.<br />
(Should be a marked improvement in at least stability, if not speed, though it should increase speed as well.)<br />
<br />
</li><li>Quit Excel, and try Word, the same thing should happen.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Once test are done, if no improvement, go back to energy saver and turn back on Automatic Graphics Switching.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Test other things such as Bad or Duplicate Fonts (Font Book), Bad Permissions (Disk Utilities), Bad Preference files for Office 2016 (Remove any .plist file in user/Library/ Containers/ &nbsp;for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and so on).<br />
</li></ol>
<p>For those that might have <strong>Dual Video,</strong> but do not have the check box in energy saver, there is a Utility you can use called
<p>
</p><p>&lt;My Personal Opinion&gt; I think that&nbsp;either 2016 &nbsp;is really designed for 16GB RAM, but&nbsp;<span>Microsoft doesn't wish to admit it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Or, They have some type of error check code built in to test as they build. And are not stripping this out when they get ready to upload. Thus compromising Speed.
</span>And eventually when they â€“ if they â€“ get to a certain point in development will remove this permanently and speed will go up. &lt;/My Personal Opinion&gt;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Mobile Device Center Host Has Stopped Working</h2>
                    I have an HTC P4000 smartphone&nbsp;that I have been syncing with my laptop running Windows Vista (32 bit), Office 2007&nbsp;and WMDC (6.1). After installing the most recent Windows update, I am no longer able to sync my phone. I get the following message:<br />
<br />
Windows mobile device center sync host has stopped working.&nbsp;Unhandled exception has occurred in your application. Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID failed due to the following error: 80040154.<br />

So far, I have deleted the partnership from both the phone and the laptop, rebooted the laptop and attempted to sync. I also tried a different USB port. The error condition still exists. Any help in resolving this problem would be most appreciated. Thanks

<p>Thanks. I reviewed the link and didn't understand the action required. Perhaps it would be helpful if I shared the entire error string (see below). Does the error describe a problem with the Windows registry? If yes, how can the problem be solved. I'm not
 a Windows expert, so the error description isn't very helpful to me. <br />

            I'm just wondering here....<br />
<br />
Since you have removed WMDC then reinstalled, I'm just wondering if it is a permissions error.&nbsp; I wonder if you removed it again then go into Control Panel/User Accounts and TURN OFF the&nbsp;User Account Control.&nbsp; Reboot then reinstall WMDC and try it to see if
 it works.&nbsp; (Don't forget to turn the User Account Control back on when you are done testing&nbsp;... it will require another reboot)

            I am also experiencing this problem. I have used a Dell Axim X50 for 4 years. It has been working just fine with my Vista (64bit) operating system until May 28h. After MS Windows system upgrades loaded, I have received the "Windows Mobile Device Center
 Sync Host has Stopped Working" error. I attempted to uninstall most of the upgrades but have not been able to get a successful sync. My mobile device does connect, however it will not sync.

            Can you give us an example of a string expression you've used as the WhereCondition argument?&nbsp; It should be an expression which will evaluate to TRUE for each row in the form's table or query which holds the value on which you want the form to be filtered.

            Access saves a stand-alone macro like this and crashes.&nbsp; I can reopen the database and use the macro afterwards and it works all right.&nbsp; Access does not save an embedded macro though: it updates the form control but it does not save the form itself before
 crashing.

            You have not answered my question as to whether the same behaviour is experienced with VBA code.&nbsp; I'm trying to establish whether this is a problem with macros per se, or is more fundamental.

            You seem to be resistant to answering the question whether the same problem occurs with saving the equivalent VBA code, so let's ask other questions.<br />
<br />
Are you in a position to install Office/Access on another machine?&nbsp; If so is the behaviour repeated?<br />
<br />
When you reinstalled Office/Access did you do so from a disk, a saved installation file from an earlier download, or as new download via your MS account?<br />
<br />
I have not seen this behaviour reported before, so I'm trying to pin down the context of the problem.<br />

<p>I do not use VBA at all, so I am not sure what exactly you mean by saving.</p>
<p>I had this behaviour on a former machine too.</p>
<p>I can install Access on any number of machines but it takes a long time because I use a downloading installer.</p>
<p>The problem seems to be that GetAccessIntellisenseManager tries to call a null function pointer.</p>
<p>OTOH, Access saves the condition without crashing if I tell it to run the macro.&nbsp; It crashes only if I save by closing the macro window.&nbsp; Closing the macro window after it has been saved does not crash Access.&nbsp; However, this method cannot be used to save
 embedded macros.</p>
<p>Action SetFilter crashes too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you paste the following text into the macro editor:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16" standalone="no"?&gt;<br />
&lt;UserInterfaceMacros xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/accessservices/2009/11/application"&gt;&lt;UserInterfaceMacro MinimumClientDesignVersion="14.0.0000.0000"&gt;&lt;Statements&gt;&lt;Action Name="OpenForm"&gt;&lt;Argument Name="FormName"&gt;Tabela1&lt;/Argument&gt;&lt;Argument Name="WhereCondition"&gt;0=0&lt;/Argument&gt;&lt;/Action&gt;&lt;/Statements&gt;&lt;/UserInterfaceMacro&gt;&lt;/UserInterfaceMacros&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>then the WhereCondition is interpreted, the macro can be saved and closed and Access does NOT crash.</p>

<h2>            No Menu or Tool Bars Loaded in Outrlook 365</h2>
                    Just did a new install of Office 365 Personal Subscription on a new computer.&nbsp; All programs installed normally with menu bars, tool, bars, and the like except for Outlook.&nbsp; There are no tool bars at the top of the screen nor are there any menu bars.&nbsp; Also,
 I transferred by *.pst files from my old computer running Office 2010, and pointed to them when setting up my email accounts, but they don't show up either; i.e. the folders under the main accounts are gone.&nbsp; Tried searching how to fix this but no answers
 on line.&nbsp; How do I go to a menu bar or a tool bar to change anything when there are NO tool or menu bars visible in the first place.&nbsp; Do not like this program. Help and thank you ahead of time.

            <p>Hi Aaron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, you cannot integrate or synchronize tasks between Office OneNote and Planner. You can use Outlook to create tasks and have it on your Notebooks. Please refer the below link for more information.</p>

            It would be really great if the Bucket automatically created a section in OneNote and each task was a page. Then the checklist could also appear on the page. This would enable me to link and make notes etc to the tsk.

            When you use onenote to take notes during a meeting, it would be great to get the actions created in planner. It would help to track and manage the tracking and so the reporting for the followÃ®ng meeting

<h2>            My email account was hacked this morning. All of my emails &#40;over 10000&#41; emails and very important folders containing emails are now missing. I need them back&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My hotmail account automatically upgraded to outlook about a week ago and this morning i noticed that my Iphone was requesting the password to my hotmail/outlook&nbsp;account. My usual password did not&nbsp;work. I then tried my laptop, again, same problem, password
 was incorrect.&nbsp; I went through the account recovery process and reset the password using my work email as the alternate address to send the password reset link to. Having done this i have now logged in to my hotmail/outlook account and all of my emails are
 gone! including all of my folders which contained emails too.&nbsp; My contacts are all there but these are of little importance. Furthermore i notice that&nbsp;having accessed this forum through my&nbsp;outlook account my name appears as 'angry man (2)'?? and&nbsp;states that&nbsp;i
 have been a member since march 2010?? this is all nonsense.&nbsp; i did not enter my name as 'angry man (2)' and have been a hotmail member since 2005! not 2010.&nbsp;whats going on?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ironically i am now understandably angry. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried the usual instructions on this forum of retrieveing deleted emails and by clicking the link in&nbsp; the deleted folders section, this doesnt retrive anything and it has not been more than 24 hours since they were deleted by the hacker or by the
 password reset process?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise what can be done as these emails are of significant importance to me. Would they not be backed up on the micosoft server?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>awaiting your response. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<font color="#0072c6">ZigZag3143, MS-MVP</font></a>&nbsp;but as i wrote in my original post i have already tried the deleted email retrieval process that you suggest above and despite it not being more than 24 hours since all my emails were deleted it is not retrieving
 any emails or folders&nbsp;at all?? I have noticed other moderators have asked for the affected persons email address to be able to look into the problem? any chance you can do this? desperate to get these emails back.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My account transfered&nbsp;from hotmail to&nbsp;outlook a couple of weeks ago now and yesterday morning its stated that my password was wrong (i presume it was hacked) Upon reseting my password and recovering the account i have noticed that all my emails (we're talking
 about thousands) and all my folders are gone!! These are all my emails since 2005 and are massively important to me. Can a moderator please conatct me and i will give you my email address to look into the issue?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have noticed that other moderators have advised of the 'recover deleted emails' option in the deleted items folder. please be advised i have tried this and it recovers nothing so&nbsp;the problem&nbsp;requires investigating on another level.

            <p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand your frustration regarding this issue. In addition to what the previous moderators have posted, p<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">lease be informed that by upgrading to Outlook.com, you are only upgrading the user interface of Hotmail to the new
 user interface; hence all your emails should still stay in your Inbox.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Here are the possible reasons on why your emails/folders are missing in your account:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. <strong><span>Due to inactivity in account:</span></strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>If your emails were over 365 days old, you may have lost them due to inactivity in your account even before you renamed the account. If you had Self-recovery of emails turned on in your account before renamed, you can try to recover some of the deleted
 messages yourself (Link to recover deleted messages is under DELETED folder). You can refer to this article for more information:
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span><font color="#0000ff">Deleted email messages</font></span></b></a></span>
</li><li><span>If you were accessing your emails on a mail client such as Windows Live Mail or through your mobile device, but didnâ€™t log into your web account for over 365 days, you may lose emails due to inactivity in web account.
</span></li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. <strong><span>You got another option to save your Hotmail emails differently when renaming your account to @Outlook.com account:</span></strong> If you chose to rename your account to @Outlook.com, a prompt would have asked
 you â€“ â€˜Where do you want to save your emails?â€™ You will have the option to create a new folder for your old account or save the emails in the Inbox of your renamed account. If you chose to create a new folder, the default name of the folder will be the name
 of your old account and the folder will appear in the left pane under â€˜Foldersâ€™. And all your old emails will be stored in this folder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. <strong><span>Your account was hacked even before you renamed your account:</span></strong> A hacker had already deleted emails in their account before you renamed the account.</span></p>
</span>&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">However, if you are sure that the data loss was caused by the&nbsp;upgrade of your account to Outlook.com, you can provide us more information by answering the questions below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>When was the account switched to Outlook.com?</span> </li><li><span>Did the data loss occur right after Outlook.com upgrade or was the data still there for a brief time?</span>
</li><li><span>Did you have issues logging in before noticing data loss â€“ did you have to reset your password?</span>
</li><li><span>Did you click on any link before the issue occurred?</span> </li><li><span>Did you try to deactivate or downgrade to Hotmail.com before the issue occurred?</span></li></ul>
</span>
<p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Office 365 allowing double booking in room calendars - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 allowing double booking in room calendars</h2>
                    My organization is currently in the middle of an migration from Exchange 2013 to Office365.&nbsp; Almost all of our users are in the cloud, as well as all of our resource mailboxes.&nbsp; A member of the organization reported that they were able to schedule a conflicting
 meeting in one of our room calendars.&nbsp; After testing this, we have discovered that if a user in the organization books a meeting by inviting the room or using scheduling assistant, the room will decline the meeting.&nbsp; However, if the user navigates to the room
 calendar and double clicks on a slot that is already taken, the room will let them schedule it. No declined message or anything, it just treats it as if there are two equal meetings in the time slot.&nbsp; I have found answers saying to set AutoAccept to false
 and AllRequestOutOfPolicy to false, but the mailbox calendars were already set that way.&nbsp; Is there anything else to try to prevent any conflicting meetings from being scheduled ever?

<h2>            As bad as Google...How to TURN-OFF ip-location based search&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    For short moment I switched from google to Bing, and was happy. Then Bing failed me the very same way as Google. It started to automatically revert my searches based on my ip-address location, despite I had chosen my location to match my physical location.
 I am working in global company, and the ip adress location is some 1500 miles from me, in another country, in another language area. How can I stop bing from automatically deciding my location based on ip address!?!?

    <title>e63 Firmware Update Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yaphcs  say:</h3>
<h2>            e63 Firmware Update Problem</h2>
                    
<p>Firmware version: 100.21.110</p>
<p>RM-437, Nokia E63-1 (26)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been trying many times to update the firmware to the latest version using NSU, but failed.&nbsp; I had the phone connected via the USB cable, and each time the update begins, the phone gets disconnected and re-connected again.&nbsp; But after approx 10 mins,
 the screen goes off, the phone is disconnected, and appears to have powered off.&nbsp; When I power on the phone and try updating again, the same problem occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone seen this before?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>While doing a firmware update, the firmware updater warns that during the process the phone may shut itself off and do some unusual things, and that the process should not be interrupted, the phone not used etc. The process takes a longish period of time
 and one must be patient. And not manually restart the phone when it appears to have switched itself off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would leave the phone where it is until it finally lights up by itself again.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, I have indeed left the phone untouch for almost 30 mins... i saw that it got shutdown, but it never came up.&nbsp; The weird thing is that it keeps losing cable connection during the update.&nbsp; Do you encounter that?

<p>I don't remember losing a cable connection. And I think 30 minutes is a long enough time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can only recommend a hard reset (backup your phone memory to your memory card or using Content Copier of PC Suite), then turning off your phone, pressing the green button, the 3 and *&nbsp; buttons of your handset at the same time, starting your phone and not
 releasing the buttons until you see the&nbsp; Nokia hands screen. This will clean the phone memory bringing it to the status when it left the factory. See if it corrects the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can later restore your phone memory from where you did the backup.</p>

    <title>IDT Audio and Rest Problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            IDT Audio and Rest Problems</h2>
                    So, my friend bought this new Windows 10 Technical Preview CD from his office and wanted to see what it's like. And, he was too excited and downloaded Windows Technical Preview on my host computer. For some days it was fine, but I really wanted to go back
 to Windows 8 (because 10 is a preview, pretty buggy). Yesterday I "Reset" my computer and Windows 10 is still here. I can't get rid of it, it's not I don't like it, I just want to work on windows 8 for now, until Windows 10 is not so buggy. And, after the
 reset finished, my Audio Drivers are...gone. I mean, I still see some things under the "Sound, and..." in Device Manager, but when I go to the volume adjustment at the bottom right of the screen (the small icon) it shows "No Audio Output Device is installed."
 If anyone can help me get back to Windows 8 and/or help me fix the Output Device problem, I'd really appreciate this. Thank You
                </div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on the Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How exactly did you perform a 'Reset'? Which media did you use to&nbsp;perform the Reset?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are facing some issues with the drivers after performing a Reset, you would need to install the latest chipset drivers from the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to go back to the previous Operating System, you'll need to reinstall your version of Windows from the recovery or installation media that came with your PC (typically DVD media). If you don't have recovery media:
</p>
<p><span><br />
For <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> or <span>Windows&nbsp;8</span></span>: You might be able to create a USB recovery drive. For more info, see

<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows&nbsp;8.1</span></span></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Kindly, take a backup of all important data before you perform a Reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. If you have further queries, we will be happy to help.</p>

            <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
You can check the option to switch back by following the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Sign in to Outlook.<br />
2. Click the&nbsp;<strong>Gear</strong> icon, then click <strong>Switch back to Hotmail</strong>.<br />
<br />
If you didnâ€™t see this option <strong>Switch back to Hotmail</strong>, switching back to Hotmail isnâ€™t available for your account.<br />

Thanks!</p>
