<h2>            No Prepaid Return Labels&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am thoroughly disappointed.<br />
<br />
First, my history with xbox. If you want to get to the problem, skip to the second paragraph. I have had an XBox since Day 1. I stood in line at Wal-Mart for 6 hours. I loved it. But ever since, I have had a slew of problems. Red Ring. Refurbished. Red Ring.
 Refurbished. Repeat this process a total of 6 times... 6 Red Rings... I'm still a loyal supporter. After this, I decided to just buy a new one, one of the sleek new black ones with a huge hard drive (I've always been bad with the names of them). And now I
 love it!<br />
<br />
<br />
Fast forward 11 months. Now my precious new XBox has a power supply that overheats. We have to put it on the air conditioner just to keep it running. I call Customer Support to get a replacement (still within warranty), and I was utterly shocked at how the
 process was handled. First off, I was required to send back the original and wait up to 15 days for a replacement. I was not offered the option to get the replacement first. Now I understand this, I work for Amazon.com Customer Service, and I know some rules
 you just cant break, and I GUESS I can see this being one of them. But still, I offered to have them bill me for the replacement if they didn't get the original back, but to no avail. So I give in... But then, I discover that they're making me pay to return
 my broken, within-warranty power supply back to them. Are you serious?! Every time I sent my red-ringed box back to them, I did so with a pre-paid return label provided to me by Microsoft. I am told that they only provide return labels for console repairs,
 and my "accessory", as they called it, did not qualify. So I quickly ask to speak to a supervisor. Of course, before being transferred, I am told she will "tell me the exact same thing" (one thing I can't stand). Julie, the Manager, was very kind, and did
 everything she was supposed to do. But that's the problem. Julie told me that this is the way things are supposed to be done. I completely agreed. I understand that this is the process, the way it works. My complaint is that Microsoft Customer Support doesn't
 have the ability to make exceptions as small as a pre-paid return label. Julie even said "I agree with you, I think the policy should be changed". Throughout this whole thing, I kept thinking "What if I'm acting too... entitled?" Maybe I should just suck it
 up and pay the very small amount that it would cost to return this thing. But Julie helped justify my cause.<br />
<br />
Bottom-line; Microsoft is extremely lacking in their ability to modify their customer service strategy to the situation at hand. And why am I posting this wall of text on Microsoft's forum? Well, because Julie told me to! That's why =P</p>

<p>Bless you Julie! I guess she wants us to make as much noise as possible? Either that or she manipulated you to drop the case, trivial or not.
<br />
<br />
I actually think there should have been a process in place that didn't require a change from this current one where a power pack is counted as an accessory.<br />
<br />
With the grief they've caused you, you should have been entitled to a free return label. 6 RROD's? C'mon, that's an inconvenience of six folds. 3 to send the darn things for repair and 3 to wait for its return.<br />
<br />
Ah well. Anyway I hope everything goes smoothly with this now.</p>

<p>I actually ended up contacting Microsoft support directly about this issue - all of the above settings were in place. Not sure if the last item ExchangeDelegateSync took place automatically or not? Perhaps the support rep I spoke with manually performed
 this task or something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Here's some of the feedback I received:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">Basically, you cannot assign users delegate access in sfB (Skype for Business) since Call forwarding from Skype cannot be setup. To get this option, you should have Enterprise voice enabled (PSTN plan is required). This message
 appear because you set delegation from Outlook. If you are not delegate in sfB, you will get an error message.<br />
<br />
Skype for Business allows you to view your meetings and appointments from your Outlook calendar. This is why when you create a delegation from Outlook, the delegation message appear in Skype.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">Thank you,<br />
Abdoulaye Cisse<br />
Office 365 Support</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">I tried to get more information from Abdoulaye regarding what changes were made but this issue was fixed. The exact changes that were made were not clearly explained to me despite me asking several times. My problem mainly stemmed
 from my inability to adjust the delegation rights from within Skype. The support rep I spoke with said this feature is available under 'call forwarding' in the Skype options however this option was completing missing from my test machine and the production
 machine. I've attached a screen shot of the delegation prompt I received in Skype after the microsoft engineer did some troubleshooting -- after receiving this notice in Skype the end user was finally able to add these events without the delegation error message
 referenced above.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>If I understand you correctly, you have a computer that was purchased with Windows 7 Home Premium x64 pre-installed.&nbsp; You installed Windows 10 on this computer and now you want to re-install Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that the product key for Windows 7 Home Premium x64 is still legible on the COA sticker on the machine, you can reinstall Windows 7 by following the directions here:&nbsp;
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install-wininstalls/clean-reinstall-windows-7/0ae269fd-167e-423b-94ef-26133f89e10c">

<p>
</p><p>Skip the parts that don't apply to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the article linked above explains, you can get the required ISO file by using the tool downloaded from here:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-and-office-iso-download-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-and-office-iso-download-tool</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that Microsoft is making it more and more difficult to access the latest version of the Windows 7 ISO files.&nbsp; Heidoc, linked above, which is the only known place to obtain a legal and untampered-with copy of these ISO files for Windows 7,
 is having difficulties for this reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As noted in the FAQ below, the August 2018 version of Windows 7 does seem to be generally available using the Heidoc tools.&nbsp; If you use this, you'll just have to add more updates.&nbsp; I don't know to what degree, if any, the Dell version has been customized.</p>
<p>
Here is the latest information from Heidoc:
</p><p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Q: I'm getting the message "This file is currently unavailable. Please check again later."</strong><br />
<strong>A: </strong>The file can't currently be made available. The number of different downloads for Windows 7 and Office 2010 that we can offer at the same time is very limited. The files to be unlocked next are determined by community demand. Currently available
 downloads are highlighted in green. You can wait until your file becomes available again, or alternatively download the Windows 7 August 2018 update, or one of the DELL OEM images.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Download options for Windows 7 and Office 2010 are currently severely restricted. New links can be generated every Wednesday from 00:00 UTC on a 'first come, first served' basis, and remain accessible until they expire.</p>

10.&nbsp;Close it when prompted.</span></p>

    <title>Getting Samsung Windows 8 Applications back - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pc wizard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting Samsung Windows 8 Applications back</h2>
                    <p>We purchased a Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T.&nbsp; We had a problem with the hard drive and had to reload Windows.&nbsp; Using the Samsung SW Update utility, we were able to load all drivers and *desktop* applications that came with this tablet (Mini S Note, Quick Start,
 Easy File Share, etc.)&nbsp; However, we did not get back any of the pre-loaded Samsung Windows 8 applications (S Camera, S Note, S Gallery, etc.)</p>
<p>Upon contacting Samsung support, they first indicated that we could just download these apps from the Windows Store.&nbsp; When we pointed out that we had searched in vain to find them in the Store, they then said that this was a Microsoft problem "with the servers",
 so we should contact Microsoft to find out why these Samsung applications are not in the Store, as Samsung apparently believes they should be.</p>
<p>Can Microsoft and Samsung please play nicely and work this out?&nbsp; We didn't have a lot of chance to work with these applications before we had the problem, but they seemed to be pretty useful applications. Thanks.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for your post.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For common Metro apps problems, check the following:</span></p>
<p><span>· 1024x768 is the minimum screen resolution needed for Metro apps; they will not start when your resolution is lower.</span></p>
<p><span>· Check if UAC (User Account Control) is enabled. UAC must be enabled for Metro apps to work.</span></p>
<p><span>To check, simply type UAC from the home screen and it will appear on the Settings search result.</span></p>
<p><span>· Try using a local account instead of a Microsoft account (Live ID) and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>Please go ahead and follow the methods mentioned below and later update us on the status of the issue.</span></p>

            I don't think running Metro apps is the issue as I understand it - because I have the same issue...
<div><br />
<div>I can't find the Samsung SNote app in the store, or the SCamera app. &nbsp;Should those Samsung apps that come pre-installed on the Ativ Smart PC or Smart PC PRO be available for a re-install from the Store, or should they be downloaded somewhere else? &nbsp;Sounds
 like the previous poster called Samsung and they said they should be in the Store, but I can't seem to find them there.</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>So I learned a little more tonight playing with it. I installed the Mini S Note app, and clicking around in there directed me to a link to install S Note:
<a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/en-US/app/s-note/894a71cb-01fa-4da3-9b77-9e8b6877c686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/en-US/app/s-note/894a71cb-01fa-4da3-9b77-9e8b6877c686</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you follow that link in IE on the Samsung device, and try and open it in the Store on the device, then the Store app says "Sorry, this app isn't available for your PC." so whatever is checking that is preventing the app from being installed on the PC,
 even though it's a Samsung Ativ Smart PC.&nbsp; That's probably the same reason searching in the store isn't bringing it up either.&nbsp; So whatever MS or Samsung is using to check to see if the app is available to us is preventing it.&nbsp; Now, I'm betting it's related
 to the fact that we reinstalled the OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone from MS/Samsung reads this, the reason I reinstalled the OS is to put Enterprise on it using our volume license agreement (I need bitlocker and didn't want to pay the $70 for the upgrade on the device especially because I have Enterprise through
 our volume license agreement).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I happened to get that link from the Mini S Note app, I don't know what the links for S Camera or S Gallery are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any chance of "side-loading" those apps, or getting the way device detection is setup modified?</p>

<p>Hey Babu</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Didn't work</p>
<p>The store indicates my Ativ PC Pro as a non compliant for S note and camera.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            OK. I found the solution. The problem is in activating windows. Entering marketplace before activation of Windows 8, make you lose the ability known as ATIV by marketplace. After format don't enter marketplace without activation windows. After activating
 you can install apps back over Samsung Picks in marketplace. Voila!

            I tried to avoid a whole re-install and I used slmgr.vbs to unactivate my copy of Windows (we have a KMS server that I use to activate off). &nbsp;I verified I don't have an active copy, but it still wouldn't let me view the app in the Store.
<div><br />
<div>Using this same model, I wonder if you'll be able to access updates when they come out after activating.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For what it's worth, if other people try to un-activate, here's the link to the KMC client key for Windows 8 -&nbsp;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj612867.aspx.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also have a call open with Samsung too, but it's been quiet for a couple days now.</div>

            So I thought I'd try a fresh install of Windows 8 Enterprise today, so I fresh install Windows, and first thing I did was head to the Store, and the Samsung apps weren't available. &nbsp;I'm not sure that doing it before activation is the only solution...
<div><br />
<div>So by locking the app down, you don't let other people use it, and you tick off Samsung customers at the same time. &nbsp;Toss the app in SW Update for us Samsung... you did it with Mini S Note.</div>

<h2>            I have problems with Clean Install windows 10</h2>
                    <p>It's been a week now or maybe a month since my computer got problem, my computer have Bitdefender installed and it detect a bug in Segoe_ui shell and when the box appeared, my computer got hang and can't move even my mouse so i restart my computer by pressing
 a small button in my CPU and the problem started, it boots in UEFI: built in shell and it stuck there and i cannot trigger the automatic repair option and i cant access safe mode, so i search internet solution and still nothing is working, and i reformat my
 PC and do clean install by using media creation tool on USB, it's not working at first so i do it again until it works. I can only access MSI boot menu because my motherboard is MSI build and i think there's nothing wrong in CMOS because i can restore it to
 defaults.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thing I've tried:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When the installation finished, i am stuck at setup screen that says "just a moment" so i reformat it again and still the same. And i tried to disconnect USB devices and network cable, nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. So i get updated media creation tool and install it on my PC, and it got stuck on "getting ready" screen for hours and i restart my PC and got an error of windows installation cannot proceed and change it on regedit and it freeze there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:</p>
<p>-My CPU has no CD/DVD so i am using USB.</p>
<p>- I can Access MSI Boot menu, i can change boot order there.</p>
<p>- I am installing windows 10 now, when my computer is brand new and no OS installed, it install with windows 8.1 i think the problem is related there.</p>
<p>- I didn't do backup because my pc is slow anyway, and need to remove everything.</p>
<p>- I can access the advanced troubleshoot in installation media only, tried repair my pc and it says, no recovery option installed or no problems were found.</p>
<p>- Tried CHKDSK command, nothing is wrong.</p>
<p>- Boot loading is taking so long, i left my computer open for 24 hours straight, even the installation of windows.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi there FelineMoon, thanks for reaching out.</p><p><br /></p><p>To take advantage of Xbox Play Anywhere, you will need to have installed the Windows 10 Anniversary Edition update on your PC, as well as the latest update on your Xbox One console. Then, simply log into your Xbox Live/Microsoft account and your Xbox Play Anywhere games will be available to download. On your Xbox One, games will show as “Ready to Install” under “My Games and Apps”. On your Windows 10 PC, games will appear in “My Library.”</p><p><br /></p><p>Did that help you access Sea of Thieves or are you still experiencing this issue?</p>

            This morning, again on startup I received this message (in full): Instruction 0x7c911689 referenced memory at 0x02954005. Memory could not be read."<br />
<br />
I believe my computer has the latest Microsoft updates.<br />
<br />
I use Norton Antivirus for an error message 3048 3.. They took over my computer yesterday to fix an update problem and gave me a free software update of the program and virus definitions.
<br />
<br />
Used spybot on machine (came out clean - one malicious cookie removed.<br />
<br />
What else should I be doing? Symantec says this is a Windows problem....<br />

            <p>no matter what else you are using download the two scans I gave you and run till they are clean, then you can uninstall them.</p>

<p>you can right click each entry to search online for what it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>clear the check mark to disable and then restart to see if the error is gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you might want to do say five at a time, but only the non Microsoft items.</p>

            <p>I also had this message but the window frame it came in identified the name of the effected program in the blue bar at the top. &nbsp;Have another look and see if it identifies the relevant program. &nbsp;Mine was ATi2evxx.exe and there was another very helpful post

<h2>            Network is losing connection but WiFi is still working</h2>
                    <p>My network keeps disconnecting at random intervals. The WiFi icon in the task bar will show I am not connected but have available connections to choose from. My network will not be listed in available connections when this happens, but if I turn the WiFi
 off and on again using the sidebar my network automatically connects; my internet works flawlessly until it disconnects again. I have many different devices including computers tablets and gaming consoles and while I did have trouble getting my Xbox One to
 connect to my wireless, every other device has no issues and does not encounter this problem. When the internet disconnects on this computer, my other devices still have full access. I recently had my ISP send someone out to fix my internet and gave me a better
 modem and the only thing that may be affecting my connection would be the router, though I don't understand why that would cause it to disconnect. I have full bars when connected on this computer, the best reception of all my devices. I have rebooted several
 times and the problem persists. My next step is to repair windows files if nobody says otherwise.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Here's my specifications:<br />
Operating System<br />
Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit<br />

NVIDIA High Definition Audio<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Additional info:<br />
It occurred to me that it is possible several of my programs might be interfering with my connection. Specifically Google Drive has been attempting to synchronize my folders every time this has happened (though I've only had this PC for about 3 days so it's
 hard to know for sure) and I am hypothesizing that my connection drop has something to do with that. I'm going to try testing my connection with and without drive running for a day or so and I will update with the results.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Update: My internet is definitely having issues when I open up several tabs and bandwidth usage is high. I also had Google Drive syncing at the time but it was only when I opened 4-5 YouTube videos that it finally disconnected. Going to try and find a wireless
 card driver and see if that fixes things.&nbsp;</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>The signal strength is a combination of the actual 802.11x signal + Phone + Microwaves + other sources that might generate 2.4GHz “Noise” in other words it is visual representation of all the 2.4GHz in the atmosphere around the your Wireless hardware.</div>
<div>That is,&nbsp;you might see High Signal Strength that Shows:&nbsp; Excellent (5 bars), but it is actually&nbsp; 30% signal + 70% noise.Such a signal would be the reason for low bandwidth, and or frequent disconnection of the Wireless Network.</div>
<div>In contrast, a&nbsp; medium level&nbsp; Signal (3 Bars) that does not contains any noise would provide a match better connection.The real meaningful measure of the Wireless' signal capacity is Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), a measure that takes into consideration
 the relevant Signal adjusted to the Noise Level.&nbsp; Unfortunately, none of the Entry Level Wireless drivers provides such a measure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There&nbsp;are a couple of freeware utilities that can be installed on a Wireless Connected computer and would provide SNR information like &nbsp;Netstumbler.These softwares would show valid SNR only with Wireless cards that provide the raw information to the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If your card is Not on the list you can still use&nbsp;SNR soft wares&nbsp;to scan your environment, and find out if there is additional WIFI signals around.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As an example, if you find a neighbor using his Wireless Network set to channel 6, try to change your system channel to 11, and thus avoid noise interference between the Networks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software
 can be solved. Usage of Third Party Software are done at your own risk.</div>
<div>Steps to change your WiFi channel:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Step 1.&nbsp;Access your router's web interface. This can be done by opening a web browser and navigating to the router's IP address. This URL will either be printed in your router's documentation or possibly on the bottom of the device itself. If not, open
 a Command Prompt in Windows and type 'ipconfig' without the quotes and look for the default gateway address. This is your router's IP address, and will be similar to 192.168.1.1. Next you'll be asked to enter the routers name and password, these details will
 either be printed on the router itself or in the manual. Ideally, you should change the password to prevent anyone else accessing the settings.</div>
<div>Cmd prompt - Router IP address</div>

<div>Step 2: From the web page that is displayed, look for the Wi-Fi settings and the channel number should be selectable via a drop-down menu. The exact location of the option will differ depending on the router manufacturer. In this example, we used a D-Link
 router and the channel settings were found by clicking Advanced from the main page. We then selected Wireless setup from the options on the let-hand menu and then chose Manual Wireless Network Setup. Make sure you save the settings - your router may reboot
 to apply the change.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>
<div>Please get back to us with the updated status on the issue.</div>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which device are you referring to?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the device?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check if there are any updates or patches for the device and download them from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to
<span>disable and re-enable the USB controllers. The following steps will uninstall all the USB controllers and then re-install them:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on
<b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Run</b>. </span></p>

</b>without<b> </b>quotes, and then click <b>OK</b>. Device Manager opens. </span>
</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Expand
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>. <br />
<b>Note:</b> You might have to scroll down the list to find this item. </span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click the first USB controller under
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>, and then click <b>Uninstall</b> to remove it.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Repeat step 4 for each USB controller that is listed under
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Restart the computer. After the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan
 for hardware changes and reinstall all the USB controllers that you uninstalled.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. Let us know if you need further assistance and we’ll be happy to help.</span></p>

            Hello!&nbsp; I believe I have a similar problem.&nbsp; I have an HP 2600n laser printer and I just bought a new computer.&nbsp; The printer is several years old.&nbsp; I have not been able to get the printer to work from the new computer.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I ran the troubleshooting feature of my device manager, and got the same note as the person above:&nbsp; If the USB 2.0 device is incompatible with USB 3.0, plugging it into a USB 2.0 port can solve the problem.<br />
<br />
I am a little confused by your advice and a little nervous about unistalling things from my new computer.&nbsp; (I am not a computer person!)&nbsp; Are you saying to uninstall the usb port, plug the printer in, then restart the computer with the printer plugged in?&nbsp;
 Will windows know to adjust the port to be usb 2.0 compatible?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you could just give a bit more explanation in laymen's terms, that would be wonderful.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />

            <blockquote>Hello!&nbsp; I believe I have a similar problem.&nbsp; I have an HP 2600n laser printer and I just bought a new computer.&nbsp; The printer is several years old.&nbsp; I have not been able to get the printer to work from the new computer.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I ran the troubleshooting feature of my device manager, and got the same note as the person above:&nbsp; If the USB 2.0 device is incompatible with USB 3.0, plugging it into a USB 2.0 port can solve the problem.<br />
<br />
I am a little confused by your advice and a little nervous about unistalling things from my new computer.&nbsp; (I am not a computer person!)&nbsp; Are you saying to uninstall the usb port, plug the printer in, then restart the computer with the printer plugged in?&nbsp;
 Will windows know to adjust the port to be usb 2.0 compatible?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you could just give a bit more explanation in laymen's terms, that would be wonderful.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />

            <p>Hello Kateg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have resolved the issue. &nbsp;Here is what I found: &nbsp;On my computer, I have a 2.0 USB on one side and a 3.0 USB on the other side. &nbsp;I can only print if plug the printer into the 2.0 port while the computer is off, and then turn the computer on. &nbsp;If I
 turn the printer on first, the printer will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing I noticed: &nbsp;my new computer (or some of the programs) seem to default to printing to One Note, even when I have my printer as the default printer on the computer. &nbsp;Check the destination every time you print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck. &nbsp;It's enough to make me never buy another computer! &nbsp;:)</p>

            <p>I had the same issue with a LaserJet 1020 and I resolved it by.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Opening device manager (Windows+x, opens menu, select Device Manager)</p>
<p>2) Uninstalling the driver for my printer, which was listed under other devices.</p>
<p>3) Powering off my printer.</p>
<p>4) Uninstalling the "USB Printing Support" under "Universal Serial Bus controllers". It failed the first time, but worked the second.</p>
<p>5) Turning my printer back end and noticed that it reinstalled the USB Printing Support and my device's driver. Now my device is actually listed as a printer. I tried it and it worked. Yeah!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure why machines get in this state, but seems like an OS bug to me. I can forgive an occasional bug They happen. However, it is tragic that Windows 10 still doesn't have a troubleshooter that reliably fixes issues like these. It is even worse that someone
 wrote and shipped a completely absurd error message implying that USB 2.0 devices may not work in USB 3.0 ports.</p>

            I am hoping you may be able to help me because I am facing a similar issue.&nbsp; I just upgraded to Windows 10 and am having trouble getting my HP Deskjet D1520 to work properly.&nbsp; It acts like it's printing and goes through the motions but just prints blank
 pages.&nbsp; I called HP and he worked remotely on my laptop but couldn't get the problem resolved.&nbsp; I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the printers and the USB Printing Support and nothing happened.&nbsp; After troubleshooting multiple times, I get the same error
 message regarding the USB 2.0 devices being incompatible with the 3.0 ports.&nbsp; I tried all the spots on my laptop and none worked.<br />

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode with network network function to repair Windows..
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Would you be so kind to say if this solved the problem?

<h2>            What happens when someone calls my Skype Number from another country&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Skype number in Australia.&nbsp; I regularly receive calls to my Skype number, no problem. But someone tried to call me from New Zealand and I didn't receive the call. Is that normal? Can I only receive calls from Australian numbers?

<p>Hi Sergei</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My number starts +6102</p>
<p>
</p><p>where +61 is the country code&nbsp;</p>
<p>and 02 is the area code</p>
<p>
</p><p>When calling someone in Australia from overseas using a normal phone you wouldn't include the 0 before the 2</p>
<p>So you would dial +612XXX XXXXX</p>
<p>Is that the case for the Skype number or do they have to dial&nbsp;+6102XXX XXXXX ?</p>

<p>Hi Joseph</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for that, but your answer wasn't really clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When someone calls me from overseas on my non-Skype number they dial&nbsp;<span>+612 XXX XXXX. Which is considered the complete country and area code. The "0" before the 2 is left out when calling internationally. As is the case
 for most countries. It is only used when dialling within the same country. e.g. 02 XXX XXX.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So when someone calls my Skype number from overseas do they dial&nbsp;</span><span>+612 XXX XXXX or&nbsp;</span><span>+6102 XXX XXXX ?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

<h2>            Unable to Sign In and play Compatible 360 Games on my Xbox One&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This is an issue that started about a month ago for me. When it was first introduced, I had zero issues installing and/or playing backwards compatible games on my Xbox One. Now, every time I fire up a game, and it loads up the Xbox 360 game, I immediately
 get the "disconnected from Xbox live" pop up, and I am unable to sign in.</p>
<p>Is this a known issue? I've searched around but haven't found anything. How can I fix this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>To verify if you have 2-step verification you can head over to <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.microsoft.com</a> and check under Security. If you have it enabled you'll need to sign in with a generated app specific password, You can also generate an app specific password from that security page. Let us know what you find :)</p>

            <p><span>Hi AmyDowell,</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to update the drivers from device manager. Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click start, type device manager on the start search box and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Expand the webcam section and double click and go to&nbsp;drivers tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click update drivers tab to update the drivers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Restart the system and check.</span></p>

<p><span><span>Hi Yacobellis,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may first try to uninstall all the USB controllers and try reconnecting it and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To remove and reinstall all USB controllers, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click Start, type device manager in start search and press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Right-click every device under the Universal Serial Bus controllers node, and then click Uninstall to remove them one at
 a time.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Restart the computer, and then reinstall the USB controllers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. Plug in the USB&nbsp;devices, and then test to make sure that the issue is resolved.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also try to reset the Bluetooth dongle and mouse.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Press and release the button on the Bluetooth dongle when the light starts to blink.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Also press and release the button on the bottom of the mouse when you get a steady light.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>

</p><p>If Home Basic was preinstalled by your PC maker, and you failed to make the recovery disks as per your PC makers instructions, and you can no longer do so, then contact that PC maker to request the recovery disks, for which there may be a fee.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, your options are limited since Microsoft no longer provides Digital River downloads of Windows 7 .ISO. So your options are the following:</p>
<p>- Borrow a Windows 7 Home Basic retail (upgrade or full version) or a OEM System Builder DVD from a friend who has one.</p>
<p>- Try requesting backup media from Microsoft.</p>

<p>- Try the following:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you
 start your computer by pressing a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling
 fee.</span></p>
<p><span>------------------------------------</span></p>
<span>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<span>
<p>For Dell, press F8 on the keyboard until the Advanced Boot Options menu appears on the screen.</p>
</span><span>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. </p>
<p>For Fujitsu, press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>

</p><p><span><strong>If you know someone who has a Windows 7 Home Premium, Professional or Ultimate or Starter DVD, you can borrow it, create a .ISO image and do the following:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Creating Digital Backups</strong></p>
<p>Now let me show you how to create digital backups. If you have physical copies of applications you still use, you can create digital backups of them and install them just as easy too using free software. The program I use for this is free and called ISO
 Recorder by Alex Feinman. You can download it <strong><a href="http://alexfeinman.com/W7.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">here</span></a>.
</strong></p>
<p>Using ISO Recorder is very simple. For this example I am going to make a backup copy of my Windows 7 DVD. After you installed ISO Recorder, insert the disc you would like to create a digital copy of. Choose
<strong>Open Computer</strong> from the <strong>Start</strong> menu.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ISO1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fISO1_thumb.jpg" height="455" width="524" /></a></p>
<p>ISO Recorder adds a ‘<strong>Create image from CD</strong>’ contextual menu (which you can access via a right click). Click it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ISO2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fISO2_thumb.jpg" height="356" width="582" /></a></p>
<p>This will launch the CD Recording wizard. Click the <strong>browse</strong> button to choose a name and location where you would like to store image.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ISO3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fISO3_thumb.jpg" height="492" width="587" /></a></p>
<p>Make sure the <strong>Save as type</strong> selection is set to ‘<strong>ISO-9660 Image files (*.iso).</strong>’ This is a universally recognized image format. Click
<strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ISO4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fISO4_thumb.jpg" height="353" width="577" /></a></p>
<p>The program is now creating an image of your disc.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ISO5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fISO5_thumb.jpg" height="351" width="574" /></a></p>
<p>When complete, click <strong>Finish</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ISO6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fISO6_thumb.jpg" height="233" width="543" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></a></p>
<p>You now have a digital copy of your program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once one has the .iso file they may wish to use the <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Windows-7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool/3000-18513_4-10972600.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then browse the thumb drive, open the <strong>Sources </strong>folder&nbsp;and delete the
<strong>ei.cfg </strong>file:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.rricketts.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2feicfg-02.jpg" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then boot from the thumb drive:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-from-a-Windows-7-installation-disc-or-USB-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-from-a-Windows-7-installation-disc-or-USB-flash-drive</span></a></p>

</p>
<p>Windows 7 will boot as it normally does into the setup environment, the only difference this time is, you will be given a choice to select the edition of Windows 7 you want to reinstall.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-5.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-5_thumb.png%3fw%3d566%26amp%3bh%3d426" /></a></p>
<p>Select Windows 7 Home Basic and proceed with the installation as normal. I suggest that you create a backup once the installation is complete.</p>
