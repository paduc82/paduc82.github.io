<h2>            What keeps recreating &#34;MicroImageDir&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    Does anyone know what in Windows 10 keeps creating a "MicroImageDir" folder in the Temp folder? &nbsp;It keeps reappearing with several image files in it that I would rather not have there.

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>No, I don't have any backup app running, including Windows' own. Other than sync settings, I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a similar note, a folder named "MicroThemePackDir" gets created in Temp all the time, most often when access the Settings / Personalization sections (not sure exactly which part triggers it). &nbsp;But for the life of me I can't discover what action is triggering
 the creation of the&nbsp;MicroImageDir. &nbsp;I thought maybe the Photos app, but doesn't happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One time I saw the two folders get created in Temp only a minute or two after Windows boot. So something Windows 10 loads in the background is doing it, so I was just wondering if it was something common.</p>

            <p>They are .jpg, and always the same 7 .jpg from a bigger pictures folder, but their sizes are reduced for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I did make some discoveries concerning this. &nbsp;Viewing the "Lock screen" section of Settings-&gt;Personalization is at least one event that definitely causes an empty MicroThemePackDir folder to be created in Temp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And one event I found that triggers the creation of the&nbsp;MicroImageDir folder is actually using the Lock screen (winkey+L). Why the same 7 .jpg are copied there is still a mystery, since I never used them for the lock screen. But at least I found a culprit
 of this, plus it seems actually saving the current theme (instead of it always showing "Unsaved theme") stops the folder from being created all the time. &nbsp;(In experimenting I did also delete the 7 .jpg from the main folder they originate from, so I'm not 100%
 sure if that or the theme save actually affected the issue.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the earlier input. :)</p>

 starting a thread..&nbsp; Now I do not know how long the response will take so i&nbsp; lived this long with the issue and maybe i can figure out a way to stop it from happening so thanks for the response</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 USB installer can&#39;t start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> user-fff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 USB installer can&#39;t start</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to install Windows 10 from a retail USB installer on a new system I built, and suddenly the installer crashes every time as it tries to initialize. Right after I choose install 64-bit, it starts to load then goes to a blue screen with code 0xc000021a.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thing is, I had been well into the installer a couple hours earlier, but had to quit when it couldn't see any drives to install to (I think because I set SATA to RAID in the BIOS). However, between then and my next attempt I updated the BIOS to the latest
 version to try and fix some memory instability and because the stock BIOS was old. The RAM is set slower and passes memtest86 and the installer's memory test, and SATA is set to AHCI, but since my second attempt to run the installer I always get a blue screen
 at the same point while loading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made sure *ALL* BIOS settings are what they should be (basically all default), RAM is stable, but the installer always fails in the same way. There's nothing plugged in except the video card, unformatted SATA drives, and the keyboard and mouse. I also
 flashed the BIOS to the original version that I got into the installer with previously, so that everything is set like it was when the installer worked, but this also had no effect. It's like it now has memory that it's supposed to crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run out of things to try and I'm not finding much additional useful information. Many of the recommendations are too vague or don't apply to a clean install.</p>

    <title>Photo disappears after rename - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jkobarg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photo disappears after rename</h2>
                    I use photo gallery to rename my pictures, i.e. change the DSC_ - part to a name that refers to the contents of the photo. Many times after typing in the new name and pressing ENTER the photo disappears and the next one is shown. I can't even get back
 to it by pressing the left arrow button. I have to go back to the list and press F5 to restore the sort order. I always use the photo date is my sort criteria.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What makes things worse: This does not happen all the time! (But most times!) Sometimes the renamed photo just stays there and I have to manually go to the next one. (Which is what I would prefer to have all the time.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a real inconvenience when after renaming I want to add comments or change other properties.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So for now I have switched to Picasa to do the rename while using Photo gallery for the rest of the job. Is it too much to ask that one program should do the job completely?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this a bug or a feature? If the latter: How can I turn it off?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks a lot in advance.</div>

<h3> irishdad1957  say:</h3>
<h2>            Volume C&#58; was not optimized . . . .  Defrag</h2>
                    Have searched high and low for cause of an error every time Disk Optimization (Defrag) starts either manually or automatically:<br />
<br />
"Volume C: was not optimized because an error was encountered: the parameter is incorrect. (0x80070057)"<br />
<br />
Seems Microsoft is unable (or unwilling) to provide any fix to this problem.&nbsp; I have no SDD, only HDD drives.&nbsp; Seems the only solution to this problem is simply trash the Windows Defrag, and pursue an alternate 3rd party solution such as Defraggler, etc....&nbsp;
 [SOME SOLUTION Microsoft, I really thought you were better than this.]&nbsp; I tried all the fixes offered by Microsoft, and some not by Microsoft, with no success.&nbsp; Anyone have a suggestion not yet considered?
<br />

    <title>Windows 7 connects to wrong router - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benzee5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 connects to wrong router</h2>
                    <p>I have a network with 2 routers on it.&nbsp; 2nd router is an extender. Each router and switch are in different rooms of the house.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I plug in my 2nd router, Windows 7 will automatically switch over to the shared inkjet printer&nbsp; for network connection then I have no internet. When I unplug 2nd router, Windows 7 switches back to router1 and works as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I make Windows 7 stick to router1 and not switch over to the printer router 2?</p>

<p>To do what you asked with your present configuration open Network and Sharing Center from Control Panel.&nbsp; Select Mange Wireless networks in the left panel then adjust the priority of connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE:&nbsp; If you configure your network properly you won't have this problem.&nbsp; Your second router should be reconfigured to function as a Wireless Access Point so it doesn't create a separate subnet.&nbsp; Many wireless routers today have a setup option to function
 as a WAP.&nbsp; If not, it can be done manually. See</p>

<p>The problem is Windows 7 connects to the printer connected to router2.</p>
<p>Router2 is configured as an access point. All other computers in my houes do not have this issue. On this PC with windows7, I have other HDs with XP, XP Pro, Linux, Win98. Those OS's do not have this issue. But with Windows 7, as soon as I plug in router2,
 Win7 connects to the Inkjet printer and router2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll post screenshot of win7 network map when I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OH! I do not have a "manage wireless networks" link. Prolly because I have no wireless nic in this particular PC.</p>

<p>It sounds to me that your 2nd router is performing as a router and NOT as a wireless access point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer is not a wireless one, but connected using an Ethernet cable, it can only connect to the router it is plugged into.&nbsp; Wireless networks are not accessible to a computer without a wireless adapter.</p>

<p>
Whether wireless or wired the basic issue is the same.&nbsp; It certainly seems like Router 2 is not properly configured and is acting as a DHCP server and creating a separate subnet.&nbsp; How did you configure it as an access point?&nbsp; Exactly what model router is it?<br />

<p>
</p><p>As you can see, my PC is connected to a switch. That both routers plug into that switch. Since the internet is now working, maybe this subject is moot. BUT I would prefer the pc take the correct path.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should go through switch to router1, but it's now going to Inkjet printer, then to router1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, it went through printer to router2. Either Windows 7 don't have the network control I demand or I just don't know how to make it do it.</p>

<p>my taskbar changed from bottom to right side of my screen.&nbsp; when i moved it back down, the task bar went from a single row of start up icons with open application windows in the same row on the right side to basically two rows -- top row has&nbsp;start up icons,
 2nd row has the&nbsp;beneath the first row, even though there is plenty of room in the top row for them.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; the top sizing arrow doesn't do anything at all and the only&nbsp;sizing handle i can see is located on the right side of the start button&nbsp;and won't move.&nbsp; (and yes, the taskbar is unlocked)&nbsp; the task bar is about an inch high and even&nbsp;when i change the size of
 my icons to the smallest i STILL can't get the blasted thing to shrink down to it's former 1/2" or so.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
i wouldn't care except that i don't have access to the bottom portion of some open applications -- mostly games -- and there are buttons there that i have to click on to continue working.</p>

<div>"<span>Click on an empty area of the taskbar and hold the mouse button down.
<p>
Now, just drag the mouse down to where you want the taskbar to be. Once you get close enough, it'll jump right into place.</p>
<p>
To keep it from jumping around again,&nbsp;<em>right</em>&nbsp;click on the taskbar, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Lock the Taskbar</strong>.</p>
<p>
If you like, you can actually put your taskbar on top, the bottom or any side of the screen you like.</p>
<p>
That's all there is to it!"&nbsp;Leo Notenboom for&nbsp;<a href="http://ask-leo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AskLeo.info</a>.</p>

<h2>            Restart Your PC to Finish Installing Updates</h2>
                    According to the Get Windows 10 app, the download is in progress. When I click view download progress, it takes my to the windows update window where it says "restart your PC to finish installing updates". My computer restarts quickly but then nothing
 happens. It just puts me right where I was before, still running windows 8.1.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Waking from Sleep frequently - Windows 10 Home</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a Asus Vivobook Notebook (i5-8250U CPU) with Windows 10 Home Single Language (v1803 OS Build: 17134.228). Since last week the notebook wakes abruptly from sleep mode. It goes to sleep without any problem but wakes up after about 4 seconds or 5
 minutes or even 15 minutes into sleep. And this happens every time. The duration between being in sleep mode to an abrupt wake is inconsistent. Here is what I have tried from whatever help I found on the internet:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I use a Logitech wireless mouse. Removed the plugged in USB transceiver to see if that helps, no it doesn't.</p>
<p>2. Checked running processes in Task Manager, found nothing suspicious or new running in the background.</p>
<p>3. Sleep gets interrupted no matter how I put the notebook to sleep - closing the lid/from power option/power button configured to sleep. These all worked perfectly fine till a week ago.</p>
<p>4. No malware/virus is reported from the Avast anti virus (free version, updated) scan. Have been using Avast free version since I bought this notebook about 6 months ago.</p>
<p>5. Haven't installed any new app in the last week.</p>
<p>5. Checked the Event Viewer. Here are the logs from a recent sleep interruption:</p>

<h2>            Skype on Sony Bravia TV not working very well since last update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem since the last Skype update. I didn't get the update on my Sony Bravia (not Android TV) television and the problem is that it doesn't let me call someone who has updated his Skype on windows/iOS or other platform. I need some help how to
 update Skype on my TV, because I tried resetting the TV or update the software but without succes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice: my TV is NOT Android TV</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

KovacsZoltan,</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to a change in Skype infrastructure moving from peer to peer to the cloud, Skype for TV is no longer supported. We want to create the best possible app experience for our Skype users which means we have to make some changes along the way. These decisions
 are hard to make, but will enable us to focus our efforts on transitioning Skype from a peer-to-peer video and chat app to a modern, mobile friendly cloud architecture.</p>

    <title>Why does the Windows 10 installation take so god damned long&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drakinite  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does the Windows 10 installation take so god damned long&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am on an HP Pavilion dv7 laptop which originated with Windows 7. It had some issue with updating, so it would not successfully upgrade to Windows 10 nor would it even update to a newer/more secure version of Windows 7. In order to update the computer,
 I had to install a new version of Windows 8.1 as a stepping stone between 7 and 10, with a disk. It was a partial "upgrade," where all files were kept but settings and programs were deleted.</p>
<p>After installing 8.1, I downloaded a Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant and it successfully began downloading. Everything seemed fine, until the installation part. The first 50% went by quickly, but it got slower and slower as time went on. By the time it got
 to 90% complete, it was crawling by, taking over 4 hours. When it went to 98% I had to leave, so I closed the laptop- and it crashed. After that, I got an error and from then on the upgrade assistant refused to work - the same way that it had upgrade problems
 when it was on windows 7.</p>
<p>So then I had to re-install Windows 8.1 <em>again</em>, to be able to even start the upgrade assistant. I started it around 9 PM last night. The installation progress followed the same pattern as before. When I went to bed at midnight, it said it was 95%
 complete. When I woke up, it was at 99%, and right now - 11 AM - it's still stuck at 99%. I check the Task Manager and the upgrade assistant is always at 0% CPU usage and 0% disk usage. This installation has taken 16 hours to go up to 99% and 13 hours to go
 the last 4% of that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here's my question: Why the **** is it taking so long to install this? It seriously should NOT be this long, especially because the majority of the installation was pretty quick.</p>
<p>I may seem upset but I am. Thank you in advance for your help, if anyone can figure out some solution to this problem I will be eternally grateful.<br />

            There's my problem, I can't even do that. I tried exporting the system information file, but it got stuck checking CD-ROM. I have tried to update my drivers but any time I try to install anything, it freezes at some point or another, and fails to do anything
 past that. No errors are thrown, they just freeze entirely. It's a mess.

<p>
</p><p>I first had Windows 7, no problems..&nbsp; I downloaded Windows 8 and everything worked fine.&nbsp; I was will pleased and thought Windows 8 was the greatest ever.&nbsp; A beta program came out and again everything worked great. When the final 8.1 came out, I downloaded
 it and that's when many problems started.</p>
<p>For some reason I was given Windows 8.1 Pro.&nbsp; I don't think I needed&nbsp;Windows 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my computer for personal records and have many Excel spreadsheets.&nbsp; I have no problems with Excel and Word.&nbsp; Explorer works fine. Just can't use many Apps and beginning January 1, I have not been able to install all updates.&nbsp; Updates that were not
 installed &nbsp;keep coming up.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am able to use my computer for all of my real needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand Microsoft is going to issue a patch which will fix all.&nbsp; It is sure needed.</p>

                    <p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, I'm facing a problem every time someone asks me <strong>what kind of network will better suit a small business, a workgroup network or a domain network</strong>?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could someone help me to find information about the <strong>advantages</strong> and
<strong>disadvantages</strong> of each one for a small business? In this way I clear that doubt definitely.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hi Jack,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Computers on a network can be part of a workgroup or a domain. The main difference between workgroups and domains is how resources on the network are managed. Computers on home networks are usually part of a workgroup, and computers on
 workplace networks are usually part of a domain.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>All computers are peers; no computer has control over another computer.</span></li><li><span>Each computer has a set of user accounts. To log on to any computer in the workgroup, you must have an account on that computer.</span></li><li><span>There are typically no more than twenty computers.</span></li><li><span>A workgroup is not protected by a password.</span></li><li><span>All computers must be on the same local network or subnet.</span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>One or more computers are servers. Network administrators use servers to control the security and permissions for all computers on the domain. This makes it easy to make changes because the changes are automatically made to all computers.
 Domain users must provide a password or other credentials each time they access the domain.</span></li><li><span>If you have a user account on the domain, you can log on to any computer on the domain without needing an account on that computer.</span></li><li><span>You probably can make only limited changes to a computer's settings because network administrators often want to ensure consistency among computers.</span></li><li><span>There can be thousands of computers in a domain.</span></li><li><span>The computers can be on different local networks.</span></li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A workgroup is a basic network infrastructure with slack security control and there is basically no central controlling administrative center.
<br />
A workgroup is more synonymous with small networks - one where it does not warrant to have a domain network installed. With a workgroup no other extra computers are required and by far the cheapest setup for a local in-house network.
<br />
<br />
A domain on the other hand is more complicated and suitable for large businesses with many computers and departments within departments like a university structure or the structure within the Microsoft Corporation.
<br />
Domains have extra computers to oversee the normal functioning of the corporate computers and security and sharing of data is high on the agenda.</span></p>

</p><p>Since you're able to install Skype for Windows 10 version 12.18 to your computer, we can be sure that you're running Windows Anniversary update or later versions of the Windows operating system. And this is the latest version available for your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With that we assure you that you are using the latest version of Skype for Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you! <strong><br />
