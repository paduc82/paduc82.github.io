<h2>            Calculator launch - a showstopper&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>On all releases of the W10 tech preview, windows calculator will only launch from the keyboard button on&nbsp;a Microsoft Wireless keyboard 6000 v3.0 when all other windows are closed or minimized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a huge issue!&lt;G&gt; and must be fixed prior to release.</p>

<p>There is no limit in Outlook unless you are using an old PST from Outlook 2002 or older, or you have an Exchange mailbox.</p>
<p>If you have an Exchange mailbox, simply click on New &gt; Outlook data file. Create one and move your excess mail to it. Exchange mailboxes often have a mailbox cap.</p>
<p>If this is the case, you must note that once you move your mail from your Exchange mailbox, where it's backed up every day, to an Outlook data file (personal folders AKA pst file) it's no longer backed up by the company/school and is no longer recoverable.
 You have to make your own backup to cover yourself in case of computer crash and/or data loss.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 mail and calendar issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> axeman101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 mail and calendar issues</h2>
                    <p>Two years ago I got fed up with the tech issues I was having and went all microsoft. &nbsp;I made my hotmail account my primary email account and added my gmail account to outlook as an additional account. &nbsp;I moved from google calendar to outlook. &nbsp;I subscribed
 to office 365 to get the latest version of the office suite. &nbsp;I replaced my apple Iphone in for a nokia Lumia 920. &nbsp;I paid for 5 premium support licences for our computers at $100 per year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was an epic fail. &nbsp;The main issue that I have is that my outlook 2013 client will not sync with outlook.com for appointments. &nbsp;So if I add an appointment on my computer it doesn't arrive in my phone. &nbsp;This is particularly a problem when I download an
 entire schedule for an event like Denver Startup week with all my appointments in it. &nbsp;They turn up on the desktop version of the app but not in the phone. &nbsp;If I need them in my phone I need to add them through outlook.com or manually put them into my phone.
 &nbsp;The problem occurs whether I use an iphone, a windows phone, or an android phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The local microsoft store has temporarily fixed it by deleting my profile and when it does an initial sync everything appears on the phone. &nbsp;But the minute I add a new appointment it doesn't carry across.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other headache is that the hotmail inbox clears itself sometimes when I launch outlook 2013. &nbsp;Since I have over 4000 emails in my inbox it takes an awful long time to resync everything from the server. &nbsp;Not to mention the hit to my data cap with it doing
 that as frequently as it does. &nbsp;One of the main reasons I use outlook 2013 is to have my emails available offline. &nbsp;I haven't analyzed what I've been doing every time it happens. &nbsp;But It seems to happen when I run a search of my inbox for email. &nbsp;All the mails
 in the inbox will disappear and the search will hang. &nbsp;When I cancel the search it says we can't find anything here for the inbox and then starts to sync everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone to the local store multiple times and while always helpful and polite it's pretty obvious the technical talent there can't help me. &nbsp;I have had some very unhelpful conversations with premium support over the phone. &nbsp;I've tried reaching out to the
 facebook pages and twitter accounts of office 365. &nbsp;Very very unsatisfactory customer service all round. &nbsp;Especially since I paid extra for support last year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm about to give up and try Google for everything. &nbsp;But I really don't want to learn to use their sheets etc after a lifetime of using microsoft products. &nbsp;If anyone can help me with a way to stop the inbox clearing itself and resyncing. &nbsp;Also to tell me
 how to get my appointments to sync from my desktop to arrive on my phone (now a Samsung Galaxy 4) I'd appreciate it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could swap to outlook.com as my main portal for mail but I prefer the fully featured version of outlook and I really want a local install of my mail client to be my main data entry point with the phone etc syncing back on the occasions that I put an appointment
 in out in the field. &nbsp;Surely I'm not the only one who still likes it that way?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your responses Brian and Ram. &nbsp;The apps that I've tried it with are the standard calendar app on ios (on an iphone 4s and an iphone 6plus), the standard calendar app on the samsung galaxy 4, and the standard calendar app on the windows nokia 920.
 &nbsp;In each case it asks you as part of the setup process on the phone to enter the email address of your account and your password and each phone appears to auto configure the rest bringing down tasks, calendar, contacts and mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have multiple calendars enabled in hotmail and my hotmail account is pretty old. &nbsp;It was also set up overseas if that makes a difference. &nbsp;I don't usually use categories. &nbsp;However I do have some reoccurring events that have categories assigned and surprisingly,
 based on Ram's comment above, those are definitely in the phone. &nbsp;It's the uncategorized ones that aren't showing up. &nbsp;I am not sure if the reoccurring events are dynamically updating and changing or a static leftover from one of the delete and resync experiments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't been using the phone calendars for 2015 due to the lack of reliability. &nbsp;But all of my appointments from 2014 are on my office 2013 desktop calendar but not on any of the phones. &nbsp;For example I had a place holder 5 day event blocked out from the
 24th of August 2014 until the 29th. &nbsp;All day event assigned to a calendar that has a check next to it on the windows phone. &nbsp;So it is in office 2013 and it is in outlook.com but it is not on the lumia phone or the samsung phone. &nbsp;The Samsung Phone has mostly
 my old gmail calendars on it. &nbsp;It doesn't break out the names of individual hotmail account calendars as far as I can tell but my hotmail address does have a check next to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have exchange activesync set up on outlook 2013 and both the windows phone and the samsung Brian if that is what you mean by how I have it configured?<br />
</p>
<p>I've just gone through and deleted 9 of my calendars leaving me with just 3 in hotmail. &nbsp;Tomorrow I'll go through and delete &nbsp;most of my gmail calendars as well and see if starting again helps. &nbsp;I did manage to get a test appointment entered tonight to sync
 to my phone. &nbsp;So perhaps the problem was in one of the calendars?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on why the mail keeps deleting itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Craig</p>

            <p>On my PC I use Outlook 2013. On iOS, I use the built-in Mail app. I also use the built-in Mail app on my Android device. All sync with both my Outlook.com accounts using EAS, and each shows me multiple contacts and calendar lists. Although the contacts are
 intermixed, the calendars and mailboxes are all separate from each other, so I know which account I'm using. I can also select and deselect them so the calendar view shows only the calendars I want at the time. I don't have access to a Windows Phone, so can't
 speak to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remember, however, I have to manually configure the Android device, using m.hotmail.com as the server (although s.outlook.com also works) and I had to specify my Outlook.com address with a preceding "\" so that the domain was understood to be empty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have all devices connected to my Google account, but Outlook 2013 uses IMAP for that because I don't want to pay for Google Apps in order to get contacts and calendar to sync. I did add the Google calendar to Outlook 2013 as an Internet calendar so
 I can see it, but it's read-only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Particularly for Outlook.com having configured them using an overseas ISP could lead to connectivity issues, but if mail works, the security aspects must be OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to deleting older mail, your devices will have a setting. &nbsp;For Outlook 2013, for example, has "Mail to Keep Offline" which limits how much information is synchronized locally, but it doesn't delete messages from the server. IOS has "Mail Days to Sync",
 but that, too shouldn't delete older messages, just not keep them locally on the device. I can't check right now, but I believe Android also has a similar setting.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Some of your issues sound familiar. I have myself had many critical issues with the contacts and calendar of outlook.com (hotmail.com) ‚Äì especially when connected to Outlook 2013.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Word 2007 - Different headers per cover page</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I've created a template with 4 cover pages (fax, letter, note, report). Depending on the selected cover page, a different header should be displayed starting of page 2.</p>
<p>Is that possible? And what's the best way to do it?</p>
<p>Can you help me to get started?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance!</p>

<p>There are three header/footers associated with each section of the document (some of which are dependant on others).<br />
The macro I provided assumed a single section document with a different first page header.<br />
If you want the same footer in both the first page and the subsequent pages you would have to apply it to both footers.<br />
Using the previous macro as an example, that means setting the two relavant footer ranges and applying the same content to both eg</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Set oRng = .Sections(1).Footers(wdHeaderFooterFirstPage).Range<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .AttachedTemplate.BuildingBlockEntries("PageFooter"). _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Insert Where:=oRng, RichText:=True<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Set oRng = .Sections(1).Footers(wdHeaderFooterPrimary).Range<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .AttachedTemplate.BuildingBlockEntries("PageFooter"). _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Insert Where:=oRng, RichText:=True</p>
<p>Obviously you would need to insert the appropriate footer building block entry name(s).</p>
<p>I assume that you have some means of identifying which type. In the following example I have provided an input box as a means to determining the document type (which is the simplest method to reproduce here) with three possible choices. The choise sets the
 name of the building block and the modified code from above inserts the appropriate footer building block.</p>
<p>Dim oRng As Range<br />
Dim sPageFooter As String<br />
Dim sType As String<br />
sType = InputBox("Enter number of document type" &amp; vbCr &amp; _<br />
"1 - Letter" &amp; vbCr &amp; "2 - Memo" &amp; vbCr &amp; "3 - Fax", "Document Type", 1)<br />
Select Case sType<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Case Is = 1<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sPageFooter = "LetterFooterBB"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Case Is = 2<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sPageFooter = "MemoFooterBB"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Case Is = 3<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sPageFooter = "FaxFooterBB"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Case Else<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
End Select<br />
With ActiveDocument<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Set oRng = .Sections(1).Footers(wdHeaderFooterFirstPage).Range<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .AttachedTemplate.BuildingBlockEntries(sPageFooter). _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Insert Where:=oRng, RichText:=True<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Set oRng = .Sections(1).Footers(wdHeaderFooterPrimary).Range<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .AttachedTemplate.BuildingBlockEntries(sPageFooter). _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Insert Where:=oRng, RichText:=True<br />
End With</p>

<p>Creating separate templates would indeed be the easiest way. But then I would end up with 16 templates (4 types in 4 languages) which makes it more complex. So being able to condense it into 4 templates would be great.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure to completely understand the code you provided.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In my actual setup of the template, the first page header and footer are inserted when selecting the site (code you provided for my 1st question).<br />
<br />
The header on the second page depends on the document type. The footer is the same for the whole document.<br />
<br />
Can I just skip that part?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Set oRng = .Sections(1).Headers(wdHeaderFooterFirstPage).Range<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; .AttachedTemplate.BuildingBlockEntries("FirstPageHeader"). _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Insert Where:=oRng, RichText:=True<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How do I tell Word to use the same footer as used on the first page.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance.</p>

<p>It would make more sense to create separate templates for each task, each with their appropriate header/footers pre-applied as required. Then create a new document from the appropriate template.<br />
If you want to build the document type on the fly, then depending on the header/footer you insert on the first page, you could insert header/footers as appropriate for the subsequent pages. The code is similar to that you requested earlier, except that you
 now need to set the ranges to the primary header/footers and apply your header/footer building blocks according to the document type</p>
<p>Dim oRng As Range<br />
With ActiveDocument<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; If .Sections(1).PageSetup.DifferentFirstPageHeaderFooter = 0 Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Sections(1).PageSetup.DifferentFirstPageHeaderFooter = True<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; End If</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Set oRng = .Sections(1).Headers(wdHeaderFooterPrimary).Range<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .AttachedTemplate.BuildingBlockEntries("SubsequentPageHeader"). _<br />

                    <p>Hi all, any feedback or suggestions will be greatly appreciated....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm facing the Outlook 2016 bug that prevents you from editing a contact because&nbsp;it deletes existing data&nbsp;or doesn't show an input&nbsp;enabled box&nbsp;when you go into edit mode. I'm also noticing the duplication of contacts, but I don't know if the two are related.
 I'm managing about 5000 contacts with pictures so exporting to csv file and reimporting isn't an option....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a bug database where this is recorded that I/we can subscribe to in order to get an ETA for resolution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ross.</p>

            <p>Hi Sagnik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When I go to an existing contact it seems to display fine. When I click the edit option it displays the edit window however many of the fields have been blanked out, and sometimes the field to type into isn't even shown as input selectable just the headings
 of the field show. I've tried opening the contacts in the list view and that shows some information as blank too (eg. email address) yet when I go back to the card view the information is displayed again.</p>
<p>2) The contacts come from Outlook.com, synchronised down to my new SP4 running Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>3) There are no other accounts configured to Outlook, and the contacts in question are not linked in any way within Outlook they are only sourced from People.live.com . However I do have people.live.com linked to my linkedin account and have had bugs with
 that connection which Microsoft server support has fixed in the last month or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ross.</p>

About an hour ago I received advice from a member of the Word Product Team that a fix for this has been released and that if you re-start Word, while your computer is connected to the Internet, you should no longer see the Security Concern message.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Note that this fix has been made available by a process that Microsoft refers to as "flighting off the rack" that takes place when you re-start Word when connected to the Internet and it does not involve installing a formal update to a new build number.</p>

<h2>            Spell check glitchy</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>My spell check works maybe 1/4 of the time. It's not prompted by a change in settings, or even by opening or closing the program. It'll flag a word one minute, and not the next. Sometimes,
 if I right-click on a word that I know is misspelled, but that hasn't been flagged, it's like it realizes it was supposed to be flagging things and highlights all the misspelled words on the page. But that only works sometimes. I've also tried going in and
 checking and unchecking all of the spell-check options, and no combination of options fixes the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used the Microsoft live chat once and the technician tried fixing the problem remotely (I think that's what it's called? He sort of took over control of it.), but, as always happens with
 these things, it worked perfectly while he was checking it out. It's been driving me crazy, though. Especially because I'm a student, and I often don't have time to read through as meticulously as is necessary to catch every single misspelled word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded the software last September, and have since gotten a new computer, and it does it just as much on this computer as it did on the old one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do about this?</p>

            <p>Hi Veronica,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure your computer is updated till date and have the ‚ÄòService pack 1‚Äô installed for Office 365 and then verify the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also repair the Office 365 installation and check if it helps resolve the issue:&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If issue persists, restart the system in Windows Clean Boot and then check how it works there.</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I see the body of e-mails</h2>
                    <p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using BAND 2 with a Samsung Note 5 mobile phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have noticed is I only get the number of e-mails that my hotmail account gets. However I can't go in details neither see each e-mail's subject nor each e-mail's body texts. When I swipe to left, I get the previous number of e-mails. When I use the
 action button, my e-mail address showed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it seems that there is no problem with the SMS section. I can see the body text reply button at the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be nice of you advice me what might be the problem or if it is possible to check the body of the e-mail in some extend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Jamie<br />

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked around the community but have not found a solid fix for this. If I open a new tab in IE it will appear next to my current window. Now if I drag that tab, I used to be able to drag it to another monitor. Now all it lets me do is re-arrange my
 tabs. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps I have already taken -</p>
<p>- Reset IE</p>
<p>- Reinstalled IE</p>
<p>- Disabled Addons in IE</p>
<p>- Performed a clean boot</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I run IE as an administrator. This feature works. If I log into my admin account. This feature works. I don't quite understand what would be still preventing this feature on the users computer. Any help would be great.</p>

    <title>How can I rearrange the toolbars in Internet Explorer 11 &#40;e.g. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cornan the iowan  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I rearrange the toolbars in Internet Explorer 11 &#40;e.g. move &#34;disembodied&#34; tabs to bottom&#41;</h2>
                    <p>In some earlier versions of Internet Explorer it was possible to drag the toolbars to different relative positions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then that feature stopped working.&nbsp; Even if "Lock the Toolbars" is unchecked (and the "move" handles appear) all the toolbars are pretty much immobile.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In particular, I dislike the "disembodied" tabs that appear TWO toolbars above the windows they affect.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What kind of metaphor is it to physical reality to slice the tabs off the folders and place them two [toolbar] rows away?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A "successful" answer to this question would:</p>
<ol>
<li>(at least)&nbsp;Let me move the "disembodied" tabs back to the windows they control</li><li>(if possible) restore "draggability" to <u>all</u> the toolbars so that I can once again place them where I want them.</li></ol>
<p>To be honest, I used IE almost exclusively from its creation in the 1990s until 2009, right about the time the toolbars got arthritis.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now I use Firefox 99% of the time and only "revert" to IE for special needs and to test web pages.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance anybody who takes the time to read this question and (especially) if there are still ways to restore functionality and "re-embody" the tabs.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 SharePoint &#34;Item cannot be deleted while on hold.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, new to SharePoint here so forgive me. &nbsp;But, I have a site collection which will not allow documents to be deleted and I cannot figure out how to fix the issue! &nbsp;It's not just one document...its all documents...none of them will delete and all throw the
 following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b82ca727-02ed-46cd-8464-d1238851fede" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b82ca727-02ed-46cd-8464-d1238851fede" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>I have reviewed compliance details of items and confirmed thru site settings that there are NO holds in place. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also reviewed thru site settings that there are NO retention policies enabled or set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone offer any other ideas? &nbsp;I am at the end of my rope! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please remember, I am very new to SharePoint so I'll need the "Instructions for Dummies" version of any suggestions. &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>THANK YOU!!</p>

<h2>            Embed PowerPoint stored in OneDrive without requiring permissions</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to embed a PowerPoint on a website and share the content with anyone that has access to the site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read several threads regarding this and none of the fixes has worked.&nbsp; I created a PowerPoint presentation and shared it to OneDrive.&nbsp; I opened the file in PowerPoint online and generated HTML code to embed on our website.&nbsp; I encountered the same
 issue as several other users that resulted in needing to grant guest permissions.&nbsp; As one forum suggested, I generated a link to the file that gives guest access to anyone.&nbsp; I tried combining the 2 links together as outlined here (<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_powerpoint-mso_other/powerpoint-online-embedding-without-password/2f51e454-8395-4973-9db8-2a9ac4de68cf">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_powerpoint-mso_other/powerpoint-online-embedding-without-password/2f51e454-8395-4973-9db8-2a9ac4de68cf</a>),
 but it results in an error message on the website that either says that the File is not found, or that the URL is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I did (*** indicates personal info retracted for this post):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Embed HTML</p>

<p>Hi Melanie,<br />
<br />
It is possible that this is due to the recent changes to the OneDrive settings. To properly isolate this issue, we'd like to ask some questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did the issue start?</li><li>Are you experiencing the issue with sharing other Office documents?</li><li>What is the exact error message that you encountered?<br />
</li></ul>
<p><br />
We're looking forward to your response. </p>

<p>Some developers from Microsoft helped me to figure out how to make this work. Unfortunately, our company's file permissions&nbsp;blocked&nbsp;the workaround from being successful.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what we did:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>Log into your office.com account.&nbsp; </li><li>Open OneDrive.&nbsp; </li><li>On the bottom left, click on "Return to&nbsp;classic OneDrive".&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Navigate to the file that you want to share. </li><li>Click on what's listed for the file under the Sharing column.&nbsp; A window will open.&nbsp;
</li><li>Click on "Get a link" at the left.&nbsp; </li><li>If you just want people to view the file and not edit, select "View link - no sign-in required".&nbsp; Or you can select the option appropriate to the permissions that you want.&nbsp; Then, close the window.&nbsp;</li><li>What's listed under the Sharing column&nbsp;for that file should now update to "shared".&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>To double check, you can click on the 3 dots next to the file name to confirm the settings for the link.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
</li><li>Open the file in the online version of PowerPoint and create the HTML to embed.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>You can generate this by searching for "Embed" in the search box.</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>I hope that this works for you.&nbsp; The developers that did the troubleshooting for this were really helpful, so thanks to them for figuring this out.</p>

<p>I've been trying for about a day now and still no change. I need to have this account live pretty soon. So I hope I don't have to wait 72 hours to find out I have to wait another 72 hours because of something I did wrong. So your help is greatly appreciated:)</p>
<p>What might be different is that the domain has a "-" in the name. <br />
The domain is brand new, although I've put a website on it and put pointers at other domains to it.
</p>
<p>I've cleared the DNS list so it only holds info for ftp, localhost, mail, pop, smtp, domain.com., www, 2 domain.com. NS records, some localhost AAAA and the TXT</p>
<p>TXT I've written as @ | MS=msnumbers </p>
<p>I've put the overal TTL on 3600.</p>
<p>Please let me know what to do</p>

<p>Hi George,</p>
<p>If we want to add domain to Office 365, the domain must have at least 4 characters, and can include only letters, numbers, hyphens, and periods, and must include the domain extension. For example, contoso.com.</p>
<p>If you cannot verify it via adding the TXT or MX record, please try the following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Remove the domain from Office 365, then remove the corresponding DNS records from your hosting provider.<br />
<br />
2. Wait 1 hour, try again to add the domain to Office 365. <br />
<br />
3. Add the newly generated TXT (recommended) or MX record from Office 365 to your hosting provider.<br />
I notice that the TTL is not done per record and the priority isn't an option with MX, you can contact your hosting provider to help you add the DNS records if you are not familiar with it.<br />
<br />
4. Verify the domain in Office 365.<br />
A related article:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-your-users-and-domain-to-Office-365-6383f56d-3d09-4dcb-9b41-b5f5a5efd611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.office.com/.../Add-your-users-and-domain-to-Office-365-6383f56d-3d09-4dcb-9b41-b5f5a5efd611</a></p>
<p>If the issue persists after that,&nbsp;I would like to collect some information below:<br />
<br />
1. Do you receive any error message?<br />
If so, please send us a screenshot about it via&nbsp;clicking Use rich formatting in this thread and select Insert/Edit Media.<br />
<br />
2. Your custom domain.<br />

<p>Hi George,</p>
<p>Glad to hear that you have verified your domain in Office 365.</p>
<p>About the email issue, after checking the DNS records of the domain, I find the value of the MX record isn't added correctly. There are some additional numbers and character "02b", please remove it to check if the issue can be fixed.</p>
<p>Normally, if my custom domain is contoso.com, to set up email in Office 365, I need to add all the required records, including the MX record for email which looks like this:
<em><strong>contoso-com.mail.protection.outlook.com</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Here is a related article for your reference:<br />

<h2>            is outlook being phased out</h2>
                    <p>A friend was recently talking to a salesperson at "Best Buy" to resolve a personal email problem.&nbsp; She had previously been an Outlook user and, due to a crash of her old system, she lost her copy of Outlook and wanted to replace it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The salesperson (at Best Buy) told her that she could not purchase another copy of Outlook and that Outlook would be a poor choice as it is being phased out by Microsoft.</p>
<p>Is there any basis for this statement or was the salesperson confusing Outlook with Outlook Express?</p>

<p>Outlook is not being "phased out". </p>
<p>Outlook Express is gone as it was last used in Windows XP. Currently Windows Live Mail is Microsoft's free email client.</p>

    <title>Problem with outlook.com Contacts - imported from gmail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rickd972  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with outlook.com Contacts - imported from gmail</h2>
                    <p>I am moving from gmail to outlook.com. &nbsp;I have used the connected accounts feature and all mail was imported nicely. &nbsp;I'm now trying to move over all my gmail contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i've exported from gmail (per the instructions I chose Google Mail CSV option; but have also tried outlook csv as well). &nbsp;At any rate; to begin with I only exported 10 or 15 to insure the fields lined up as desired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The import appears to work fine as I got prompted to insure the content "appears OK" and continued on. &nbsp;Once completed; I got a message indicating the import was successful; but no entries show up in "My contacts"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a subsequent time (and 3rd, 4th....); and each time now I get a message indicating "the contacts you are importing already exist".</p>
<p>
</p><p>so somewhere outlook believes the contacts exist; but I can't see them in the "People" view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have found if I go into the "Settings / Options" and drill down to "people"; then to import contacts; this option appears to work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to the "people" view; and selecting 'Manage / Import' results in the same "duplicate" entry issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure why the difference between the two options ;or how the import options differs, but it is frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also; the help sections for both differ in their recommendation; the "people" view indicating to export gmail contacts in the "gmail" csv format; while the settings/options help screen indicates to export as "Outlook" csv file from gmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh well.</p>

            Since this glitch appears to affect mostly the Body styles and not the Headings, you should check to see what font is assigned for Body in this theme. It may be that just changing the font will solve the problem. By default, the Body style is Calibri and
 the Heading style is Cambria. It would appear that both of these have been changed.

            <p>If a soft reset didn't work, we suggest that you perform a hard reset instead. You can reset your phone under Settings:

 performing a hard reset.&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Go to<strong> Settings </strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />&gt;

            <p>I have the same problem with my&nbsp;Lumia 925&nbsp;since they update the software last year.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I do not think that a hard reset will fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use the new application Office Lens the focus work great.</p>
<p>The original camera application get screw up when they add Office Lens last year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is Microsoft.</p>
<p>They respond like if you are the only one with the problem.</p>

            <p>Just report my Camera Focus problem to Feedback Hub.&nbsp; I do not think that will change something.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Like the "icons position in a folder" that disappear and Microsoft never mention about it.</p>
