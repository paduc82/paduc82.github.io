                    <p><em><strong>Original Title: </strong></em>Game won't close! Need help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got a computer with windows 10. I was playing Sims 2 on it and it was working fine. Then a couple weeks later after it had been running fine for those 2 weeks, it just froze. I tried ending the task and the process tree in the task manager, but it
 keeps saying "Unable to terminate process. The operation could not be completed. Access is denied. So I restarted the computer and it is still running! So then I shut down the computer for an hour. Turned it back on, and the dang thing is still running! I
 tried restarting the program and it said it couldn't because the program is already running. I have no idea what to do or what happened. How can a program still be running after I shut down the computer? I don't have it set up to run at startup. I am so confused.</p>

    <title>Must restart Spooler to print - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ramorius  say:</h3>
<h2>            Must restart Spooler to print</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 10 machine (10.0.14393), upgraded from Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, the Windows Troubleshooter says my default printer (a network printer) is 'turned off'. Clearly it isn't, because I can access the printer configuration via the http port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I restart the spooler, Windows will send whatever documents are in the queue and they'll print, usually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried turning off the firewall - no change in the behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this? It's really a PIA to have to restart the spooler every time I want to print something.<br />

<p>
</p><p>If your printer was installed before your computer was updated to Windows 10, there is a possibility that the drivers might be causing this issue. With that, we suggest that you reinstall your printer. Please follow the steps

            <p>I've reinstalled the printer with new drivers after the upgrade. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why the spooler can't find the network printer, when other services can and why restarting the spooler enables it to find the network printer, if only for a second.</p>

            <p>Have you set the Print Spooler server to <em>Automatic</em>? If you haven't, then let's do it. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp;Open <strong>Services</strong> through the search box.</li><li>Locate <strong>Print Spooler</strong> service and double click it.</li><li>Once the <em>Print Spooler Properties</em> window is open, look for <strong>Startup</strong> type and set is to
<strong>Automatic</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Check also the Service status and make sure that it is set to <strong>Started</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In case there are other printers installed on your PC that you no longer use, we suggest that you uninstall it as it may also cause some issues with Print Spooler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>

<h2>            Cant log in after clean boot</h2>
                    <p>I had a stuck windows update where it kept asking me to restart and update but it would restart without updating so i fallowed instructions through several different methods from thewindowsclub which directed me onto an article about how to do a clean boot
 i first did one where just disabled startup items and disabled everything other than microsoft services in the services tab of msconfig.</p>
<p>this didn't help so I followed the next step and also disabled load system services.</p>
<p>now its asking me to log in via password instead of pin that I normally use and no password is working.</p>
<p>I tried the SHIFT/Restart and got to the advanced options but if I try to use any of them my screen turns off, the pc stays on but nothing other than manually holding the power button to turn it off works.</p>
<p>its a local account and there aren't any other accounts on the pc that I know of.</p>

            Hi, Gabi.Matcz
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode with network function to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

            I've managed to fix it another way. The clean boot and the problems were all on an ssd but I originaly i had windows 10 on a HDD and I'd cloned it onto the ssd for faster boot times . I disconnected the ssd and managed to boot from that older unchanged
 version on the HDD.&nbsp;

<h2>            Sorting Chat List</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Skype online and don't see any way to sort my chat list by most recent.&nbsp; &nbsp;It defaults to sorting it by day.&nbsp; &nbsp;But what I've got now is a list of conversations going back days that have unopened conversations.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't want to scroll back days
 - I want to see new unopened conversations at the top of the list under my favourites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be a way to do this but for the life of my I can't find it on the online version.</p>

<p>Skype for Web is the same as the beta version that does not have the complete features just like on the Skype application. It is best if you will just use the Skype application instead, so the option to sort the contacts is available.</p>

    <title>Installed Windows 10&#47;Can&#39;t find network printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> risii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installed Windows 10&#47;Can&#39;t find network printer</h2>
                    <p>We have four windows 7 computers and a network printer in the office. All were connected to the printer (directly, through the network). Last night, Windows 10 installed inadvertently on one of the computers, and the printer stopped working. I deleted the
 printer and attempted to reinstall, but the computer won't find the printer. that means: 1) I can't find it in the printer install wizard, 2) it wont' find the ip address (when I try to install and ip printer)...and 3) i can't even connect to the printer web
 interface via a browser using the known ip address. I can still do all these things with the windows 7 machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted the printer support team, and we figured out that the Windows 10 computer was acting as if it were on it's own little network slice. We pinged all the computers: all the computer were reporting back except the windows 10 computer (request timed
 out).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Microsoft chat support, and he was useless, insisting I had a printer driver issue. I've already downloaded the updated driver. It doesn't install itself and magically "find" the printer on the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The windows 7 computers in the office are on a "work" network; the windows 10 defaulted to "private". It's listed as discoverable. I've reset the tcpip stack, but not the modem or router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions regarding my issue?</p>

            I see many users including myself can not print emails from Win10 Mail. Printer works just fine from other programs. When clicking the 3-dot icon top right (similar to 3-dot icon in Mail of Win8) and select print, printer selection appears, but the document
 does not. The little spinning dots circle just spins and spins. Print window says "Nothing was sent to print. Open document and print again." &nbsp;This is bug. Similar worked fine in Win8. The document is/was selected.&nbsp;

            A kernel memory dump records only the kernel memory. This speeds up the process of recording information in a log when your computer stops unexpectedly. You must have a pagefile large enough to accommodate your kernel memory. For 32-bit systems, kernel
 memory is usually between150MB and 2GB. Additionally, on Windows 2003 and Windows XP, the page file must be on the boot volume. Otherwise, a memory dump cannot be created.<br />

            Hi Esavvas,<br />
<br />
Which Skype for Business iOS app version are you using? Please provide us with the detailed information about this.<br />
<br />
If other participants can't hear anything from your side, the problem is either with your microphone compatibility or with their playback device (speakers or headphones).<br />
<br />
Moreover, please try to check this issue via using different headphone device to see whether it is specific headphone adapter side issue.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Shyamal

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I use the latest IOS version of Skype for Business (updated), 6.22.3, connected to my corporate account&nbsp;in Microsoft/Azure. The issue was present from previous versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ios version 12.01.1.&nbsp;The issue was present from previous versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Iphone&nbsp;7 with a genuine headphone adapter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Headphones: JBL LIVE 100 IN-EAR HEADPHONES. I have also tested other headphones. Similar results.<br />
</p>
<p>No issue with the microphone of the headphones in any other operation/application as stated in my previous note</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Other participants, during the same call, can hear me when I use the same earphones from my Skype for Business in my PC vs my phone</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Esavvas,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since the issue persists, please check if you mute your microphone in Skype for Business or in your phone when you start a Skype call. Besides, as far as I know, there's a button to switch to mute mode on the left side of iPhone mobile,
 please check if you have switched to mute mode. While if the issue persists, you can try to reinstall Skype for Business app in App Store to check if it helps. As a side note, please try to restart your phone and keep Skype for Business app only in the background
 to test it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, if you don't use earphone to answer the Skype call, will the other participants hear you? Does the issue happen to all Skype calls regardless of the number of participants?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Marvin</span></p>

<p>To answer your question, same call if I dont&nbsp;use the&nbsp;adapter/headphone combo the hear me. For example from my car's Bluetooth&nbsp;connection, etc. It happens regardless the number of participants.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I dont&nbsp;have an issue, if on the same skype call I opt to call in from the skype call rather than use Skye for Business&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So , from my viewpoint, is skype/iphone&nbsp;7 adapter&nbsp;issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp; am a very, very experienced user....&nbsp;I have trouble-shooted&nbsp;extensively on my own. I hope you look into it.</p>

<p><span>Hi Esavvas,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for the detailed clarification. From your test results, it could be the incompatibility between the headphone and adapter when starting a Skype call. As a workaround, you can use the bluetooth or the original iPhone earphone
 to make a Skype call.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>

            <p>Hi Alok, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are unable to install the Windows Update due to error prompt 0x800705b4. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could occur if there is change in Windows update settings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues that prevents Windows from updating. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open <strong>Control Panel </strong>by right click on <strong>
Start</strong> Button.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> In the search box, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Click on the <strong>view all </strong>option on the left panel.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Run the <strong>Windows Update </strong>troubleshooter.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Reset the Windows Update components</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>Reset the BITS (<strong>Background Intelligent Transfer Services) </strong>service, the Windows Update service, and the Cryptographic service which enables the detection, download and installation of the Windows Updates. Follow below steps:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Right click on <strong>Start</strong> button and select <strong>
Command prompt (Admin)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Stop the BITS, the Windows Update service, and the Cryptographic service. To do this, at a command prompt, type the following commands. Make sure that you press Enter after you type each command.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>net stop bits</p>
</strong>
<p><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong><br />
<strong>net stop appidsvc</strong><br />
<strong>net stop cryptsvc</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Rename</strong> the <strong>software distribution folders
</strong>backup copies. To do this, at a command prompt, type the following commands. Make sure that you press Enter after you type each command.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistributionSoftwareDistribution.bak</p>
<p>Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Check to see if the issue is resolved. If not, <strong>restart</strong> the system and try to install the updates.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would request you to temporarily disable the firewall and then check if it helps.
</p>
<p><strong><span>Warning:
</span></strong><span>Firewallsoftware can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases,
 you shouldn't disable your firewall software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your firewall software is disabled, your computer
 is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

<h2>            How do I find out which edition of Windows I had prior to upgrading to Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I could have sworn I had Windows 8.1 Professional edition prior to taking the free upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; Yet I now have the Home edition of Windows 10.&nbsp; Is there an easy way to confirm which edition I had previously in Win 8.1?&nbsp; I have the Dell Windows
 Restore DVD.&nbsp; Are there files on there I can consult?&nbsp; I don't want to outright revert back to Win 8.1.&nbsp; I just want to make sure I didn't get mistreated in the upgrade.</p>
<p>

            I also contacted Dell to see if they could confirm which edition I initially ordered.&nbsp; After waiting a few days, I get an emailed response saying they can't help me because my computer is out of warranty.&nbsp; (So absurd.&nbsp; I've only had my PC for 1.5 years,
 and I'm not asking for tech support; just confirmation about what I ordered.)<br />

            <p>In the end, the only way I was able to find out my previous edition of Windows (prior to updating to Windows 10), was to complain to Dell about their poor customer service.&nbsp; Eventually someone sent me an email claiming that I did indeed order the Home edition.&nbsp;
 I think this is as close to a solution as I will find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On side-note: For years I have avoided purchasing the lesser Home edition, typically preferring Professional so I am a bit stunned and disappointed with myself.&nbsp; But then again, I may have been so concerned with getting both a 64-bit OS and making sure I
 got a DVD restore disk that the edition was simply forgotten.&nbsp; That, or, I may have compared the Home and Professional editions and found the latter to not be worth the extra money.&nbsp; Anyway, looks like this is the bed I shall lie in...unless the Professional
 version of 10 can sell me on the extra $99 to upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you to all who took the time to respond to my inquiry.&nbsp; I guess it was all for naught.&nbsp; ...Then again, you would think there'd be a simple log file stating previous OS versions with the upgrades time stamped.</p>

<h2>            Forza Motorsport 7 Crashes on Window 10</h2>
                    <p>I bought Forza Motorsport 7 and play it on my PC with Window 10. The game looks super fun and amazing, but I can't race for too long because the game crash right in the middle of the race. Is there anyone that having the same issue ? Is it a known bug for
 window 10 and a patch will be out for this soon?<br />
<br />
If you need, here's my PC Spec:<br />
i7-7700k, 32 GB RAM, GTX 1070</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run the game on 1080i in a steady 60 fps. The game works perfect until it crash. Freeze for a second, then the application closes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel really sad to have put a lot of money in this game (I bought the ultimate edition...)</p>

            Well, thats a graphically intense game, so, it would suggest the issue is related to a driver bug.

Press Windows Key + X
Click Even Viewer
Expand Windows Logs

Click System

Look for recent red exclamations, select it and see what it says. 

Copy and paste the error information here. 

In the mean time, you can try updating essential drivers for your video card to see if it helps.

    <title>How do I fix black lines, flickering screen and ghost screen appearing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> woojaelee  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I fix black lines, flickering screen and ghost screen appearing on Microsoft Surface Pro 4&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a used Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (1 year old) from a guy who barely used it due to it not being suitable for his needs. For the first week, it was fine, however, after a day of long use with only chrome tabs open, faint black horizontal lines
 appeared at the top and bottom of the screen. I ignored it, as it did not affecting visibility. But after a few more days of using it with only chrome and word open, as well as a few light games played in between for about 30 minutes altogether, the black
 lines got darker and thicker. So I searched about the issue online and found it was a hardware issue which could be temporarily solved with an external usb fan. But this solution is quite noisy and distracting when trying to study. So I stopped using the fan
 and tried to work again without it. However, now, after 2 hours of playing youtube, or just 5 minutes of light gaming causes the screen to develop thick black lines at the top and bottom, begin flickering heavily, light bleed from all sides, ghost screen and
 overall, making visibility impossible. I found the temperature at the back of the screen to be lukewarm but not super hot so I am not sure what to do. It is past its warranty and I've heard that replacing the screen costs around $800, which I don't have the
 budget for. I have contacted the original seller and he does not want a refund. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My usage is for school work and a bit of light gaming so I do a lot of typing for long periods as well as watching youtube and surfing the web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please tell me how to fix this issue or any advice on what to do.&nbsp;</p>

            Since, this is more of a hardware issue, I would suggest that you should post simultaneously (i.e. cross-post) to HP forum also as this will increase chances of getting the fast answer to this query. So, your question will be on two forums - This and HP. Experts on both forums will assist you giving you wider reach.

<br />
<br />Run all of the Maintenance tasks in the Settings on the Printer's control panel.  This should fix or reveal the problem.  
<br />

<br /><a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/products/printers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/products/printers</a>
<br />Use chat, phone or forums support depending upon your remaining warranty coverage.  It is included for the first year.

            <p>Hello Cappy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We highly regret for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that the Skype experience is a part of the Windows 10 experience. This means the functionality of Skype messaging will work in tandem with Windows 10 functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you choose to use a Local User account in your PC, then the Skype would not function. But, again this means that you&nbsp;wont be able to experience the benefits of using a Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, i<span>f you have any suggestions about Windows 10, I suggest you to post your valuable feedback about Windows 10 in feedback app. So, that it will be helpful for the developers to integrate the changes suggested by you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Open <strong>start menu </strong>, type <strong>Feedback app</strong> in search bar and click on feedback app to open it. Post your suggestions in feedback app.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>============================================<br />
To adjust duration on 'all' clips...it&nbsp;must be set 'before' the photos are <br />
added to the timeline.</p>
<p>Or for individual adjustments...(in timeline view) place your pointer on <br />
the edge of a clip and a&nbsp;double&nbsp;red&nbsp;arrow should appear...drag the double<br />
red arrow to increase/decrease the duration of that clip.</p>
