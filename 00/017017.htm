<h2>            Edit links to speed up calculations</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a worksheet in Excell 2010, which is linked to another workbook (used as database)&nbsp;by vlookup's.</p>
<p>It works fine, but I when I fill a cell in the worksheet, it takes around 20 seconds when the linked cells are calculated.</p>
<p>I found out, that when I go to "Edit links"&nbsp;&gt; "Change source" it calculates in less than a second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The source I select is exactly the same source as my reference table in the vlookup, so the vlookup formula doesn't change.</p>
<p>Excell seems to be working fast now, but when I save the file (with the same, but renewed source) and start the worksheet again, it is very slow again. When I do the same steps as described again. The worksheet is working fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: Why do I have to&nbsp;do this everytime for fast calculations? The reference and&nbsp;formulas&nbsp;are exactly the same, but very slow without doing:
<em>"Edit links &gt; Change source"</em>. Do you have a solution for this problem and have you ever heard this before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help me.</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

<h2>            Pocket Quicken 2.5, WM6, Vista, AT&#38;T Tilt</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greetings. Last week I bought a new phone, the AT&amp;T Tilt with WM6. I installed my copy of Pocket Quicken 2.5 on the new device. However, when I synch, I get the folowing error in the Synch Results: Pocket Quicken 2.5: attention required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's it. Nothing else. No numbers or error codes. I've uninstalled and reinstalled a couple times now (per Landware's "email support" suggestion. Nothing. There's no error on my device that I can find. Same on the laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, with my old phone (Cingular 8125), I would connect the phone, and it would trigger Pocket Quicken Connect to launch. That no longer happens. However, if I do it manually, I can synch without any error message in Pocket Quicken Connect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect the problem is that the Sync Center is trying to launch Pocket Quicken Connect on my desktop but failing. Truthfully, I have no idea. The only thing I know is that Sync Results reports the above error, and that Pocket Quicken Connect
 no longer launches automatically when I connect my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone has any suggestions, I'd be very grateful!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My thanks and regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keith</p>

<p>I'm not sure how to do it on my device. I know how to launch Windows Mobile Device Center and end the partnership, but not how to do it on the device as well. I don't see anything in System or Connections about ending

<p>Will that do anything to my settings or files, or only the relationship between my phone and PC?</p>

<p>I did find a second Pocket Quicket 2.5 in Windows Defender. I deleted it, but it didn't help, and now I don't have even one. Weird.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to say that LandWare is completely and absolutely unresponsive in any way. For customer support, they are a terrible company.</p>

<p>I deleted the partnership on my PC and device, resynched, but no go. I got the same error: Pocket Quicken 2.5: attention required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no error messages on my device that I can find. I'm going to delete Pocket Quicken, delete the partnerships again, resynch, and reinstall to see if that might do anything. So annoying! :-)</p>

<p>Well...drat! That didn't work either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I did notice something odd which may offer further insight: When I reinstalled Pocket Quicken, all my data was still there. Now, it asked me again for my Quicken password, so it didn't save all my information, but it didn't ask me for
 my registration code and all my accounts were present with the correct entries and account totals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dang it! This should be a no brainer! No other application has given me grief like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OH, and I noticed in Windows Mobile Device Center that I can't check Business Contacts. It's not greyed out, but I can't check it. I'm not sure if that provides additional information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate your help and patience!! Thank you!!</p>

<p>My HP iPAQ 4350 just died, I have mega bucks wraped up in software for it. I'm wanting to buy the AT&amp;T Tilt and have no idea if all this software I have will work on the Tilt. I
<em>also</em> have Pocket Quicken 2.2. I sure hope this works on a Tilt? My iPAQ has OS Version: Windows CE 4.20. Sure hope I don't have to re-purchase all this software I have. Does any one know?? If I purchase the Tilt it will be my first Mobile/PDA/Phone
 combination. Otherwise I had my iPAQ which is not a phone and an Apple iPhone; which for what I need is useless.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know I'm not helping you with your Quicken problem but you have a Tilt and would like to know what you think of it and if you know if my software will work from my iPAQ to the Tilt?

            If I didn't want a new iPhone so badly, I'd probably still love my Tilt. It's a quite decent phone, but I am unhappy with how the keyboard slides out with the mere hint of a breeze. Seriously irritating.

                    Hi. I need to create a new picture style in Word 2013 but can't seem to find any way to do this. The style will be simple: I'd like all the pictures in the document to have a black border applied to them. Thanks.<br />

<p>Unfortunately, the Picture Tools don't seem to have any "Set as Default" or "Add to Gallery" provision for picture formatting. Your question intrigued me, as I've just finished working on a document in which I had added a black line around almost all of
 the pictures, and I wondered whether there would have&nbsp;been a quicker way, but apparently there isn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did was add the Picture Border command to the QAT, making it one click to add the default border. Word remembers the color and weight you last selected in a given Word session. Unfortunately, between sessions it resets to the default weight and color.
 If you're happy with a 3/4-point line (I was), then the weight isn't an issue, and the color (which seems to default to Accent 1) can be quickly changed (for the Word session) with one click on the arrow beside the QAT button and another click on the black
 square.</p>

<h2>            Where are my Office 365 icons&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I loaded Office 365 Home Premium on my Windows 7 HP 2.4 Gh&nbsp;laptop a few days ago.&nbsp; It works fine, except that, a day or so ago the Office&nbsp;365 (2013)&nbsp;icons reverted to Office 2010 on my saved files (I have several on my desktop)?&nbsp; The 365 icons are still
 on the exe&nbsp;quick-launch&nbsp;files on my taskbar.&nbsp; When I open Excel 365, create a new worksheet and save it the icon appears as 2010?&nbsp; I assume something happened to my system files.&nbsp; I&nbsp;did a&nbsp;"sfc /scannow" and&nbsp;a "chkdsk /f". Nothing out of the normal?&nbsp; What do
 I do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update: Fixed my own problem!&nbsp; Somehow Office 2010 got installed after Office 365.&nbsp; Don't know why?&nbsp; When I uninstalled 2010 the problem got fixed!&nbsp; Funny, files used 2010 icons even though I created them with 365 (2013)?</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings. As you can see in this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://products.office.com/en-sg/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?tab=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://products.office.com/en-sg/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?tab=1</a>, an Office
 365 for home plan doesn't include the sharepoint service. If you perfer to use SharePoint service, as&nbsp;Palcouk mentioned above, you can switch from an Office 365 for home to a business subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as I understand from your description, you want to use the sharepoint because you want to share files with other users. Since an Office 365 for Home plan includes OneDrive service, you can simply<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/upload-photos-and-files-to-onedrive-b00ad3fe-6643-4b16-9212-de00ef02b586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">upload
 files to OneDrive&nbsp;</a></span>and share files with other user. See:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-and-collaborate-with-onedrive-51e669f6-4602-4492-8648-13ffa09ff24f?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Share and
 collaborate with OneDrive</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, about the question "<span>keep this email address for my business",&nbsp;</span>you can sign in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.office.com/</a>&nbsp;to download Office apps
 and configure your&nbsp;<span>hotmail.com account into Outlook client so that you can send and receive emails with this account. But j</span>ust a kindly reminder, you can only use your Office 365 account to upload and share files
 through OneDrive<span>. For your reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-an-email-account-to-outlook-6e27792a-9267-4aa4-8bb6-c84ef146101b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add an email account to Outlook</a>.</span></p>
<p>Note: to sync the emails of your gmail account, you should configure your gmail account as an IMAP account rather than POP.</p>

<p>Hi John,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to access all the information from the hotmail account and continue to use this account, as I mentioned above, you can<span>&nbsp;sign in&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.office.com/</a><span>&nbsp;to
 download Office apps and configure your&nbsp;</span><span>hotmail.com account into Outlook client so that you can send and receive emails with this account. And to sync your old emails of the hotmail account, you need to use IMAP to add your hotmail account
 to Outlook.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>About how to import email into Office 365, here are some videoes for your reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/video-import-email-into-office-365-d0cf6608-4862-4a7b-82fc-f5fef235c966#_migrate_email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Video:

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Different subject but just thought i would ask.</p>
<p>If I have Office 365 business (with Sharepoint) and have customers (x3) at the moment the is it easier to share with them as guest in</p>
<p>-Teams</p>
<p>-Sharepoint or</p>
<p>-Onedrive</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also want (whereever their info is kept) to add logos and a mini portal that they can access.</p>
<p>I am a sole trader (consultant) and they are not part of my YHSA Ltd organsation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your fedback would be appreciated. So far what you have replied with is excellent.</p>

<p><span>Hi John,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Greetings and sorry for delay my reply since I was OOF.&nbsp;</span><span>About your first question:
<em>"</em></span><em><span>If I have Office 365 business (with Sharepoint) and have customers (x3) at the moment the is it easier to share with them as guest in&nbsp;</span><span>Teams,&nbsp;</span><span>Sharepoint
 or&nbsp;</span></em><span><em>Onedrive</em>". T</span><span>he answer is yes, in Microsoft Teams, you can add your customers (as they are not internal user in your organization) as a guest in Teams
 and share files with them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Moreover, by design, there are limitations for Guest experience, here's a list of some of the functionality that isn't available to a guest in Microsoft Teams:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dacbb6a2-99b4-4527-a38b-103322b7db0c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dacbb6a2-99b4-4527-a38b-103322b7db0c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>For details, please see:&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/guest-experience" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What the guest experience is like</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your second question: "<span>How do I share a sharepoint group, site or library with an external user (customer) so they can view and download / use files in the specific folder/page on sharepoint?", here is an article
 for your reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/external-sharing-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">External sharing overview</a>.</span></p>
<p>Hope above information helps. If you still have any further questions about Microsoft Teams or Sharepoint, since a thread usually focus on one question, for better help, we recommend you to post a new thread
 in our forum and we will continue to help you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your understanding and cooperation will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>

    <title>how to reset followed hyperlink back to default color&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> viola77cells  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to reset followed hyperlink back to default color&#63;</h2>
                    The style Word applies to a hyperlink is the Hyperlink character style, which by default is underlined blue and turns purple for followed links. I want to create a PDF from my Word document with all hyperlinks showing as the default font color. I do not
 want to redefine the color of a followed hyperlink to that of the default un-followed link. I want to retain the ability to see a followed hyperlink as purple within the Word document. Thus I'd like to know how to reset a&nbsp;followed hyperlink back to the default
 underlined blue color.

            Followed hyperlinks change from the <i>Hyperlink</i>&nbsp;character style to <i>FollowedHyperlink</i>&nbsp;only while the document is open, and saving a document with followed hyperlinks does not save their followed status. Thus, easiest thing is to close the document
 and reopen it.

            <p>I got a new Nokia 950 and the email account would not sync and I began deleting accounts and resetting them to see if there was a conflict with my outlook account, with no luck and wound up doing a hard reset that is very easy. After doing this everything
 worked fine. I thought it would be a difficult and it was very easy. took about 20 minutes total. clicked on the Outlook App pressed sync button at he bottom of the screen and bingo all the emails came in.</p>
<p>After doing the process below EVERYTHING worked better on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To ensure a smooth transition you need to be able to connect to your Microsoft account to ensure all your contacts, pictures that are on your phone are are on the cloud. If you can see all your contacts and pictures and whatever else saved is in the cloud,
 your good to go.</p>
<p>Make sure you have a full charge on your battery.</p>
<p>Go to settings</p>
<p>Go to ABOUT and choose reset phone.</p>
<p>Press the restart button and it will ask you a few times if you are sure.</p>
<p>The phone will restart a few times and progress and ask for you to log onto Microsoft account where all your data will be &nbsp;reinstalled on your phone. The other question asked during Set up are simple.</p>
<p>Write down your Password off your modem for WiFi in your house if it applies because it will ask this during set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before doing any of the above I removed my battery and tried to soft rest my phone to see if this would resolve the problem with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one drive site below is where you see all your data on Microsoft cloud. </p>
<p>If your pictures and contacts are NOT there, you saved nothing and you will lose all the info on your phone if you continue the hard reset. &nbsp;Top left hand corner of of the one drive screen click in the square with the little 9 boxes. click on people to see
 if your contacts are.</p>

    <title>Using Bing to Search Locations in Outlook.com calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shay1976  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Bing to Search Locations in Outlook.com calendar</h2>
                    <p>Using My Default Calendar in Outlook.com I used to be able to "Search Bing" when looking for a location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After starting to Type in the Location Box I would typically get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Five "Top Results"</li><li>Option to "Search Bing"</li><li>Option to "Add Room"</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba92c7a3-35b0-42e6-94d9-f3acb8eb7493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba92c7a3-35b0-42e6-94d9-f3acb8eb7493" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the option to "Search Bing" has disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the feature still exists as I have a second Outlook account and I can still see "Search Bing" in that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Hi Nathaniel</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. My response is in-line below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.When did the issue start?</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>• Not sure of the exact date but I first noticed it at the start of December. Thought it might be one of those things that would "fix itself" in time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.What are the troubleshooting steps you have done on your end?</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>• Tried stopping and re-starting the Bing Maps Add in on the "Manage Add-ins" options page</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>• Ensured that I've granted location access to the browser for that page. (Revoked and re-granted it)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>• Ensured that my location settings in Bing Maps settings are correct.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.Have you tried using a different web browser and check if the issue persists?</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>• Yes I've tried in IE11, Edge, Chrome and Firefox</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

                    I have never had a problem with spellcheck or grammar check. I've been editing this same document for the last two years and never received the error message above until yesterday. I receive it in the same place about 1/4 of the way through the document.
 I'm using Word for PC 16.0.7329.1023 through the subscription service. I've tried exiting the document, and turning the PC off. Not sure what else to do.

<h2>            Annotated Template&#63; &#40;aka Template with Guidelines&#41;</h2>
                    Is there a way to include annotations/guidelines in MS Word templates to provide instructions to users who are writing the documents?<br />
<br />
I have done this using simple text in brackets, but it's amazing how often people DON'T delete out the "sample" text. I have also contemplated using track changes balloons, but I know some people will be confused and/or won't know how to remove them.
<br />
<br />
It seems like there should be a way to provide some helpful hints/tips to users who are using the templates, but I haven't been able to figure out a way!<br />

            <p>Task B has two parts, so make it two tasks, B1 and B2. If there is no "data", then estimate start date and duration of each part. In task information, check the rollup box.</p>
<p>You can't make A look the same in both situations because in 1 A is a task while in 2 A is a summary, not a task.</p>
