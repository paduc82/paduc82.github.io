<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error code&#58; 0xc0000098</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to upgrade to Windows Ten from Windows 7, which was an upgrade from Windows Vista when I bought the computer. I after starting the upgrade process, I get a "no bootable device--insert boot disk and puts any key" message. I then used the upgrade
 media tool on another computer to try to boot from a UDB device which allowed me to arrive at the Windows Ten install setup page. After being instructed to remove the media for the install to continue, I encountered the same problem again but used the trouble
 shooting tool to try to fix the problem. This finally gave me the report of the error code: 0xc0000098.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also not sure how to get to the command prompt from the startup menu if I need it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

Hi, I have a HP Pavilion entertainment PC DV4.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The issue that i am haveing is the cooling fan is always on. which uses up pressious battery life.</div>
<div>I did everything such as update bios, clean fan and vents. but it still is always on from ever since i bought the laptop its been like this. its not that its loud or overheating, i just with it would only turn on when needed. I went into the BIOS and saw
 a way to solve it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The opption is [ Fan always ON, OFF ] it is currently set to on and wanted to know if i set it to off would it turn on when needed? like a automatic setting&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks&nbsp;</div>

<p><span>The best way to see if you can run without a fan (momentarily) is to run a test. Download and install one of many
 CPU fan temperature gauging software. This type of software will usually give you all sorts of helpful info about your system hardware. Once installed, you can then turn the setting off, but be ready to change it back if the temp rises above 67c or so. Your
 bios should have a setting which allows you to set what temp to have the fan kick back on. Make that temp 65c. Above all, proceed at your own risk. This is definitely dangerous for your CPU life, so be careful.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 USB Installation Boot Black Screen</h2>
                    I was installing Windows on a friends pc because he had too many viruses on it, after seeing that he had 6 partitions I combined and formatted them into one. After this I began installing it via a usb that I booted off of, after rebooting it was a black
 screen. We made sure the installation was up to date and I have looked at similar questions to this one with no luck. Thanks in advance.

            Hi Fade.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you all possible steps to troubleshoot installation failure which work in about 90% of cases.  If not we'll go from there:
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI, UEFI is enabled, CSM disabled, Windows Boot Manager set first to boot, if necessary disable Secure and Fast Boot until after install:   <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />Create the latest new Windows 10 Installation Media by installing Media Creation Tool and following the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands,  each followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />Make sure to follow the setup steps in the first link tutorial to complete your install.  Drivers are important enough that those steps are printed in red.  
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the first linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

<h2>            Xbox one trade in for Xbox one S</h2>
                    
<p>Recently, &nbsp;as in about 10 days ago, i shipped my xbox one 500 gb console out for service, as it was the last day of warranty coverage for that i could get out of it. It hasnt come back yet. &nbsp;I was wondering if there was maybe a chance of me being able to
 trade that xbox one console in for the new xbox one s console with no additional charge. If the console i would get back would be almost new or a brand new one (depending on if they could fix it or not), would I be able to trade it in for the s version? Thanks
 so much to anyone who is able to help me with this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm going to guess that this won't be possible as even if your system is unfixable they just send you a refurbished system anyway never a brand new one. Also, there is no 2tb original Xbox One and the 2tb Slim is the only one officially out so there's technically
 no 500gb or 1tb slim system they could replace it with.</p>

<p>Some stores such as Game are offering trade ins, the one where i live offer trading your Xbox One in for the Xbox One S at £200 but i'm not aware of Microsoft doing a deal like this themselves. I can absolutely confirm that you would not be able to trade
 the Xbox One for an S version without paying any extra since the Xbox One S is worth more in value</p>
<p>Hope this helps! :) &nbsp;</p>

<p>i have the same problem. using 2 wired controllers they both connect as player 1. if is use only 1 controller everything is fine. they are working without any problems. it doesn't matter which port i use. its everytime player 1 for both. i don't think the
 controllers are damaged as they are working when i put on only one of them. bought them yesterday.</p>

<p>unfortunately i do not have another console. but i have connected them to my pc. there the controllers worked properly. the first as player1...the second as player2. after that connected to my box again...both as player1. it is really strange. i think the
 problem is the xbox...or something connected to it but i do not know WHAT it is... :-(</p>

<p>If they have had access to your PC they may installed any number of malware programs. My recommendation is to do a clean reinstall of Windows - its the only way to be sure your system is clean.</p>
<p>If you paid them by credit card, tell your card provider what has happenend immediately.
</p>
<p>Any data on your PC (passwords, credit card nos, account nos. documents, etc) may have been compromised (they may now know it). Tell any relevant companies (e.g. your bank) what has happened.</p>
<p>Use <u>another</u> PC to change any passwords.</p>
<p>Consider telling your local police.</p>

<h2>            &#40;Win8&#41;The &#39;pin&#39; option dissapeared from login and now I can&#39;t login&#33;</h2>
                    I created two options to login at the start screen, password and pin. I used the pin password so much that I forgot the normal password.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Yesterday, my brother got on my computer and started trying to spam passwords to login, and<b> now the option is gone</b> to choose between the 'pin' password and a the 'normal alphabetic' password. I can't login and I've tried to reset it but am having
 touble.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know how to switch to the pin mode password on the lockscreen with a shortcut or something? (Like pressing f2)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>btw, if I don't get the correct password the first time, it normally brought up two options (two squares with pin option or normal password) and the password hint. The password hint is still there but the options to change between the two password types
 is gone.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note: I did not reset my pin or change any of the settings that could possible remove the pin.</div>

            <blockquote>I created two options to login at the start screen, password and pin. I used the pin password so much that I forgot the normal password.
<div><br />
<div>Yesterday, my brother got on my computer and started trying to spam passwords to login, and<strong> now the option is gone</strong> to choose between the 'pin' password and a the 'normal alphabetic' password. I can't login and I've tried to reset it but
 am having touble.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Does anyone know how to switch to the pin mode password on the lockscreen with a shortcut or something? (Like pressing f2)&nbsp;</div>

<div>btw, if I don't get the correct password the first time, it normally brought up two options (two squares with pin option or normal password) and the password hint. The password hint is still there but the options to change between the two password types
 is gone.</div>

            This happened to both my desktop and laptop after I changed the PIN. created a bootable. usb with windows 8 installed. This gave me the command prompt, allowing me to use the cmd line net user commands. Activated the Aministrator user. So I see the Administrator
 logon picture but when i click on it it says I must use a smart card. this is susposed to be fixable by going into the registry which i am able to do and modify the SCForceOption setting from 11 to 10but that had no effect. I also saw that virtualy all the
 hex values for the administrator account were all zeros. When I type net users I only get 2 accounts, administrator and Guest, both which have full admin privilidges. I also used the net user cmds to create more accounts but they are not there after I create
 them. Follow an online screenshot of the admin account hex values for enabling the admin account, I modified the hex valuesfor the F value. that also did nothing. If I had also had the microsoft account password, i could have just

<h2>            WINDOWS STOP CODE ERROR&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Okay so let me make it clear.</p>
<p>I had a Windows 10 installed in my PC from like an year or so. Then outta nowhere my cousin screwed it up. As i had a Win 8, i installed it. It was working fine but i still had those errors like in WIN 10. So i didn't know what to do. I replaced my Hard
 Drive and i installed Windows 8 in it.</p>
<p>And here is this error outta nowhere. It says WINDOWS STOP CODE...etc.</p>
<p>It first occured when some updates didn't install. So after lots of searching i got to know its the updates and tried to fix it. But the update wasn't installing. So i downloaded Windows 10 from Microsoft.com and burned it into a USB. And installed the Windows
 10.</p>
<p>But still i was getting this STOP CODE Error. Then i replaced my my Hard Drive with the old one and installed Windows 10 in it. Still the STOP CODE repeats.</p>
<p>And now i dont know how to fix my PC. Cause i have installed Windows 10 more than 10 times and i still get this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Help Me.</p>

<h3> seldomseen_cd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to print in windows 10 causes program to lockup, nothing is able to print.</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop running windows 10 in my office. &nbsp;When you try to print from any program the program freezes and the print dialog never appears. &nbsp;The only thing that can be done is to kill the program. &nbsp;I've tried removing and reinstalling the printer. &nbsp;I've
 tried printing with no printers installed but the print to pdf, and get the same results. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried turning off spooling and printing directly to the printer and the same thing still happens. &nbsp;I have also tried both making the printer default, and making it not the default. There is only one physical printer installed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing to note is that doing a test print works perfectly, but printing from anything else, the programs locks up, print dialogue never appears, and program must be killed before you can continue. &nbsp;Does anyone have any suggestions for this issue?
 &nbsp;Other computers running windows 10, windows 7, and linux can all print to the printer just fine. &nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Windows 10 on my PC for a few months (as an Administrator). And now I've suddenly lost the admin rights on the user account (I only have 1 user account).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So. I've been trying to enter Safe Mode, as many guides tell me to. But when I try to log in to an account in Safe Mode I cannot use my keyboard nor my mouse to do anything. The screen isn't frozen. The only thing I can do is to shut down the computer from
 the power button. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm not planning on doing anything myself as I don't quite know what to do... Or maybe I'll just ask my dad. :P Help is still much appreciated</span></p>

<h2>            REMOTE DESKTOP&#58; &#34;The Remote Computer Cannot Be Authenticated Due to Problems WIth Its Security Certificate&#34;</h2>
                    Interesting you guys have chosen TeamViewer so clearly,....I've just tried it, and it will make due for now, but I need to copy and paste text from pdfs constantly and I noticed it to be extremely laggy by comparison (to RD). I'm guessing it's because
 it needs to download more data than the native client, but if there are any suggestions on speeding it up please post.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Remote Desktop/RemoteApp Problems</b><br />
<br />
I have not been able to connect while out-of-network.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've waisted several days of productivity trying to resolve this by myself, then on the phone with Microsoft, and some of them aren't even familiar with Surface RT. So with connecting to RD in-network is pretty easy and effective, hopefully some here can confirm
 that they have the same problems and/or offer possible solutions.<br />
<br />
As I see it, there are 3 interfaces where we can connect to RD on the Surface RT: The the
<b>pre-installed desktop Remote Desktop </b>found via swipe and search, the<b> metro
</b>downloadable Remote Desktop, and<b> RemoteApp </b>via control panel). <br />
<br />
I see where the computer is pinged and port 3389 is open, so I will state the problems I see with each when I try log into a Windows 8 Host computer:<br />
<br />
<b>1) pre-installed RD: </b><br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi48.tinypic.com%2f1zlgmcy.jpg" /><br />
<br />
It's great and your computer name is there for you and ready while logged into your account and in-network. You have options like "Connect and don't warn me If server authentication fails" that I see helped out a lot of people on Windows Server with certificate
 issues. <br />
<br />
Once out of network on Surface RT, however, you get "Remote Desktop can't find the computer ______. This might mean that "_____" does not belong to the specified network. Verify the computer name and domain that you are trying to connect to."
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>2) Metro UI: </b><br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi50.tinypic.com%2f346w4mq.jpg" /><br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi47.tinypic.com%2ft5si80.jpg" /><br />
<br />
It seems to ping the computer faster when you put :3389 at the end of your IP. However, no success after trying with and without the port ending. The messages I get are....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>3)RemoteApp: </b><br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi45.tinypic.com%2f3785.jpg" /><br />
<br />
<br />
this is the solution I've seen in most tutorials,...but the reason given for not connecting is "The remote computer cannot be authenticated due to problems with its security certificate."<br />
<br />
Instead of the option to bypass it (which option 1 gives you), there is no other option and it says "Windows cannot continue setting up this connection. Contact your workplace administrator for assistance."<br />
<br />
This message caused me to learn more about certificates than I ever wanted to know. I've tried starting up MMC and making sure the cert listed in Remote Desktop was copied to the Trusted Root Certificate Authorites folders (both sides as local computer certificates).
 I've tried different combinations and haven't really gotten anywhere.<br />
<br />
If anyone connects via #3, please post specs on your certificate if you can find it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help on getting any of these methods to work is appreciated. It bares repeating that port 3389 is listed as open on my home network, traffic is forwarded to the correct PC, and all firewalls are disabled until I can resolve this.

<h2>            Windows 10 v key seems unresponsive, but it&#39;s only a long delay</h2>
                    This has happened in the past, but it stopped. &nbsp;The v key seems unresponsive, but I can still use it with the on-screen keyboard. &nbsp;But every time I push the v key it seems to still save every time I push the button, but it doesn't type it right away for
 some reason. &nbsp;It could be the keyboard, but I haven't tested with another keyboard.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>1. What do you mean, when you say "not able to run some apps"?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Do you have issues installing the apps from the Windows store or do you have issues accessing the Apps?
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can understand the frustration when things don't work as expected. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have issues accessing the Apps, I suggest you refer to the following article and follow the suggestions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem for you. If the Store doesn’t notify you of a problem, or if you continue experiencing problems with
 an app, here are some solutions you can try to fix the app yourself.</span></p>

<h2>            How can I open .dll files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am trying to open a .dll file because I have just downloaded drivers for a digital camera and this is part of the process.&nbsp; The instructions tell me to click on this file to set it up installation.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have had to open .dll files before, and I was able
 to find&nbsp;a free, quick and easy file opener for them online.&nbsp; This one is giving me trouble, however, and I cannot find another "free, quick and easy" fix again.&nbsp; Can anyone refer me to such? I would so greatly appreciate it!&nbsp; I am trying to install the download
 and the first step is to open this file: SETUP.DLL . I have&nbsp;Windows XP Professional with SP3. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks so much!&nbsp;</p>

            You don't open DLL files.<br />
<br />
Please copy/paste the instructions you are following or provide a link.&nbsp; It's always possible that the instructions have an error and you should be double-clicking SETUP.EXE.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
What's the make and model of the camera?<br />
<br />
Note that instead of connecting your camera directly to your computer, you might prefer to buy a card reader (if your computer or printer doesn't already have one) and just take the card out of the camera and read it directly.<br />

            Hi Mary,<br />
<br />
To troubleshoot the issue, I’d like to suggest you try the followings:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Change your iPhone 6’s network via 3G/4G or Wi-Fi.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Re-start your iPhone 6.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Un-install the Skype for Business app and re-install it in the App store.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, we may consider whether the issue is related to the specific app client/mobile. To identify it, we suggest you confirm the following points:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Try to find another Skype for Business app in mobile and sign into it with your account.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Check whether your Skype for Business desktop client works well if you have one.
<br />
<br />
In addition, I have sent you a private message to collect the Office 365 account which you are using to sign into the Skype for Business app in the private message (PM) for checking. You can click the following link to access the PM.<br />

 with our live chat support which will have the proper tools to verify and find the correct account which the charge is connected to and cancel them right away.

<h2>            Programs work together on one Win10 computer and not the other computer  &#40;Palm Desktop with Macro Express&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've run the Palm Desktop program for&nbsp;many&nbsp;years, first on Windows XP Pro, then Windows 7 Pro 64,&nbsp; I've also run a macro program called Macro Express in all of those years.&nbsp; And Macro Express would "type" in phrases like my address or phone number into the
 Palm Desktop fields without problems.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran this way on two computers,&nbsp;a Dell D610 laptop, and an HP Z230 Desktop.&nbsp; While still on Windows 7 Pro 64,
<strong>both</strong> the Palm Desktop and Macro Express worked together well on both of these computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just&nbsp;upgraded to Windows 10 Pro 64.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Immediately after I updated both computers to Windows 10 Pro 64, the Macro Express
<strong>would still write text</strong> into Palm Desktop on the Dell Laptop, but
<strong>not</strong> on the HP Desktop.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though nothing was changed on either software&nbsp;just before or after the upgrade, I've since tried to compare security and compatibility settings by looking at the "Properties" of the respective Palm programs on the two computers, and they are the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly
 I've tried to look for differences on the Macro Express on both computers looking at the Properties page, and there is no difference there.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I don't understand how<strong> both </strong>computers' software programs&nbsp;<strong>worked together well before</strong> I did the upgrade to Windows 10, but&nbsp;now &nbsp;<strong>on o</strong><strong>nly one</strong> computer do the two software packs
<strong>work together okay.</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas to explain this?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me where else I should look between the two computers to restore what I'm looking for on the one that is acting up?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's bad enough when you have software that ran fine on Win7 but doesn't on Win10 at all.&nbsp; But it is just as much or more frustrating that the
<strong>two software packs work together well on both </strong>computers before the upgrade, but after the upgrade, the two software programs
<strong>work well on only one </strong>of the upgraded computers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help and ideas you can provide. </p>

</p><p>A key point is that the same two packs of software, running from the same operating system before and after the upgrade from Win7 to Win10,&nbsp;and they
<strong>work together on the Dell </strong><strong>laptop</strong>, but <strong>not the HP desktop.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As noted in my original post, since the problem started, <strong>I've tried </strong>
a variety of compatibility options by making the changes in the Properties page.&nbsp; They have not fixed the problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have not tried </strong>to install the Palm or Macro Express software in a compatibility mode.&nbsp; I can uninstall the software and do that,&nbsp;but I need further clarification.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the Macro Express program, it does have an installation file called macex3.exe used for installation.&nbsp; Is that what you would put in compatibility mode for the installation<strong>?</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the Palm software, that is installed with a program called <strong>autorun.exe.&nbsp;</strong> Is that the program I should install using a compatibility mode<strong>?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, the Palm program uses a driver for the USB connection, but that is loaded separately by having Windows look for it.&nbsp; The&nbsp;files used in that driver installation end in .cat, .inf, .sys, and .dll.&nbsp;&nbsp; None of those four files have a compatibility
 tab on their "Properties."&nbsp; Is it possible to install that in a compatibility more, or not<strong>?</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Streaming Video Crash&#58; Xbox One Shuts down during - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Streaming Video Crash&#58; Xbox One Shuts down during Netflix&#47;YouTube</h2>
                    Just bought a brand new XB1 about a week ago and everything was working fine up until two days ago when I tried streaming a video on Netflix and this caused a crash where the video freezes for a few seconds while the audio continues and then the audio
 gets distorted and the whole console shuts down. I have tried power cycling, uninstalling and reinstalling the apps, updated the console, switched to power-saving mode, and plugged it straight into the wall rather than a surge protector. None of these steps
 seemed to help. Although, weirdly I tried watching a short youtube video this morning and it did not crash whereas normally it only takes about a minute or so to crash. I don't know if this is because I left the XB1 unplugged all night and have not extensively
 tested it yet but will do so later tonight and see if the crash happens again. Has anyone else had this issue, and if so, what fixed it?

<p>the issue never came back for me. what appeared to have fixed it was keeping it unplugged overnight. not sure if that was an actual fix or not. but so far, it never came back.
