    <title>Word App Unable to Open &#40;Office Open XML Document .docx&#41; Files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word App Unable to Open &#40;Office Open XML Document .docx&#41; Files Stored in Google Drive &#40;Android Oreo&#41;</h2>
                    <p><span>I am unable to open .docx documents through the Word app. I need to open some .docx files on Google Drive and when I try to do so, at first a message would pop up saying
<strong>"Word found unreadable content in "xxx.docx". Do you want to recover the contents of this document? If you trust the source of this document, click Yes."</strong>. No matter whether I click Yes or No, it would still fail to open the document and say
<strong>"Can't open file - Sorry, something went wrong and "xxx.docx"</strong> can't open.". However, I am able to open .rtf format document files quite well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I don't see any option to open the file using any app other than Word app so it is impossible for me to open .docx files on my smartphone.
<strong>Is this a bug or sonething wrong with my device? Or perhaps is it an issue with my files?</strong><strong> Does anyone know how to solve this issue?</strong> I really hope this can be fixed because it would be convenient for me to open those files using
 my smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>I think this could be because the file type is&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"Office Open XML Document (.docx)"</span>? Does anyone agree?</strong><span>&nbsp;This
 was because on my old computer I messed up and broken my Microsoft Office software,
<em>so I installed and used another office suite called Apache OpenOffice</em> so my word document files were saved in that format/type.
<strong>If so, what could be the solution? Should I find ways to change the word document files to
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"Microsoft Word Document (.docx)"</span> format?
</strong><em>I worry this will risk corrupting data/contents of the word document.</em> Maybe it's my fault for messing up with the MS Office software years ago.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Is the MS Word app/software/program designed to be unable to open Office Open XML Document (.docx) format files?</em> If so, I hope Microsoft take aware of this issue and take action to solve this issue so that MS Word app is compatible to open word
 document files of this format/type.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm aware that this question has been previously posted before, but it didn't receive any replies/answers and got locked, that's why I'm asking it again. Hopefully I do not get mistakenly suspended for duplicate post
 and people pay attention to the issue that I'm having here.</span></p>

<p>It is a fact that some of the so-called "equivalents" to Microsoft Word produce documents that are not compatible with Word, even though they purport to use the same Open XML Document format.</p>

<p>How do I send the copy of the problem files? You mean by putting Google Drive sharing link here? I afraid such files are personal and private. Perhaps I can erase the contents of the word document using Wordpad then make a copy of the file then upload it
 to Google Drive. Right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wordpad can open them but not MS Word, and on my smartphone, those files are stored on Google Drive and Drive automatically opens them through the Word App and the fact that I can't open them on my smartphone is so inconvenient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I agree that the factor leading to MS Word unable to open the files is that the format is Office Open XML Document (.docx), which is not compatible with MS Word.</p>

            I'm here to inform you that I have just sent you an e-mail. Take a look at it, diagnose the issue as I provided the copy of the file attachment, and tell me the solutions/steps necessary to solve this issue so that the file can be opened using MS Word
 as I want to be able to open such files on my smartphone which are stored on Google Drive. Google Drive would open the file automatically using the Word app and I don't see any option to use alternative apps to open them.

<p>I did some experimenting and I think I found out the solution. The first solution partially solves the issue unfairly while the second solution seems to have solve the issue.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The first solution is, at first, I changed the file format from Office Open XML Document (.docx) to&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>(Microsoft Word 97-2003 Document (*.doc))</strong></span>&nbsp;by "Save as" the
 file using WPS Writer. By doing so, Wordpad fails to open the word document properly and shows the content as some weird charts such as "√ê√è √†¬°¬± √°". Meanwhile, MS Word app is now able to open the word document file. The issue have been solved partially and
 unfairly. Why is it so?&nbsp;<strong>Is Wordpad incompatible with the .doc file format?</strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>The second solution is, later, I changed the file format to&nbsp;<span><strong>Microsoft Word Document (.docx)</strong></span>. Now, both Wordpad and MS Word are able to open the file. However, for&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Wordpad</span>,
 an annoying yellow message would appear on the top saying,&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"WordPad does not support all of the features of this document's format&nbsp; Some content might be missing or displayed improperly"</span>. Why? How to get rid of
 it? Or is it meant to be like that? Means Wordpad is not fully compatible with .docx files?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<span>Looks like I have found the solution. Which solution do you recommend, the 1st or 2nd? I hope my questions and concerns will be also answered, especially those in the 1st paragraph.</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>For the benefit of anyone else following this thread, the document that you sent to me was apparently a Rich Text Format (.rtf) document and after changing the file extension to .rtf, which results in Word then using the appropriate converter to open the
 file, it could be opened in Word.</p>

<p>Oh I see. <strong>The file document was actually a Rich Text Format (.rtf)? If so, why does it show it's a .docx file in File Explorer?</strong> Do you have any idea about this? What could be the reasons? Does it mean the file is kinda screwed up or corrupted
 due to maybe the way I saved it using various office suites like Apache OpenOffice, then Wordpad, etc.?
<strong>I think this the more likely factor as I did some testing.</strong> I went to Folder Options and turned off "Hide extensions for known file types", then renamed the file from
 extension/type/format and file naming. <em>A .rtf file wrongly named as .docx caused Word unable to open it.</em></p>

<p>I have the choice to change the file format/type to .doc and .docx. Which should I change to, .doc or .docx? Which one is better/recommended?

<p>
</p><p>Now, Microsoft offers for free only Office 365 A1 and Windows 10 Education. Since the company do not own any mass hardware production (not counting Surface family then) it does not offer free devices for students. But as a student you can apply a discount

Why was Media Center removed/missing from Windows 10? Does Windows 10 have other applications that have the features of Media Center? (movies, TV, and DVD)

<p>A reset wipes the entire device and sets it back up as a NEW device from the store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you set it up and if you use the SAME Live ID, ALL your Contacts and Calendar information will return.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure your Pictures have been saved to OneDrive (Do you have auto upload to OneDrive enabled?) and then you will have access to all of them to either view or download to your device if you want particular ones saved on your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will be given an option to restore from a backup when you reset the device. I generally do NOT do that. I find it better to start fresh (personal opinion).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure any important documents are saved to OneDrive for access if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>Further more whether the link between the phone and the contacts (where the No. is registered ) will have any impact or not.

<p>&nbsp;I believe that is answered above.</p>

            <p>Method 1 did not find any errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried Method 2.&nbsp; I followed the link and ran the Automatic reset Windows Update tool for Windows 8.1 (even though I am running windows 10)</p>
<p>The link downloaded the troubleshooting tool which i then ran.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Update troubleshooting completed and found 1 problem which was not fixed:</p>
<p>Service Registration is missing or corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else should I try?</p>

            <p>Hello Boris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>perform clean boot and then try to install the updates.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />

(Also holds good for Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section ‚ÄúHow to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting‚Äù to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>

                    <p>I have to use custom paper in order to print out labels.</p>
<p>MS Word always defaults to sizes that are unusable and what is more disturbing these sizes actually control the printer.</p>
<p>I want to know how I can create custom paper size that I can use?</p>
<p>No the custom paper option doe not work in Word 2013 anymore - not sure why!</p>

            <p>The range of paper sizes that can be printed is determined by the printer driver. Most are useless with custom paper sizes and Word, which uses the printer driver information to format the document, adopts a standard size which may or may not be close to
 the required size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two potential solutions. The first is to use a standard paper size larger than that required and make up the difference with margins so that the document prints only on the available area.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other is to configure a new form for the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run Windows Control Panel &gt; View Devices and Printers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the printer. From the menu bar select Print Server Properties and create a new form. That form will then appear as an available paper size in Word.</p>

<h2>            Disable-DistributionGroup does not fully work when disabling a mail-enabled security group in a DirSync&#39;ed environment</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to figure out why I am unable to fully disable a mail-enabled security group.</p>
<p>After running Disable-DistributionGroup on a mail-enabled security, this will remove all Exchange attributes On-Premise.&nbsp; However, after sync, the mail-enabled security group in Office 365 will not fully be removed.&nbsp; It will retain my tenant email address,
 and can still be seen via GAL, and can still be emailed.</p>
<p>I understand that I can run Remove-MsolGroup to fully remove the group, however, I don't understand why it was designed like this.&nbsp; When I run Disable-RemoteMailbox, it effectively removes the mailbox, however there is a different behavior when running Disable-DistributionGroup.</p>
<p>Is this really the expected behavior?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>To better understand your situation, I‚Äôd like to confirm some information:</p>

            Hello. There is limited language support if you go to Start&gt;settings&gt;system&gt;regional settings. There does seem to be a language pack for Samsung devices. You would have to contact Samsung by email, Facebook, or Twitter to get it. Another solution is to
 use <a href="http://spb.com/pocketpc-software/shell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SPB Mobile Shell</a>, which would change the user interface language.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>I can reproduce this issue in some of my libraries. To further confirm if this issue is related to a bug or server side, I need some time to do some more tests and consult senior engineers. Your understanding and patience are appreciated.</p>
<p>In the meantime, could you let us know more detailed information for the investigation?<br />
1. Have you tried different browsers to check the outcome?<br />
2. When did this issue happen?<br />
3. Does this issue occur to all the libraries in the specific private site collection? How about different Site collections?<br />
4. Do any other colleagues encounter this issue in the same or different libraries?</p>
<p>We look forward to your updates.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Kerwin</p>

<p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>Good to know that the fix has been deployed. Thanks for your continued cooperation and patience on working with us.</p>
<p>For other community members, if the issue remains, please first try reindexing the library by clicking the
<b>LIBRARY </b>ribbon &gt; <b>Library Settings</b> &gt; <b>Advanced settings</b> &gt; <b>Reindex Document Library</b>.</p>
<p>You can also reindex the entire site at <b>Site settings</b> &gt; <b>Search </b>&gt;
<b>Search an offline availability</b> &gt;<b> Reindex site.</b> (*Initiating reindexing may cause massive load on the search system. Please make sure that you don't initiate this without having done changes that requires all items to be reindexed.)</p>
<p>If you are still experiencing an issue, please let us know by posting a new thread as this may indicate either a scoping issue or an independent problem.</p>

<h2>            OneNote for Android crashes after &#39;Loading notebooks...&#39; for ages</h2>
                    I created a sample Notebook using the web version of OneNote on my SkyDrive
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then on my HTC Sensation XE I opened OneNote for Android</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All it does is sit there saying 'Loading notebooks...' for quite some while, then it crashes out and restarts and does the same.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>when it crashes, the Android logcat has this in it:</div>

    <title>&#34;Delete record&#34; not shown in shortcut menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emerald77  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Delete record&#34; not shown in shortcut menu</h2>
                    I have a single form with the Allow Deletions property set to "Yes".&nbsp; However, when I right-click on the record selector, there is no option to delete the record (only Cut, Copy, and Paste are shown/available, and Form Properties and Properties are greyed
 out).<br />
<br />
Is there one or more other properties I need to set in order to have the shortcut menu display the option to "Delete record"?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any assistance.

Hmmm.&nbsp; If I right-click on the record selector of a datasheet, the "Delete record" option appears.&nbsp; But if I try and do the same thing on my single form, then&nbsp;the "Delete record" option does not appear.<br />
<br />
I don't understand the inconsistency.

            <p>Not sure either.&nbsp; It is the same in all forms (continuous or single). You can also pick Cut to get the same result as delete.</p>

It&nbsp;doesn't help the rest of us in the "community" who have the same question. Posting the answer would be helpful rather than responding to CornishKent privately.

<h2>            How to Install Data Analysis for Excel 2013</h2>
                    Hello I need help please. The data analysis add-in tool is not available when I go File/Options/Add-Ins. I located the four files (ANALYS32.XLL; FUNCRES.XLAM; ATPVBAEN.XLAM;PROCDB.XLAM) for data analysis in the program files, but I'm not for sure where
 I need to transfer these files in order to enable the data analysis toolpak in Excel 2013.

<h2>            Can&#39;t access my credit, Skype phone number or voice mail messages.</h2>
                    <p>For years I had and still have a skype phone number. &nbsp;A few months back, skype quit working and it wanted me to use my MS account. &nbsp;I opened a MS account.</p>
<p>But I still get emails from Skype that say I have a voice mail (which I can not open). &nbsp;Also, I can not access my skype phone number even though they send me emails saying I have one and have a balance of about $70. &nbsp;My new skype does not recognize my skype
 phone number. &nbsp;So I have two accounts but can not use the one with credit. &nbsp;Any suggestions? &nbsp;</p>
