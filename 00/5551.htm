<p>Hi Fredrik,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the status bar do you mean the ribbon at bottom of the screen showing items and connecting condition? If so, the answer is no, this view cannot be changed in Outlook for Mac. And if you think your request can be more user friendly in your daily work,
 we suggest you submitting a user feedback to our dedicated feedback website: <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac</a> . Many features of current programs might be designed and upgraded based on customers’ feedback. Your voice is important for us to improve our products.

<h2>            Switched  to Outlook from Earthlink.net&#40; administered by outlook&#41;.  Get mail, no access to Notes, Calendar, cloud, MS HTC Phone, photos...</h2>
                    <p>An account with new email was set up for me at Outlook.com.&nbsp; I thought I needed to switch my email from my earthlink.net address to my outlook.com address.&nbsp; The status I'm in currently is:&nbsp; &nbsp;I can get email from both, but my all the outlook functions on
 my PC are no longer linked to my phone.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are all empty, new, unused.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have some very important travel information in the phone I can't afford to lose.&nbsp; I'd like to relink/resynch the PC with the phone, but have no clue as to why this situation exists.
 I don't know how I got into this fix.&nbsp; I do know I was surprised the password I was trying to create for the new signon MS page did not take, but the old sig-in password did work.&nbsp; So now I sign in to MS with&nbsp; the password my son created when he opened the
 Outlook.com account for me.</p>
<p>Can I save my data and get it to work with the phone?&nbsp; Is the data roaming untethered in the ether?</p>

            <p>I have both Office outlook 2010, handling EarthLink, and Outlook.com. Using Windows 8.1.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I was using the EarthLink set-up well, until something to do with EarthLink started to interfere with the speed of my PC, so my son suggested I switch over to an Outlook.com account and ditch EarthLink, which he never appreciated.&nbsp; He set up an email account
 and app for me on my computer.&nbsp; I was able to get&nbsp; new email on Outlook, but the other functions stayed with EarthLink.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the bright idea I wanted to move all my cloud based stuff (calendar, notes, people etc, that were working just fine, synching with my phone and RT Surface) to work&nbsp;&nbsp;with Outlook.com.&nbsp; I don't know what I did wrong, but I started new cloud-based stuff,
 and could no longer access my phone or calendar using Outlook.com. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The current status is that yesterday my son did a&nbsp; workaround for me, by moving an icon&nbsp;for the old outlook/earthlink calendar to my start page, bypassing the new account.&nbsp; He also synched the two calendars, so that is working, after a&nbsp;fashion. &nbsp; So, essentially
 I'm back where I started, with two email accounts, and only one linked to my portable devices.&nbsp; I can't afford to start over, because all my data, travel plans etc are in my phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, it's a mess.&nbsp; I'm afraid I did not find the instructions about linking accounts at all intuitive.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have everything merged, but perhaps that is just not possible?&nbsp; If so, please tell me, and I'll quit fretting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I'm using terms like synch, bypass, workaround as part of an old vocabulary.&nbsp; For all I know they mean something different in computer lingo, but I don't have the current vocabulary.&nbsp;

            <p>Let me make sure I understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have Earthlink as your Internet service provider and they also were your mail service provider. &nbsp;You have created an Outlook.com address for email and Earthlink is still your Internet provider. &nbsp;Correct so far?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You said you were synching your phone (what type of phone, by the way?) and your Surface RT with your Earthlink mailbox. &nbsp;How were you doing that? &nbsp;Earthlink has always been POP, which cannot sync anything. Earthlink states they are implementing IMAP early
 in 2015, but IMAP, while synching email, also doesn't sync contacts or calendar. &nbsp;I don't think any protocol can sync Outlook Notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook Connector will allow Outlook 2010 to sync with Outlook.com's email, contacts (People), and calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can describe how you had Outlook 2010 connected to your Earthlink mailbox, that should help build a picture of what you had so we can determine how best to proceed.<br />

            <p>I can shed some light on this scenario (I've been providing support in this matter).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to using an earthlink email address in Outlook 2010, Leptopsylla has two Microsoft accounts. The original (which I will call "Hybrid") was created back in the MSN Messenger/.Net Passport days and is keyed to the earthlink email address.&nbsp; The
 new one (call it "Pure") is a new @outlook.com account.&nbsp; Systems involved are a Windows 8.1 desktop, a Surface RT, and Windows Phone 8.1 (HTC 8XT)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, L's desktop account was switched from Hybrid to Pure. (I wish I'd seen it, as I hadn't anticipated this could be done).&nbsp;
<strong>This removed Hybrid from the accounts lists of the OneNote and Calendar apps, and is responsible for the apparent loss of content; easily corrected through the Settings charm&gt;Accounts.</strong> (although I didn't see&nbsp;the OneNote app reopen Hybrid's
 notebook, OneNote 2010 can be used on the desktop&nbsp;instead). We would have 'lost' the People hub as well if we hadn't already imported Hybrid's contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As is evident in this thread, there has been a lot of confusion from the reuse of the Outlook name (the office 2010 client, the outlook.com webservice, and the outlook.com account). At this stage, the plan is to continue to move away from Hybrid, if only
 for clarity.&nbsp; On the RT, we will be adding Pure as a separate user account, transferring files as needed. The&nbsp;phone can be reset to make Pure the dominant account there. OneDrive contents, calendars, and contacts will be copied over.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So everything is stable and secure (for now), but Outlook 2010 could remain untidy.</strong></p>
<p>I had planned to put Pure front-and-center with the outlook connector as described, with earthlink on the side. Unfortunately, since the desktop has been switched to Pure without starting fresh, we'll still have to confront the unpleasantness of outlook
<em>read-only </em>use, and then scrub it to a fresh state, that would be ideal. Otherwise, an untidy Outlook 2010 will have to suffice.</p>

            <p>HI Gerry8TR,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Phone does not have a volume lock switch or setting. &nbsp; The only way to change the Ringer volume is by pressing the volumne up/down buttons on the side of the phone. &nbsp;Do you have the phone in a case or in a pocket, where the buttons could be pressed?
 &nbsp;You can change the volume while on the lock screen. If something was pressing against both the lock button and the volume down button, that could be the cause of the problem.</p>

            the problem is design of the phone when on the phone the vol controls are easy to use BUT when then using the phones many screen controls you switch hands and your finger presses on the vol reduce button it needs a software lock<br />

    <title>Confusing behaviour of full screen mode - usability problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> javier 22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Confusing behaviour of full screen mode - usability problem</h2>
                    <p><span>Using OneNote 2010, when clicking view-&gt;full page, the title bar and menu are not hidden, so it is easy to access to the
 quick access toolbar and the ribbon.</span></p>

<p><span>However, OneNote 2013 hides both the toolbar and the ribbon. In order to access toolbar and ribbon THREE additional clicks
 are needed (see http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-onenote/is-there-a-way-to-have-access-to-the-quick-access/dac28c62-a59d-4f9b-8cdc-e10ea84c8fce).</span></p>

<p><span>Additionally, there is a "double arrow" button in the top-right corner of the window which performs exactly the same function.</span></p>

<p><span>IMO the view-full page should not duplicate this behavior by do not hiding neither toolbar nor ribbon.</span></p>

<p><span>Another problem is that these settings are not preserved when screen is rotated (e.g. from portrait to landscape and then
 to portrait). </span></p>

            After using the double arrow or the View &gt; Full page, you can then pin the ribbon back and achieve what you want.

            <p>Agree with Javier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In OneNote 20120, the Quick Access Toolbar remained visible in full screen, and allowed quick changes in pen colour etc, This was extremely valuable in educational contexts, when developing notes and displaying &nbsp;fullscreen on a dataprojector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be useful if there was an option for the Quick Access Toolbar to "Always Display in FullScreen Mode" (i.e checkbox along with the "Display Quick Access Toolbar&nbsp;below the Ribbon" option)&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lack of this essential capability in&nbsp;OneNote 2013 may make me stick with 2010 - and miss out on the other benefits.</p>

            This is just to endorse all the previous complaints. On a tablet, using the "Quick Access Bar" from full screen is anything but quick.

If anyone's listening, please revert to the 2010 behaviour.<br />

            Absolutely I agree! &nbsp;As an educator, I've been using a tablet PC in my classroom in order to post my lessons online as videos. &nbsp;OneNote is critical to this process. &nbsp;Having used OneNote 2013 for one week, I will have to revert back to OneNote 2010 if this
 is not fixed. &nbsp;

<div>Please, Microsoft, create an add-in or something to permanently keep the Quick Access Toolbar visible.</div>

            I find this issue to be extremely annoying as well. I currently have both OneNote 2010 and 2013 installed, and I find myself having to use 2010 because of it.<br />
<br />
The program really should remember if one chooses the "Show Tabs and Commands" setting in Full Page View mode. As it is, one can select it in full page mode, leave full page mode, and then the ribbon is no longer there when one re-enters full page view.<br />
<br />
At the very least it could be a program option whether to have it remembered or not. Or two separate functions: Full Page View vs Full Screen View or something like this.<br />
<br />
I echo the previous calls: please fix this, so that I can enjoy the other benefits of OneNote 2013!<br />

            This happened to one of our older computers today too. It was just out of the blue. I noticed mcafee wanted to update prior to the page popping up and restarting windows wanted to update amidst all of it too. A smart tv wouldn't have anything to do with
 it would it? If it has access to the pc? I removed the device for now.

                    Why does security essentials say "potentially unprotected", every second day. &nbsp;Then I must do a full scan for it to turn green or "protected" again. &nbsp;Furthermore it says once a week "Genuine Windows" validation failed, I have done this validation 12 times
 already, and is definitely sure about the genuity of my windows products. &nbsp;Please help is this normal procedure???

            <p>Hi Johan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These appear to be two separate problems and no they are not common, but it's certainly not the first time we've seen either of them.&nbsp; Let's tackle them each in turn:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>***********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Potentially unprotected:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please see the following compliments of Le Boule:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Are you using CCleaner? Piriform has programmed it for some reason to remove part of the MSE History files and it's deleting the files MSE checks to determine the last time a scan was conducted. This file removal has no effect on the antimalware
 protection provided by MSE.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Open CCleaner Applications Tab, then Under Windows uncheck MS Antimalware...that should prevent CCleaner from deleting the MS Antimalware scanning history files.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Per suggestion of <em><span>MartinHampton</span></em> you <u>may</u> also need to uncheck MS Management Console.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>You may need to run another quick scan and reboot the computer.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>See this thread for more details and alternatives to resolve this problem if you are not using CCleaner:</span></b><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/why-after-a-couple-of-days-after-a-scan-does-my/0dc5b433-28ec-4180-a8ee-26a6cd10c3ab"><b><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/why-after-a-couple-of-days-after-a-scan-does-my/0dc5b433-28ec-4180-a8ee-26a6cd10c3ab</span></b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that isn't it, please check your system clock to make sure it is correct (even a few minutes can matter - but I've seen it say 1978 or 2286 for the year). Resync it with the internet clock. If it need to be changed and keeps happening, change the
 CMOS battery on the motherboard as that's almost always the cause of a system clock problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please see the following compliments of Stephen Boots – MVP:</span></p>

<p><b><span>What operating system and service pack?</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Any security software still installed?</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC. Reboot.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</span></b><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</span></b></a></p>

<p>*****************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Genuine validation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm assuming this has to do with installling MSE. If not, skip to the last paragraph for general assistance with Windows Genuine Validation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSE doesn't in and of itself cause genuine validation issues with computers - but the computer must be activated and have a genuine validated OS installed for MSE to be installed and continue working. I believe this was identified by installing MSE and think
 that the solution involves working with WGA as in the next paragraph or with applicable experts as noted in the following one. The issue is not MSE but genuine validation of your operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First try the following: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/genuine-windows-validation-error-with-microsoft/22930cda-a0bd-4263-890b-ddf812859ca4">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I</span><span>f the issue is that your OS is being termed “Non-genuine”, then first check to see if your system passes the genuine validation test:<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/diag/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/diag/</a>
 and following the genuine validation problem instructions here:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/916247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/916247</a>. If the problem does not go away or you still get the message, then I recommend further
 assistance at the following forum: <a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/genuine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/genuine</a>, select whichever is applicable to your version of Windows, and start with the announcements at the top which will provide instructions on what to do to prepare your first post there so things will
 go faster and more smoothly. They will help determine the cause and what you need to do to fix it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            6111 - how to view Message Details</h2>
                    For a SMS, the 6111 messaging app does not display the Sender and Date/Time at the bottom of the message. Rather, this is available as a Menu Option which is much less convenient. Is it possible to configure so this is shown as a continuation of the message
 as in other Nokia phones?

            I have exactly the same problem. It's quite a fuss having to go to the message options and then selecting the details of the message just to see what time the message was sent. I have been trying to see if i can find a setting or something that will make
 the phone show the date and time at the bottom of the message, but no luck whatsoever. It looks like we are at the mercy of somebody at Nokia who may fix this problem and then have our phones updated...

I know the solution for this problem that is to explicitly set the AllowFormattingCells to False along with the DrawingObjects but just curious to know the reason for excel VBA to behave this way.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;- i had seen that before on 2 different formula's.&nbsp; not sure why the formula would add a couple of megabytes (to a 16mb file),&nbsp; for 1 column up 2bm = 18mb.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>but beleive it is true that some kind of errant formula's (maybe testing too many open ended things),&nbsp; but did not take time to troubleshoot.</p>

<p>- on another note,&nbsp; sorting a file will bloat it,&nbsp; fixed by closing &amp; reopening file.&nbsp; to the contrary sorting seems to line more conditional formats up together, taking up less space.&nbsp; (done alot of cu-pastes lately,&nbsp; sort the sections, on what ever you
 want:&nbsp; file should be smaller than what started, after:&nbsp; close-reopen-save).</p>
<p>- pasting formulas down a column&nbsp; and / or formats will bloat the file as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>answers:&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;- close / re-open&nbsp;file, hit save;&nbsp; maybe:&nbsp; select empty columns to right &amp; empty rows underneath (and delete columns / rows).</p>
<p>&nbsp;- look for new formulas made, remove them, modify them...</p>
<p>&nbsp;- to expand on ossie's answer,&nbsp; thats what i do each time run into that, but include other items to delete,&nbsp; (with columns or rows hilited, hit del key, delete&nbsp;conditional formats,&nbsp; right click &amp; format all cells general if you want:&nbsp; but i figure when
 you delete the whole columns,&nbsp; it should get rid of all).&nbsp; </p>
<p>sometimes file asks you to select cell A1 &amp; save.&nbsp;&nbsp;close-reopen file-hit save.</p>

            It took over 10 hours!! to get it installed on my Lenovo S10-2 (2GB RAM). I woke up to a black screen, with no diskactivity - the disklamp just blinked one time, or two, now and then.... I closed the lidt - opened it again, could logon, and it did the
 rest of the install "We are setting things up for you" - and "Almost ready"... it did its things finish, and it is now up and running...

            I have installed multiple and upgraded versions of Windows 95 to Windows 8.1 since the mid 1990's. All of them took under an hour either with a clean install or upgrade. I have also had some beta versions and none of them has been has slow as the latest
 builds. Keep in mind the older computers were 386 and 486 machines. These have all been on desktop computers. My newest installation was on a separate computer about a year and half ago was Windows 8.1 and that was approximately 40 minutes. Really is Windows
 10 going to take several hours to install/upgrade on modern computers?

<p>But this wasn't from Windows Update, like when we are having a "fight" with now? Didn't you use an ISO to these old machinery?</p>

<p>How about Windows 3.0 and Windows 3.1 which were 5 1/4 inch floppies? Boy do times change.</p>

<h3> rusty hightower  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#42;&#42;Resolved &#40;sort of&#41;&#42;&#42;  I switched from slow ring to fast ring.  No builds are found.  Is there a way to fix this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Edit 6/27</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>While I was ossifying overnight, I checked back at <a href="https://insider.windows.com/Home/Index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://insider.windows.com/Home/Index">
Home Insiders</a><br />
&nbsp;and the problem I was complaining about when I started this thread resolved itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow my Windows Insider account got resolved and I am able to login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help while I squirmed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>6/25** Short of specific registry keys or hidden folders, I took drastic action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found several ISOs online.&nbsp; Since my build was broken, I took the chance and downloaded an ISO from an earlier build, used Rufus to burn it to a USB and installed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: This is usually a BAD idea but I had experience on early Insider builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can wait to see if the newest build can be downloaded.</p>

<p>I was happy with an earlier build but now that the rollout is approaching I switched to Fast.&nbsp; A few transient error messages forced me to confirm my Microsoft Account settings to confirm it's the build that developed the bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any settings or registry keys I can modify?&nbsp; I remember the during the W10 rollout there were some obscure folder contents that could be rebuilt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm too old to wait for the latest fast ring build to move to slow ring. ;)</p>

 delete messages after 10 days. This is more convenient as we don't have any control if senders are randomly changing their address. Follow the steps below on how to set to Exclusive and check if this helps:</span></span></p>

                    As i person who never experienced having a joystick navigated phone i worry a bit about the joystick of my new 5700. I want the people who own joystick navigated nokia phones to share their impression (good and bad). Are they reliable? From how much time
 you use them? etc.

            Well, nokia's joysticks are overally better than SE.<br />
Specially the eseries phones like E70,E61/E61i,E60 have powerful joysticks.<br />
In nseries N91 is pretty cool, but once I have to go outside my city and gotta browse internet a lot-this causes the joystick malfunctioning.<br />
My cousin has had 3250, both 3250 and 5700 has not that good joysticks yet they can be carry on.<br />
N73's joystick I found not very relable.<br />
My mates and cousin are havin this. Bad.

            But yeah they are better than Sony Ericssons joysticks beause they are sharp and hurt your finger.<br />

Also dust gets in the joystick base on the SE's

            My wife's 3250 is more than a year old, but the joystick is still functioning as it was when new. As with all phones with joysticks, be careful in using them heavily, as eventually they will also wear out if abused. =)

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to use the Zune software to sync your Zune player with your computer. If you do not have the Zune software installed on your computer, you can download the Zune software from here:</p>

<h2>            internet options screen is too big on netbook</h2>
                    gateway netbook running win 7 starter: when i open internet options in IE the window is so big I cant click on the okay, cancel or apply buttons. i tried to move the window up but it wont scroll up beyond the screen. i tried to change the resolution on
 the display but the only setting makes it even bigger. i tried changing folder option and even tried to hide the taskbar but its still to low even with the taskbar off. i feel like an idiot because its such a simple thing but having a brain fart here. i have
 no problem scrolling the window on my desktop&nbsp; beyond the screen but cant do it on my netbook. its really ____ me off. (drivers and hardware are up to date and no errors)

<p>Hey jvec99,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Is it only the Internet Options window size that is big or the whole browser?</p>
<p>My suggestion is to change the display size of Internet Explorer (IE) and see where it takes. If this helps you in getting proper view of the “Internet Options”, you can reset IE settings to its default configuration.<br />
<br />
Hold down the CTRL key and roll your mouse wheel down to reduce your display size.<br />
Open Internet Options and see if it’s any better.<br />
<br />
Additionally try changing the text size of IE.<br />
If you go to "View" on the top menu and find "Text Size" you will see a list going from "Largest" to "Smallest." Select the smaller settings. Test and see.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If this helps in getting better view of “Internet Options”, reset IE settings so that it is back to its default settings when IE was first installed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note: Resetting Internet Explorer's settings is not reversible. After a reset, all previous settings are lost and cannot be recovered. Rather than resetting everything, you might want to reset specific settings or delete your webpage history.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For more information, see:<br />

<p>If none of this helps, changing screen resolution that is best for the monitor should have given you what is required. Just in case if it's the limitation of driver, try updating your graphics card driver.<br />

    <title>Keeping personal &#38; work Outlook data separate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rexeast  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keeping personal &#38; work Outlook data separate</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I sync my WM6 Verizon XV6800 with two Outlook accounts: one in my personal folders on my home computer, and with my company's exchange server. Since I want to keep my work and personal data separate, I don't want information from one account to end up on the
 other.<br />
<br />
Can I sync only my personal contacts/notes to my phone, and not my company's Exchange server contacts/notes?<br />
<br />
More generally, is it possible to set synchronization settings differently for my Exchange server and my personal PC? it seems that if I check the box to sync "Contacts" in my personal PC's Windows Mobile Device Center, it automatically syncs not only with
 my PC, but with my company's Exchange server too.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Rex<br />

            I am bumping this thread because Rex's situation is mine exactly.&nbsp; I haven't found the answer anywhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have contacts and calendar items at home that I don't want showing up at work, and I certainly don't want all of my work calendar alerts repeated at home!<br />
<br />
However, I want BOTH sets of data to go to my phone.<br />

<p>You don't need to register any Microsoft software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that Works Suite 2006 was released 11 years ago (originally intended for use with Win 98, Win Me, and Win XP), it's not surprising at all that links point to pages were no longer functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Activation, on the other hand, is required.&nbsp; I don't know if Works Suite 2006 required activation, but it probably did.&nbsp; If that's what you're referring to (that is, you have a product key that came with the software and you want to use that key to authorize
 use of the software), you can do it by phone.&nbsp; See this article: </p>

                    <p>Excel Shuts down every time I right click. I've lost so much work I'm going nuts</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running office 10 windows 10 </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried 3 different mouse.&nbsp; Updated drivers no help</p>

            <p>Does this happen if you open Excel in Safe Mode (hold down Ctrl while launching Excel).<br />
If not then it is likely that an add-in or a startup workbook is causing the problem<br />
.</p>
<p>Otherwise, try searching for an EXCEL14.XLB file and renaming it to EXCEL14OLD.XLB&nbsp;
<br />
It is your toolbar customisation file - possibly it has been corrupted.</p>
<p>It will be remade (though you will lose any customisations).</p>
