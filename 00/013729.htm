<p>1. Please put an option to allow the + and - tree view (with the + or - inside a rectangle) back into the File Explorer. This view is much easier to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Why do the symbols (like the "&gt;") keep disappearing when you move the mouse off the tree? Please put an option in to allow them to stay visible all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. In build 10074, when I click beside the folder name (address?), it doesn't show the full path. This is a very useful feature in Windows 7, that I use a lot. I could only get it to show the full path if I went through the C: drive, etc. lower down on the
 tree. I am assuming this is a just a bug, but it really needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. One thing that would be really nice, would be to have the old Find/Search command back. The search box in the upper right corner of Windows Explorer has some nice features, but the old dialog box was much easier to use. It was much more intuitive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Allow us to use bold, italics, and color on the text of individual file names and folder names, and of course to sort by color. This would allow users to find files faster when scanning a list. This would be an awesome feature!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Office 2016 Home &#38; Student  AND Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Bought Office 2016 Home &amp; Student version. Installed and activated it. However, after an windows 10 update, whenever I open any office app; e.g. Word/ excel/ or PowerPoint, its opening as 365 as shown in below image (screenshot collage). However, as My Office
 opened, it showed my license as Office 2016 Home &amp; Student version. </p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT IS HAPPENING? AND WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?</p>
<p>Does it mean that I cannot use my office apps after 1 Year? Please help me out!</p>

            Hi Supratim
<br />
<br />If you have purchased Office 2016, that is yours for life and does not expire.
<br />
<br />There are a few possible causes of this . .. 
<br />
<br />Was there a pre-existing Office 365 version on your PC,before you installed Office 2016?
<br />
<br />This may just be a splash screen branding issue, in Word, go to File - Account, what Office version is reported there?       
        </p>

<p>Thank you so much. I checked in account, it was showing office 2016. </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>However, I still see some features like Designer and Morph transition in PowerPoint. In my old laptop with pre-installed office 2016 these features are NOT present. I heard that these feature are only available through office 365 subscription. That's why
 my confusion is not completely gone. Is Microsoft giving this features to office 2016 who buy it in 2019?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>One thing I must mention that whenever I open office apps I see my name at top right of the apps. However, in my old laptop I don't see it. Should I always keep them signed in?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Yes! you are right! Before I installed office 2016 from Microsoft site using the key, the laptop makes pre-downloaded office apps that required sign-ins to activate. But, I never saw "365" in them. Rather, when I used to click windows icon on taskbar or
 searched office apps in cortana, I used to see 2016 versions of the apps.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>So my problem solved- that my version indeed in "2016". But I still get some of the so-called "365-only" features. So I'm still with confusion! :-D</p>

<p>Today, 7 days after installing office 2016, I don't see the office 365 features anymore- no design ideas, no morph transition in PowerPoint. Moreover, my office programs are opening without "365" written underneath. I think, it was a 7 day promo by Microsoft
 to test Office 365.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To further investigate, is it only one email address that you can't search on Skype? Have you tried to search using Skype on a different device? What is the
<strong>exact</strong> version of Skype you are running? (not latest or recent)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post. <br />

            WiFi = WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) you can use if you have a WiFi/WLAN access point (or router) at home, or at work, at hotels, or other places where there is free or fee based WiFi/WLAN available.<br />
<br />
You can use it for (web) browsing, email, podcasting, instant messaging, RSS news feeds, etc.<br />
<br />
For setting it up, you do it in the phone menu under "Tools" and the "Settings" app. However, when you use,
e.g., the browser ("Web" app), you can also in its settings (Options &gt; Settings) configure it to ask for the connection type every time, and then look for any available, public WLAN.<br />
<br />
Details on what kind of information needed to configure a WLAN access point you cand find in the phone's User's Guide.

            Speaking about getting wi-fi working on the n80 i have been having problems with this as follows:-<br />
<br />
I have had a nokia N80 for a few days, and can I get the wireless access working to access the internet, can I hell!<br />
<br />
I can get the phone to connect to my router via dhcp or static ip address. I can enable security, have an open network and can even ping my phones ip address so I know the link is working via wireless.<br />
<br />
It's just when I attempt to connect to wlan on the internet is says the usual 'web no gateway reply'. Has anyone got this working with a linksys wag54gx2 wireless router?<br />
<br />
Following on from there I thought you might like to know that my mobile works with Opera mini via my wireless access point. So it looks like the issue maybe with the internet browser.<br />
<br />
Can anyone at Nokia comment when this issue will be fixed?<br />
<br />
Also to note my phone is currently running the latest firmware.<br />
<br />

You get this error when the phone is not able to resolve the hostname to an IP address.

Did you try Opera Mini via your WLAN? Does it work?<br />

            Sorry stanley_cooper,<br />
<br />
Didn't noticed that you mention that Opera Mini works.<br />
<br />
It may be the browser's problem then. So far, it didn't work for me in WLAN with 802.1x EAP-LEAP security. Hadn't confirm if Opera Mini will work in that WLAN. Will update once I have the chance to test with Opera. Will update Nokia on this as a defect once
 I can confirm.<br />
<br />
Cheers. ^_^;

            Right after trying using the ip address I was able to access google's website.<br />
<br />
After getting another machine connected on the router it had the same issue and wasn't able to resolve the dns even though it has the correct public dns details.<br />
<br />
So I changed this to my internal dns server and hey presto it now works!<br />
<br />
It's stange how opera mini worked fine though..<br />
<br />
Now if only I could access oranges url links using wi-fi instead of it coming saying I need to be on orange's network.<br />

</p><p>If your accounts are already linked or you sign up in Skype using your Microsoft credentials, I'm afraid there's no option to close the Skype account without affecting your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And even if you created your account before Skype and Microsoft migration or haven't linked your accounts, you will still need to link your Skype account to a Microsoft account to be able to proceed with the account deletion process, but you can use a dummy
 account. This is due to the full migration of Skype to Microsoft and one <span>

<h2>            Sort Blank Rows Using Excel VBA</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; While sorting an pivot table column using&nbsp;excel vba code &nbsp;we have an issue&nbsp;where blank spaces which are substituted as the string "(blank)" being appeared in the&nbsp;beginning of the sorted list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Is there a way&nbsp;to make the word "(blank)"&nbsp;appear at the end of the sorted output using the excel vba code.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

 seen no kind of solution to my problem. Now office is not allowing me to use any of the features saying i have an unlicensed product. What am I supposed to do?</p>

</p><p>Drop Down List contains 4 choices (A, B, C, D) and I would like to add the selected text to the Company field of the document properties.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, however, this didn't address my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding the control to the form is not the problem, the problem is getting the value of the drop-down list to auto-populate the Company field of the document properties, and hopefully, without the need for VBA.</p>
<p>File -&gt; Info -&gt; Properties -&gt; Show All Properties -&gt; Company</p>

<h3> cristian secaräƒ  say:</h3>
<h2>            feature request for Nokia Car &#40;if not already present somehow&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>The Nokia Car is quite useful, but still there is something missing: a simple way to do Voice commands. The easiest way should be by select and hold the "Call" area on the Nokia Car screen (something like it was in original S^3 or Anna versions with the
 Call button in every home screen).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At present I don't know if there is a way to activate this, but I was not able to find some. Without this feature and without a BT headset, the Nokia Car mode is not of much help when making calls while driving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Cristi</p>

            &nbsp;It is very likely that Outlook doesn't close properly or not at all. In case of the last, you'll see an outlook.exe process still running in Task Manager.<br />
<br />
Most likely causes are add-ins or having applications running which rely on Outlook such as sync or fax software.<br />

<p>Ok after further troubleshooting.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems Office 2010 has problems with DFS.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can go directly to the share and files will open... but if&nbsp;I use a DFS share name it craps out. =(&nbsp; Office 2007 has no issues with the DFS share.</p>

    <title>import a log text file into access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raulsousa  say:</h3>
<h2>            import a log text file into access</h2>
                    hello all<br />
I would appreciate any help on the best way to approach the following problem.<br />
I need to import a log file into access. This is a text (.txt) file.<br />
The problem is that all information, in this file, is record in a single column, line after line<br />
The file structure is mainly like the following example:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Event ID<br />
&nbsp; Header line1<br />
&nbsp; Header line1<br />
&nbsp; Header line1<br />
&nbsp; ...<br />
&nbsp; Detail line1<br />
&nbsp; Detail line1<br />
&nbsp; Detail line1<br />
&nbsp; end of event<br />
&nbsp; Event ID<br />
&nbsp; Header line1<br />
&nbsp; Header line1<br />
&nbsp; Header line1<br />
&nbsp; ...<br />
&nbsp; Detail line1<br />
&nbsp; Detail line1<br />
&nbsp; Detail line1<br />
&nbsp; end of event<br />
<br />
I could upload this file, only if knew who to do it.<br />
anyway, any hint would be most appreciated.

            <p>The word 'Mainly' has me worried.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One method would be to read in the file using a function such as <a href="http://www.devhut.net/2012/05/14/vba-read-file-into-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.devhut.net/2012/05/14/vba-read-file-into-memory/</a>&nbsp;and then use vba to loop through the content line by line and do whatever you'd like with it.</p>

            I has also thinking on using VBA.<br />
I am more familiar with excel. so, i was thinking importing the file into excel. work the data. then, import the excel file into access.<br />
in this way i need to transpose lines into columns.<br />
The problem is to create a rule for this transposition, as any event may have a different number of lines.<br />

            Use the Open and Line Input commands to read each line in turn. There needs to be something in each line to determine whether it is a I'D, header, detail or event end. So, you test each line to determine the type and act accordingly.

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Search for From Does not Find Anything</h2>
                    <p>I have Outlook 2013 with Windows 8.&nbsp; One day, when I searched using From(), it began to come back with nothing found.&nbsp; Happens on all search items (Subject, etc).&nbsp; Of course, there are things to be found.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched on-line and someone said to try unchecking Outlook in the indexing options.&nbsp; I did that.&nbsp; But now the search options are grayed out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, either search options don't work or grayed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advnace.</p>

<h2>            Office 2010 free download &#40;2 month free one&#41; automatically directing to Office Click &#38; Run</h2>
                    <p>I am using Win 7 64 bit. I wanted to install 64 bit Visio 2010 (through online not through a disk)&nbsp;who's installation was failing because I had Office Click &amp; Run. So, I uninstalled Office Click &amp; Run, and was then successful in installing Visio 2010.
</p>
<p>Then I went online&nbsp;to install Office (not the Click &amp; Run).. where I had the option to go for 2 month trial so I went for it and it started downloading the exe file.. this file was over 300MB and since download speed was slow, I decided to cancel the download
 and try again after clearing temp folder, removing cookies and restarting the system.
</p>
<p>But now when I am trying for the Office (2 month free trial)&nbsp;through MS website, I am getting a 2MB download which is a Click to Run (as I understand from its description below the "Install now" icon). But I believe installing office trial through Click-to-run
 won't be a good idea, because the whole point was to get rid of Click to Run, because the 64 bit Visio 2010 didn't like it. Unfortunately since I cleared the Broswing history, I don't remember the web&nbsp;link which was earlier providing me the (greater than 300MB)
 office exe file which wasn't a Click to Run one. Now the microsoft web links are only taking me to Click &amp; Run downloads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly advise. I badly need Office applications soon as possible. </p>
<p>Many thanks for your prompt advice.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> </span><span>Run Microsoft Online Scanner.</span>
</p>
<p><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>Note: The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Important: While performing scanning on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when scanning tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> <span>Reset Host file.</span> </span></p>
<p><span>Follow the article mentioned below to Reset Host file:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/972034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/972034</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span><strong>Method 3:</strong></span><span> </span><span>Fix your hijacked web browser</span>
<p><span>Follow the article mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/resources/hijacking-whatis.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/resources/hijacking-whatis.aspx</span></a></span></p>

 current. I have reinstalled the Realtek drivers from Acer's site and the adapter is still not recognized.<br />

<h2>            performance degradation of wifi outgoing traffic after some a while and&#47;or sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>the wireless outgoing traffic performance drops to around 4-5 Mbit/s after a while, especially when there were some sleep mode events in-between. incoming traffic is not affected. this happens on several different wifi networks (i.e. home, work, friends)
 and only in win10. under win8.1 on the same machine, the traffic performance is steady.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>disabling/enabling the network card does not help, while a reboot fixes the problem temporarily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260&nbsp;with power management features disabled and connecting to 802.11n and 802.11ac networks</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyone experiences the same problem? are there some netsh parameters that can be tried out?</p>

<p>the network seems fine: the degradation happens after a while (sometimes after 5min, other times after 1 to 2hrs). when experiencing the outgoing traffic degragation, other pcs can send &amp; receive data with full speed. experienced it with several different
 access points (wndr3700 and asus rt-ac87u) and wifi bands (2.4ghz and 5ghz). when booting the machine into windows 8.1 (using same driver version), everything is fine.</p>

            <p>i already did that prior to the tests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it seems it's an MTU issue with jumbo frames. while windows 8.1 seems to properly support them, the connection degrades after a while under windows 10 when using jumbo frames (i.e. MTU &gt; 1600). reducing the MTU on all my local devices to 1500 helped.</p>

            First question: You don't.<br />
<br />
Second question: I don't know, but I suspect because there are much more Windows users than Linux users &amp; that Nokia probably did not reserve an unlimited budget for developing the update application &amp; due to fewer Linux users it wasn't as high on the priority
 list.<br />
<br />
With Linux, your options are:<br />
- install Windows alongside Linux<br />
- find somebody else who has Windows on their PC and lets you borrow it<br />
- Have a Nokia repair/service center update your phone<br />
- Live with whatever firmware version you have now<br />

            I think Nokia would support Mac OS X before they support Linux.

            I think I read something about an OS X version of PC Suite being planned - though I guess they'd have to change the name: McSuite anyone?<br />
<br />
If that does happen, then I guess it would, technically, be easy enough to port the OS X version to Linux or any other flavour of Unix. Can't see Nokia doing it though: there are just way too many flavours of Unix around and way too few people using them. Unix
 is mosly used on servers, after all.<br />
<br />
As the previous post suggests, your best bet is either a friend's PC or a trip to a service center. Or surrender to the Might Microsoft ..

            This infuriates me! The non-microsoft users will remember how you treated us, Nokia. You can make things work cross platform or at least with Wine. This is inexcusable.

            Agreed. As I understand it, all the updater is doing is communicating via the USB port, and connecting to the Internet to grab the right update. Neither of these tasks is particularly advanced, so it should be easy enough to develop a Wine-friendly version.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I am a very ardent Linux user/fan/fanboy/supporter myself, yet I don't agree. I have been using Linux from 4 years, but I have kept Windows installed.<br />
<br />
My logic is - if Nokia has to diversify it's tech team to provide a version for Linux, they'll spend that much less time concentrating on something more important - software updates for the phone! Already with Windows they're having so many problems, they'll
 be swamped if they release a Linux version. So, in lieu of having more frequent and robust software updates for
<i>phone</i> I can ignore the fact that Nokia PC Suite and Update is not available for Linux. Much as I want it, I can live without it.<br />
<br />
A workaround would be to use virtualization - <a href="http://virtualbox.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
VirtualBox</a> is free, and available for most Linux distros. It has USB support, so you could install Nokia PC Suite/Updater in Windows XP guest. I have not tried it myself. If someone does try it, please post your experiences here :)

            If I wanted a phone to connect to MS Windows, I'd have bought a Windows Mobile (smart)phone.<br />
<br />
But I bought a Symbian OS phone, and I expected it to connect to Linux easily. Bad guess...<br />
<br />
I tried to install PC Suite on Windows XP in VirtualBox, but it failed. It was some monthes ago, the failure wasn't very explicit , impossible to debug of course.<br />
<br />
Shame on nokia to forget Linux users.

            Not a lot of people will switch their OS because the phone-software works with that particular OS ( certainly not linux users ).<br />
They 'l probably choose a phone with software that works on the OS they're using.<br />
<br />
With more and more users switching from XP/Vista to Ubuntu/Kubuntu or other distro's, they should at least figure out some kind of solution ( wine, virtualization, platform independent programming ) and put it on the net.<br />
<br />
I currently own a N73, but my next phone will be one chosen for it's compatibilty with linux.<br />
I still hope it will be a Nokia...

What part of the phone is NOT "compatible" with Linux? You can transfer data, music, and anything else you want. Software updates won't work, but you can always visit the nearest Nokia Care Center.

            Thanks for your reply,<br />
<br />
I would like to see something like the Nokia software suite on linux.<br />
Everything needed to handle the phone in one single application.<br />
<br />
I'll probably get the phone working with my distribution if i spend some time on the subject ( knowledgebase, config files etc. forums, etc. ).<br />
But then i'll probably end up with some functions of the phone supported and others not ( like the firmware-upgrade you mentioned ).<br />
<br />
A Nokia software suite - wine-solution, wuld be a good start :-)

<p>Thank you for the detailed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Account misconfiguration is a possible cause of the issue you're experiencing in Outlook. In order to isolate which device is causing the issue, we advise removing your email account on your iPhone for a while. Monitor if you will still receive two copies
 of sent emails. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure to update the iOS Mail app to the latest version before adding back your email account. For the steps on adding your Outlook.com account to iOS Mail app, please refer to this
