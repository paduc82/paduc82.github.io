<h2>            What&#39;s wrong with this vba code to copy rows based on cell value. I need your advice&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Hi!
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b><u>What I've done</u></b><br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've made this code for the first time step by step searching best option for each line. i'm proud of it, but I know it has mistakes:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b><u>My Goal</u></b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm trying to copy all rows that have on column H the words In Process to Sheet2 and all rows that have on column H the words Closed to Sheet3.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b><u>The Problem</u></b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I see that the two blocks of code that start with the autofilter have a lot of instructions which are the same. I was wondering if there's another way to make both blocks shorter, because the action is the same, with different filter criterias and different
 destinatio sheets. Or is it OK as I've done it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Sub Copy()</div>
<div>Dim Sh As Worksheet, Sh2 As Worksheet, Sh3 As Worksheet</div>
<div>Dim Rng As Range</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Set Sh = Worksheets("Sheet1")</div>
<div>Set Sh2 = Worksheets("Sheet2")</div>
<div>Set Sh3 = Worksheets("Sheet3")</div>
<div>Set Rng = Sh.Range("A1:K" &amp; LastRow(Sh))</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sh.Columns("I:J").EntireColumn.Hidden = True</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Rng.AutoFilter Field:=8, Criteria1:="In Process"</b></div>
<div><b>Rng.Offset(1, 0).Resize(Rng.Rows.Count - 1, Rng.Columns.Count).SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible).Copy</b></div>

<div>End Function</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've put in bold the code I want you to give me your opinion. I'm not too fond of loops because I always make mistakes and the application freezes, but if that's the way to go, perfect!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you so much!!</div>

            There is nothing wrong with your code, especially since you only have two sets of sheet and conditions.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>But, you could loop (useful when you have many more combos)</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Sub CopyWithLoop()</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim sh As Worksheet</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim sht As Worksheet</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim Arr(1 To 2, 1 To 2) As String</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim Rng As Range</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim i As Integer</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Set sh = Worksheets("Sheet1")</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Arr(1, 1) = "Sheet2"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Arr(2, 1) = "Sheet3"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Arr(1, 2) = "In Process"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Arr(2, 2) = "Closed"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Set Rng = sh.Range("A1:K" &amp; LastRow(sh))</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; sh.Columns("I:J").EntireColumn.Hidden = True</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; For i = 1 To 2</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rng.AutoFilter Field:=8, Criteria1:=Arr(i, 2)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rng.Offset(1, 0).Resize(Rng.Rows.Count - 1, Rng.Columns.Count).SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible).Copy</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set sht = Worksheets(Arr(i, 1))</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sht.Range("A" &amp; LastRow(sht) + 1).PasteSpecial (xlPasteValues)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sht.Cells.Columns.AutoFit</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; sh.Columns("I:J").EntireColumn.Hidden = False</div>
<div><br />
<div>End Sub</div>

    <title>Locked out of microsoft account and cannot recover it - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Locked out of microsoft account and cannot recover it</h2>
                    <p>Hi. as the title says, I've been locked out of my account after a "it appears someone else has been using your account" message. I have tried at least ten times to recover the account. My mobile number has changed and I never updated it, so I have to use
 my mothers account to get a recovery code. I am inputting ALL the correct personal data on the personal data screen. I cannot remember any previous passwords I have used and can only remember one previous email recipient and subject line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been in online chat with someone and that didn't help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a connected account&nbsp;I use as an alias&nbsp;(I used it to log on here) that I occasionally use as an alias that has all it's emails redirected towards my primary address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several emails in that account under several subfolders that have online receipts/guarantees stored in them that may well be required in the future if I have any issues with online purchases and therefore I really need to access the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am prepared to start using this email address I have logged into the Microsoft community with as my primary address but I need to get access to those subfolders on my previous Hotmail.co.uk address that I have been using for years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely, someone in Microsoft can get access to these and help me transfer them across to this email address ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be gratefully received but if nothing is forthcoming, I will stop using Microsoft email completely as I understand security is important but when you can give data as requested and then the system rejects it and asks for even more that no person
 would normally be able to deliver it is beyond a joke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Darren</p>

<p>Hi, I have the same problem too, which has only occurred this morning (Sunday 5/8/18).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received an e-mail stating that someone else may be using my account. They were not....I was using it. However, I deleted the e-mail and logged out, but then out of curiosity I tried to log back in again. I have entered my alternative e-mail address and
 entered the code sent to that e-mail address several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, each time it tells me to change my password, when I try to log in again, I am once again told that someone else is using my account and have to start the process all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even tried this with a Yahoo e-mail address as the alternative contact, but this also fails to unlock my account. I am now unable to use the account, even after being given a new long recovery code....please help !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even trying to send a message at <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-gb/contact/form/23/msa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-gb/contact/form/23/msa/</a> throws up an error message....are Microsoft trying to make it as hard as possible to contact them about user issues ??? !!!</p>

<p>The microsoft chat assistant was no help at all really. She just said that i would be able to try several times to recover my account but alas, to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do get the opinion that microsoft don't really care whether anybody loses their account through no fault of their own as on my last attempt to recover the account, I got an email saying that it would be better for me to open a new one !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fair enough, like I said I don't mind opening a new account and letting my contacts/companies know this but I still won't get access to my raft of emails that are still in my old account :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there are people at microsoft that can access this info ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really poor, it honestly is.</p>

<p>UNBELIEVABLE !!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just received another email from microsoft telling me that my other account, that I used to just use as an alias with all mails being forwarded to the account I've been locked out of is also now apparently being used by someone else !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I give up, I really do. How the hell can I answer the question about emails and subject lines on that account when it's NEVER been used to compose and send email ???????</p>
<p>
</p><p>No replies from any Microsoft techs on this subject also tells me that nobody in that company gives a toss about the people who pay their wages by buying their products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To RobMarsh......I would start looking at other products if I were you mate as it looks like microsoft are going to implode.</p>

 You could also check in Word's temp folder (typically somewhere like C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Local\Temp), for files with the .tmp extension.&nbsp;Simply changing&nbsp;a&nbsp;tmp file's extension to doc/docx/docm, as applicable, might allow Word to open it.</p>

            <p>Exactly how are you trying to open this file. Are you using the file name in the Recent list, or are you double clicking on it somewhere?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of looking for it in Word, use Windows File Explorer. Can you see the file name `on the drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally if you had the problem that Palcouk mentioned, not using the save remove function, part of the file would be still be present on the USB drive. Word would try to open it but report a problem.

</p><p>&lt;edit&gt;</p>
<p>Paul made a valid point.&nbsp; </p>
<p>USB is a connector type for plugging in external devices.&nbsp; For this discussion there are 2 types of USB connected file storage devices. The original "Thumb/Flash" drives and relatively newer spinning disk drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thumb drives are those physically small, thumb sized, drives that use "flash" memory.&nbsp; The started out as KB of storage and now are up to (insanely huge) 256GB. Flash memory has a limited number of write cycles and it consists of "blocks" that have a technological
 limit that the block must be written all at once. So Windows protects that limited write life. Windows does that by temporarily storing written files in a "cache" on the local drive. It only writes out to the flash drive when it has a a full 'block' (or blocks)
 to write all at once or you close the file.&nbsp; If you don't "flush" the cache before unplugging the drive you can potentially (not always) leave part of the file behind on the HD.&nbsp; And unfortunately, the way DOCX files are physically ordered/structured, the
 actual text is in the part of the file that gets left behind.</p>
<br />
<p>Spinning disk drives are "traditional" disk drives that have been shrunk in size and put into a portable box that uses a USB connection to the computer. They don't have any any special read/write requirements other than making sure you don't pull the plug
 while the write is actually happening (and don't bang them around while they are spinning)</p>
<p>&lt;/edit&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some tips for the future, to reduce the chance of this problem re-occurring.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;edit&gt;</p>
<p>#0 ALWAYS use "Safely Remove" before unplugging Flash/Thumb drives </p>
<p><a href="http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-7/how-to-safely-remove-hardware-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-7/how-to-safely-remove-hardware-in-windows-7/</a>
</p>
<p>&lt;/edit&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 USB "Flash"/thumb drives are flakey!&nbsp; They will work fine, until they don't. So DON'T TRUST THEM with the only copy of important files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 ALWAYS copy the file to the local hard drive to edit it. NEVER edit directly on a thumb drive!</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 When you are done, copy from the local drive to the USB. LEAVE the copy behind on the local drive. That way, if (WHEN) the USB carps out (or you lose it, or whatever) you still have a recent copy of the file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 If it is a really important, make (frequent) periodic copies of the file so that you have multiple generations of backups.&nbsp; Either use "Save As", or make copies in File Explorer.

            IMHO, your 'tips' grossly exaggerate the problem and fail to differentiate between USB device types on the one hand and user/software issues on the other. If you pay attention, you'll also see the OP referred to the files being on a
<em>portable hard drive</em>, not a flash drive. Motherhood statements like "They will work fine, until they don't" help no-one; the same can be said of any piece of hardware or software. Editing files on USB&nbsp;flash drives &amp; hard drives&nbsp;is fine, provided one
 also goes through the 'safe removal' process - and even your #3 ignores that step entirely. As for #4, have you never heard of Windows Backup?

<p>
</p><p>Personally, I'm still old-school enough to primarily think of "windows backup" as the system type backups. I've tried FileHistory, but not had much luck with it.
</p>
And frankly I forgot all about the return of RPV in Win 10.&nbsp; But Win 10 RPV depends on File History, which requires the user to setup an external drive explicitly for file history, and how likely is that to happen?
<br />
<p>
</p><p>Question: do you know if file write cacheing in Win applies only to "flash" type external memory or all USB connected storage?&nbsp; I've always assumed it was specific to flash memory (identified by the OS in the background) only.

<p>The point is, your rabbiting-on about flash drives is totally irrelevant to the subject matter of this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Windows Backup, I suggest you look in the Control Panel. Unlike the File History, you can use Windows Backup to easily create a backup of almost anything on a hard drive. File History, by comparison, only backs up files in&nbsp;a user account's libraries.</p>

    <title>Project Server - Non-working days in Enterprise Resource Calendars not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nick thomson &#40;nick.thomson&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Project Server - Non-working days in Enterprise Resource Calendars not appearing in Enterprise Projects</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for some advice/review of best practice to help me troubleshoot a problem our organisation is having.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem: When adding non-working days to Enterprise calendars, these are frequently (but not always) NOT appearing in the Enterprise Project where the resource is question is assigned to a task. E.g, an Enterprise resource has a 'non working' in their specific
 calendar, and their calendar is derived from a 'Standard' company Base Calendar. However, when I assign a task in a project, the task length will usually not extend to accommodate for the holiday. In some cases 2 tasks in the same project file will behave
 differently with one factoring in the holiday, and one not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What we've tried so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing the Enterprise resource calendar through 'resources', select resource, 'Open', 'Change working time', then saving and checking in the resource.</li><li>Adding a new task in the Enterprise Project with the affected Enterprise resource assigned. Saving, publishing and checking in the file, then re-opening.</li><li>Validating the times are the same viewing the schedule in Pwa and in Project desktop.</li><li>Clearing the cache in Project Desktop.</li></ul>
<p>Thoughts about potential causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do holidays have to be added either before or after all project tasks are inserted in order to take effect?</li><li>Is there a setting somewhere we are missing.</li><li>Should there be a sequence of updating resources, does it matter if other people in the organisation have projects checked out where they are assigned as a resource?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance for your help.</p>
<p>Nick</p>

<p>Hi Neha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the follow-up. I managed to resolve this by changing the tasks type to 'fixed unit' whereas previously they were all 'fixed duration'. The holidays are now displaying properly. I'm not sure why tasks were defaulting in all newly created projects
 to 'fixed duration' when previously managing projects using Project desktop they had all been fixed units. I can't find an enterprise setting in Project Online to change this default so have just asked everyone to change it locally 'all new projects' under
 'Options', 'Schedule' in Project desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Nick</p>

<p>Hi Michael, (and Heya Jack!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installation of FlashThemes is pretty much the same as most PocketPC (WM 6.0 Professional these days) software.&nbsp; Here's a quick guide:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Connect your phone to your PC through ActiveSync</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Ensure you have installled Macromedia Flash 6.0, available from here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flash/pocket_pc/ppc_installers/install_fp6_ppcax_en.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flash/pocket_pc/ppc_installers/install_fp6_ppcax_en.exe</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download to your PC desktop and double-click the file and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Open the zip file you downloaded for FlashThemes and pull out the file called "FlashThemes_Player_(v3.0)_Setup.exe", put this on your PC Desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Double-click the file and follow the install instructions, first from your PC and then you should see confirmation on your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. The installation installs FlashThemes Player and one theme (FT-2K7Plane).&nbsp; The other 11 themes are in the original zip file and you just need to choose the ones you want (or all of them if you prefer) and copy them "as-is" to your phone's
 Windows or My Documents folder.&nbsp; You can also put them on a storage card&nbsp; if you want to save the phone memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. To run FlashThemes, change your theme in the normal way: Select Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;Today and select a FlashThemes theme (FT-2K7Plane for example).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. One caveat with FlashThemes 2007 is that it will make sure that the animation is sized to fit the amount of space on your Today Screen (at the bottom).&nbsp; This ensures that the themes will work on any screen layout, being, portrait, landscape
 or square.&nbsp; This also means that if you have lots and lots of Today Screen plugins on your screen taking up space the movie will resize to fit.&nbsp; However, if there is less than 20 pixels of space left at the bottom of the screen then FlashThemes hides itself
 as there's really not enough room to show the movie.&nbsp; The answer to this is to make sure you have enough room on the Today Screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really hope this helps - I know that the TytnII with WM 6.0 is compatible - I've seen it running on one (I had one) and there are 100s of users who have it also.</p>

    <title>EMET 5.51, Windows 7 x64 and Outlook 2016 - December Click-2-Run - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pete az  say:</h3>
<h2>            EMET 5.51, Windows 7 x64 and Outlook 2016 - December Click-2-Run update conflicts with EMET</h2>
                    <p>Since early December I've had Outlook stop working three times. I went through all the troubleshooting steps: new profile, repair, uninstall/reinstall, and so on. The first time the uninstall/reinstall worked. The second time removing Office and installing
 with offline media seemed to work. The third time I determined what appears to be the actual cause of the issue: a conflict in the December Office update with the EMET. Unfortunately I cannot seem to prevent that update from happening eventually because of
 C2R, and then when it does... Outlook won't launch again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get around the issue, I added exceptions in EMET.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, I have added exceptions for Outlook.exe, OfficeClickToRun.exe, and OfficeC2RClient.exe in EMET with all selections cleared. Even with these settings, the first launch of Outlook still fails - I have to kill it in task manager, and then the
 second try will actually launch Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else run into issues with C2R/Outlook and the December Office update? Is there a way to configure EMET so Outlook will launch successfully the first time? Is there a particular Office update that I can block to prevent this Microsoft breakage?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that EMET has been installed for years before the December C2R update without having any issues with Outlook, so the issue here is in C2R/Outlook and not EMET.</p>

<h2>            Cannot save email to folder</h2>
                    <p>I recently changed from an IMAP mail system to Microsoft Exchange and can no longer save emails to a folder that I had created named "Saved Mail".</p>
<p>This worked fine with IMAP, and POP3, but&nbsp;no longer works.&nbsp; I am running Outlook 2010 on the MS-7 operating system.&nbsp; Anyone know how to fix this?</p>

<h2>            Defender Cannot Remove Trojan&#58;Win32&#47;Kovter.A&#33;lnk -- HELP</h2>
                    <p>Help! I have Windows Defender and Malware Bytes (free version) on my laptop -- using Windows 10. MB doesn't find any threats, but Defender pops up with a notice saying it found the virus "Trojan:Win32/Kovter.A!Ink" on my computer. In the summary of threats
 page, it says "0," as if it removed the trojan. But in the scan history, it lists the trojan and has an alert that indicates Defender failed to remove it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have scanned multiple times. Tried to remove and quarantine multiple times. Defender is unsuccessful, MB does not even see it. Tried using Windows Defender Offline, but the program doesn't really do anything -- no alerts or scan results once it is done
 restarting.&nbsp;I even tried to locate the file holding the virus based on where Defender says it's located, cannot find it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read up on this virus, and it's bad news. How do I get rid of it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. I did the first part -- deleting certain files and cleaning caches. However, the second suggestion, a link to "How to remove...", looks like just a series of links to different security/malware programs. IE: an advertisement, as opposed
 to a solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Track Changes in Excel 2016 is missing... Help &#62;_&#60;</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi, everyone.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>I’m using Office 2016 ProPlus, and I’ve already update it to the latest version. The details are as the photo below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d696b66-f86d-4315-8e99-030b7cf4cfae?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d696b66-f86d-4315-8e99-030b7cf4cfae?upload=true" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>What I’m focusing right now is the feature call
<strong>“Track changes”</strong> in Excel 2016 which should be found under <strong>
Review </strong>tab, but the problem is they’re missing for some reason. &gt;_&lt;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And here’s screenshots of my Excel
<strong>Review </strong>tab and <strong>Customized Ribbon</strong> window.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cac632fc-c30d-4147-a183-ed07adeba2ca?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cac632fc-c30d-4147-a183-ed07adeba2ca?upload=true" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/321ba4c1-6b7e-485e-a407-f8b13ad9ed2f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/321ba4c1-6b7e-485e-a407-f8b13ad9ed2f?upload=true" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>But, in Word 2016, I got Track Changes... right there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62655674-bd26-4289-b8db-a277120b650a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62655674-bd26-4289-b8db-a277120b650a?upload=true" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>Most strange part is, I have a friend who is still using probably the very-1st version of Office 2016, here’s his version of Office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cedc313c-3704-490b-ac01-48044adb9369?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cedc313c-3704-490b-ac01-48044adb9369?upload=true" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And he got this feature right under review tab... it doesn’t make any sense!</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Please help. Thanks for any response.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>PS: Sorry if I made some grammar mistake.</span></p>

<p>Finally I've&nbsp; figure it out by myself after 2 hours research...</p>
<p>
</p><p>looks like in the latest version of Office 2016, Microsoft just removed the Track Changes feature... So, you have to add-on this feature manually from Quick Access Toolbar - Track Changes (Legacy).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I've noticed that Track Changes feature would be able to track only text changes, formatting changes are NOT included , which is I need to be tracked exactly .... &gt;_&lt; sad face...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that's probably the reason that Microsoft just removed it .... probably only ...</p>

<p>Pressing the key combination you listed simply tells you what version of the firmware you currently have installed. It does not update it. To update the firmware you need to connect your phone to a computer that has either the Nokia Software Suite or Ovi
 Suite installed, and then run the updater. This will download the update to your computer and then install it on the phone. AFAIK you can't update the E71 firmware directly 'over the air'. You need to do it via the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Re your gallery problem, what sized memory card do you have and how many images are in the gallery? If your memory card is large, it can take a while for the gallery to scan it for updates. Not really sure what you can do about this. Once all media files
 have been indexed it should open quicker, though.</p>

<p>The Nokia Software Updater (NSU) comes with Nokia PC Suite (or Ovi Suite):</p>

<p>As Windows 8 is not yet a released product yet, the software support in the abobe products might not be there yet, either, for Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See if Windows 8 has some "compatibility" mode that allows the apps to work, if they otherwise refuse to install. Otherwise, you presumably need to wait for Nokia to release new/updated versions of the Nokia Suite (might happen only after Microsoft releases
 Windows 8).</p>

            Click on the ¶ Button on the Standard toolbar.<br />
<br />
see if you can see three ¶'s if so you can highlight them and remove two of them<br />
you will have to just hit delete key to delete the last.<br />
<br />
If you see none or just one the you have line spacing set to 1.5 or double space which will appear as though you have hit ¶ more than once.

Close the document, save if prompted and reopen it. That should clear the problem.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The easiest thing is probably to download the ISO for the new build 10162...</p>
<p>I think it was just released yesterday...</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You don't even need to burn it to a DVD...</p>
<p>If you are doing a upgrade, and not a clean install, you can just run the ISO...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you don't have a program like WinZip to EXTRACT the ISO to a folder and run "SETUP", 7-Zip has a free program that will do this....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>OR... you can right click on the file and select at the top of the menu....</p>
<p>"Load into a new Emulated drive"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>OR... you can install the free "Virtual Clone Drive" from SlySoft, which will allow you to open the ISO file and run "SETUP" just like installing any other program...</p>
        </p>

            <p>I don't have the next preview in the updates too. I'm using a microsoft account, but i'm trying to change security info on this account (and wait 30 days) because it was based on an email that does not exists anymore... so maybe thats why i don't see build
 updates (though in the "Fast" ring)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But i've also tried to run this 10130-&gt;10162 upgrade using the ISO</p>
<p>---&gt; installation runs up to 71% also , then reboots , then try to restart indefinitely. Have to reset, it restarts using 10130 build and give me an error message saying that installation failed at the second reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm posting this as a feedback , and to check if i'm alone in this situation</p>
<p>(if there is a tip for a solution, i would be glad of course : i would love being able to have a build upgrade, hoping for some fixes about USB)</p>

            <p>i managed to upgrade to 10162 , by disconnecting all unnecessary peripherals (logitech mouse, 2nd screen using VGA port of the motherboard, USB, etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>unfortunately , as i linked my local user account to my MS Account (MSA), i got the "<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_security/critical-error-start-menu-and-cortana-arent/746d57f4-95b0-4c64-be92-2614e8c9584a"><strong>Critical

<p>
</p><p>had to create another user account to work this around</p>
<p>
</p><p>any clue to unlink my user account frome the MSA would be appreciated :p</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>i have to mention that my MSA is currently in the process of changing security info (email)... in case of it would be related.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm glad to hear you were able to get build 10162 installed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't be of much help with unlinking your MSA though... I have never used one to logon to my machine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be that the error and your reconfiguring your MSA is related, but Cortana and Start have had some issues on their own... which I also know little about...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never used Cortana either... I don't feel like wearing a headset or something to use my computer...</p>

<h2>            Running a Make Table and getting a multi AutoNumber error.</h2>
                    <p>I am using ACCESS 2013/2016.&nbsp; I am working on a basketball statistics project.&nbsp; I am working with the points scored each game, and using queries to show each games scoring (by player) for each of 10 games.&nbsp; After getting to the 3rd game's scores, the query
 was getting slow, so I created a 'temporary' table.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; For each game, I need to make 2 queries, one to identify the next game and player (Roster_ID), and the second to then enter the points scored.</p>
<p>Now I have gotten to 9 games, and again the query is running slowly, so I am trying to Make Table again.&nbsp; When I run this (second/18th) query, I get a message:&nbsp; Resultant table not allowed to have more than one AutoNumber field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I find out what ACCESS is thinking is an AutoNumber field?&nbsp; From what I can guess the Roster_ID is my only AutoNumber field being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my first MakeTable query:</p>
<p>SELECT [MjMost_V_Pts_3/4g_v1_Query].Player_ID, [MjMost_V_Pts_3/4g_v1_Query].Roster_ID, [MjMost_V_Pts_3/4g_v1_Query].Name, [MjMost_V_Pts_3/4g_v1_Query].Game_ID, [MjMost_V_Pts_3/4g_v1_Query].Season_ID, [MjMost_V_Pts_3/4g_v1_Query].Next_Seas, [MjMost_V_Pts_3/4g_v1_Query].[Game_#],
 [MjMost_V_Pts_3/4g_v1_Query].[MaxOfGame_#], [MjMost_V_Pts_3/4g_v1_Query].g1_Pts, [MjMost_V_Pts_3/4g_v1_Query].g2_Pts, [MjMost_V_Pts_3/4g_v1_Query].g3_Pts, [MjMost_V_Pts_3/4g_v1_Query].g4_Gnum, [MjMost_V_Pts_3/4g_v1_Query].g4_S, [MjMost_V_Pts_3/4g_v1_Query].g4ID,
 Val(Nz([Roster_Info].[Roster_ID])) AS g4RID INTO JLW_V_Pts_3g<br />
FROM [MjMost_V_Pts_3/4g_v1_Query] INNER JOIN Roster_Info ON ([MjMost_V_Pts_3/4g_v1_Query].g4_S = Roster_Info.Season_Play) AND ([MjMost_V_Pts_3/4g_v1_Query].Player_ID = Roster_Info.Player_ID);<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>and here is my second MakeTable query - the one that has the error message:</p>
<p>SELECT [MjMost_V_Pts_9/10g_v1_Query].Player_ID, [MjMost_V_Pts_9/10g_v1_Query].Roster_ID, [MjMost_V_Pts_9/10g_v1_Query].Season_ID, [MjMost_V_Pts_9/10g_v1_Query].[Game_#], [MjMost_V_Pts_9/10g_v1_Query].[MaxOfGame_#], [MjMost_V_Pts_9/10g_v1_Query].Next_Seas,
 [MjMost_V_Pts_9/10g_v1_Query].Name, [MjMost_V_Pts_9/10g_v1_Query].g1_pts, [MjMost_V_Pts_9/10g_v1_Query].g2_Pts, [MjMost_V_Pts_9/10g_v1_Query].g3_pts, [MjMost_V_Pts_9/10g_v1_Query].g4_Pts, [MjMost_V_Pts_9/10g_v1_Query].g5_Pts, [MjMost_V_Pts_9/10g_v1_Query].g6_Pts,

            <p>You recognized what was causing the problem. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>
<p>I need the G10RID (Game # 10 Roster ID) to find the points scored for game 10.</p>
<p>I removed the G10RID from the query for the MakeTable, and then when I continue I will re-create the G10RID to help me find the points from their 10th game - using the 'temporary' table:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">JLW_V_Pts_9g</span></p>

I currently have the Blackjack II and it's equiped with GPS. I know I would have to pay to use it with TeleNav and I'm wondering could I use it with Live Search? If I could, how much would I have to pay, if any? Thx.

    <title>Microsoft Security Essentials &#40;MSE&#41; disappeared after a failed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials &#40;MSE&#41; disappeared after a failed upgrade via Automatic Updates</h2>
                    <p>On 28-APR-2011, I installed Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) on my Windows 7 Pro computer. All seemed fine. In early Aug 2011, I happened to notice that the MSE icon was missing.
</p>
<p>What the heck is going on?! This is the exact reason that I removed McAfee Total Protection suite to go with Microsoft's trusted solution. I am completely dismayed at the fact this such a crucial and vital piece of software could just disappear without any
 obvious and visible sign or reminder from Microsoft. I'm not talking about the event viewer; the average user doesn't often review such logs .. yet the MSE solution was designed for such the average user.</p>
<p>After searching installed apps, I see that it was indeed removed. A quick search using Event Viewer Application log (filtered by "Microsoft Security Client Setup") reveals that an upgrade was attempted at appro 3am (0300 hours) which indicates Automatic
 Updates was making the attempt. Then, something went wrong and it failed ... leaving my computer COMPLETELY UNPROTECTED. And it's been that way for a week now. Had I not noticed the missing icon, it would have likely been longer. After a week, the delayed
 "Action Center" finally popped up to inform me that I should install an Antivirus solution.
</p>
<p>The event viewer stated the following, albeit burried within the log:</p>
<p>HRESULT:0x80070643<br />
Description:Cannot complete the Security Essentials Upgrade. Security Essentials is not currently monitoring and helping to protect your computer. Please restart your computer and try again.
<br />
Error code:0x80070643. Fatal error during installation.</p>

            <p>Thanks for taking the time to reply with suggested resolutions.&nbsp; While I merely had to download and reinstall it (no other actions were required), my underlying message was to express utter dismay that such a situation could and did occur with a Microsoft
 product that was otherwise intended to replace / out-perform its competitors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, this occurence only proves that Microsoft's Security Essentials tool is neither infallible nor dependable.&nbsp; After all, I went for a week without Antivirus on my computer, due to my false sense of security regarding their product.&nbsp; Never again.</p>
