                    <p>My son has xbox live but was recently reported by 'a friend' and banned from communication, which has now finished. &nbsp;Since this ban, he still cant talk to his friends through his mic. &nbsp;We thought it was his new wireless headset which he got for xmas, but
 he cant even get his old headset to work.</p>
<p>I am wondering if its something to do with his original ban. &nbsp;Can anyone help with this?</p>

<p>Try performing the hard reset EXACTLY like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.&nbsp; Unplug the power
 cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in forums for this issue. Sorry to hear that you're having difficulty with your son's headset/controller combo. If his communication ban has already been lifted, then he should be able to use his headset but it never hurts to
 troubleshoot to ensure that there isn't anything going on with your headset or your controller. We recommend you being with our&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/controllers/wireless-controller-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One Wireless
 Controller Solution</a> to ensure that the issue isn't the controller rather than the headset. The wizard will take you through some different scenarios in order to pinpoint what may be happening. I'm also listing some other troubleshooting articles specific
 to headsets and/or controller steps that may prove helpful as well. </p>

<p>This is a very steady and consistent issue the entire community has been having which in my educated guess seems to be due to short cuts/ cost cutting measures in the manufacturing of the 3.5mm jack housing inside Xbox one controllers and up which becomes
 loose sometimes over very little time at all causing the mic to not work. Support has to be aware of this issue but I have not seen any physical changes in the new one X controllers and don't expect it to be resolved any time soon otherwise most people wouldn't
 have a reason to replace there controllers and would probably end up stagnating contorller sales.</p>

<p>I dont know if this &nbsp;makes any difference but both headsets are just normal earphones, one is wireless with a mic built in, the other has a mic connected. &nbsp;He can hear his friends in the party, but cant speak with either headset. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            You can also buy a 10 dollar piece off of amazon, open up the remote and put it in to keep the audio jack in place. Its just sad to see quality go so down hill since the days of the original xbox.

            Be sure all your chat settings are how you want them. Be sure the headset is connected properly. Then go in to your consoles settings check the power and start-up option select turn off or restart then choose full shut down.&nbsp; Once you restart your console
 try the headset.

Make sure the headset is not muted. To do this, check the mute button on the headset controls. (For a headset, the mute button is on the left side of the connector that is plugged into the expansion port of the controller. For a 3.5-mm chat headset, the mute
 button is a slider button on the front of the audio controls that are in the middle of the headset cable.)</li></ul>

Increase the audio. If you're using a headset plugged into the 3.5-mm port, go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>, choose&nbsp;<strong>Devices &amp; accessories</strong>, and then select your controller and adjust your audio options.</li><li>
Try using a different controller or headset to check for a hardware malfunction.</li><li>

<h2>            Netflix will not load even when connection to Xbox Live is fine</h2>
                    
<p>I have deleted Netflix, power cycled my Xbox One and unplugged all the wires, waited and plugged them back in and then reinstalled Netflix as suggested by the user Miss Diggz of Xbox Support, but after turning the Xbox back on and trying to load a new video
 I still get an error.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This time it says:</p>
<p>Netflix has encountered an error. If the application does not work properly, you may need to restart it.</p>
<p>5025-1090 . 0 </p>

<p>If this is a server problem I understand Xbox will work hard to fix the issue, but is there any other way to fix this problem?

<p>I get that same error message usually after I've watched 1 episode of anything on my list, gotten the 5012-1090.0 error, and tried all the steps you listed. All other videos will work fine but give the same error when the next episode starts I can even stream
 it on my PC or my laptop without having this issue. Most recently trying to watch the 1st episode of Full Metal Alchemist, it stopped loading at 33% activity on the modem stops, then after a minute or so quit to Home. Tried it again stopped at 24%, no activity
 on the modem, etc. Same video plays on everything else using the same router with no problems. Obviously it's the Xbox One app or Xbox itself?</p>

    <title>Transfer Vista to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertspj1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer Vista to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello all. &nbsp;I bought both a new laptop and a pc (mom) running Windows 10. I currently have a laptop and pc, both running Vista. I have most of the old software on CDs, but I keep the programs updated when possible. I back up frequently. I want to transfer
 all docs and install some programs needed to run some of the docs. Can I get your assistance with the current answers to questions I have (without some of the snarky stuff I've seen in some of the other blogs please):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Is there any easier way than copying docs to an external device?</p>
<p>2) Is there a faster way?</p>
<p>3) What about programs like PC Mover Express from Laplinks? Some say it's free, Amazon says $29.99, and one Windows community contributor says it's $100 to make it actually work?</p>
<p>4) Some blogs indicate that though Windows Easy Transfer though not supported in Windows 10 will still work with Windows 10? Is that true/false? Is it an easy, viable option?</p>
<p>5) What about network transfers? What is it and how hard is it?</p>
<p>6) What about backups on hard drives, Dropbox, Norton? If I restore from them on the new computers what will happen to the newer computers pre-installed programs? Will a 'restore' wipe them out? Ex. Running older versions of Office on the older computers
 and the new ones came with office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7) What about transfer cables? Do they work? They look like they are cheap?</p>
<p>8) What about my iPhone and IPad? Do I need to do something special for them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help w my sorta dumb questions is appreciated. Thanks!</p>

            <p>None of your questions are dumb.&nbsp; To the contrary they show you are engaged and eager to get it right.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestion is to read over <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
Clean Install Windows 10</a> and then ask back any questions which arise from it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Wiki in that link has been used by tens of thousands of consumers without a single complaint, is the best install of WIndows one can have in an OS where the quality of the install is
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">everything. </span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>For backup I recommend using an external or another hard drive or flash stick if it's big enough, also uploading your most valuable files to OneDrive which offers 5gb free storage with each MS Account (and more cheap) and keeps your valuables fireproof.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would not use a transfer program because it can fail with loss of files, which need to be backed up anyway using one of the methods in the link.&nbsp; It may also transfer settings which are a corruption path into a new install defeating the purpose of it being
 as Clean as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assure it's Clean follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space then click Next to let the installer auto-format needed partitions and begin.&nbsp; This makes it foolproof.&nbsp;

<p>On my Xbox One home screen I wanted to close the COD Ghost game so I pressed the Start Button and went down to QUIT. The game closed out but now the pop out menu is stuck on my screen and wont go away. I can move the joy stick around and the white box highlights
 my other apps and games in the background so the xbox isn't completely frozen. I unplugged the xbox and waited before turning it back on, but starts right back up to the stupid menu on the home screen. I know its not my TV. Any suggestions? :(</p>

<p>
</p><p>My tablet is a Samsung XE500T1C with Intel Atom processor.</p>
<p>I have set my system so that after sleep, a password must be entered. &nbsp;(This only seems to work when the tablet has been asleep for several minutes, however: &nbsp;if I wake it within a few minutes, I immediately arrive at either the desktop or the start screen.,
 but that is another issue.) &nbsp;The screen where I enter my password has the power control icon (1 inside 0), the network icon, the ease of access icon, my picture, name, MS Acct. email address, and place to enter my password and an arrow to go to the user account
 log in screen, if someone else wants to log in. &nbsp;The battery monitor shows in the lower right corner of my desktop with other chosen indicators, bur not on the lock screen.</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Check at Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and other users for the existence of this or any other accounts you don't claim.  See if you can choose them to delete.  
<br />
<br />Confirm also at Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your Info that you are logged in to the correct account.  
<br />
<br />I would also immediately run a scan for infection and check for system damage from Steps 7 and 11 in this Checklist:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  Then go back and run through the reset of the list to go over the install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If problems persist once you've cleaned up the PC and fixed any broken system files, I'd run a Repair Install which reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files, programs and most settings in place,  by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This will solve most problems and also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            A way to turn off Xbox one and game controller at the same time&#63;</h2>
                    <p>What is this?&nbsp;Only two options, either you turn off a console or a game controller. Why not both at the same time! I'm so tired of long push for the game controller after shutting down xbox. Or, is there something I don't know?</p>

            Hi brucel13 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Till your problem is resolved and you need to do urgent and limited typing, use Onscreen Keyboard - Type OSK in Windows Start Search Box (Cortana) &gt; Click On-Screen Keyboard
<br />
<br />2. Run Keyboard Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down and click Keyboard &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall &amp; reinstall Keyboard Driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Keyboards &gt; Right click on Standard PS/2 Keyboard &gt; Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer to reinstall 
<br />
<br />4: I would recommend that you restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Bruce
<br />
<br />Please check if the Left Arrow on your Keyboard is stuck down . . .
<br />
<br />If that is not the issue: 
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot 
<br />
<br />Run the Keyboard troubleshooter 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this for you 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager 
<br />
<br />Expand the Keyboards section 
<br />
<br />Right click your keyboard and choose 'Uninstall' 
<br />
<br />Then restart your PC
        </p>

            I did all you suggested and still have crazy problem. cursor returns to start after typing 2 or 3 letters . also&nbsp; scroll down with mouse wheel scrolls screen right back up to the top. but up and down arrows correct it for a little while .&nbsp; strangely, I
 noticed this problem happens when the trash icon on desktop is highlighted . I can only type this now because i'm using onscreen keyboard as you suggested . I have done system restore and problem came back when I used edge browser . I need tech help for sure
 or&nbsp; im gonna have to delete edge and go back to chrome . I have done keyboard troubleshoot and uninstall reinstall too. nothing helps .

            Did you unwittingly enable right-to-left typing? Normally, you would do this if you wanted to type in Arabic or Hebrew.

<p>Hi Vinita,</p>

</span>So we can assist you accordingly, we’d like to know the Surface Pro model you are using. When did the issue start?
 What other key(s) on the keyboard is not working as expected? Also, have you attempted any troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue? If yes, can you tell us the steps you have done?</span>

    <title>Default Gateway Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ray de la pena  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default Gateway Error</h2>
                    <p>Ever since the installation of Windows 8.1 my computer has developed an issue with ' Default Gateway Error' propping up every time I watch a live feed on the internet.&nbsp; In my research to try and find a solution to this problem, I came across the suggestion
 to go into the network adapter via the device manager and attempt an update for the adapter. The suggestion given was to change internal adapter to other available adapters listed until the one that worked could be located.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Ralink RT3290 802.11bgn (Ralink Technologies)&nbsp;witch is installed by default on my computer and there are countless WiFi adapters from which to choose. I wish not to get into something that may create a greater problem for me so if I could get a
 bit of guidance on how to proceed it would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some choices given are as follow,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ralink RT3290LE 802.11bgn WiFi Adapter (Ralink Technologies)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ralink RT3592LE 802.11bgn WIFi Adapter (Microsoft)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ralink RT3592 802.11a/b/g/n 2x2 WiFi Adapter (Ralink Tech)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ralink RT3592 802.11a/b/g/n 2x2 WiFi Adapter (Microsoft)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ralink RT3592 802.11a/b/g/n WiFi Adapter (Ralink Tech)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ralink RT3592 802.11a/b/g/n WiFi Adapter (Microsoft)</p>
<p>
</p><p>... and several other choices.&nbsp; How do I began to establish which one will be the right one to help correct the issue with the default gateway error I have been facing for so long?&nbsp; If anyone can offer some assistance, please do.</p>

            <p>Hi Ray, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update on the issue.<br />
By clicking on “yes”, it will install the Ranlink driver. However, it is not a Microsoft product, hence we cannot guarantee about its working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are using Ranlink adaptor, it should work with your system. Since, it’s a third-party driver, we cannot provide any assurance. In case, you face issues, you can always roll-back or upgrade the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also recommend you to contact the manufacturer of the system to know if the driver is genuine or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful.</p>

                    <p>I recently imported new photos into my photos application, and am just wondering why the app has not yet added the faces from the new photos under the people tab. Does it take a certain amount of time for the app to recognize faces in newley imported photos?

<p>Hi Miguel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the link, but my problem isn't that facial recognition was turned off ( I already have many people/ faces recognized) it is that new photos with faces are not being recognzied/ added to the people tab.

<h2>            The printer automatically goes to offline and disconnected.</h2>
                    <p>
Hi,</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
A HP printer automatically goes to offline and disconnected. The printer is connected with a Windows 10 Home laptop.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I did..</p>
<ul>
<li>Printer reset.</li><li>Printer power cycle.</li><li>Replaced printer cable for connecting with laptop.</li><li>Plugged to another USB port of the laptop.</li><li>Uninstalled and reinstalled the printer driver.</li><li>Checked in both connections (wire and wireless).</li></ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
In both cases (wire and wireless) and after reinstalling the driver it works fine for sometimes.</p>
<p>
After sometimes, it goes offline and disconnected automatically. Also it works fine while printing offline files and gets offline and disconnected while printing online docs/ webpages.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Please let me know, how to fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Regards</p>
<p>
InTech</p>

            <p>Yep, same here. Whatever the Windows 10 upgrade did in preparation for reboot rendered a fully functional SSD unreadable in the BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Timeline:</p>
<p>8am - Fully functional Windows 8.1 notifies me that Windows 10 is ready for install. I click install.</p>
<p>8:30am - Windows 10 finishes install routine, reboots.</p>
<p>8:31am - NO BOOT DRIVE DETECTED</p>
<p>8:32am - Go into BIOS. Hard drive is no longer listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently lots of reports of this happening. Wished I'd have known.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: One user suggested opening the computer and unplugging the SATA cable (after turning it off the power/removing the battery) leading to the hard drive for 10 minutes. Then reconnect it, and restart the computer. I tried this and Windows 10 started up
 and finished installation.<br />

            That's not his problem. The problem is that Windows 10 has rendered the drive unreadable to the BIOS, and it can't see it anymore. Therefore, there is no "booting to safe mode" to attempt to fix anything.

            <p>IIam having the same problem.</p>
<p>An update installed itself on Saturday 19th Sept. I turned the machine of for the night once it was complete and had rebooted into windows fully. Then switched it off using the correct power off option in the start menu.</p>
<p>The next morning, out gives me the no boot device found error. I go to the boot device menu (this is where my issue differs from the above) and am actually able to see my hard drive. But i put the recovery flash drive in and it finds it as well after a reboot.
 However neither of these boot the computer.</p>
<p>Having a little computer knowledge, i have a couple Ubuntu flash drives for emergencies. I tried these and both are visible, but do nothing to boot the computer.</p>
<p>When booting, i cannot access the BIOS and an given no option to acres bit device order or any of the normal stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm concerned that the windows update corrupted the uefi or somehow corrupted the BIOS and now I'm left with needing to buy another computer on Microsoft's bill.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANY help would be very much appreciated</p>

<p>So.. my pc has been running smoothly for about 5 months since i built it. &nbsp;So i've had plenty of crashes within the last 2 weeks. Regardless if i'm in a game, movie, browser, just loading... my comp will crash. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The crashes go like this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes it will show some artifacts on screen then reboot </li><li>sometimes it will just reboot </li><li>sometimes it will blue screen and quickly reboot </li><li>sometimes blue screen and freeze. </li></ul>
<div>So far i've updated all drivers for Chipset, Video Card, bios, audio, Lan everything.</div>
<div>Checked the temps in the bios and they are fine.</div>
<div>Checked voltages in bios as well and they're fine.</div>
<div>Swapped out the ram for new ram and it still crashes.</div>
<div>I swapped in a new hard drive as well and did chkdsk on both and they're both fine.</div>
<div><br />

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
See this thread for information on using BlueScreenView, MyEventViewer, and other methods to<br />
troubleshoot BlueScreens - top two answers.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/c675b7b8-795f-474d-a1c4-6b77b3fcd990" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/c675b7b8-795f-474d-a1c4-6b77b3fcd990</a><br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Since this is a custom made system the possible causes might be harder to pin down and certainly<br />
hardware has to be very suspect. Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables<br />
(on both ends) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug.<br />
<strong><br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This error is usually a driver&nbsp;issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though it<br />
could be others.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software issues<br />
can also cause the error. When you get to the driver section of the troubleshooter use my generic<br />
methods in the next message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed. <br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel - Windows<br />
Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-<br />
spyware/security programs.<br />
<br />
When you get to the driver and memory sections of the troubleshooter refer to the next message to<br />
update drivers and test memory and then refer back to the troubleshooter if needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 7E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0x0000007E&nbsp; which is also 0x1000007E</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To<br />
interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the <em>Ntstatus.h </em>file that is located in the<em>inc</em> directory of<br />
the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
Resolving the Problem
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enough disk space. </li><li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the</li><li>manufacturer for driver updates. </li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p><em>If you plan to debug this problem</em>, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2<br />
(the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system<br />
was started with the <strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly,<br />
make sure that a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the <strong>
/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame supplies additional information.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware that is installed is listed in the</li><li>Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List. </li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be</li><li>responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts,</li><li>and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error. </li></ul>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable<br />
or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup<br />
sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe<br />
Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process<br />
in Safe Mode, you must start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote<br />
control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the computer<br />
by using the Recovery Console and then deleting the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the<br />
device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.</p>
<p>You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS might to try to resolve the error. You should also<br />
run hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies.<br />
For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or<br />
after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system<br />
BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows installation that are associated with lack of disk<br />
space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary<br />
files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and<em>.chk</em>files that<br />
contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more<br />
free space for the installation. You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version.<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info<br />
that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error<br />
information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />

BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

<h2>            Power problems&#58; computer shuts off when power cord is unplugged.</h2>
                    <p>original title: Power problems: computer **** off when power cord is unplugged.</p>
<p>I have a HP Pavilion dv2000</p>
<p>windows vista home premium/sp2</p>
<p>AMD Turion(tm) 64/2 1.80ghz processor</p>
<p>1GB memory</p>
<p>32bit Operating System</p>
<p>I have 2 issues with this laptop.</p>
<p>!.I lost the powercord and bought a cheap one online (Model:PA 1650-02c. input 100-240v&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.5a(1,5A)&nbsp; out put 18.5V=3.5a)</p>
<p>When i first plugg the cord the battery charging indicator light came on steady, then it started to come on and off.</p>
<p>now its completely off, even with the powercord plugged. on the bottom right corner of the screen its showing that the cord is connected to power and the battery is fully charged but as soon as i remove or unplugg the powercord the computer cuts off right
 away.</p>
<p>the second issue is that the left mouse botton does not work, the right side work fine. i went in the proprties to switch it to right hand click but that does not work either. i updated the drivers but still nothing.</p>
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>aloum,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What type of mouse are you using?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does the left mouse button appear to be stuck or it doesn't respond to the click? Does this happen only with certain applications?
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Test the mouse on another computer or test a different mouse on the computer</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To determine whether the mouse or the computer is defective, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Test the mouse in question on a system that you know is working. If the problem appears to follow the mouse, you may have to return or replace the mouse.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Test a mouse that you know is working on the computer in question. If the problem appears to remain on the computer, then the problem is most likely software-related.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Regarding battery not holding the charge</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Battery problems are often related to the battery itself. If you're experiencing this problem, contact your mobile PC manufacturer. If you purchased the battery separately from the
 mobile PC, contact the battery manufacturer.</span></p>

=========================================<br />
If you sort the photos and select all...you can right click / rename<br />
the first photo Birthday Party (10001)... and press enter...<br />
the remaining photos will be renamed in sequence.&nbsp;They should<br />
stay in order on the DVD.<br />
