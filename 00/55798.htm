<h2>            need magnifier,   don&#39;t like or want aero......Vegas</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am&nbsp; an old guy still using windows seven. &lt;g&gt;&nbsp; I need to use the windows magnifier now , but it is rather&nbsp; clunky unless I&nbsp; turn on AERO to use&nbsp; its features and ease of use. Its an app for the handicapped, but I have to blow away my task bar and color
 it like the Vegas strip in order to use it? :-)&nbsp; Ugly and awful colors, inmo. black is horrid on the desktop. for years grey was accepted, with sharp edges, and a simple look.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AERO makes it hard to use, rounds off the icons, colors them like bubblegum
 candy&nbsp; or M&amp;M's&nbsp; , does not give me a place to "right click" and ends the "box area " on the&nbsp; far right where the&nbsp; speakr, internte and various sys apps resided out of harms way.&nbsp; There seems no place "grab" the task bar and move it to the side or the top.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;when I get lucky and get&nbsp; the bar on the right, its impossible to find a point in the vertical layouto grab it and return it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't care for the look, icons I used for decades are different and more difficult&nbsp; to find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as a result, in order to get the full functionality from magnifier, I can't see my task bar icons....&nbsp; how can I have a classic windows task bar and start button and use magnifier with the lens, unlocked, and all options?&nbsp; &nbsp;I cannot see the screen well,
 and as a result I can't use the taskbar as I did. I thought ease of access was a Microsoft method of respecting the ADA...&nbsp; this is disappointing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>any suggestions or pointers are appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

<span>Just as the subject line states :need magnifier, don't like or want aero:</span><br />
<span><br />
</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;you misread&nbsp; my question, or I posted it poorly :-)</span><br />
<span><br />
</span><br />
<span>the manifier has useful settings, for&nbsp; for those of us who are vision impaired Lens, full screen, and docked make it very useful and simple.&nbsp; I have been stuggling with basic, docked in a classic win 7&nbsp; therme which gives me a 'classic'
 taskbar used for decades..., but the useful settings are locked out unless it is an aero theme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>As noted on the link you posted, those options are not available unless I use an AERO theme, and using an AERO theme forces me to have a taskbar I not only just do not like, I cannot use it.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span><br />
</span><br />
<span>I really,&nbsp;</span><span> I know how to choose themes in win 7, I just am looking for a method that will give me a useful taskbar when I want to use the full function set&nbsp; of the magnifier. I probably
 don't need to re-visit my reason for being unable to use the AERO taskbar,&nbsp; but.......</span><br />
<span><br />
</span><br />
<span>The magnifier is supposed to assist the vision impaired, but it absolutely requires AERO, which gives me a taskbar&nbsp; I cannot see well enough to use. the taskbar in any AREO theme has all icons scrunched together, is unviewble to
 me because it is just a "mush" of distracting colors, and&nbsp; requires impossible pinpoint accuracy to find a "place" to right click for those apps. there is simply no room between app icons.</span><br />
<span><br />
</span><br />
<span>I often see "addons" that purport to let me customize the taskbar, but they are all ... well...... trash.. :-)&nbsp; yesterday I tried 'clasic shell" just because I will try anything, right or&nbsp; wrong to use the magnifier, :-)&nbsp; and it
 is a virus that forced on&nbsp; my screensaver slide show and inserted a desktop "skull and cross bones" with a nasy sound and&nbsp; image, and locked my desktop when its "turn" came&nbsp; around....&nbsp; &nbsp; I understand, caveat emptor, its the internet, and many children like
 find ways to to pass around viruses,so I am loathe to use add-ons, whch is why I am here.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span><br />
</span><br />
<span><br />
</span><br />
<span>is there anyway to adjust the&nbsp; look of taskbar from AERO theme to give back the classic, grey, chiseled taskbar that also has a launch toolbar on the far right? so many years the audio, app, and several added pps have 'lived' right
 there. AERO says "no more"&nbsp; bummer. "-(</span><br />
<span><br />
</span><br />
<span>grateful for any direction, or suggestion.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you,</span></p>
<p><span>John</span></p>

            <span>&nbsp;it seems you do not know how to use the magnifier, and you did not even read the link you gave&nbsp; as a solution.</span><br />
<span><br />
</span><br />
<span><br />
</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;a direct quote from one of the links tossed out as a solution to my question&nbsp;</span><br />
<span><br />
</span><br />
<span>"Full-screen mode and lens mode are only available as part of the Aero experience. If your computer doesn't support Aero, or if you're not using an Aero theme, Magnifier will only work in docked mode."</span><br />
<span><br />
</span><br />
<span>&nbsp; https://www.groovypost.com/howto/microsoft/windows-7/customize-windows-7-taskbar-classic-xp/&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;is useless because the only way to customize the toolbar is to use an AERO theme.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br />
<span><br />
</span><br />
<span>thanks, but my issue is I have trouble using the aero theme tool bar, and hoped to find a way to customize it&nbsp; and have the clasic chiseled look and the classic start button. the aero taskbar is really junky looking, overly colored,
 and the icons are too close together,&nbsp; I like having the launch bar found in every windows version since 95.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span><br />
</span><br />
<span>I thank you for your time. I know its not your fault that microsoft continues to force me to change my workstation and work habits. :-( nothing personal, but microsoft looks like sweethearts by providing the disabled a good tool,
 but those who sing M$ praises&nbsp; for honoring&nbsp; the ADA,&nbsp; are unaware that if&nbsp; &nbsp;those who are nearly blind want to use the magnifier, and its useful options, we have no choice but to use AERO., and many of our older, useful&nbsp; systems ill not allow aero. microsoft
 is telling the disabled that they must buy new computers. we are used to that attitude, but its still hard to accept.&nbsp; if I load a non-AERO theme, the magnifier makes using the win 7 system a breeze and a pleasure to see the display,&nbsp; But I cannot use AERO,
 so no magnifier assistance.......&nbsp; just a bummer, that's all</span><br />
<span><br />
</span><br />

<p>&nbsp;why do you make this so difficult?&nbsp; &nbsp;don't tell me how to use themes, please?&nbsp; &nbsp;I seek anyone who knows how to turn the aero taskbar into the classic&nbsp; 'chisled' look because Microsoft has provided the tool I need to use my computer, but they hold a gun
 to my head, and declare " you will use AERO!"&nbsp; but AERO is a memory and CPU hog that tasks my cpu, and is ugly. my limited vision keeps me from seeing the icons on the AERO taskbar.&nbsp; ther is just to much useless&nbsp; 'confusion'/color and the icons are soo close
 together that&nbsp; &nbsp;I cannot even&nbsp; find&nbsp; place to right click if I need the task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>the bottom line is that I cannot use an AERO theme. I need the magnifier, and cannot use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>lots of windows users know of "little apps" that allow customizing of features and I&nbsp; figured to ask if anyone on the earth knows how to edit an AERO taskbar so I can use my computer with impaired vision.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I hate asking for help because the reply is always someone talking down to me, questioning my intelligence and understanding of windows, asking unrelated questions about my system. When I came here I clearly asked&nbsp; "need magnifier, don't like or want aero"
 and kind folks lectured me on what magnifier is, and how to install a theme......</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;it seems that the&nbsp; experts don't know how to use magnifier, do&nbsp; not know that magnifier and all it excellent feature&nbsp; only works if I use an AERO Theme??&nbsp; hence the search for a 'tweak' so I can use magnifier and see my taskbar</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;just admit you have no idea and we will not spend more time waiting for an answer you do not have. I am mostly blind and just want to use the windows taskbar I used in 1993, I don't need or want and an LSD&nbsp; tip into colorforms land</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not your fault that once again Gates has screwed&nbsp; the disabled in his quest for another $billiion.&nbsp; &nbsp;I dare not upgrade to v10 in hopes I can use magnifier in a classic them, as most likely AERO will stull be the only way the blind can use a windos
 pc.. sory.....&nbsp; its just a damn shame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a great week.. :-)</p>

In addition to the steps suggested already, I'd recommend you run the DirectX Troubleshooter which you can access as follows:<br />
<ol>
<li>Go to Start, then Run (<i>hit Windows key + R if you can't see "Run" on the Start menu</i>) and copy/paste the following and then click OK:
<b>dxdiag</b></li><li>After the animation finishes loading, click the "<b>Sound</b>" tab and then click the "<b>Test Direct Sound</b>" button and respond to the prompts accordingly.</li><li>If you still don't hear anything, click the "<b>Music</b>" tab and try testing each port. By "port" I mean the options available to you which you should be able to see in the list.</li><li>If the above results remain negative, click the "More Help" tab and then click the "Sound" button.

<p>In the event that it doesn't, you can try using System Restore to wind back the clock to a time when you know the PC was working properly, To run System Restore, do the following:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Click Start | Programs | Accessories | System Tools | System Restore.</li><li>Click the option: "<b>Restore my computer to an earlier time</b>" and then click
<b>Next</b>. You'll get a calendar with a number of Restore Points which appear in
<b>bold </b>type. Choose one where you know audio was working properly.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>System Restore takes a few minutes to run during which time the PC will reboot. Don't interrupt this cycle. When the PC reboots, it will load the System Restore menu where you'll see a message as to whether the restore was successful or not. Click OK to
 boot to the desktop and then try and play something to verify whether audio is now working.<br />
<br />
Be aware that when you run System Restore, any programs you installed after the date you choose to restore to will have to be reinstalled again. The same goes for antivirus updates and security patches.<br />

<h2>            Lego Dimensions - Load Corrupted</h2>
                    
<p>We have had to start the game over now for the 3rd time. First 2 were because the save said corrupted, now it is telling us Load Corrupted. I have gone into the system and none of the files even when it said save corrupted have ever had the yellow ! on them.</p>
<p><br />
Is there a work around for the load corrupted? </p>

<p>Forgot to mention the corruptions showed up when the game froze and we had to restart the xbox. This was all on a 360S with 60GB hard drive.</p>

<p>Is that how much space left is in the hard drive or did you buy the hard drive with 60GB of space?</p>
<p>Try removing the hard drive from the console and running the game back without the hard drive. See if it's the hard drive causing the issue.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, maybe it is the disc. Let me know what happens after the first solution.</p>

<p>It is the 60GB HD, I was backing up to a USB, so that save file says load corrupted too since I didn't know anything was wrong with the file. The HD had 48GB open on it. I tried all of the following:</p>
<p>Clear system cashe</p>
<p>clear game cache</p>
<p>deleting the game files and reinstalling</p>
<p>we have received a warranty replacement disc, still froze and corrupted something</p>
<p>Now it was an xbox 360S, it was used from GameStop (purchased 2 years ago) - so I just don't know if that had anything to do with it. But it had plenty of HD space to work with.
</p>
<p>We "upgraded" slightly to the xbox360E with an external HD (500GB) and installed the game to no avail. Still says load corrupted, but the save file looks fine. &nbsp;Knock on wood it has not frozen on the new system during game play yet, but my son just started
 (this is hard on a kid with special needs that loves his legos, KWIM?)</p>

<p>You've tried removing the hard drive and running the game and it still freezes at that point? I would've figured it was the hard drive causing that issue? You mention your saves are backed up with a USB and you tried it with it connected to the USB?</p>
<p>Could you try it on another Xbox 360 if possible?</p>
<p>Also try making another save file to see if the problem still persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also sounds like your hard drive for your 360 is illegitimate; Xbox 360 S and E hard drives should be a minimum of 250 or 500GB of space. This doesn't apply to external hard drives, however.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The spot it freezes at is not the same - it was unpredictable. Never the same spot twice but always while saving.
</p>
<p>I have tried loading from the USB, still load corrupted</p>
<p>I have tried on the new Xbox 360E we just bought</p>
<p>We have just started a new save and so far only through the 1st level - no issues yet (but was 86% finished on the corrupted load)</p>
<p>The hard drive for the xbox 360S is the external clip on - it is legit as far as I can tell - the xbox 360S only has 4gb on it built in as does the 360E we just got, I have a 500GB external HD connected to it.</p>

<p>The 500GB would be a legitimate hard drive on the E or S.</p>
<p>If nothing happens then, it must be the hard drive or something. You may also need to format the USB again in case. Apologies for this issue.</p>
<p>Did the same happen on the E (either with the USB save or by itself?)</p>

<h2>            Best Free Antivirus</h2>
                    
<p>My Fiancée is running Vista Home basic SP1 on a Compaq Presario CQ50 Notebook, and I want her to run a better free Antivirus.</p>
<p>Right now she is running AVG, Malwarebytes and Superantispyware.</p>
<p>I want something that is going to DELETE her viruses, NOT <em>VAULT</em> them, like AVG.</p>
<p>Now I've heard MSE is pretty good. I don't like defender, I've read about WAY too many bugs on it, but I was wondering about other free Antivirus, like Avira and Avast or any other Free antivirus.</p>
<p>So, If you could I would like you to post the best free Antivirus that DELETES viruses, AND is compatible with Malwarebytes and Superantispyware.</p>
<p>Thanks for the time.</p>

<p>Malawarebytes and Superantispyware are both malware/spyware scanning apps &amp; I wouldnt expect them to conflict with any mainstream AV, unless perhaps you have the paid for versions and are configured for auto scanning.</p>
<p>MSE has had some good reports, its added advantage is that it can be installed in conjunction with many mainstream AV's</p>
<p>PS despite from time to time visiting sites I should'nt I cannot remember the last time any spyware app detected anything nasty, in fact I only scan for spyware about once a month, if I remember. My AV very very occasionally detects/removes an infected email</p>
<p>Avast is often reccomended</p>

<p>In general, what action your AV product takes is selectable by you.&nbsp; Putting a suspect file into a vault or deleting it is normally a choice in the configuration of the product.&nbsp; That said, I prefer and recommend Microsoft Security Essentials for keeping
 the computers in my home safe.</p>

<p>Defender is not an anti-virus. It's anti-spyware.</p>

<p>Here's my standard advice:</p>
<p>For an anti-virus program, I recommend eSet NOD32, if you are willing<br />
to pay for it. If you want a free anti-virus, I recommend one&nbsp; (only<br />
one; never install more than one) of the following three:</p>
<p>Avira<br />
Avast<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials</p>
<p>You also need anti-spyware software. I recommend that you download and<br />
install (both freeware) MalwareBytes AntiMalware <strong>and</strong><br />
SuperAntiSpyware. </p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend :&nbsp;(These are all Free Versions and very effective.)
<p>Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and<br />
Network running.</p>
<p>Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free</p>
<p>Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)</p>
<p>IE - Protected Mode</p>
<p>IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)</p>
<p>I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 5.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 5.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</span></a><br />
<br />
Avast 4.8x&nbsp;- Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate&nbsp;those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4</span></a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp</span></a>&nbsp; &lt;-- download<br />
<br />
PCmag - Prevx - Editor'a Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a></p>
<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p>There is more than one way to make your choice, but as far as I'm<br />

No rebooting is a normal process. Lot better than having malware.<br />

    <title>Paint 3D automatically enlarges original picture size after saving - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eujinnw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Paint 3D automatically enlarges original picture size after saving using the &#34;save as&#34; function</h2>
                    <p>Very frustrated. I usually use MS Paint but thought to try out Paint 3D as it is more modern and allows me to rotate selected images to exact angles (In MS Paint you can only rotate images by 90' per rotation and therefore are limited to 90', 180', 270').</p>
<p>
</p><p>My original image size was 19.41cm X 28.48cm (scanned A4 hand drawn image, size confirmed in MS Paint).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After editing the file in Paint 3D and saving it as a .png file, the image is automatically resized by Paint 3D by about 6x to 121.27cm X 177.9cm</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is messing with my printing significantly as I need the image size to be printed exactly as per the original image (A4).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand your concern, the option to resize the image is available on paint 3D. I suggest you to resize the image before proceeding with the printing option and check
 if that helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do that,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open the image that you are trying to print on paint 3D.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
<strong>Canvas</strong> option.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Check mark
<strong>Lock aspect ratio</strong> and <strong>Resize image with canvas</strong> options.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now select the preferred size under
<strong>Width</strong> and <strong>Height</strong> options.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Save the image.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can now try to print the image and check if you are able to print the image according to your requirement. You can refer the following article on
<strong><span style="color: rgba(95, 94, 94, 1)"><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/04/17/windows-10-tip-five-ways-get-started-paint-3d/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 Tip: Five ways to get started with Paint 3D</a>

<p>
</p><p>We are using sync center in our environment to sync our home drive to local drive using GPO, however we notice recently sync center partnership automatic create new sync without our notice, and is not configure in any GPO. Is anyone have idea how to trace
 where this sync instruction from and how to stop it? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to GPO, our sync center option like "Disable offline file" is grey out and unable to use. And the new sync partnership will backup to local drive folder&nbsp; C:\Windows\CSC and unable to delete it. Thanks</p>

            Hi turkishjim, check in Programs and Features for Nvidia GameStream Network Service. If it is a separate app to your nVIdia graphics card software and you so not use it, then you should uninstall it to get rid of this annoyance
<br />
<br />It may also be starting with Windows, try disabling it form there:
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager 
<br />Click on the Startup Tab 
<br />See if Nvidia GameStream Network Service is listed there 
<br />If it is, select it and click 'Disable' 
<br />Close Task Manager 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type msconfig and hit Enter 
<br />When the System Configuration dialog opens, click on the Services Tab 
<br />Check the box marked 'Hide Microsoft Services' 
<br />In the remaining list See if Nvidia GameStream Network Service is listed there , uncheck any you find 
<br />Click Apply and OK 
<br />
<br />Restart your System and this annoyance will be gone . . .

The part that is making no sense to me is the fact that my aero score is lower and for that matter so FAR lower then my gaming graphics score. To me that is suggesting that the desktop interface is more resource intensive then playing games.. which essentially
 makes no sense. Am I just understanding this wrong? Is Aero that much more intensive then games? How can I alleviate this nuisance?<br />
<br />
Thanks ahead for any information you're able to provide.<br />
<br />
Also please note I do have the most current drivers.

<p><span><span>Hello Kissmyne,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I understand how the Aero score being lower than your Gaming score could be confusing to you at first glance.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I think if you take into account how the scores are arrived at it will make more sense to you.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Aero package is way more graphics intensive then running games when you are utilizing ALL of the Aero advanced features such as dual displays performing a task like video editing:</span></span></p>
<p><span>A computer with a base score of 3.0 is able to run Windows Aero and many new features of Windows Vista at a basic level. Some of the new Windows Vista advanced
 features might not have all of their functionality available. For example, a machine with a base score of 3.0 can display the Windows Vista theme at a resolution of 1280 × 1024, but might struggle to run the theme on multiple monitors. Or, it can play digital
 TV content but might struggle to play High Definition Television (HDTV) content.</span></p>
<p><span>The above is quoted from this Microsoft article that explains the Windows Performance Index:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/get/experience-index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/get/experience-index.aspx</span></a></p>
<p><span>When you think about it in these terms it becomes easier to understand how your graphics card can have a higher Gaming Index Score than Aero Score because running the game simply
 isn’t as taxing on graphics card.<span>&nbsp; </span>I would recommend that you read the entire article I provided the link for.<span>&nbsp;
</span>After you read the article the Vista Performance Index should be easier for you to interpret.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I hope this information is helpful.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

    <title>Gateway PC won&#39;t shut down or restart on its own - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Gateway PC won&#39;t shut down or restart on its own</h2>
                    <p>I have been having this issue now for around a month's time.&nbsp; I try to restart the PC sometimes when I install new Windows Updates or just need to refresh the RAM.&nbsp; Anyhow, every time I do that, it will say Restarting on the Screen and then it doesn't actually
 restart the computer with Windows 8.1 on it.&nbsp; I have to manually turn off the computer by holding down the power button until it goes completely off.&nbsp; Then I have to power it back on myself as well.&nbsp; Its been a real pain for me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only changes I've made are with adding more memory, DDR3 SDRAM and updating some of the drivers for different hardware components.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't have this issue when I got the computer a few years ago, I think it was just in 2012 or 2013, I really can't recall now.&nbsp; But it started doing this to my Windows 8.1 and it isn't fun to deal with either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing, I did disable the Power Options where it says Start Windows up faster and I unchecked that but it still didn't solve my problem that I am experiencing as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise me on what I can do to hopefully solve this issue, thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I suggest you to run the hardware troubleshooter and check. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type <strong>
<span>troubleshooting</span></strong> in the search bar.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;Click <strong>
<span>view all </span></strong>in the left panel. &nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select ‘<strong><span>Hardware and devices</span></strong>' and follow the on-screen instructions.
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>Secondly, uninstall the driver and restart computer for the generic driver to be installed once the Microphone jack is inserted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Get back to us for further queries. We are happy to help!</p>

Uh oh... that shouldn't have happened.
It appears you've found a glitch in the system.

<h2>            Syncing photos with iPhone</h2>
                    Hello there,<br />
<br />
I recently updated to Windows 10 from Windows 7. Before, I could easily transfer pictures from my iPhone to PC, but since the upgrade I cannot at all. Using the photo app, I get an error message "An error occurred". My iPhone is unlocked and everything worked
 before. I also tried syncing with my sister's Windows 8.1, using AutoPlay, but got the same message. Any idea how to solve this?
<br />
<br />
Thank you for your answers.

            <p>Hi Samuel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you trying to view/sync pictures through iTunes or you want to view/copy picture to Windows 10?</li></ul>
<p>Let's check a few tips as below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Unlock iPhone when you connect to the computer</p>
<p>b. Make sure you tap "<strong>Trust this computer</strong>" message on iPhone</p>
<p>c. Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>E</strong> and click on <strong>
This PC</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to view picture folders only from your iPhone in Windows 10. If&nbsp;you are trying to sync photos to through iTunes, make sure latest version of iTunes is installed in Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to: <strong><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-al/HT201352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get the latest version of iTunes - Apple Support</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, I recommend contacting Apple Support Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<h2>            Stop Interactive Services Detection interference with printing</h2>
                    Just got a new laptop with Windows 7.&nbsp; Now every time I want to print, instead of 1 click to print - I now have 5-6 clicks to print.&nbsp; This is what I get:<br />
Click print<br />
Interactive Services Detection icon appears at the bottom of my screen so I click that<br />
Then click View the message pop-up<br />
Then my screen goes black<br />
Then I have to click Continue (printing starts)<br />
Then I have to click Return Now<br />
Screen goes Black again<br />
Sometimes I'm taken back to a different application (not Word or Excel etc...) and I have to click back to where I was printing.&nbsp;
<br />
This many steps is insane.&nbsp; I've tried stopping or disabling the Interactive Services Detection.&nbsp; When I stop it, it just restarts and I have this problem all over again.&nbsp; If I disable it, I can't print.&nbsp;
<br />
Does anyone know how to fix this?&nbsp; I never had this problem with Windows XP on my old laptop.&nbsp; Thank you!!!<br />

            Hi jmcd2000,<br />
<br />
If Interaction Service Detection service is disabled, both notifications of and access to new interactive service dialogs will no longer function and hence the printer doesn’t respond.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to change the startup type to manual and check if you’re able to print in few clicks.<br />
<br />
Also, I would suggest you to turn off your User Account Control and check if that helps.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Microsoft do not recommend to turn off User Account Control. Just for the sake of troubleshooting, turn if off. If it is not interrupting, turn it on soon.<br />
<br />
Does it happens with whatever applications you use to print or only inclined to specific applications?<br />
<br />
Post your results back.<br />
