<h2>            &#34;invalid product key&#34; when trying to install office 2003</h2>
                    I'm trying to install MS Office 2003 on my new computer with Windows 7.&nbsp; It asks me for the product key, but when I enter it, it tells me it's invalid.&nbsp; It worked on my other computer and it's a valid key!&nbsp; I tried several times but still with the same
 result.&nbsp; Made sure letters were upper case.&nbsp;

<p>Just to make sure, you <strong>are</strong> entering the Office 2003 Product key,<br />
right? It's not the product key on the sticker on the new computer,<br />
right? (That's the product key for Windows.)</p>

            Yes, I've got the product key for the Office 2003 not Windows.&nbsp; It worked just fine when I installed it on my laptop a year ago (Windows XP), tried it on another computer and the product key works there, just won't work on my new PC with Windows 7.&nbsp; Keeps
 telling me it's invalid.&nbsp;

<p>Those Microsoft Product Key labels are a 'pain-in-the-butt' aren't they? So small, the print even smaller!</p>
<p>Try using a magnifying-glass, to read that Product Key 'enlarged', if you can.</p>
<p>Then, use a word-processor......to RETYPE it all. Larger! Stick in casing, so in future you will have a 'readable' Product Key-Code to use. No more 'invalid key' errors!</p>
<p>That's what I do. (Works for me! Every time!)</p>

<p>Hello salrog1962, <br />
<br />
Is your copy of Office 2003 a retail copy that your purchased or did it come&nbsp;pre-installed on your computer from an Original Equipment (OEM)&nbsp;manufacturer such as Dell, HP, Acer, etc?<br />
If it is an OEM copy, the product key will not be valid as the Office license is only valid for the computer that it came installed on.<br />
<br />
You can use the Microsoft Geniune Product Validation as it will provide information about your system and product key.<br />

<p>Be sure that is it not the product key that is on the bottom of the computer as that is the Operating System product key.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

            You maybe have a preinstalled Office Trial that you failed to uninstall and reboot, prior to installing your paid version

<h2>            No Internet, Secured</h2>
                    <p>So I am attempting to connect to my wifi but I am unable to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everytime I attempt to connect it says "Checking Network Requirements" until eventually it will go straight to saying "No Internet, Secured."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read other troubleshooting methods including restarting my computer, restarting my router, etc. Upon using the Windows Netwrok Diagnosis to find the problem it reads as "Wi-fi 2 doesn't have a valid IP Configuration."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to fix that as well by enterring the Command Prompt and typing "IPconfig/release" and it reads "An error occured while releasing interface Wi-Fi 2 : An address has not yet been associated with the network adapter."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am stuck, I have no idea how I am able to fix this issue. I have had it once before but it fixed itself eventually, now after downloading the newest update there is no way to connect to the internet. Other tablets, phones, and desktops all work as
 normal but the laptop cannot gain internet access.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The errors you're getting when trying to connect to your network may occur due to incorrect or invalid IP configuration settings. For us to correctly determine what's causing this unusual behavior on your connection, we'd like to confirm the following details:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were you able to connect using the same network previously?</li><li>Have you tried using a wired connection to check if you will encounter the same difficulty?</li><li>What is the make and model of your router?</li><li>Have you made any software or hardware changes to your device and router prior to this happening?</li><li>To make sure we have not missed on anything, what steps have you tried so far aside from the things you have mentioned?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Your response is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Are you saying you were charged twice for the same month?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might have recurring billing turned on, this is the default setting. To change this go to your Microsoft account online, at the top there is a tab for Services &amp; Subscriptions. Click that tab then look in the list for Xbox Live, this is the current status
 of your account. Look under the Xbox Live and you should see in blue lettering a Recurring Billing turned or off. You click on change then turn off Recurring Billing. If you were charged twice then you will have two months of Xbox Live, you wouldn't be charged
 twice for one month. If you wish to get further help go to https://support.microsoft.com/contactus and you can ask for a refund.</p>

                    I have a Vista 32-bit HP notebook and I have noticed that KB915597 keep installing itself eve though I have update set to notify me and then have me install them myself.&nbsp; Between 02/05 and 05/14 I have nineteen (19) of the updates self-installed.&nbsp; My question
 is why is this happening also whenever they are installed my computer slows down considerably.&nbsp;

<p>I've already told you why you all those KB915597 updates listed: They're all sequential definition updates for Windows Defender but those updates&nbsp;have nothing to&nbsp;do with your "computer [slowing] down considerably."</p>
<p>Your problem's due to one, two, or all three&nbsp;of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. "Leftovers" from your previous installs of Norton Internet Security and McAfee Security Center (the previous Comcast freebie);</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Your Trend Micro subscription (or free-trial) having expired before you installed Norton Internet Security; and/or...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. A hijackware infection.</p>
<p>=&gt; NOTE: If the Comcast freebie <a href="http://security.comcast.net/norton/resi/migrate/default.htm?cid=33_232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Norton Security Suite</a> (which is only "powered by Norton 360 technologies" but
<em><strong>not</strong></em> a free version of Norton 360) were installed &amp; functioning properly, Windows Defender would be disabled
<em>and not updating itself!</em></p>
<p>To resolve #1 (only), contact Norton/Comcast support via chat (<a href="http://www.norton.com/comcast_chat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.norton.com/comcast_chat</a>) or by "calling 1-877-272-7149 to speak to a live Norton technician."</p>
<p>To resolve #2, #3, or #1&nbsp;<strong>and</strong> #2 <strong>and</strong>&nbsp;#3:</p>
<p>Back-up any personal data (none of which should be considered 100% trustworthy at this point) then format the HDD &amp; do a clean install of Windows.&nbsp;
<strong>Please note that a Repair Install (AKA in-place upgrade) will NOT fix this!</strong></p>
<p>HOW TO do a clean install of Vista: See the "If you want to reinstall Windows Vista by performing a clean installation..." section of
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-Vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-Vista</a></p>
<p>After the clean install, you will have the equivalent of a "new computer" so take care of everything on the following page before otherwise connecting the machine to the internet or a local network (i.e., other computers) and before using a flash drive or
 SDCard that isn't brand-new or hasn't been freshly formatted:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/pypc.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/pypc.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Tip: After getting the computer fully-patched, download/install KB971029 manually:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971029</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NB: Any Norton or McAfee free-trial that came preinstalled on the computer when you bought it will be reinstalled (but invalid) when Windows is reinstalled. You MUST uninstall the free-trial
<strong>and</strong> download/run the appropriate removal tool <strong>before</strong> installing any updates, Windows Service Packs or IE upgrades
<strong>and before</strong> installing your new anti-virus application.</p>

<br />
If these procedures look too complex - and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea - take the machine to a local, reputable and independent (i.e., not BigBoxStoreUSA or Geek Squad) computer repair shop.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>I have not been able to download my windows 7 home premium upgrade as my pc does not seem to be able to read my disc.</p>

<p><strong>Ok, Here is the deal.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have a upgraded Sony Vaio. It refuses to reboot. I can not reboot the computer from the start menu. I can cold boot perfectly fine and run windows. It only does not want to reboot (or Warmboot). I cant find a solution even after digging through
 the forums. I have all updated drivers(that I know of) and all current updates. What is the problem?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here are the specs of my computer if it helps anyone.</strong></p>

<p>What error message do you get when you try to boot from the Start menu?<span>&nbsp;</span>How long have you had this issue? Were there any recent changes to the computer, such as new hardware or software including Windows Updates?</p>

<h2>            can the X handle 240v&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Xbox one x from the US but i have recently moved to Norway where the outlets output 240v and i was wonder if the Xbox one x can handle 240v without frying, for the tv that I brought from the US i have to use a converter to prevent the tv from being destroyed although i don't have another one for my Xbox&nbsp;one x and I would like to plug it into the wall without fear of it being broken .</p>

<p>since the latest version of Windows 10, version 1809 (System version 17,763,134), Windows Media player is no longer launches and Microsoft print to PDF no longer works with an error message. The print to PDF printer is well installed and present as well

<h2>            Windows 10 default password</h2>
                    I got a new computer and started to install the OS on it- Windows 10- and when I got to the personalization settings the screen froze and I rebooted my PC. When I came back on, the user was named "defaultuser0" and there was no password available, as I
 never entered one. What is the default password for Windows 10? Please help.

            <p>Hello Igor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience this has caused. We'll be happy to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly provide few information to diagnose the issue better.</p>
<p>a) How are you trying to install Windows 10? Do you know the Windows 10 build?</p>
<p>b) From where did you download or purchased Windows 10 ISO? </p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question, there is no default password&nbsp;setup for Windows 10. In this case, you may have to do the installation again i.e., clean installation and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, I would suggest you to refer the reply by Srimadhwa B and the discussions posted in the following thread:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/user-account-not-created-defaultuser0-and-asks-for/9b360e67-6c8a-4413-857f-8af36d75f4cb">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/user-account-not-created-defaultuser0-and-asks-for/9b360e67-6c8a-4413-857f-8af36d75f4cb</a>

            <p>You're welcome for the help.</p>
<p>The error in your original post appears to&nbsp;be caused by the tmtdi.sys.</p>
<p><em>BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; X64_0x1E_c000001d_BAD_IP_<strong>tmtdi</strong>+c1de</em></p>
<p>The tmtdi.sys appears to be a Trend Micro driver.</p>
<p>Since this appears to be a driver left over from a previous installation of Trend Micro I would suggest to run the following removal tool to try to remove any traces of the previous Trend Micro Installation:</p>
<p><a href="http://esupport.trendmicro.com.au/Pages/How-do-I-remove-old-or-new-versions-of-Trend-Micro-products-in-my-comp.aspx#vista7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://esupport.trendmicro.com.au/Pages/How-do-I-remove-old-or-new-versions-of-Trend-Micro-products-in-my-comp.aspx#vista7</a></p>
<p>Also, there are some other errors that implicate the atikmdag.sys.</p>
<p>What display adapter is installed and from where did you obtain the driver?</p>
<p>Also, have you ever enabled the "Driver Verifier" and, if so, did you disable it afterward?</p>
<p>Also for some reason you appear to have changed antivirus software a few times.</p>
<p>Was the reason for this system instability?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are a group of customers of MINIX mini-computers (all located in Europe).</p>
<p>We all had a windows update in the past days (for most of us it is related to a Realtek driver update) and all our devices are now not responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same problem as mentionned above. No display, no boot, nothing. Just a black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our dedicated thread at the manufacturer is here : <a href="http://www.minixforum.com/threads/neo-z64w-doesnt-start-anymore-after-windows-10-update-help.14122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.minixforum.com/threads/neo-z64w-doesnt-start-anymore-after-windows-10-update-help.14122</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>We are trying to figure out a technical solution but if it fails, what is the MS policy when this happens because of their messy&nbsp; updates ?</p>
<p />

            <p>Same problem here, unable to boot after upgrade. Black screen, NO cursor, NO Bios screen, nothing.
</p>
<p>Unable to boot from alternatives (USB, CD). Tried blind login etc as suggested elswhere, no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally removed the hard drive, now successful boot from USB (Linux).</p>
<p>Inserted hard drive again, NO bios, No cursor again. Unable to do anything with notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion? Cumulatieve update Windows 10 Version 1607 voor x64-systemen (KB3213986) bricked my hard drive on my laptop. (ACER Aspire 7551G)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrade worked fine on my desktop PC. Have to find some way to mount laptop's drive on an other computer to check for corrupted bootblock and/or dataloss.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I might have written my previous post above a bit premature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably it was caused by a power setting "snel opstarten inschakelen" (I don't know the exact wording in English, but I'd translate is as "Enable fast startup") in the advanced power setings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some fidling with power, (removing battery and trying an old hard drive) I re-assemled the laptop to the original configuration and &nbsp;to my surprise it booted up again. It also looked like the upgrade had not finished yet, so I waited till the upgrade
 completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile I found some people had similiar problems caused by a problem with rebooting/hibernation/sleep status of their PC. Someone suggested to switch off this fast reboot option and reconfiguring what the power button does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, might it have been this power setting that the upgrade set to the wrong value? I have to say that I never reboot or hibernate the laptop, I just shut it down when done. Or maybe it was just the reboot or wakeup that didn't work propery to start with?
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, it works again and my laptop/hard drive was not bricked by the upgrade.</p>
<p>

            The average computer user is not expected to be able to disassemble and reassemble their computer. And they are not expected to have other hard drives laying around for diagnostic repairs. The average person would need to take it in to a repair shop and
 spend a lot of money on it. All because windows decided to shove an update down our throats. Many people have reported this happening during the work day and losing a lot of business because of it. This is simply unacceptable and I sense a class action lawsuit
 coming.&nbsp;

            &nbsp;I had this exact problem for ages. Tried everything in this thread and nothing worked.<br />
<br />
After going through Windows System logs found there were repeated COM server errors. Suspect these may have been related as System logs also had errors for DCOM unavailable for FB app just after boot up.<br />
<br />
Found a solution for the repeated COM errors, applied it, and FB app now works fine.<br />
<br />
The solution I found is very well written and easy to follow. It uses Regedit so need to be very careful and follow instructions to the letter, but it works. Looks like Windows update has something to do with the problem. So far don't think anyone has connected
 this solution to the Facebook app, but it may also address problems with other apps.<br />

            <p>I am having the same problem.&nbsp; I was able to get logged in and start the "Restore Windows 7" option before the Explorer.exe error.&nbsp; I am now back to Windows 7 and running without issues.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would have to Ctrl+Alt+Delete to even get to the login screen.&nbsp; It would just spin and sit there.&nbsp; Once I got logged in I had about 20 seconds before the Explorer error would wipe out my screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried starting in safe mode - didn't help.</p>
<p>I tried turning off fast start - didn't help.</p>
<p>I checked it wasn't trying to make multiple monitors/screens - it wasn't - only one screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't upgrade any other machines or this one again until its fixed!</p>

            <p>Hello Justin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have fixed that error. Like you said, about 20 seconds before the error pop up. So in about 20 seconds I clicked Start -&gt; and I start the "Reset this PC", it upgrade my laptop again and delete some app I installed on my old windows. I did it so fast in
 20 seconds so when it upgrade, the error didn't annoy me again. The Restore button take you back to your old windows but the Reset button upgrade your windows again and maybe fix some error for you. Trust me, I tried and now I'm using windows 10, writing you
 this reply. Maybe you can upgrade your windows again, but I'm not sure. I think windows 10 is good and better, you can upgrade if you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reply me!</p>

            <p>I had the same error on my laptop (The file explorer on). I have tought about the Reset option but when in the process the system gives me a list of all the programs that will be deleted and this include the drivers for the wifi connection, mouse pad etc.
 As i am not a very expert of computers i dont know what to do but i want to keep Windows 10 because it is just awesome . Did you have the same problem with the Reset option?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello Nax</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have that problem. Don't worry, when the Reset option done, my laptop still have the wifi driver, mouse pad etc, you can't see them in Control Panel (Unistall/Features Program) but they're still work. I don't know much about it but maybe if your drivers
 doesn't work normally, when the Reset done, you can download it again. And if it work normally, like they said: "Windows 10 is your".</p>

<h2>            Apps and Games from the Microsoft Store not Opening or Installing</h2>
                    <p><span>I have an HP p6732f PC with an&nbsp;AMD Athlon II X3 445 processor and I've had this issue for months where any apps or games from the Microsoft Store won't&nbsp;open.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Simple apps from Microsoft such as Calculator, Photos and Camera won't open either.</span></p>
<p><span>If I try to open an app or game it will immediately close without any error message. If I try to install an app or game from the Microsoft Store it will just reload the page after I click install.</span></p>
<p>I upgraded my PC from Windows 7 to Windows 10 when it first came out, but the Microsoft Store worked totally fine then, this has only been a recent problem.</p>
<p>My attempts&nbsp;to fix this have not succeeded, got any ideas?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Corrupted Windows apps components are one of the possible reasons why this issue is happening. To help resolve Windows app and store issues, we suggest running the Windows apps troubleshooter. Click on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>, then click
<strong>Run troubleshooter</strong>.<br />
<br />
Get back to us with the outcome so we can help you out further.<br />

<p>I ran the troubleshooter and it said that there was an issue where the Windows Store Cache may be damaged. It said that it resolved this issue, but I am still not able to open or install any apps.</p>
<p>I rebooted my PC and ran the troubleshooter a second time and it said again that there was an issue where the Windows Store Cache may be damaged.
</p>
<p>It resolved this issue again, but every time I open up the troubleshooter it keeps coming up with this same issue and saying that it has resolved it.</p>

<p>Since the troubleshooter wasn't able to resolve the issue, we recommend resetting the Windows store cache or the app. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>, then click <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Apps &amp; features</strong> on the left pane.</li><li>Locate <strong>Store</strong>, then left-click and select <strong>Advance options</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Reset</strong>.</li><li>If the issue still persist, type <strong>wsreset.exe</strong> in the search bar.</li><li><strong>Right-click wsreset</strong> in the search result, then click <strong>
Run as administrator</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us in the loop with the result.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 on Microsoft Imagine Premium</h2>
                    Is Windows 7 still available to get via Microsoft Imagine Premium service that universities are offering? I can't seem to find it on the store. There was no notification on software catalog change and now it seems that some other software is not available
 on Microsoft Imagine Premium (Visual Studio 2015 for example).

            Hi Kartracer22, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

 him at this point is by booting him into safe mode &amp; trying everything from there, which doesn't always work because Safe Mode blocks a lot of programs.</span></p>
<br />
I finished building him on Jan 21, 2016. He went from Windows 7 to the free Windows 10 upgrade (upgraded before anything else was installed) &amp; worked wonderfully for nearly 6 months. This is the 2nd time a Windows Critical Update has caused this to happen and
 my previous fix of uninstalling and reinstalling the latest graphics drivers didn't work.<br />
<br />
I have run malware scans, virus scans, cleaned the registry, &amp; manually updated all the drivers. I have set the BIOS to default, gaming as the main computer use with a tower cooler, &amp; back again with no noticeable changes. Attempted &amp; failed to set him back
 to a previous restore point. The same happened when I tried to reset him without deleting my files, I REALLY don't want to remake my bills excel let alone lose my save data. I have also stress tested his CPU, RAM, &amp; HDD to see if any of them were the cause
 of the problem. They all came back as being in perfect working order. Check Disk also found nothing wrong.&nbsp;I wanted to test his GPU as well but FurMark, the recommended program for the test, won't run in safe mode. He has also never gotten anywhere close to
 overheating. Nothing seems to be fixing him this time.<br />
<br />
I would love to take him in to Geek Squad to see if they can do anything, but a diagnostic is $100 &amp; if it turns out to be a hardware problem they can't do anything anyway. Besides that I have ~$70 to my name until July 1st &amp; $25 of that needs to stay in my
 checking in case my epass runs low/I need gas. Even after the first my fixed expenses won't leave me with much wiggle room.<br />
<br />
I found a program called ReImage PC Repair Online that has positive review articles dating back to 2011, but had never heard of it until now &amp; it costs $20 so I don't know that I want to use it just yet.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any suggestions on where to go from here or have used ReImage or something please let me know.<br />
<br />
EDIT 7/1/16:&nbsp;I had to clear space on an old computer &amp; find enough time but I finally tried a clean install of Windows 10, but Shran BSoD on me twice during the clean install. I'm now pretty sure this is mostly a hardware error, but am terribly confused as
 to why it worked perfectly fine until the 2 critical updates &amp; still works fine in Safe Mode. Having also stress tested nearly all of the components the only thing left that I can think of doing is to take it into Geek Squad or another computer repair place
 when I have the money and see what they can tell me.<br />

 I would first back up all important data so you don't risk losing it during the testing process. After that I would run a complete stress test and see if any parts hit 100% usage, any abnormal temperatures occur or anything else happens.&nbsp;</span><br />
 that works. Then start adding mode parts and see which one causes the issue.&nbsp;</span><br />

            <p>The CPU hasn't even come close to overheating &amp; I'm not familiar enough with overclocking, so I haven't messed with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally found my flash drive &amp; updated the BIOS, but that didn't fix it either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested the CPU before using Prime95, but I'm running it again with different testing parameters so we'll see how that goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesn't work I'll probably start moving things to my external in prep for a clean install.</p>
