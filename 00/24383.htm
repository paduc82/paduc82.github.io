    <title>New folder group in Outlook 2013 does not work - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New folder group in Outlook 2013 does not work</h2>
                    <p>In Outlook 2010 Contacts I used to be able to right click, add a new contact folder (not a group or distribution list, but a folder), then add contacts&nbsp;and groups&nbsp;to that new specific contact folder. IE I can have&nbsp;1 contact folder called "clients" and 1
 called "vendors", each with their own contacts and contact groups. I&nbsp;cant get it to work in Outlook 2013. When I add a "New Folder Group" by right clicking on my "Contacts" it creates a folder but the folder is completely useless. I cant do anthing with it
 other than move it up and down (why I would need to move a folder I cant do anything with, Ill never know!). The folders also do not appear in the list of contacts so I can't import my existing folder contacts from my Outook 2010 file and point it to that
 specific 2013 folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            1&#47;3 of page getting cut off when trying to print on 11X17 paper in Excel 2007</h2>
                    I'm trying to print landscape on tabloid paper (11X17) from excel 2007.&nbsp; When I print almost the entire right side is cut off at a certain point, almost 1/3 of the page.&nbsp; I've double and triple checked all of my settings, cleared the print area, reset
 it, set the page breaks properly, made sure everything was set to landscape.&nbsp; Everything shows up 100% correct in print preview, but no matter what I do I get the same result.&nbsp; I've uninstalled and reinstalled the printer on the network, updated the drivers,
 messed around with all of the printer settings and still no luck.&nbsp; I actually opened the spreadsheet in Open Office to see if it would print properly, in OO it would print the entire sheet but the area that's cut off in Excel prints would not be colored in
 at all, very strange.&nbsp; When I exported the spreadsheet as a .PDF extension and printed it from Foxit Reader it printed fine with no issues.&nbsp; Is there some sort of fix out there for this issue?&nbsp;

<h2>            Word App not uploading to Dropbox</h2>

                    <span>I am currently having some issues between dropbox and the Word app on my iPad. I will be typing in a document in the Word app and suddenly get an error message saying the app has saved my changes but can't upload them to Dropbox. When I
 check, the WiFi signal is strong and there is no obvious connection problem. In the directory the file shows "Upload Pending" under it and has an exclaimation point with a triangle around it. This happens multiple times daily, and happens to files in multiple
 folders. I have to save the file again with a new file name each time it happens because it won't over-write or delete the old file. Once the new file is saved, the old file never syncs and shows no yellow triange or green check icon. If I try to delete the
 old file I get an error message saying that the file cannot be deleted now and to try again later. &nbsp;I have tried deleting and re-installing both apps multiple times and restarting device to no avail. I checked Dropbox trouble shooting and they said it was
 a Microsoft problem, not their end. I use these programs to take, save, and organize my class notes so getting this fixed is vital with exams coming up...thanks for your help. &nbsp;</span>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to gather additional information to better help you with this concern. Kindly answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you notice any changes to your device prior to this issue?</li><li>Does the issue happen to a specific Word file?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you upload the Word file in your OneDrive and check if you will still experience the same issue. To do it, kindly follow the steps on how to use OneDrive in iPad through this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Upload-photos-and-files-to-OneDrive-b00ad3fe-6643-4b16-9212-de00ef02b586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were able to upload your document to OneDrive, the issue is with Dropbox. That being said, we advise contacting the developer for better assistance. We understand that you have already contacted them. However, if you'll be able to upload your file
 to OneDrive, then there's nothing wrong with your Office program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please post back with the result for further assistance.</p>

<p>It happens with more than one file, and files in more than one folder. It does not happen every time I manipulate the file but will happen in fits. I will have to re-save a document 5 times within an hour and then be fine for a day or two before it happens
 again. I took screen shots if you need to see them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not noticed anything out of the ordinary other than known reported bugs after updates to the newest iOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try OneDrive, but as the problem runs in fits it may take a while to see if the problem occurs with OneDrive.</p>

<p>I have not been able to re-create the problem when uploading to OneDrive but OneDrive is not my preferred method to save documents. I have been in contact with Dropbox support and they noted that all the error messages appear in the Word app, not the Dropbox
 app and that my files appear fine on the Dropbox end. Their reply is below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(43, 46, 47, 1)"><em>Also, thanks for your file names. On my end the files look fine so i'm trying to distinguish exactly where this problem lies.</em></span><br />
<br />
<em><span style="color: rgba(43, 46, 47, 1)">I see that the screenshots are from the Word App and not from Dropbox. I do see the exclamation mark in the orange triangle, but I need to understand how this corresponds to Dropbox, and what makes you
 believe the issue is being caused by Dropbox, and not the Word App so I can troubleshoot.</span></em><br />
<br />
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(43, 46, 47, 1)">I have attached to you the same photos I sent to them. Instead of blaming each other I would really like if you could work together to figure out why your programs are no longer working together, as I
 have been using this method to organize my notes for over a year and this problem has only been going on for a month. Again, I am using the Word app on my school-issued iPad to save documents to Dropbox. I get no error messages in Dropbox, the error messages
 appear in the Word app. The error appears to be communicatio between Word app and Dropbox for saving files as they are updated and I need your help to find out why.

            I have tried un-installing and re-installing both apps at least 3 times over the past month. I have checked the internet/WiFi connection and as far as I can tell it is fine. I have done several reboots/hard restarts with my device. My operating system
 is up to date and I am not anywhere near my storage limit.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Misconfigured settings in Word are one of the possible reasons why you are unable to upload your files. That being said, we will be performing some troubleshooting steps to isolate and to resolve this concern. Since you have updated and reinstall the app,
 let us try a different account and check if the issue will occur. In addition, we will further investigate this concern on our end and have it sent for review. We'll keep you posted once we figure out what's happening. But, please use a different account and
 let us know if you will still experience the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other questions or concerns, kindly reply to this thread.</p>

<p>I am having a similar problem, which started today on my ipad. I opened the dropbox app and can see all my files as normal. When I then try to open the files with excel or word they will not open. I have updated everything, done a reset. By reconnecting
 excell to dropbox I managed to get excel working but not word. I then transferred a word file from dropbox to onedrive and could open the file with word, no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be word not being able to connect to dropbox. I suppose I will have to transfer all my files to one drive. A shame really because dropbox up to now has worked flawlessly for me.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been having the same problems with Excel as listed in this forum with Word.&nbsp; We can randomly a file and it saves automatically and uploads to Dropbox, and then at other times it comes up with the same message 'Can't upload-Something's wrong and your
 changes can't be uploaded'. This process works for word at the moment. We have been using Excel for several months now and the problem has just started last week, it is random, but seems to be occurring with more frequency over the last few days.</p>
<p>Please advise on how we can fix this?</p>

            I am having the exact same problem on my Ipad Pro.&nbsp; My documents will&nbsp;not update on Dropbox.&nbsp; Instead I get a
<br />
Can't upload - Something's wrong and you your changes can't be uploaded" message.&nbsp; My only choice then is to save back a new document which is frankly annoying.&nbsp; I have no desire to use OneDrive.&nbsp; If this can't be fixed I may just move to using Pages for my
 word processing.&nbsp; Please advise how I can fix this problem with Word.

    <title>Temp files created by Word still shows when hidden - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ahmad fadil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Temp files created by Word still shows when hidden</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a user who has password protected Word files on her Desktop, in which when opened, creates "~$" temp files even when the option to "Don't show hidden files and folders" in Explorer is selected. I could recreate the issue on her machine with a test
 Word document which I then password protect, opening which will then create a "~$test" file on the Desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, the creation of the temp files persist throughout every Word/Excel file on her Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were to create a Word file (without password), it works as per normal; whereby the temp file although created, is hidden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Ahmad,<br />
<br />
Theoretically, Word/Excel will delete all of its temporary files when you exit the program. However, these temporary files might be left if Word hangs, if you exit the program abnormally, or if you left a large number of items in the Clipboard when you exited
 the program.<br />
<br />
Would you follow these steps to see if there is any improvement?<br />
1. Restart your computer. The temporary files are supposed to be deleted once the program is completely closed.<br />
2. If the temp files still exist, please open the folders where you normally save documents. In File Explorer, unselect "Don't show hidden files and folders". Now when you look under those saved folders, you will see the hidden ".tmp" files. Delete the .tmp
 files.<br />
3. In File Explorer &gt; search bar, type ".tmp" to get a list of all these file types. Delete all the .tmp files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please let me know</p>
<p>1. Your Windows edition.</p>
<p>2. Your Office version number. (Click File &gt; Account &gt; next to Update Options, capture a screenshot of the version number )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
James </p>

            <p>Machine has already been restarted, and I tried on a different Windows profile and the issue still persisted. Manually deleting the .tmp files of course works in that instance whilst the document is opened. But closing and reopening said document will incur
 the creation of the same .tmp files, whether deleted on saved folder or system wide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to point out that Word in itself does not crash, and is working normally. As I mentioned, I created a blank test Word document which has the same results. Only difference is with or without password protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine is running Windows 7 with Office 365 32-bit. Though I can't advise on the version due to the machine being away at the moment.</p>

            It is normal for Word to create temporary files when you are working with a document. Sometimes these files are left behind when you close the document and exit Word, and then you have to delete them manually.

<p>Good evening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a little confused by your code, but that may be just because I can't see the workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are unprotecting and re-protecting the worksheet with a VBA code name of "Sheet7" - is this the "Juni" worksheet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are also copying the row from the worksheet with a VBA code name of "Sheet1" - is this a separate worksheet to the "Juni" one, or should this be the "Juni" one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be that the sheet names are incorrect, and you are actually copying a blank row from "Sheet1" rather than the "Juni" worksheet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Russ.</p>

<h2>            Safety Scanner installation being blocked</h2>
                    I have downloaded the Safety Scanner on my computer and it shows as genuine Microsoft product however whenever I try to install it on my other computer (which I believe has a virus)&nbsp; it will not load stating its a theat and from an unknown source. Assuming
 this is the virus causing this - any suggestions for fixing? Thanks

            <p>Hi Donna,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you by any chance using Prevx?&nbsp; If so, it detects that program as a threat (a "false positive") and tries to remove it during scans (though I haven't had a problem with downloading or installing it)?&nbsp; What version of Windows are you using?&nbsp; What security
 software is installed on your computer (all the names and versions of everything)?&nbsp; Though I'm unaware of any that actually block installation, I don't know about all of the various options out there in the market.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, if you believe you are infected,
 we do need to deal with that and it could well be behind the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are infected, that could easily be the cause of the problem.&nbsp; We need to deal with that first and then, if that doesn't resolve the Safety scanner problem (as it likely will), then we'll address that knowing that your system is clear of any type of
 malware and can rule that out as the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a> and SuperAntiSpyware:</span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span>
 and then run a full ESET Online Scan:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>.</span><span> These may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them.
 Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected, you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this
 and get the expert help you really need as described below).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you
 can ignore the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</span></p>

    <title>Can&#39;t link to outlook folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrickchurchville  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t link to outlook folder</h2>
                    I know many of you will groan when you see there is another thread about the dreaded "Microsoft Access can't find the wizard." post, but I need to figure this out. I operate an IT Help Desk with 3 other analysts. We have an Outlook organization box to
 receive emails from people with IT issues. I have designed a nice Access DB to help us track the issues and the time we spend on them. The DB has also become a sort of "knowledge base" where we can look to see what others do to solve a particular problem.
 It is split so that all of us can easily access it.&nbsp; No pun intended.&nbsp; The problem is that I would like to link the inbox from our Help Desk organizational email box to our Access application with the idea that I could manipulate the email fields with VBA
 and create trouble tickets from them. I can't get my Access (after reinstalls, renaming wizards, repairing, add/deleting features) to link to that inbox. I have also tried creating a new profile and tried double clicking acwzmain.accde to see if something
 would happen, but it didn't. It links to my personal inbox just fine. It just will not let me link to the Help Desk Inbox. It will also not let me link to my personal .pst, but I'm not concerned with doing that.&nbsp; The only thing I haven't tried is changing
 the registry. I probably would have done so if I had been able to find which key(s) need(s) to be changed, which I have not. Are there any ideas out there including the registry changes? I have tried nearly everything to no avail. Help please.&nbsp; Getting access
 to the Help Desk Inbox is really important to getting the maximum value for our application and manage our Help Desk activities.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for anything you can do to help.<br />

            I am a bit surprised at the lack of response to my question but for those of you that are interested in an answer to this problem I recommend you use VBA to read Outlook emails as opposed to using the linking function in Access.&nbsp; The linking function is
 limited to the account's primary folders.&nbsp; I think this is a bug, but I'm sure Microsoft will disagree.&nbsp; To access other folders you have to use VBA.&nbsp; Unfortunately I am having problems with even that.&nbsp; The code to read Outlook emails works at home but fails
 at work where I need it.&nbsp; The only real difference is that I use Outlook 2010 and the Outlook Connector to access Hotmail and GMail accounts from home and I use my work organization's Exchange 2010 accounts with Outlook 2010.&nbsp; It appears that the field names
 are different between the two.&nbsp; Oi vey!&nbsp; When I figure it out I will post code and appropriate instructions....<br />

                    <p><span>Summary: When I open a project from project online into my desktop Project 2013 app and select Insert, Deliverable, Manage Dependencies (or
 Manage Deliverables), all of the project tasks disappear and I don't get the Manage Dependencies/Deliverables dialog.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Details:</span></p>

<ol>
<li><span>I am running this version of Project 2013: (15.0.4867.1003) MSO (15.0.4859.1000) 32-bit.</span></li><li><span>I am connected to our PWA in the Microsoft Project Online (Office 365) environment.</span></li><li><span>I select the project in PWA and do "Open, In Microsoft Project for Editing".&nbsp; The project opens in Project 2013 and is fully editable. (Note: I have also tried opening Project first and
 connecting to my PWA instance and I get an editable project as well)</span></li><li><span>I go to the insert section of the ribbon and click the Deliverable icon.&nbsp; From here I can successfully create a deliverable in my project tasks.</span></li><li><span>But when I click on either Manage&nbsp;Deliverables or Manage Dependencies...</span></li><li><span>All of my tasks disappear and cannot be recovered by switching to other views. In addition, my list of available views under View, Gantt Chart disappears.</span></li><li><span>The other tabs such as Project, Project Information are still functioning correctly, but the list of tasks simply don't come up.</span></li><li><span>Please, I'm not an idiot.&nbsp; I've tried all of the simple stuff like restarting Project, restarting Windows, repairing Office and Windows.&nbsp; I believe my version and patches are up to date.
 Checked with other project files, other users, other machines, other office 365/Project Online accounts.</span></li></ol>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Please let me know if you have had this problem before and/or if you have any ideas as to how to fix it.</span></p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 800 has stopped working</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Nokia Lumia 800 has just stopped working - I checked it during the day to reply to messages and it was working fine, and then when checking it about an hour later it would not respond to anything.</p>
<p>When I got home I tried charging it (it didn't have low battery when I was out so I don't think it turned off because of that). Then I tried taking the SIM out and putting it back in, tried the 'soft reset', the 'hard reset' and then plugged it into my laptop,
 all of which did nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm just not sure what to do next really, any advice would be much appreciated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zara</p>

    <title>How to format table caption &#34;Table A1&#34; in an appendix - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to format table caption &#34;Table A1&#34; in an appendix</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 6th edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association specifies that table captions for tables in appendices must be labelled with the appendix identifier. For example, the first table in Appendix A would be "Table A1". My university
 requires me to follow this publication manual for my thesis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using "{ SEQ Table \r 1 \* ARABIC }, I've figured out how to get numbering to restart at one. However, I can't work out how to get the 'A' into the label. I can manually add this by typing "Table A", or creating a new label. But then it doesn't show correctly
 in the table of tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest how to format the caption to include the appendix identifier, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks...David</p>

<br />
In the Video Channel, you can view how many "views" a video has received. Is there anything like this in the Microsoft Teams space? I would like to see how many times a document is opened, or a page is viewed to ensure associates on my team are using the page.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Schafer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting here. It isn't feasible in Teams. But you can do it in SharePoint. When you create a team, a SharePoint site is created. You can follow the link to get more details:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/sharepoint-onedrive-interact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/sharepoint-onedrive-interact</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In this situation, you can open the SharePoint site to view the file activity. For your reference:</p>

            <p>Hello Johnny:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding your issues playing music stored on your computer through your Xbox One.&nbsp; This forum specializes in the Xbox Music and video&nbsp;application.&nbsp; When it comes to the Xbox console we will do all we can to assist but
 you might find better support here, <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/?xr=shellnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://forums.xbox.com/?xr=shellnav</a> . </p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding is that you would need to use the Play to feature to have music played from your PC to your console.&nbsp; You will find more information about this here,
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows/playto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows/playto</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp; In addition to the steps outlined here, you should be able to use file explorer to set this up as well.&nbsp; That
 would be done by going to file explorer, opening the folder with your music, clicking on a track you want to play to the Xbox, look to the top for the play option and select play to.&nbsp; If you notice that play to is grayed out, you may want to go to your network
 and sharing center and check your advanced sharing options.&nbsp; Enable all of these and you should notice that play to becomes available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to have issues with this, I would suggest you contact Xbox Live support&nbsp;via the forum posted or via their live support options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns I can assist you with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>

    <title>Unable to load Business Contact Manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andman150  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to load Business Contact Manager</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to access Business Contact Manager for Outlook 2013. I receive the following error message when I click on Business Contacts or Accounts in the Contacts window of Outlook:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The set of folders cannot be opened. MAPI was unable to load the information service BCMMS.DLL. Be sure the service is correctly installed and configured."</p>
<p>
</p><p>My operating system is Windows 7 with Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013. I have reviewed existing posts related to this error message, but they refer to using BCM with older versions of MS Office and the need to install a compatibility pack. I updated
 my BCM database quite a few months ago after I upgraded from Office 2010 to Office 2013 and BCM worked fine up until a few days ago. Now I can no longer use BCM. Any help would be most appreciated. Thanks</p>

            <p>The problem that I documented on March 26, 2015 and thought I had solved by uninstalling and reinstalling BCM has recurred. It is the same error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The set of folders cannot be opened. MAPI was unable to load the information service BCMMS.DLL. Be sure the service is correctly installed and configured."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on why this problem has recurred? I have not made any further changes to my computer, i.e. adding new software, since I applied the previous fix on March 30th. Thanks</p>

<h2>            Remove the &#34;Click to add title&#34; object using VBA</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Lately I used the following code to remove object from presentation slides by the object name (when started with "ENG")</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I used the following code;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;For i = ActivePresentation.Slides(Slide_no).Shapes.Count To 1 Step -1</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; ShpName = ActivePresentation.Slides(Slide_no).Shapes(i).Name</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; If UCase(Mid(ShpName, 1, 3)) = "ENG" Then</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ActivePresentation.Slides(Slide_no).Shapes(i).Delete</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; End If</div>
<div>&nbsp; Next i</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After the removal process, I got the "Click to add title" shapes which I would like to remove using VBA as well.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can someone suggest what is the property which represents the title <b>shape value</b> ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>

</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I could not find it in the above link.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need it in order to delete all objects named "Title" n &nbsp; with <b>empty value</b>.</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Pick a meeting Time &#47; Date</h2>
                    Need to schedule MANY appointments. Want people to pick their own times/days. How can I send invitations to 100+ individuals to choose their own appointment times in Outlook Group Calendar?

            <p><span>Hi Reagan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to send multiple meeting requests to someone so they can pick time they are convenience, please follow the steps below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Create an appointment:</span>
<ol>
<li><span>Include the Location, Date and Time of the meeting in the Subject(important).</span></li><li><span>Invite yourself and mandatory attendees(important).</span></li><li><span>Send the appoint to yourself.</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>Go to your calendar and double click appointment and save as .ics file to your local PC.</span></li><li><span>Repeat loop for other time’s appointment in the series.</span></li><li><span>Create a new email message.</span></li><li><span>Attach all appointment .ics files including every time to the message.</span></li><li><span>Send the message to group.</span></li><li><span>Let recipients choose only one meeting by double clicking on the appropriate attachment and accept it.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;But the workaround has some limitations:</span></p>
<p><span>a. The meeting can reoccur. However, the time must be set as a specific period in advance.</span>&nbsp;We cannot force invitee to select unique time period and just accept one appointment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. The appointments cannot show in Group calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Vanessa</p>

            I have literally the EXACT same issue. Everything was working before the update then after it whenever I click on the app it just takes me back to my home screen. I have done a soft reboot, uninstalled and reinstalled about 6 times. I even factory reset
 my phone last night. Nothing works. Please can someone help. Sorry, I know this isn't helpful, I thought adding more detail about what doesn't work would help direct advice

            <p>Hi prav77,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, was it an update of the app only or&nbsp;an update of your phone OS ?</p>
<p>If there was an update of the app only, try to check if you don't have an available update for your phone in
<strong>settings &gt; phone update &gt; check for update</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to set Date+time manually on your phone (disable the automatic setting).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your phone is up to date, and nothing changes, I advise you to contact whatsapp support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, </p>
<p>Gaëtan L.&nbsp;</p>
