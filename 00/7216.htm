    <title>Lumia 650 keyboard is possessed&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> srino  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 650 keyboard is possessed&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My Lumia 650 has had this problem for a long time - sometimes (not all the time) and usually infrequently, the keyboard on my Lumia 650 just goes crazy. When typing a text message, say, I will hit one key and 4 or 6 or more random entries are made. It is
 very strange - there is no rhyme or reason as to what letters or numbers are entered. Using the backspace just makes it worse. Has anyone else had this problem? I have tried resetting the phone several times but nothing works. Thanks for any information!</p>

<p>I have tried both resets. I am not aware of a specific keyboard update. I would assume any updates for that would be included in a regular update.&nbsp;This has been going on for a while and, while it is extremely frustrating at the time, fortunately it doesn't
 happen that often. But would still like to get it fixed if I can. Thanks for the input.

            This happens to me all the time, every day. Hence why i googled the issue and it brought me here. Takes ages to write a simple sentence because I have to go back and correct it so much. Already done the feedback hub thing but they don't seem to listen.
 The phone is only a year old as well a rub&nbsp; ly jus rg, argh this phone is s bad. It won't even let me type out this message right

</p><p>If the problem is worse when charging then this would indicate a possible hardware fault, I would recommend taking your phone to your nearest authorsied service centre to have it checked out while it is still under warranty.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion. But I live in Anchorage, Alaska and I don't&nbsp;think there is a service center for a thousand miles. Probably&nbsp;Seattle. This being my only phone, sending it to Seattle isn't practical for me. I am wondering if it is possible to return
 the phone for a replacement this far into ownership of the phone. If not, I may need to live with this.</p>

<p>Groge, </p>
<p>Unfortunately, that is exactly what mine looks like when this happens - there is no controlling it. I would recommend as 93tid did above - if your phone is still under warranty, take it to a service center to get checked out. You may be able to get a new
 device. My phone, unfortunately, is no longer under warranty so unless there is some miracle cure, I will need to live with this. Good luck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>I have discovered that this problem occurs when the phone is charging. While I like the phone a lot, it is no longer under warranty and it is not worth the cost of having it repaired, even if it can be repaired. I doubt it.

<h2>            Bypassing SmartScreen Spam Filter</h2>
                    &nbsp;I hate the SmartScreen Spam Filter. &nbsp;It refuses to allow emails from an important website to go into my Inbox. &nbsp;I have repeatedly marked them as safe and set several rules for them that should get them sent to my Inbox but the SmartScreen thing over rides
 the rules and they go to my Junk Folder every time. &nbsp;That means that my Outlook mobile app doesn't alert me to their existence and I am always late in responding to them. &nbsp;How do I over ride the filter so the emails marked safe go into my inbox?

            <p><span>Hi ,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>To assist you further could you please confirm a couple of things:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Has your Account migrated to Outlook Mail?</span></li><li><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that&nbsp;the junk filter settings of your account is set to Exclusive. If the junk filter settings is set to Exclusive, emails from non contacts will go directly to junk folder. I suggest that you set your junk filter settings to Standard if your
 settings is currently set to Exclusive. Follow the steps below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Sign in to <a href="http://www.outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
preventing junk email.</strong></li><li><strong>Under </strong><strong>preventing junk</strong> email, select <strong>
filters and reporting.</strong></li><li>Choose a <strong>junk email </strong>should be in <strong>standard.</strong></li><li>Delete <strong>junk email </strong>should be in <strong>ask the sender to remove you from mailing lists and automatically block spammers.</strong></li><li>Block content from unknown senders should be in <strong>Show attachments, pictures, and links for senders with good reputations.</strong></li><li>Click on<strong> save.</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to make sure that emails from your contacts are directed to your inbox is to add them to your contacts list. To do this, please find a message from your contacts, open it and click the Add to contacts link that you'll find in the message header
 beside the sender’s name. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, please remove and re-add their email addresses to your Safe senders list to prevent their messages from getting into your Junk folder by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From your Inbox, click the <strong>gear icon</strong> on the upper right corner
<strong>beside your name</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>options.</strong></li><li><strong>Under preventing junk email, </strong>click <strong>Safe and blocked senders.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Safe senders. </strong></li><li>Enter the <strong>email address </strong>or <strong>domain in the box </strong>
labeled Sender or domain to mark as safe: and click <strong>Add to list</strong>.</li><li>Make sure that you enter the correct email address/domain.</li></ol>

<h3> johns_mia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2019 16.24 Calendar Printing Issue</h2>
                    <p>This seems to be a chronic issue the comes and goes from version to version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Client is on latest version of Mac Office. Running MacOS Mojave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook, he wants to print a weekly version of his calendar. The print out shows blocks but no text inside. This is on his main Office 365 calendar. There is another calendar I believe is a holiday calendar and those blocks have text in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed and re-added the printer to ensure he has the latest driver. Printing to an HP Laserprinter. I deleted the cache and also removed duplicate fonts using Font Book but no change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking to confirm if this is still a bug or whether its fixable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On one thread, I read to try using the online version of Outlook and when doing so, that works but client wants this working in the desktop version.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi JohnS_Mia,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</p>

I hear you there.&nbsp; We just upgraded to IE7 about 6 months ago at my current job location.&nbsp; I'm currently contracting at a large bank so they are very slow to move.&nbsp; I'm hopint that they will skip the Office 2007 upgrade and go directly to 2010 (but then again
 my contract has only been extended to March 31st so I may not have a job with them after that point).

            I had to copy the cab file to my device to install it. So, after you've installed on your computer, mgo to \Program Files\Microsoft.Net\SDK\compactframework\3.5\WindowsCE\. Select the .cab file compatible with your device and copy it to your storage card.
 That should be&nbsp;NETCFv35.ppc.armv4.cab.

<p>
</p><p>I'm currently using gmail, but am viewing it through Microsoft Outlook 2016 on Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way that I can get a reminder if my email isn't responded to (e.g. within 2 weeks)? I'd like to be able to do this through Outlook rather than having to log on to gmail in a browser.</p>

<p>Hi EliNathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings. As I understand from your description, you want to track if the recipient has seen it or read the email you sent. In fact, this feature in Outlook called Request a Read Receipt. However, according to this article:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/request-a-read-receipt-or-delivery-notification-in-outlook-for-mac-2493ae0b-fba6-47f3-a5d5-ca0c0dbfe878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Request
 a read receipt or delivery notification in Outlook for Mac</a>, this feature is not work for a Gmail accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it is not feasible for a Gmail account to track and get a reminder for the emails you sent. If you perfer to use this feature in Outlook for Mac with Gmail account, you can vote this feature request in following link:&nbsp;<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac/suggestions/20076217-expand-read-receipt-usability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac/suggestions/20076217-expand-read-receipt-usability</a>.

<p>Hi EliNathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your updates. Based on my experience and test, it is not feasible for a Gmail account to flag emails for follow up with a reminder when sending emails. If you think this feature is important and more convenience for you, we recommend you vote
 your feature request in <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac/suggestions/20076217-expand-read-receipt-usability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Embedded videos not playing when projected on another screen. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Embedded videos not playing when projected on another screen.</h2>
                    <p>Hello - I've tried all possible suggestions for the fix on this but still can't get my embedded videos to play when I connect/project to another monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed the path: File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; and made sure that that both the "Disable hardware graphics acceleration" and "Disable slide show graphics acceleration" are ticked and they still do not play when I connect to another monitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The videos do play when not projecting and I've figured out the workaround to "Duplicate Slide Show" in Display settings, but it is clunky and throws off the presentation to have to jump back into the PPT when the video ends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another fix that can help me resolve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Aleisha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that the problem is either in the embedded video or how the 2nd monitor was set up. Have you tried to embed a different video on a new presentation if there's any improvement?</p>
<div><br />
<div>As an initial recommendation, I suggest that you compress the media files to improve playback performance and see if the issue will be resolved. Here's the
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/compress-your-media-files-a45c956a-f4a6-4d47-99ef-b408ac5a9a6b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>for the steps on how to do it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</div>

<p>Thanks for the response...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be any and all videos projected in any way.&nbsp; I've tried different videos, links vs. embed codes and even video files.&nbsp; They all play fine when I leave presentation mode and "Duplicate the Display" but none of them play in presentation mode.&nbsp;
 It's like they're frozen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it happens in Presentation Mode on any projection that I've tested around my office: Wireless Monitor Connections, HDMI Connections, giant monitors, little monitors, sharing my screen over Lync/Ring Central, and finally on my own computer monitors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made hundreds of slides with video and haven't had this happen in the past with PPT at other companies.&nbsp; I just started at this new company so my laptop is new - my feeling is that it is a setting inside PowerPoint somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's driving me bananas that I can't figure it out!<br />

            Make sure that the Maps app has permissions to access your location. Also, do you see issues getting your location in other apps? Keep in mind GPS signal is only available if there's no interference and is usually not available indoors.&nbsp;

            There aren't a lot of options. BUT all is not lost. Search the web for free lessons for any version of Word 2007 or newer. The basics are pretty much the same for all of the versions. Once you learn the basics, get lists of "what's new" and "new features" for the versions after the lessons. You should be able to find short lessons / tips from MS on specific features.
<br />
<br />Here are some links to lessons
<br />This site isn't about formal lessons, but it does explain a lot of features:

<br />In this article, we point out an assortment of simple, yet often “invisible” features in Office.
<br />According to Microsoft, around 80% of the feature requests they get for Office are already currently within the applications. That’s right – the feature you might really want is hidden away or even just poorly documented, but chances are it is in there somewhere. This isn’t really surprising as each application within Microsoft Office has literally thousands of different functions to categorize. Exposing some of these hidden functions to the user is the main reason behind the new Office 2007 User Interface.

<h3> sheilajeanne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Login Cookies Are Being Deleted w&#47;o my consent&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, this is a weird one! Every so often, seemingly at random, I&nbsp;sit down at&nbsp;my computer to find all my login cookies have been deleted from my favourite websites. This is a reall pain!</p>
<p>The first thing I did to solve this was to reset my privacy settings to 'medium' from 'medium high.' I then&nbsp;added every one of my favourite websites&nbsp;to the list of sites allowed to use cookie information. This worked for the last couple of days.</p>
<p>Then, I woke up this morning to find it had happened AGAIN! ALL my cookies had been deleted, and I had to sign in to all of my favourite websites.</p>
<p>I've checked to see if maybe my antivirus program (AVG)&nbsp;or antispyware program (AdAware and Spybot S&amp;D)&nbsp;were responsible. Nope, neither one had done a scan in recent days.</p>
<p>The only other possibility I could think of was that maybe there had been a power failure during the night, but that would be the first time a power failure has caused this to happen. It certainly never happened when I was running Windows XP.&nbsp; Nor did I
 get a message about improper shutdown when I first went online this morning. Everything looked the way it always looked, expect for the missing cookies! (I left the computer running alll night, as I have SETI at Home installed, and it works on analysing data
 from outer space while I sleep.)</p>
<p>Can someone please help me get rid of this cookie monster that keeps 'eating' my cookies?</p>

<p><span><span><span>Hi Sheilajeanne,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Clear cached data in Internet Explorer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To determine whether a performance issue or an error message is caused by corruption in the temporary Internet files or in other cached information
 that is used by Internet Explorer, you must clear cached data. To do this, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Internet Explorer 7
</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Internet Explorer 7.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click Tools, and then click Delete Browsing History.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In Delete Browsing History, click Delete All.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click to select the Also delete files and settings stored by add-ons check box, and then click OK.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Internet Explorer 8
</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Internet Explorer 8.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click Safety, and then click Delete Browsing History.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In Delete Browsing History area, click Delete.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A progress bar is displayed to indicate that the browsing history is being cleared. After this process is complete, test Internet Explorer to verify
 that it works correctly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>If this does not resolve the issue you may follow the second method, to reset the security settings for all the zones.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Internet Explorer.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Tools</strong>, and then click <strong>Internet Options</strong>. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Security</strong> tab. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Reset all zones to default level</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you do this, test Internet Explorer to verify that you do not get the same error message when on Netflix.</span></span></p>

                    <p>My wifi was not working on my Windows 10. Perhaps this is my last feedback for technical preview, as I rolled back to my&nbsp;previous version of Windows. I couldn't use my wifi network even it's connected. I can use on all other devices and other laptops. Perhaps
 it was technical difficulty. I tried to use another Wifi Network, but the same problem persisits. I use troubleshooter, but no way!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experience with Windows 10 was good, and impressive for my friends. Hope there will be another great build. Thanks<br />

<h2>            Windows Defender refusing to update</h2>
                    A few days ago, at the advise of my university IT, I uninstalled Symantech Antivirus and installed Microsoft System Center Endpoint.&nbsp; Since then, there have been no automatic updates and when I initiate an update, I get error code 0x80070490 with a message
 saying that the app couldn't check for updates and to check my internet connection.&nbsp; I am doing other things online at the same time (like writing this question) so I definitely have an internet connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; What can I do?

            There is nothing wrong with the code, so the error must be caused by your sheet or workbook - most likely, one of both are protected.

            The model is way old and nokia now dont provide SW upgrade for this model.<br />
Did you try a hard reset by*#7370#?<br />
Backup phone memory by latest PC Suit to PC before doing that.

<p>Hi Asharaf AliShaik3382,</p>
<p>Here are the explanations for your references:</p>
<p>Q: COMPLETE : if I set the button as COMPLETE &amp; APPLY , WILL it change the object ?</p>
<p>A: the “COMPLETE” action means the specific attribute you’re checking has the correct value. Which means it won’t be changed after we select the COMPLETE &amp; APPLY action, even though the tool may show error for the attribute.</p>
<p>Q: EDIT &amp; APPLY</p>
<p>A: The value stored in the attribute will be updated with the correct one.</p>
<p>Q: REMOVE &amp; APPLY</p>
<p>A: The incorrect value stored in the attribute will be removed.</p>
<p>Also, if you found you have done something wrong to the attributes, you can select UNDO after restoring from transaction log. Which you can refer to the “Rolling back your changes by using the IdFix GUI” section as described in the article you mentioned.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community forums. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like you are getting an error message 'The message was not sent and e-mail has been truncated'.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer few questions to narrow down the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Which is the e-mail client that you are using? Are you using Microsoft Outlook or web based e-mail clients?</p>
<p>2. What is the complete error message? </p>
<p>3. Does this issue occur only when you send a large file sized e-mail? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Truncated means shortened by having a part cut off. Sometimes when emails are too long they cut the ends off.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">This means that the email that got sent back was too long, the mail server send back to you instead of sending all the parts.
</font></p>
<font color="#000000">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Provide more information regarding this issue so that we could help you further.
<br />

<p>This question is almost impossible to answer without any detailed interview or analysis.</p>
<p>3000 - 6000 is really a wide estimate. </p>
<p>Are they in the same location? How many in each location?</p>
<p>What are the use cases identified by Yammer? How many staff involved with those use cases?</p>
<p>What are the other identified uses for Yammer? </p>
<p>Is the customer going to drive mass adoption with campaigns, or are they going from small use cases before scaling?</p>
<p>So many other questions need to be worked out before the bandwidth question comes about.</p>

</p><p>it makes a lot of sense. I am trying to get my hands on 2 windows phones, once I do they will be amazing for sure..</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>but anyways I wanted to find out if by any chance Microsoft is thinking about replacing windows media player or not..&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>or if they are working on a newer version of windows media player or a replacement player?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>or is groove going to advance and continue stomping windows player hide or something..</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>if thats the case I hope windows player grabs a set of nun chucks and defends it self..</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">but I am just curious if windows media player is currently getting a 2019 revamp or something?&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hi Samuel
<br />
<br />Windows Media Player is no longer being actively developed by Microsoft and there is no word of them making a on-par replacement application
<br />
<br />Groove music is the app Microsoft are actively developing and new features will be added as time goes by.
<br />
<br />There is somewhat a lack of functionality in the Groove App, which till hopefully get better and better in time . . .
