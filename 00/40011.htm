<h2>            Game Given Low Priority-Changing Back Doesn&#39;t Stay.</h2>
                    Ok so I like to multi task while playing my game however this problem only seems to mainly exist while playing<strong>Guild Wars</strong> while I have media player going and messenger running. For some reason my<strong>OS:</strong>
<strong>windows 7 professional 64-bit</strong> places my <strong>priority to low</strong> for guild wars when I multi-task.
<strong>my specs are I7-950, 6gb ram, GeForce gtx 460 graphics card 1gb</strong> model. By all means i have the resources to multi-task all this at once so why does it keep<strong>repeatedly putting it to low priority</strong> even after I put it to normal/high
 priority the second I get back to game (I know cuz I alt tab again and check a moment later and its low setting again) I would like to lock the priority setting in if possible or is their a program I dont know of running that I can uninstall/change a command
 that is micro managing this horribly. I'm wondering<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">if it might be a program I installed from a cd that came with my<strong>motherboard: ASUS P6X58D PREMIUM</strong>
</span>or if this is something built into windows 7. And yes this is a custom built computer if your wondering. I would like to note I have never noticed this priority level problem occur when I play starcraft 2 which is odd since it clearly affects guild wars
 badly making my game laggy even though the latency is green/good for internet connection.

<p><span><span>Hello ShiroSan,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Although you can change the priority with Task Manager, the priority is not set permanently. Once you restart your system, Windows forgets your custom
 priority and assigns the process default priority. There is not a way to permanently set the priority level in Windows, however there are several Third Party programs that will give you an ability to remember the settings. You can use your favorite search
 engine to search for the related programs. The programs can also lead to instability in the system.</span></span></p>

            That doesn't answer the question. I am having the same problem. The problem is not that the priority changes after you restart the system. He said: "<span><strong>repeatedly putting it
 to low priority</strong>&nbsp;even after I put it to normal/high priority the second I get back to game (I know cuz I alt tab again and check a moment later and its low setting again)&nbsp;" NOT after restarting the system, just a few minutes after changing it without
 doing anything else.</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>The same thing happens to me, actually with the same game, Guild Wars. I start the game, change the priority, then a couple minutes later it's back to low. I didn't restart the
 system or do anything else besides alt-tab to and from the game.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>So is there a way to stop Windows from changing the priority while the game is still running (that is the problem we are having)?</span></div>

            <p>I have the same problem with CIvilization IV and V.</p>
<p>Both I start with a "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c start "runhigh" /high "-prefix to the sortcut, and the games does indeed start with high priority, but after a few seconds the game grinds to a halt, and when Alt-Tab`ing to Task Manager, it is running
 with below normal priority.</p>
<p>Changing it to high, Alt-Tab`ing, playing for 30 seconds unti it slows down, and repeating the whole process again is quite boring in the lung run but the only way to play. We have the same issues on my wife`s computer.
</p>
<p>I read somewhere on technet that the system scheduler sometimes gives a low-priority tas a "boost" to let it finnish before returning it to its original "low" state, and some believed it somehow had something to do with it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, can someone please answer the question: <strong>why are the games repeatedly being put to low priority ?
</strong>I cannot remember this being an issue with any other versions of Windows.</p>

<h2>            Glitch in Skyrim</h2>
                    
<p>While i was playing skyrim today i found some malachite ore and decided to mine it. &nbsp;However my character hit the ore easily over fifty times and i didn't get anything. &nbsp;I also tried to get firewood to make arrows, but my character just keeps chopping the
 wood and i don't get any of it. &nbsp;any ideas on how to fix this?</p>

<p>Are you sure you're not getting any of what you mine or any of the wood you chop? That sounds really strange and if it's a bug, it's one I'm unaware of. It should pop up in the top left corner of the screen in somewhat small white lettering saying what was
 added to your inventory. Even if it doesn't say you have it, have you checked your inventory? They will be under the miscellaneous section.</p>

<p>I have had that happen before. I just push back on the left stick to break the animation and then start over, that usually fixes it. If you let it go, the character will just stand there forever going through the animation but mining nothing.</p>

Please note that Adobe Creative Suite 3 is not compatible with Mac OS X Snow Leopard, which is the latest version of Mac OS X. Also, non of Adobe's professional applications work on Linux. So, if you think its any better on the other side, sorry to inform you,
 but no. My recommendation is to downgrade to a supported version of Windows such as Vista or XP and install it on that.<br />

<p>Does anyone know if Adobe CS3 will work in "Windows 7 Professional" running in xp mode? At the Microsoft site they imply that it will " run older programs". I'd rather not spend the money to find it won't work. &nbsp;Also what may be the downside of running in
 that mode? Does it effect memory use, can I run duel monitors, etc.?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello El Rojo,</p>
<p><span>If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Use the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the Program</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click

<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Compatibility tab</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 Run this program in compatibility mode and select Windows Vista or whatever operating system the program was running successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you run Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate version, install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP mode (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx</span></a>)
 and execute your software in Windows XP.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you run Windows 7 Home Premium, try VirtualBox (<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.virtualbox.org</span></a>) or VMware Player (<a href="http://www.vmware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.vmware.com</span></a>)
 or any other 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party virtualization software and install a separate copy of Windows XP (either Home Edition or Professional) for that purpose.<span>You can find virtualization software free of charge that will run on Windows
 7 Home Premium.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Hope one of these options will work for you.</p>

<p>Thanks Marilyn,</p>
<p>I have already tried the compatibility mode and the programs won't open. I've tried most of the fixes offered online. I am considering upgrading to Windows professional though there is no assurance that will work. The Virtualbox route appears promising,
 though I need to do a lot more reading about that process before trying it.</p>

            It will work in Windows XP Mode, but its gonna be slow, and because there is no accelerated graphics support in Windows XP Mode, your productivity will be limited. Especially since Adobe CS3 includes applications that greatly depend on your graphics card
 such as Photoshop.

            For what it's worth, I have Adobe CS3 running flawlessly on Win7 Pro 64-bit. I'll trawl through my archive to see whether I can spot any reason why you might be having difficulty. Is yours a 32- or 64-bit system? And is it the English language version
 of CS3 you're having trouble with?

<h2>            After Windows 10 update on 2&#47;20&#47;17 lost connection to Epson Artisan 800 printer.</h2>
                    I received the automatic Windows 10 update on Monday and then could not print to my Epson Artisan 800 printer. Tried to reinstall drivers but matters got worse. Now computer cannot find or recognize the printer. How can I restore the printer function?

            I had tried the Troubleshooting method already but it could'nt find the problem. I just did the second suggestion, then sent a test print to the Epson but the printer is still in an "error state". I had also downloaded the latest driver and network package
 from Epson and ran it. The new drivers were installed successfully but when the network app runs it gets only to the point where you select the printer and none are listed as it can't seem to find it. Printer is connected to computer with internet cable at
 this stage. Will be grateful for any further suggestions. Thanks.

            <p>Thanks for the suggestions. Number 3 led to a solution.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1 </strong>returned an "Error 87" message and after a question said "option 'online' is unknown".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong> returned "Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations"</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3 </strong>resulted in identifying the Epson Artisan in the Add Printer dialog. I was then able to run the Epson setup program in Windows 7 compatability mode which also found the Epson Artisan in the setup dialog. After that everything completed
 successfully and the test print was printed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>From the very first time I started it up, with no other software installed, I was getting that error.&nbsp; I looked it up and saw that it indicated hardware conflicts so piece by piece I replaced all of my components.&nbsp; After each one was replaced I kept getting
 the same error until I had replaced all of them with brand new parts.&nbsp; The longest I could keep the pc up before it froze and/or rebooted was 32 minutes.&nbsp; To determine if it was still a hardware issue i downloaded ubuntu onto an usb drive and ran that for
 almost 2.5 hours.</p>
<p>

            Hi drizzt2018, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<p>
</p><p>Also: A bad install media can cause this. So can improper boot order for BIOS or EFI, as the media can not remember the last place it left off after rebooting during install.</p>

<p>What year are you in?&nbsp; Modern mobo's don't use jumper pins anymore and I have double checked the wiring and connectors many times - this is the 10th or 12th pc that I have built and it is the first one that I have had issues with.&nbsp; I have had the issue with
 all BIOS settings at&nbsp; default as well as setting the memory manually to 3200 14-14-14-14-34 CAS latency, also tried 2933 14-16-16-16-34 latency.&nbsp; Made no difference.&nbsp; Also using a 240 closed loop cooler and temps don't get over 40C.&nbsp; Checked voltage in BIOS
 and 12V rail was 12.14, the 5V was within spec also.&nbsp; Have updated the bios to the latest one as of 6/2018, had no issues with the loading media as it was a virgin usb drive.</p>

<p>
</p><p>And I build about 4 a month and work on hundreds of PC's a year. </p>

            I don't use cloud storage ever - just set up this one drive folder for this use only.&nbsp; Set up the share as I would for anything else?&nbsp; &nbsp;Did that so it should work now,&nbsp; My mobo doesn't have jumpers or switches&nbsp; to set everything.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I also ram the
 DISM and&nbsp; SFC that was in the link you posted and nothing was found in the DISM but SFC did find files it couldn't correct - the CBS file is in the one drive also.

            Mainly interested in easily updating the "comments" field for each file to track the file's status. Would like to click on the comments field in Windows Explorer and type in a comment rather than right-clicking the file then &gt;properties&gt;summary&gt;comments.
<br />
<br />
So instead of clicking four times to add a comment, I could add comments by clicking one time.

<p>Websites like it exist for one purpose: to persuade you to download and install their fix-it software, which is useless at best and infected at worst. You need to avoid those websites like the plague.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a while it will be easier to spot websites like this, because they're filled with useless, generic information that doesn't tell you anything of value. Often they're built around a template with the file names and titles plugged in from a database.
 This too is easy to spot because the syntax is awkward.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
TiWorker.exe is part of Windows however it can be infected. Best to avoid programs on the internet that<br />
claim to be able to fix a vast array of issues. Think of them as Snake-Oil likely to cause issues while fixing nothing.<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do&nbsp;a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect
 as&nbsp;the cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with
 these to an extreme overkill point.<br />
<br />
How do I find and remove a virus?<br />

<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN&nbsp;it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not
 does not mean you should not check with the other methods below.<br />

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>

</p><p>What got my interest I that the log appeared on a day that I was not home. Also If it is a so called Microsoft file why has it suddenly disappeared when I do a search for it. Why would it hide itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, why cant i find an official Microsoft link about this so called file but just fake sites that say that it belongs to Microsoft. Seems very fishy to me.....</p>

<p><span>On a Windows Vista-based computer or on a Windows Server 2008-based computer, the Microsoft ISATAP adapter appears with a yellow exclamation mark next to it in Device
 Manager, and you also receive an error message</span></p>
<p><span>Windows cannot load driver (Code 31)</span></p>
<p><span>You can safely ignore this error message. This error message does not indicate a problem with the adapter. The adapter will continue to work correctly.</span></p>

            Hi Michael
<br />
<br />I would try upgrading to a more recent version of Skype to see if it corrects the problem:
<br />
<br />Uninstall Skype.
<br />
<br />If you already have Skype 8 installed, you can uninstall it from Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />
<br />If you are running Windows 8 or earlier, open Control Panel &gt; Programs and features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />Select Skype, click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type:
<br />
<br />%appdata%\
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Rename the Skype folder Skype_old
<br />
<br />If you don't see the Skype folder, move on to the next step:
<br />
<br />Restart then download and reinstall Skype:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/download/win/Skype-8.36.0.52.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/do...</a>
<br />
<br />Check if the problem is resolved.

<h2>            error installing and updating using the external HDD.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello and thanks for your support in advance.</p>
<p>I use the Wrstern Digital HDD for xbox one WDBWLG0030HBK-JESN for external storage and save many titles on it. &nbsp;When I try installing games or updating games on external storage, I fail to do these by error code 0x80070015 telling "To complete download,
 set disc agein ." message. &nbsp;But I am the great fun of DL play so every games are downloaded through XBOX live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By clicking My collction's "STOPPED installing" message, error code 0x8007045d occurs. But it's reference seems to be xbox 360 profile issue and I cant do anything.</p>
<p>I know the remedey for this. Install the game and its update into internal storage and copy the games through the external storage. but my 500GB HDD is too small. I'd like incoming frequently updated games in internal storage, and rarely updated games in
 external.</p>
<p>In short</p>
<p>1:I can't download games into the external storage directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2:I can't download the updates of the games in external storage</p>

<p>WHAT I WANT</p>
<p>download into external storage directly games and the updates.</p>

<p>temporary remedy</p>
<p>use internal storage downloading game itself and its update then copy to external storage. &nbsp;This is tired way:(</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Conflicts with the default program settings is one of the possible reasons why the preview pane for the .jpg files is not showing. To change the default app to open .jpg files, you can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows </strong>key.</li><li>Type <strong>choose a default app for each type of file</strong> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li><li>Locate <strong>.jpg </strong>and change the default program to <strong>Photos</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, don't hesitate to get back to us.</p>

    <title>Extremely high DPC Latency from Directx Graphics Kernel since - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john panagiotou  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extremely high DPC Latency from Directx Graphics Kernel since Anniversary Update.</h2>
                    Hello,
<p>This is the only place that I hope can bring peace to my mind. I have a persistent problem since the Windows 10 Anniversary update that has challenged my mental capabilities each and every one of these 20 days since the update. The problem is: Sound crack
 and Popping occurs when playing audio/gaming/streaming videos followed by stuttering / mini stuttering when playing games. Especially bad if I switch tabs or doing both at the same time. I checked my PC's &nbsp;DPC latency, and it is through the roof.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used 2 programs to check my DPC latency: Latency Mon and DPClat. The first tool brought up a detailed report as to what causes the problem and the second just informed me of my extreme latency (1500 ms). According to Latency Mon (I will include the report
 below) dxkrnl.sys (DirectX Graphics Kernel, Microsoft Corporation)&nbsp;is what causing the huge spikes. The first thing I did was to re install the drivers of my GPU (GTX 970). Nothing changed. I then proceeded to remove my GPU, remove the drivers using DDU and
 checking again. The same thing was reported with my integrated gpu. I proceeded to do a clean install of windows 4 different times, testing from the beginning if I had issues and until I installed all the necessary drivers of my motherboard. The same problem
 was reported each and every time. And the same problem with the sound occurred each and every time. I sold my 970 and got a 1070 (was planning an update anyway). Same thing. Now I am sitting here, with no&nbsp;GPU inside my rig, with a fresh install of windows,
 trying to figure out what is wrong and what is causing the DirectX Graphics Kernel, Microsoft Corporation to cause all these problems.<br />
On top of that, to eliminate any problems related to audio drivers or bad integrated sound card, I used sound from my AT2020 USB+ microphone which has a dedicated sound card. Same thing happened when using sound directly from the microphone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S - Before you post the usual, yes I did everything a sane person would do. Changed the power settings to be at&nbsp;high performance, removed from&nbsp;BIOS&nbsp;any power management related setting,&nbsp;Removed drivers and&nbsp;reinstalled them using DDU, did a fresh installation
 (not even reset) of windows, changed cables of each and every component, updated my GPU to a new one, completely removed my GPU and used the Integrated GPU, changed ram slots, removed any oc on&nbsp;CPU, GPU, RAM&nbsp;etc etc etc. Please, for the&nbsp;love&nbsp;of God&nbsp;and everything
 holy, help me find the issue. It's been 20 days that I cannot do anything on my PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S 2 - SPECS: </p>
<p>Mobo: MSI z170 m7 Gaming<br />
CPU: i7 6700K<br />
GPU: MSI GTX 1070 Gaming X (Prior: MSI GTX 970 Gaming)<br />
Ram: HyperX Savage @2144 (2400 OC) 8G (1 stick, planning to purchase more in the near future)
<br />
</p>
<p>P.S 3 - The highest reported ISR change from time to time, including different services (USB, Audio, NVM (when NVidia card is installed), network etc)</p>
<p><br />
P.S&nbsp;4 - Latency Mon Report (Displays Win 8 as my operating system, I suppose it's a bug as it was just updated to windows 10 compatibility)
<br />
</p>
CONCLUSION<br />
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
Your system appears to be having trouble handling real-time audio and other tasks. You are likely to experience buffer underruns appearing as drop outs, clicks or pops. One or more DPC routines that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be executing
 for too long. One problem may be related to power management, disable CPU throttling settings in Control Panel and BIOS setup. Check for BIOS updates.<br />
LatencyMon has been analyzing your system for&nbsp; 0:00:53&nbsp; (h:mm:ss) on all processors.

&nbsp;REPORTED HARD PAGEFAULTS<br />
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
Hard pagefaults are events that get triggered by making use of virtual memory that is not resident in RAM but backed by a memory mapped file on disk. The process of resolving the hard pagefault requires reading in the memory from disk while the process is interrupted
 and blocked from execution. </div>
<div>NOTE: some processes were hit by hard pagefaults. If these were programs producing audio, they are likely to interrupt the audio stream resulting in dropouts, clicks and pops. Check the Processes tab to see which programs were hit.

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the issue you are facing and appreciate&nbsp;for providing the&nbsp;detailed information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the methods provided below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>:&nbsp;Check if the issue persists in Clean Boot state. <span>
A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows
 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>*
</span><span>Place the computer in a Clean Boot and check if the issue is occurring due to any third party programs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the link to view the steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>

            The problem still occurs when I am on clean boot mode.&nbsp;As I stated, I&nbsp;installed each and every driver of my motherboard. As I also said, I used an external sound card (microphone with integrated sound card) to check if the problem persists. The problem
 is not related to sound. Something is messed up with dxkrnl.sys&nbsp;since the latest windows update that causes high DPC latency, causing the dropouts and the cracking sounds

            <p>This is a huge problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the exact same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Huge ISR time for the directX Kernel.</p>
<p>There are also enormous amounts of people on the Nvidia support forums with pascal GPU's that are reporting similar issue. &nbsp;There may be something to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also done every conceivable manner of debug. &nbsp;I tried tracing but couldn't find nvidia symbols nor could I get the directX symbols to help figure out what within directX was interrupting all the time.</p>

            Microsoft seems to ignore that. After hours of digging, I found out that if I enable&nbsp;game boost in my motherboard (z170 m7 from MSI) and get an automated overclock of my cpu, I reduce the&nbsp;DPC latency to a steady 500 ms (from steady 1000) I still get pikes
 though with dropouts and cracks. I believe the problem lies to bad communication with windows and cpu/mobo. By the way, if I disable C-states and any power management from motherboard I do not reduce the DPC latency. Please, at least aknowledge the problem
 Microsoft so we know you are going to fix this. This is the worst I've seen from Microsoft in ages. Seriously who even releases such a big update without checking guys.&nbsp;I was an insider for Pete's sake and I had more stable versions of Windows in the past!!

First removed&nbsp;and then&nbsp;updated _everything_. No change whatsoever. Had no problems prior the update.

            <p>Same problem here. Updated to Anniversary yesterday (9/9/2016) and since then am getting DPC latency spikes of 5000-7000 us on dxgkrnl.sys when playing games. &nbsp;My games will literally freeze for about 0.5 seconds when this DPC spike occurs. The spike itself
 happens about every 3-5 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalling and reinstalling graphics driver made no difference.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ahaa. Atlast found what I was looking for.</p>
<p>This issue has created my machine into a self styled Heater.</p>
<p>First of all I faced some flickering/popping audio from System. Then my games started crashing as only feasible way to use the system is a Force Restart, which I believe has done by me close to 200 times since update.</p>
<p>Yes it is a notable bug and DPC latency level while gaming are: 16250 + us.</p>
<p>Please address this major disaster before somebody's system explodes.</p>

            <p>I was actually happy to find this. I guessed that it had something to do with the Anniversary update but was not sure. I have the exact problem and also reinstalled windows 10 several times but still have the problem. I am using a Komplete Audio 6 DAC and
 am seeing Latency of 1457 us making my computer impossible to use for Audio and Music Production. When I close Ableton Live Suite 9 the latency drops to 600-746. This is with a buffer setting of 2 ms if I drop it to 1 ms the latency climbs to 2,300. What is
 going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have noticed that this problem seems to have occurred only after the update to 1607 Windows Anniversary Edition.&nbsp; I will report this to Ableton but I do believe now that its a windows problem and its the same drivers</p>

    <title>Experience with Narrator and Magnifier. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Experience with Narrator and Magnifier.</h2>
                    <p>Hello Manga here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to share my experience with Narrator and Magnifier here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Game I tried it on: Sea of thieves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Platform: Xbox One X With Headset and Wireless controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Experience:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I first tried Narrator on the Xbox Home and was largely impressed by it all. The only issue I had was sometimes it would mispronounce words, for example I have a friend who has reaper in his name. we mostly all know how to pronounce reaper, but the narrator
 pronounces it as rapper, quite comical really but as you can guess it doesn't help our friends using narrator to find HIS friends or add them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went into Sea of Thieves since its the game I currently play. The narrator didn't work at all with that. I don't know if its the same for everyone.</p>
<p>So I then used Magnifier to talk to the barkeep at the tavern you start in. It zoomed the game to the top left of the screen using the left analog to scroll around. this makes the text bigger and very clearly readable, I can see this being useful to people.
 The only problem I had, though understandable, because you use left analog to scroll around the screen this means you cannot aim, turn or anything. so when using it you need to make sure there are no skeletons or people around as you would be a sitting duck
 so to speak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for reading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is Manga Blasting off again..</p>

            I'd recommend finding the appropriate place on the Xbox website to submit this feedback as it could be very helpful in making the services even more useful than they already are to the people who rely on using them. Not to say the forums isn't a valid
 place, but it isn't as likely to get noticed here.&nbsp;

            Narrator is especially good when used in the console system reading. I may find kinda logical to fail somethings here and there in-game related.

<p>Hey ThisGameIsSucky</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted it here because my ambassador mission suggested it be posted here. since this isn't a feedback sort of post its my opinion given my experience with it. Thus a discussion..If that makes sense?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I figure they would check here since they suggested it be put here..hopefully they do.</p>

<p>Yeah agreed. I use thick glasses to see and have a problem with my right ear. so I can often miss some key details or words simply because of them and I found narrator to be helpful in those cases. to be honest I didn't even know about it until the release
 of the adaptive controller lol</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has narrator always been there?</p>

<h2>            Changing from Outlook to Yahoo Email Client</h2>
                    
<p>Im using my yahoo for all email on windows 7, but when I want to send a web page by link or by page itself, my computer brings up "outlook" . I went to internet properties, and programs, but windows 7 does not have an email "drop down" menu to set Yahoo
 as my default pop server settings. How can I set Yahoo up for all email?<br />
<br />
Thank you!</p>

            Making Yahoo email the default involves the use of the Yahoo Toolbar.&nbsp; It is supposed to include a small application that places Yahoo email as a selection to use under 'Internet Properties|Programs|Email'; this section doesn't exist under Vista or Windows
 7, it has been replaced by 'Control Panel|Default Programs|Set your default programs'.&nbsp; Theory would hold that, after installing the Yahoo Toolbar, Yahoo Mail would become selectable from Default Programs as the default email client.&nbsp; From what I've read,
 this does NOT happen and&nbsp;the Yahoo Toolbar app. needs to be updatd to accomodate both Vista and Windows 7.&nbsp; Since you have an AT&amp;T/Yahoo account, you can use Outlook, Windows Live Mail, Thunderbird, etc. using these account settings:<br />

<h2>            fan is running at full speed</h2>
                    <p><span>I have a problem with a fan because it is running at full speed all the time. It is an old problem which I am unable to fix. I think the OS cannot detect the hardware and force the fan to run at full speed.
 It is Dell Precision T3500, Windows 10, ver. 10.0.17763.</span></p>

            Hi Rhonda, my name is Max and I'm an independent advisor.
<br />
<br />I suggest you run hardware diagnostic tests. This can help to identify what the issue may be and provide you troubleshooting steps to help resolve the issue. Refer to the article below <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/04/sln115162/resolve-hardware-issues-with-built-in-and-online-diagnostics-epsa-or-psa-error-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/04/s...</a>
<br />If diagnostic tests don't help, you can try to contact Dell Technical Support to get further assistance <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/incidents-online/us/en/19/contactus/Dynamic?lwp=rt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dell.com/support/incidents-online/u...</a>

            Hi Rhonda
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />It appears this system is not certified compatible with Windows 10. All the drivers pre-date Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce an incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include: rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />If you need help with downgrading to the original working version of Windows you had prior to upgrading to Windows 10, do let us know.

            HI Rhonda.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The issue and error are from Dell and pertain to their hardware so you'd need to get more help from them.  I found these Dell forums threads that seem to pertain and may also help:

<br />
<br />You might also find help here if the issue is solely fan speed since it can be adjusted in some cases:

<br />
<br />The best freeware solution for adjusting fan speed has always been SpeedFan as discussed here:

<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
