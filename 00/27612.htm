<p>
</p><p>I was easily able to simulate what you are seeing, but it is not due to a bug in Microsoft Project. &nbsp;Your problem (and mine) is caused by column widths and printing at 100% scaling. &nbsp;The first thing you should do to solve the problem would be to narrow the
 width of each column, especially the Task Name column, until all columns fit in the PDF, or nearly fit. &nbsp;Then I would recommend you follow these steps as well:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click File &gt; Print and then click the Page Setup link near the bottom of the page.</li><li>In the Page Setup dialog, click the View tab.</li><li>On the View page of the dialog, select the Print All Sheet Columns option.</li><li>Click the Page tab.</li><li>Set the Adjust To value to increasingly smaller and smaller values and look at Print Preview until you see the columns now fit.</li></ol>
<p>Just a thought. &nbsp;Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            N95 - Phonebook issue</h2>
                    Some contacts won't show when the call me. It will just show their number instead of their name.<br />
I've seen no similarities between them (checked number, location in phonebook, name, letters, numbers, language etc.)<br />

Does anybody else have this problem? And maybe have a solution?<br />

            It sounds like you've got that person's number in your phone book twice... therefore the phone doesn't know which to display and just shows the number.<br />
<br />
Delete one entry, and see what happens when they call again.<br />
<br />
It could be one on your SIM card and one on the phone memory.

            Thanks for the fast reply, but that's not it. I have no contacts on my SIM and there are no doubles. I actually deleted some and re-entered them, and still the same problem with exactly the same contacts.

            I also have had the same issue and several of the names wouldnt delete out of the phone book, I took one to an authorised Nokia repair centre they said it was a software issue but couldnt sort it as Nokia had'nt sent them the software for N95 yet.Orange
 exchanged the phone 4 times and in the end they gave me a new phone and sim and this has resolved the issue

            Yep. I have the same issue. PLUS ALL the calls in the call log have the mobile icon.<br />
<br />
I have reported both issues to Nokia (I am sure they are related). I encourage anyone else experiencing this to report it as well. Maybe than Nokia will get off their $*&amp; and fix the problem.<br />
<br />
It's really sad that S60v3 might have the greatest Contacts application ever, but it seems to be crippled on Nokia N95 due to completely fixable software bugs with the Call Log.

            The original problem is almost invariably due to duplicate numbers in the phonebook.<br />
<br />
A visual check is very difficult to do: the only reliable way to isolate these problems is to take a number that you know is giving problems and use the LATEST version of Search (so normally that's NOT the version that came with the phone but one you've downloaded
 and installed in the last couple of months) to search for PARTS of the number.<br />
<br />
The reason you have to search for parts of the number is to handle number formatting differences. If you had:<br />
<br />
"0208 123 4567"<br />
"020 8123 4567"<br />
"02081234567"<br />
<br />
in your phone this would cause a problem, however searching for "0208 123 4567" would NOT find either of the other two while in this case, searching for "4567" would find all 3.<br />
<br />
You would probably have to try a number of different parts of the number depending on how many different formats you use.

<h2>            Can a tenant for a company have two sets of email addresses&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>

<p>Hopefully this an easy question. &nbsp; I am working with a charity and in the process of listing the users I will be shortly provision for them. The charity is made up of&nbsp;</p>
<p>CompanyA &nbsp;- &nbsp;will have a unique email addresses e.g. *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &nbsp;</p>
<p>external site exists&nbsp;</p>

<p>CompanyB &nbsp;Will have unique email addresses *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>New external site is being built ( not in office 365 or Azure)</p>

<p>Now when I come tor provision companyB users, I note that some of the managers will have @companyA.com email addresses &nbsp;(IDs). &nbsp;These users have transferred from CompanyA and want to keep their current email address. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, can I assume this won't be an issue for a single tenant as all users will be assigned the appropriate license. Can you please confirm this this case and I won't have doing anything with AzureAD services to accommodate both sets of users</p>

<p>Yes, you can use multiple domains in the same O365 tenant, provided you add/verify them first (and set them as Exchange Online domains in order to use them for email aliases).</p>

<h3> mjgold  say:</h3>
<h2>            LONG delays sending email from earthlink.net account through outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>I am seeing a lot of questions about this but no answers.&nbsp; There is a problem with Outlook.com servers; it is not with anyone's individual computers or the software program anyone is using.&nbsp; This problem occurs using Outlook.com's web site -- on any computer,
 Outlook 2013, or the Mail App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several earthlink.net addresses that I use for personal and business, and have added them to my Outlook.com account.&nbsp; For months, I had NO problems using Outlook.com to send an email from "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" to anybody.&nbsp; Then right around November
 1, those emails starting getting delayed,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I send someone an email from my outlook.com address, it goes through immediately, If I send it from my earthlink.net address, it takes 15 - 24 hours to get from "hotmail" to "earthlink" and then earthlink delivers it to the recipient right away. If I
 go to earthlink's web site and send an email from my earthlink.net account, it gets delivered right away. So the problem is only a sent message getting from hotmail to earthlink. I can provide email headers that show the delay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tonight I added a gmail account to outlook.com; when I send an email from "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" it gets delivered right away.&nbsp; So the problem seems to be with hotmail sending to earthlink.&nbsp; Perhaps it's a problem with POP accounts????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, somebody give me some ideas.</p>

            <p>Thank you for replying Ajay. I removed then re-installed one of my earthlink.net accounts tonight, signed out, signed in, sent a message to my "outlook.com" address, and so far it has not arrived. I will check in the morning to see if it arrived over night
 but when sending an email from my "live.com" address it was delivered immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should mention that I have 4 earthlink accounts and they ALL have the same problem, so I doubt it was an issue with the particular earthlink.net account.&nbsp; As I mentioned, I can send you headers from the emails that will show the delay in being sent from
 "hotmail.com" to "earthlink.net".</p>
<p>
What do you suggest now?&nbsp; Again, thank you.</p>

            <p>No. For months, I was sending in emails demonstrating the problem. Weeks would go by, I'd email to ask what was going on, and they'd ask for another sample. Literally months. Finally I was emailed this:</p>
<p>
</p><div><span>"Firstly, accept my apologies for the delay in regards to this issue. I would like to deliver the news here regarding the main issue "delayed delivery to Earthlink.net" email addresses. After our complete investigation by our PG team we have come
 to a conclusion that the issue has to be dealt between Microsoft and Earthlink.net. Earthlink.net would need to reach out to us directly in order to get this issue resolved.

<div><span>Once again, apologies for the delay on this issue. Going forward, I will be closing this case as unresolved.
</span></div>
<div><span>Thanks,</span></div>

<p>
</p><p>And that was it. Case closed. Too bad customer. I emailed to ask why Earthlink needed to contact Microsoft, why MS couldn't contact Earthlink, and got no answer. Service that I got from "customer service:" none. Their reputation remains deserved.</p>

            Just made the mistake of trying to move my parents over to Outlook.com by setting up smtp send-only and forwarding new emails from EarthLink (to avoid the 30 min pop check delay).
<br />
It is now almost Aug 2015.. I see posts for well over a year that this has been going.&nbsp;
<br />
Knowing how they work, I assume it is just MSFT support's answer is to let the ticket remain open and just close it as resolved once their manager asks about why the ticket is aging.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
I am sadly going to have to move them to Gmail instead.

<p>Thanks for your posting. However sorting or prioritizing Tasks by different categories like PC is not feasible in Outlook for Mac. For this requirement, some users have same concern with you. I suggest you to vote via

<h2>            Permission level required for Site Owners to Close or Delete their Site&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Using SharePoint 2013 Online. My site owners have Design permissions. I have applied a Site Closure &amp; Deletion policy which sends the notification to the site owners that their site will be closed/deleted soon. The email contains instructions on how they
 can postpone the deletion but it seems that Design permissions are not enough for them to even see the 'Site Closure and Deletion' link under the 'Site Administration' section of 'Site Settings' for their own site as per the instructions.&nbsp; I had to give them
 Full Control in order for them to see it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the normal setting I must use for all my site owners? Seems a bit much and odd to have to give them Full control when Design seems plenty.

            Hi Jos,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks for your clarification.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To use Site Closure and Deletion function in Site Settings &gt; Site administration, Design permissions is not enough and we need to add a Manage Web Site permission to it. The Design permission level is a default permission level, therefore, we need to custom
 a permission level with both Design permission and Manage Web Site permission. Then, assign the new permission level to the users and they can view the Site Closure and Deletion option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To add Manage Web Site permission to Design Permission level, please follow the steps I provided in my last post.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Shirley<br />

<p>I agree this seems like an oversight in Outlook 2016 for Mac!</p>
<p>have a supplementary question about this. If users subscribe to an Office265 group (in Outlook 2016 for Windows), will they then be able to see and reply to group messages/threads when using Office 2016 for Mac?</p>

<p>hi cloud,</p>
<p>the answer is yes. when users subscribe to an office365 group, all group conversations and calendar events will be sent to both the group mailbox and your personal inbox. even if you can’t access the group on mac, after subscribing to it, you’re able to
 see messages and conversations in your own mailbox and reply to them. group calendar events will sync with your own calendar. here is my test to illustrate the question:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;after user4 sends email to group2, admin white on mac can see it in his inbox:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c26a5b62-d071-4e56-95a0-ccae84fd01e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c26a5b62-d071-4e56-95a0-ccae84fd01e3" /></a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;events are created on the group2 calendar on windows, the test account, admin white can see those contents on his own mac calendar after he accepts the invites.</p>

<p>hi cloud,</p>
<p>it would be&nbsp;a good idea to access the group and add it to favorites in owa online on your mac. you can use features of groups on owa for mac like the way on owa for windows. here is a test screenshot made on mac:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59cb1a65-e5de-41ba-b03b-0934b72d4eef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59cb1a65-e5de-41ba-b03b-0934b72d4eef" /></a><br />

</p><p>Good day and welcome to Skype Community! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how important your concern is since we are dealing with your hard-earned money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your account's purchase history, I can only see a solitary order placed on September 28th. However, the charge on September 30th&nbsp;is not under this account. Do you have another account?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, have you received any email notification for the September 30th charge? I suggest you check your inbox&nbsp;since we never miss out in sending email notifications&nbsp;for every&nbsp;transaction with Skype.&nbsp;From there, please&nbsp;check the Skype Name that will show up
 on the delivery report.</p>

            I'm afraid we're mostly volunteers here, not MS employees, so can't help with the refund. &nbsp;However, from the details you included above (and thanks for quoting it directly!) it seems that you first have to select a specific order (ie, your Office purchase)
 before you can see the details link mentioned.
<div><br />
<div>But backing up a bit to clear a few things up:</div>
<div><br />
<div>There's no need for the compatibility pack; &nbsp;that's actually so that earlier versions of Office can open/edit files from Office 2007 and onward. &nbsp;You don't need it in Office 2007/2010 to open files from earlier versions of Office.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You may be running into a problem with file corruption; if you moved these files to the current computer from another PC, try doing that again via some other means. &nbsp;Email, portable hard drive, thumb drive, SkyDrive (free online storage from MS) and so
 on.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Or the new version of PPT may be "protecting" you (yes, from yourself ... how clever of it, yes? &nbsp;No.) &nbsp;Depending on your security settings it may refuse to open files you've downloaded/received by email.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Try rightclicking on one of your files that won't open. &nbsp;Choose Properties. See if there's anything about the file being blocked (or words to that effect) at the bottom of the general tab. &nbsp;If so, remove the check mark, then try opening it in PPT.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result of a MONTH() function is always a number.&nbsp; Perhaps you are getting January because the cell has been Custom formatted or the cell is blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this formula to get the month</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(G4="","",TEXT(G4,"mmmm"))</p>

If the cell is formatted as "mmmm" then 2 is the second day of the year, which falls in January.<br />
With 32 you get February.<br />

<br />seems fake, are they known to be related?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Hello Andre
<br />
<br />Short answer: Absolutely and completely fake.
<br />
<br />Can't speak to whether or not the phony phone call and email are "related" but MS would never phone you and the link in the email you rec'd is not legit even though it appears to be on its face.
<br />
<br />It's always very prudent to check any link to ensure that what you see is actually what it points to whether allegedly from MS, Paypal etc etc. That's done by hovering over the link and looking at where it actually points to or "right-clicking" on the link --&gt; select &lt;Copy&gt; --&gt; paste it into any text editor (i.e. NotePad)
<br />
<br />In your case, the link in the email that appears as
<br /><a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Reactivate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Reactivate</a> 
<br />actually points to
<br />
<br />http://   help-supportpebha.dynv6. net   /   7qhnq/oauth2/index.php?authorize&amp;client_id=4345a7b9-9a63-4910-a426.......................................
<br />
<br />*** I added the spaces in the link above to void it as a valid link that someone can click on as well as truncating the full link. 
<br />Point is that "help-supportpebha.dynv6.net" has nothing to do with MS
<br />
<br />On a much simpler note, the easiest way to check to see if anything needs to be done on any of your accounts is to simply log into it normally and never click on a link contained in an email.

            I have no experience on Access app. I think you can use an unbound textbox to hold the string you want to display and then use some code to convert the string to number for insert into database.

<h2>            Apps Constantly Launch on their own</h2>
                    Iam having problems where windows keeps launching a few applications without my knowledge. I have already ruled out viruses and malware so that leaves me to assume it is something in the latest insider preview build as it hadnt occured previously to the

            <p>I have noticed things about this problem.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Those that do come up are ones that you have opened recently.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; They are at full screen.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; They do not launch but just put the tile at full screen.&nbsp; If you want to really launch you have to click on the tile.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; As reported by Ronnie clicking om the Un-maximize icon in the upper right before closing will keep it from reappearing.&nbsp; I also that the clicking does not reduce the size on the screen.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; I had some different ons show uo as they were ones that I used.</p>

            Actually I can blow a hole in your logic there as omly recently used applications because the setting app I hadn't opened for a week and the same goes for the windows store. I rarely use those.

    <title>When deleting browsing history IE9, multiple Rundll32 processes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nervez  say:</h3>
<h2>            When deleting browsing history IE9, multiple Rundll32 processes running 100&#37; CPU</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Well i've managed to discover once I delete my browsing history multiple rundll32.exe processes will start running at 100% cpu and keep on running non stop unless I kill the process manually.<br />
<br />
After using Processexplorer it shows the following command line;<br />
<br />
''rundll32.exe C:\Windows\system32\inetcpl.cpl,ClearMyTracksByProcess Flags:25035 WinX:18 WinY:11 IEFrame:0007032A''<br />
<br />
I checked for malware etc as well, which didn't seem to be the case since I had none.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any kind of solution I'd be happy to hear!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Bearing in mind that there is no formal support from Microsoft for IE9 Beta and that you are testing this software &amp; will eventually need to uninstall it anyway...</p>
<p>&nbsp; • How do I uninstall Internet Explorer 9 Beta?<br />

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/help/ie-9/how-do-i-install-or-uninstall-internet-explorer-9</a></p>
<p>Does the behavior persist if you uninstall IE9 Beta, reboot twice and do NOT reinstall it?</p>
<p>Note: One uninstalls Windows Internet Explorer 9 via Installed Updates, not Programs and Features. Uninstalling IE9 Beta will automatically restore the previous IE version (i.e., IE7 or IE8).</p>

<h2>            Forms - legacy text fields - formatting</h2>
                    
<p>Windows 7, Word 2007. Creating forms using legacy text fields. Some fields will not keep format assigned to them; i.e., I have the text field set to Times New Roman 12; I protect the form and then try to enter data - the text appears as Times New Roman 14.
 Unprotect, reset, protect ... same problem.</p>
<p>Not all fields are behaving this way. Note: the basic body of the form was copied from a Word 2003 document and pasted. Some fields that were pasted are behaving, some are not.</p>

<p>Hi girardta</p>
<p>If you insert a new field in place of one that's misbehaving does it work properly?</p>
<p>Field codes (the { } brackets you see when you toggle the codes with Alt+F9) can become damaged. They store a lot of information "under the covers" and if that gets mixed up, somehow, the behavior can get odd. There's no way to fix them, so when a field
 starts to be "off" it's usually a good idea to reconstruct it from scratch...</p>

<p>If I delete the mis-behaving field and insert a new one in its place using the Developer tab, the newly inserted field shows the unwanted font size.</p>
<p>If I copy an existing field that has the correct font size from a different portion of the form and paste it where the mis-behaving field is located, it then become mis-behaved as well.</p>
<p>If I select the entire form and set it to Times Roman 12, the mis-behaving fields continue to show Times Roman 14.</p>
<p>It seems as though THAT particular space in the document is haunted, and no matter what I do, I can't get rid of the wrong font size.</p>
<p>Incidentally, before I retired and was using Word 2003 at the office, the same problem cropped up from time to time.</p>
<p>It seems to be an inherent defect in Word. I really dislike Word 2007 - the older version was so much easier to use.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Is this particular space a paragraph? Is it formatted with a different style?</p>
<p>What happens if you press Enter in the paragraph just before or just after the problem one and insert a text field in that? Does it maintain the correct formatting? If yes, would it work to delete the problem paragraph and use the new one?</p>

<p>Deleting the field and inserting a new one from the menu has no effect.</p>
<p>It's as if the cell in the table where the field resides has something wrong with it.</p>
