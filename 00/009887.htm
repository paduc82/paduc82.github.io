<h2>            Assigning Text Message Ringtone to Individual Contacts not Working</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought Nokia Lumia 830 Windows 10 Mobile Build 14393.189 updated. Problem is I have assigned particular text message ringtone to a contact but whenever I receive text&nbsp;message from that contact the default text message ringtone sounds up instead
 of the one that I have assigned to that contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the problem? Please resolve this issue.</p>

            Hi Adil,<br />

Let's get this resolved. You can perform a soft reset when an app or phone isn't working as it should. This won't delete any of your files and it's as good as taking off the battery. To know more what a soft reset can do, click

<p><span>Hi Alexa,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I assume you open the workbook from Excel Online then get the error message.
</span></p>
<p><span>To explain that, having data linking to a different workbook is the feature only supported for Excel desktop client. For your concern about this feature to work for Excel Online,
 we would like to suggest you vote this UserVoice: <a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/274580-excel-online/suggestions/10366332-links-between-spreadsheets-in-excel-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Links between spreadsheets in Excel Online</a> to make our products and services better for you and others. From the UserVoice, it is said that this idea has been added to backlog by the related team.
</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to use the feature that getting data linking with different workbook, you only can use it in the Excel desktop client app. If you want to use the feature with two
 workbooks stored online, you can follow the steps below as a workaround:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Upload the two workbooks to a document library.</li><li>Sync the document library to your local computer.</li><li>Open these two workbooks from the local sync folder.</li><li>Re-create the data link connection.</li><li>In this way, when you open the workbooks on the desktop client, the linked data is also refreshed automatically. And the data will be synced to cloud.</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Rena</span></p>

<p>Have you tried a different SIM ? Borrow from friends / family members to see if the same happens with &nbsp;other SIMs too.. If not, get your SIM replaced thru' your Operator.. If it happens with all SIMs you may first try re-installing the Firmware. Else, you
 need to visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Care</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Also, check if it makes any difference without the Memory Card being inserted ..</p>

<h2>            scanpst.exe doesn&#39;t exist</h2>
                    
<p>I've been setting up my new computer for over a week and every step forward seems to result in two steps back. Last night, I started Windows Easy Transfer for the 3rd or 4th time and, this time, it completed, about 15 hours later. Unfortunately, I didn't
 know I shouldn't use it for my Outlook setup. Now I cannot Send/Receive. It looks like everything came over great, even messages I should have deleted ages ago. My Contacts look good, etc. However, I get the error message about not being able to access my
 data file. I've read lots of answers regarding this, but most of them don't make sense to me. One answer included a link to a site that seemed really helpful, so I tried to follow its advice to copy my .pst file from my old computer. I must have done something
 wrong, because when I use that file as my default,<em> nothing</em> in Outlook is populated. So, I thought I'd try the .pst repair tool Outlook Help refers to, but I cannot find it, anywhere! I typed "scanpst.exe" into the Search field in the Start menu and
 came up with nothing; I managed to find the Microsoft Office\OFFICE14 folder and open it, but scanpst.exe isn't in it.</p>
<p>I'm running Windows 7 on an HP Pavilion laptop; I loaded Office Professional 2010 either yesterday or the day before (everything is taking so long, it's all running together) and set one of my email accounts up in Outlook and I was able to send and receive,
 but of course, I didn't have old messages, contacts, etc. Now I've messed that up with the Easy Transfer and I don't seem to have the repair program, but don't see how that could possibly be.</p>
<p>Surely would appreciate some help.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>If Outlook 2010 is installed, scanpst.exe should be in the folder C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14<br />
It seems that you have created a new profile in Outlook and thus a new PST file.<br />
Copy your original PST file to the new PC. I would put it in a new sub folder of My Documents called Outlook<br />
From Outlook open that PST file.<br />
Then set it as the default data file and you can then close the new empty PST file.</p>

            <p>Le Boule,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on what i read from the internet, compatibilitycheck.exe is a malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that even my Security Essentials and Windows Defender is updated, they did not detect the file as a virus or malware. &nbsp;It also caused trouble on the Security Essentials by not allowing it to turn on and it also makes the Security Center not to detect
 the Security Essentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whati have done is to run on safe mode and manually deleted the "Compatibility Verifier" folder located inside the system32 folder. &nbsp;After that, I installed and run "Malwarebytes Anti-Malware" and "Hitmanpro" to remove unwanted programs and repair the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards.</p>

            Well, some of the websites I visit via my phone's mobile browser saves my log in information and password while others do not.&nbsp; Most of them do.<br />
<br />
I think this is a website controlled issue and not so much a windows phone mobile browser issue, but you might go to Settings &gt; swipe over to the applications screen &gt; tap Internet Explorer &gt; check to make sure the "allow cookies on my phone" and "allow internet
 explorer to collect my browsing history" options are selected to see if this makes any difference.<br />

<p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Good Day! </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for that information.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To start with, are you using the latest version of Skype? Please be advised that one reason of having issues in sending messages and showing the status online to offline, itâ€™s because the Skype
 is not yet up to date. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With that, we highly suggest for you to uninstall and re-install the Skype application for Skype for Desktop
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10634/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10634/</a>, but if you are using Skype for Windows 10, just update the version of Skype.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

JimfDoherty</a>. Does using another USB cable give you the same behavior? How about inserting to a different USB port or another computer? In case that the issue still remains, you may reboot the phone by pressing and holding the volume down and the power keys
 for 10-15 seconds. If necessary, set the time and the date correctly.</p>

            <p>OK, you can do this with an <strong>Advanced Search/Replace</strong>, but you need to be careful (very careful!). &nbsp;It is a LOT quicker to do this than it is to read about it. &nbsp;But you need to read carefully, because you are about to perform a series of replacements
 using Word's little-known regular expression ability.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a copy of the document and <strong>save</strong> it (if this goes wrong, you lose all the text, so let's not take risks with the original, work on a copy!)</li><li>Go to <strong>Edit&gt;Find&gt;Advanced find and replace</strong></li><li>First, we need to "mark" the paragraph marks, because we do not want to lose them. It helps greatly to turn on your non-printing characters for this exercise, so you can see what you are doing. &nbsp;Click the Â¶ on the Ribbon until the blue paragraph marks appear.</li><li>In the "<strong>Find what</strong>" box, type <strong>^p</strong> &nbsp;-- that's a caret symbol and a lower-case letter p. &nbsp;Must be lower case. No spaces.</li><li>In the <strong>Replace with</strong> box, type <strong>$^p</strong> -- a dollar sign and a caret and a lower-case p. The dollar sign could be any other character you like, so long as it is NOT a digit and does NOT appear in the unwanted text (a-z, A-Z).</li><li>Click <strong>Replace All.</strong> &nbsp;This marks each paragraph mark 
<strong>Find what</strong> box, paste&nbsp;<strong>[!0123456789$]</strong> exactly like that, including the square brackets. The exclamation point tells Word to find any character that is NOT in the brackets, except itself.</li><li>In the <strong>Replace</strong> box, click <strong>Delete</strong> until you are sure there is
<strong>nothing</strong> in it.</li><li>Check the "<strong>Use wildcards</strong>" box. &nbsp;The use wildcards box will not be visible unless you click the&nbsp;
<span><strong>âˆ‡</strong></span> checkbox at the bottom left of the dialog.</li><li>Click <strong>Replace All.</strong> &nbsp;All the text will be removed apart from the dollar signs and numbers.</li><li>Go to <strong>Edit&gt;Find&gt;Advanced find</strong> again, and this time type a <strong>
$</strong> sign only.</li><li>In the <strong>Replace with</strong> box, type <strong>^p</strong></li><li><strong>CLEAR</strong> the <strong>Use wildcards</strong> checkbox.</li><li>Hit <strong>Replace all</strong>.</li><li>Now we are left with the numbers, and lots of blank paragraphs. &nbsp;To get rid of those, go back to the
<strong>Advanced Find</strong> dialog.</li><li>In <strong>Find What</strong>, type <strong>^p^p</strong> -- two carets and two lower-case p</li><li>In Replace with, type <strong>^p</strong> -- replace two paragraph marks with one.</li><li>Hit <strong>Replace all</strong>&nbsp;several times, until the number of replacements it shows stops decreasing. Typically, it will get down to 2 or 3 and be unable to go below that.</li></ol>
<p>There you go, job done. &nbsp;And as I said, a lot quicker to do it than to read it! &nbsp;For more, see&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-wildcard-characters-to-find-or-replace-text-610e37dc-bb2f-4a8b-8fa5-aa991160eafb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-wildcard-characters-to-find-or-replace-text-610e37dc-bb2f-4a8b-8fa5-aa991160eafb</a></p>

    <title>Bad car audio using bluetooth with Lumia 1520 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stabes---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bad car audio using bluetooth with Lumia 1520</h2>
                    
<p>Recently changed from a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 to a Lumia 1520. Great phone accept that the bluetooth connection to the audio system in my car is very flaky (which the Samsung wasn't). Audio quality, or rather audio connection is very haphazard. Songs play
 but sound like they've been put through some kind of rutting. There is jumping and drop out. But the odd thing is that it's intermittent. Sometimes there will be a perfectly good connection.&nbsp;I checked that the actual audio files were intact, which they are.</p>
<p>It seems to happen most when I skip tracks (although it doesn't all the time). The new track starts and it sounds like there is major signal loss. I can then pause the track for a while, and more often than not, when I start playing again it is sorted. It's
 all very strange.</p>
<p>I've been through the usual checks of turning everything off and on and removing the bluetooth connection and then re-establishing it. No help.</p>
<p>As I said, the system worked fine with my Note 2 and also continues to work with my daughter's S4 mini as my wife's LG G3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas anyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I recently updated the phone to Windows 8.1. But that's all I've done - and not sure if that qualifies as a firmware update. If not, how do I do a firmware update?</p>
<p>And what is a soft reset? Just turning the phone off and on?</p>

            yes u are up to date with the latest firmware. also go into the Store and check for any app updates - if there are any system app updates such as Display, Audio etc, update these.<br />
<br />
a soft reset is performed by pressing and holding the volume down and power buttons together until the phone turns off and vibrates.

    <title>Computer hijacked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcneillmama3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer hijacked</h2>
                    <p>Thursday afternoon, I was on my personal desktop computer checking my email, when I started getting all these warnings and a recording coming through my speakers that my computer had been infected with the Zeus virus and someone was hacking my financial
 information. It listed an error code 268D3 and instructed me to call a 1-888 number.&nbsp; It also said that if I exited that page or shut off my computer that MIcrosoft would seize my computer to prevent damaging their network.&nbsp; I called the number because I couldn't
 shut down my computer or exit that screen and that voice kept coming through my speakers over and over again.&nbsp; The guy on the phone had a thick Indian/Pakistani? accent. He seized control of my computer and kept saying that he was fixing the problem, but I
 coudlnt' tell he was doing anything. While he was talking to me I opened up AVG and started running it and the guy said, "I see you are using a free version of AVG, why are you using a free version? It won't protect your computer." Then he told me to quit
 moving my mouse because it was interfering with him fixing the problem.&nbsp; He then asked my about my antivirus. I figured this was phishing scam and he was trying to scare me into purchasing something over the phone to fix my computer.&nbsp; I told him, "Look either
 you fix this problem or this conversation is over because it sounds like you are trying to sell me something and I don't give out financial information over the phone.&nbsp; Then he hung up on me and my computer was unfrozen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>He even opened up my Notebook and typed a name, probably fictitious Daniel Hannaday Microsoft Technician and told me to enter my name and email address.&nbsp; So I asked him if you are remotely controlling my computer you should be able to see my email address
 somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a scam.&nbsp; I've checked my credit cards and bank accounts which are pretty well protected against fraud.&nbsp; My husband already had his identity frozen, IRS income tax refund scam, so he was sent a passcode from the IRS so no one can file a tax return
 in our name and try to get our refund. His social security number is frozen for the next 7 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I recommend that you run Disk Cleanup or CCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Delete temporary files</strong>. </p>
<p>To delete temporary files: Do a disk clÉ™anup. Click the <strong>Start</strong> button, in the sÉ™arch box, type
<em>disk cleanup</em>, and then, in the list of results, click disk clÉ™anup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And/Or </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>CCleaner</strong></p>
<p>One of the single-best system maintenance tools around. Can be used for cleaning junk, browser safety, startup management, and plenty more. A must have on almost every system.</p>

            <p>Hello pedro alexisnieto sanchez,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the forum entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can recommend you any SD Card brand but any of those you comment are compatible with Windows Phone. Your mobile phone particularly has to not exceed the SD Card more than 64Gb you only need to know that. I will recommend you to format the SD Card before
 you&nbsp;use it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To format the SD card </p>
<p>You can format the SD card in your phone to erase all files on it and start fresh.
<span>WARNING:</span> All your personal files and everything else on the SD card will be erased.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the App list, tap <span>Storage Sense </span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f9bd3c406-1ead-40fd-bee6-b6a3373fb58a%2fstorage-sense-icon_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap <span>SD card</span>, and then pan down and tap <span>Format SD card</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the <span>Format SD card?</span> message box, tap <span>Yes</span> to confirm and format the card.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information help you.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Focusrite Sarlett 212 and Skype for Business</h2>
                    I have seen posts about this in the past but have seen no solution. Is there a solution for Skype for Business not seeing the&nbsp;Focusrite Sarlett 212 audio interface? Windows utilizes it fine but when I open SfB it will not see it as an option.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Luke,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For cannot see the&nbsp;Focusrite Sarlett 212 audio interface, if you mean you cannot see it as an option under Options &gt; Audio devices in Skype for Business?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, please try to confirm you have upgraded your driver to latest in Windows (device manager &gt; Audio inputs and outputs &gt; right click the audio interface and Update driver).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please also confirm you have installed latest version of Skype for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, for the audio and video device in Skype for Business, it's recommended to use the certified&nbsp;USB peripherals and programs listed in the following link to get a better experience:</p>

    <title>Alignment of Stacked Text in PPT Textbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frank wood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alignment of Stacked Text in PPT Textbox</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>Hello, I have a user who is using stacked text in a text box in PPT 2007. When using a word such as â€œPREMIERâ€ the width of characters make it look odd.<span>&nbsp;</span>For example
 the â€œIâ€ and â€œMâ€ are aligned on the left side rather than centered under each other which makes the â€œMâ€ appear to stick out.<span>&nbsp;</span>Is there a way to center the characters horizontally even though the text is written vertically?</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>The only way I was able to do this was by creating 7 different text boxes, each with only one character, and nudging them into position by eye. This is not feasible as there are close
 to 200 slides in the presentation, it is an important presentation for the board of directors.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Any assistance is greatly appreciated!</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Instead of using "Stacked" just type normally with Text Alignment Horizontal and reshape the box vertically. That makes the letters centered horizontally and they are lined up underneath one another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I chose Text Alignment Stacked and resized the text box to be a vertical rectangle the letters were not centered horizontally as one might expect. I'm not sure I see the benefit of the "Stacked" option.</p>

<h2>            Migration to SharePoint Online throttled too much</h2>
                    <p>Hello good people,</p>
<p>

</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Basically we're doing a migration from SharePoint 2010 to SharePoint Online using ShareGate. We have over 450,000 documents (over 400GB in size). We are constantly facing
 throttling issues using the tool. We have configured the tool according to ShareGateâ€™s recommendations with the minimal level of requests, but we are still getting throttled and Office 365 is returning the following error: (429) Too Many Request". Retry at
 a later time.</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Since there is nothing else to configure on the tool, I was wondering if there is a way to change throttling limits on SharePoint Online? It was managable a couple weeks
 back, but now we can migrate literally 100 files a day...</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<h3> userage  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Lumia 920 unlocking request</h2>
                    I put in an unlock request with EE/TMobile 4-5 weeks ago and they still have sent me nothing, they are trying to blame the delay on Nokia by saying they haven't sent a code to them. How long does Nokia take to give an unlock code? I'm sure it is nowhere
 near 4-5 weeks, EE is just taking the **bleep**, I've called them 4 times and they keep telling me they've escalated the issue and I'll get the pin in 48hours(which has been said 3 times now). Is Nokia to blame here or TMobile?.. I mean if I chose to get the
 pin through one of the online websites it would have arrived in 10 days.. 5 weeks is a joke.

<p>Nokia supply SIM-free handsets to the networks, which then decide whether and how to lock them. Both the unlock codes and the unlock procedures are owned by the networks, not by Nokia, so any attempt by a network to refer the issue to Nokia is an outright
 lie. Nokia cannot do anything about unlocking a handset, it is 100% up to the network which has locked it.</p>

<h2>            Unable to Changing primary alias from a custom live domain to an outlook.com adress</h2>
                    I am trying to change my primary alias on my microsoft account. I have been using an Custom Live Domain email-adress and would now like to move away from that. So I need to change my primary alias but on my account page it says: Your organization's policies
 prevent you from changing your primary alias.

            <p>Here is what I did to correct the issue being unable to change the Primary Alias.&nbsp; Your mileage may vary and know that you are proceeding at your own risk. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a two-step process - create a new alias for the account and ensure it works.&nbsp; Then, visit the Windows Live Admin Center and delete the account associated with the external domain.&nbsp; This will "break," the link between the external domain account and
 the newly created&nbsp;alias.&nbsp; You're then free to make the new alias the primary one.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign out&nbsp;of everything and clear your browser's cookies. Microsoft recommended using
<em>Internet Explorer</em> several times in case there was an issue with the browser settings.&nbsp; I'll follow suit.</li><li>Visit the <strong>Microsoft Account Center </strong>at <a href="https://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Microsoft Account">
account.live.com</a> and sign in.</li><li>Click on <strong>Aliases </strong>under the <em>Account</em> heading in the left menu.</li><li>You should see your Primary Alias, with a message that indicates it cannot be changed.</li><li>Click <strong>Add Alias </strong>and complete the form.&nbsp; I used a Microsoft Outlook.com account, but you are free to use any alias outside of the domain in question.</li><li>Click <strong>Add Alias</strong> at the bottom to finish the process.</li><li>Confirm you have a Primary Alias and the new alias you've just created.&nbsp; Now, click
<strong>Sign Out</strong>.</li><li>Attempt to login to your account with the new alias and identical password.&nbsp; If this does not work, repeat steps 2-7.</li><li>Now, visit the <strong>Windows Live Admin Center </strong>at&nbsp;<a href="https://domains.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Microsoft Windows Live Admin Center">domains.live.com</a>.</li><li>You should see a list of domains associated with your Windows Live account.</li><li>While there may be only one, be sure to click the one that matches the domain of your account.</li><li>Click on <strong>Member accounts </strong>in the left menu.</li><li>You can view or delete accounts from this listing - click the <strong>Red X</strong> across from your account under the
<em>Delete</em> heading.</li><li>You'll receive the message, "Deletions Are Permanent."&nbsp; Try not to panic - remember you can still access the account via the alias you just created.</li><li>Your browser may redirect to an accounts page to reset the Primary Alias.&nbsp; If this does not occur, click
<strong>Sign Out</strong>, and login to <a href="https://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Microsoft Account">
account.live.com</a> using your alias.</li><li>You will have the option to add a new alias or assign an existing - use the one you just created.</li><li>Voila. If you visit the <strong>Aliases </strong>link in the <strong>Microsoft Account Center</strong>, you will now see that your newly created alias is the Primary Alias.&nbsp; You can subsequently add additional aliases and use the
<strong>Make Primary Alias</strong> option to&nbsp;change it.&nbsp; (Up to twice per week.)</li></ol>
<p>I am by no means an expert, and your account issue may or may not be related to the domain association.&nbsp; Feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer if I'm able.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

    <title>Powerpoint Morph Transition - Bug or &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Powerpoint Morph Transition - Bug or &#63;</h2>
                    Scenario:&nbsp;slide one you have a rectangle, you duplicate that slide... in slide two you&nbsp;change the size by dragging&nbsp;bottom/middle (handle) down&nbsp;to wherever.&nbsp;Using the Morph transition (great by the way)&nbsp;you would assume that all it would do is resize (grow
 down)&nbsp;which it does fantastically except for one minor detail as it is morphing down&nbsp;the top of the rectangle appear to be morphing as well - top will blur a little move up about 10 pixels (like a gradient)&nbsp;and fade when morph is completed,&nbsp;when done with
 an oval&nbsp;the same way (just dragging bottom center to resize)&nbsp;it shows&nbsp;no visual of a blur (which is correct IMHO). Was wondering if this is happening just with me or everyone - if the oval is doing the process correctly why not the rectangle? Thanks ahead
 of time for any input.

            <p>Doesn't happen here either. We have several installs of machines with very basic graphics to high spec PCs with Windows 7 and 10 so I guess it's not a general bug.

<p>
</p><p>My guess is it may be a graphics card driver problem but very hard to tell.</p>

<p>Will try to get that done today - thanks - like the other said it might be a graphic card issue but as stated if it was a graphic card I would think the oval would produce similar effects that the rectangle does....</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Edit:</em></p>
<p><em>After I posted this I decided to try the scenario again as I have yet to since I had just reformatted system and well low and behold it was an issue on my end evidently cause after the reinstalls etc. works great!</em></p>
<p><em>Thanks for the [grin] help you guys. Human error on my end I guess or just a drive that might needed some defrag, etc.</em></p>
