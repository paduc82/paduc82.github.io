Usually, it's also required to stop the WMP Network Sharing Service before rebuilding the library. Go to Start, type&nbsp;<strong>services.msc</strong> in the Search field, and press Enter. In Services, find the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service</strong>
 . If its status is&nbsp;<strong>Started</strong> , double-click the service and click&nbsp;
<strong>Stop</strong> .

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
First check if there are different entries for same media on your computer. If a song or a file is saved twice it may show you a duplicate copy as they are located at two different locations.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong></div>
<div>I would recommend you to rebuild the Windows Media Player database and verify if the issue is resolved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here is how:<br />
To resolve this problem, clear the Windows Media Player database. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Exit Windows Media Player.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click Start, click Run, type %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player, and then click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Select all the files in the folder, and then click Delete on the File menu.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: You do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Restart Windows Media Player.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note: Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.<br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong><br />
If this does not resolve the problem, clear the Windows Media Player database cache files.</div>
<div>To do this, follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Exit Windows Media Player.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click Start, click Run, type %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft, and then click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Select the Media Player folder, and then click Delete on the File menu.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Restart Windows Media Player.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

<p>Which browser do you use?</p>

<p><span>Run an IPCONFIG /all to see what the configuration settings are or to check if you are able to obtain an IP (internet protocol) address.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Hold <strong>Windows key + X </strong>on the keyboard<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>b. Now click on <strong>command prompt admin </strong>and<strong> type IPCONFIG /all</strong> and hit enter.</span></p>

    <title>Buying a headset for Xbox One - need recommendations and setup - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Buying a headset for Xbox One - need recommendations and setup questions</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I'm looking to purchase a new gaming headset but have some questions on setup and use before making a decision on one.&nbsp; I have never owned or used a gaming headset so I have little idea how they're set up except for a few things I read online.&nbsp; Currently,
 I have my cable box running through the Xbox One which is connected to my receiver which is connected to my TV.&nbsp; Everything is connected with HDMI.&nbsp; I did this to make everything simple for non xbox users in my household to simply turn on components (with
 a universal remote button push) and the whole system turns on and goes directly to TV - they can pretend the Xbox doesn't even exist.&nbsp; All audio is through the receiver/surround system as TV speakers (if you could call them that) are disabled.&nbsp; My question
 is, if I buy a gaming headset to play games and chat, I have to hook this up to the optical audio of the Xbox one to get game audio and chat (as well as a chat adapter typically).&nbsp; Will audio play simultaneously?&nbsp; i.e. will my home theater still play all audio
 through the HDMI connection while the headset plays audio through the optical connection?&nbsp; If so, if I muted sound on the home theater system, would that mute the headset or is completely independent?&nbsp; Typically I'm gaming or watching TV late at night so I
 use headphones jacked into my receiver to get audio and not disturb anyone (but obviously I can't use any chat that way).</p>
<p>So that brings me to my choice for a headset.&nbsp; I'd like something that simulates surround sound and has good quality sound, as I'd essentially like for the headset to be my only gaming audio if late at night, but want to have chat ability with friends.&nbsp;
 I'd need a decent mic to pick up my voice when I'm essentially speaking quietly late at night.&nbsp; I don't need fully wireless (only one real option on xbox one anyway), but I don't want a ridiculous amount of cables either.&nbsp; I need it to be able to set up so
 as not to greatly interfere with non xbox people to use the system as a normal tv and not have to switch audio outputs etc.&nbsp; Frankly I don't want to either.&nbsp; Is this possible to do?&nbsp; I've been looking at the Astro A50's, TB XP510, and Elite 800's mostly because
 of their theoretical audio quality.&nbsp; I'd love to be able to keep cost down, but it's not a limiting factor if it does what I want it to do.&nbsp; Any and all help is appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>With the Adapter all Sounds come throu the Controller ;-)</p>
<p>It depends very on your Budget there where Headsets from 60-300$</p>
<p>for example the XBOX One Stereo Headset is just linked to Controller like your Chat-Headset.</p>
<p>(Adapter is included) no other Cable</p>
<p>I believe some other Headsets have a axternal amp.</p>
<p>I &nbsp;never had a Headset Before, but now I got the Stereo and I like it. For EGO-Shooters it is better than just TV. And My Girlfriend can Needs not to hear the BANGPENGPENG.</p>
<p>But the diffrence between L+R is a Little bit Strong for my opinion.</p>
<p>I have never used another one so I can not tell you how good it really is..</p>
<p>may Others are much better.</p>
<p>But for the cheap Price compared to Polk 4 Shots and stuff, I think I am happy with it..</p>
<p>May you can test at a friends house...</p>
<p>And yes your AV System and and Headset can work simultan, but it will disturb you..</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions. &nbsp;For the A50's, I read a lot about poor mic quality and buzzing in the headset. &nbsp;Any personal experience with this issue and if/how you corrected it? &nbsp;Also, do you know if there is a significant difference between Gen 1 and Gen
 2 for the A50's? &nbsp;I'm still really up in the air here. &nbsp;A50's are said to be a little bass heavy whereas the XP510's are said to lack a little bass. &nbsp;Mic troubles in the A50, didn't read about any sort of thing with the 510's. &nbsp;The elites are harder to find
 a "deal" on so it really might be between the other two. &nbsp;Any specific reason the Astros over the Turtle Beach model? &nbsp;The turtle beach seems to allow more audio customization and has a few more connectivity features. &nbsp;I don't think either one will be bad
 just looking for a few &nbsp;more details. &nbsp;Thanks again.</p>

<p>Turtle Beach I hear are less durable and people complain about their comfort. Astro A50 excel on durability being a tank. Buzzing sound yes there is an annoying chimp on the right side, not noticeable when gaming though. Sound quality is meh average for
 its price tag, sound direction is what they are design for. Their customer service are horrible though. Comfort is great, slightly heavy though. I think the old A50 their Mixamp software can't be updated that is all. I'm hearing this combo is the most popular
 for getting the best of the best:</p>
<p>Sennheiser PC 350 SE with Astro Mixamp to make it work with console and give it 5.1 surround sound.</p>
<p>Its even more pricey than Astro A40/A50 mixamp bundle.</p>

 than anybody but there are going to be a few squadmates that wouldn't mind getting a piece of TIM it goes without saying Jack would want to go, Tali would like to go because they attacked one of the flotilla ships in Ascension, and well most any alien on your
 squad would probably like a piece of them.&nbsp; So who are you taking with you when you put TIM out of his misery?&nbsp; I am leaning towards Jack.

<p>Depends on which of my Shepard's I'm playing as lol... Have 5 Shepards all ready to carry over into ME3, only difference being three are Male, the others Female and have different LI's sooo...</p>
<p>Male Shepard1: Tali and Garrus. They've stood by Shepard since the beginning, so it's fitting to bring them along... that and this Shepard's LI is Tali.</p>
<p>Male Shepard2: Miranda and Grunt. Miranda for a few reasons, mainly being she's Cerberus and has knowledge of it's operations and she's this Shepard's LI. Grunt... well, he's just a powerhouse. Nuff said.</p>
<p>Male Shepard3: Ashley and Garrus. Similar reasons as with the first Male Shepard.</p>
<p>Female Shepard1: Liara and Garrus. Same reasons as Male Shepard 1 and 3.</p>
<p>Female Shepard2: Thane and Zaeed. Thane as he's this Shepard's LI and Zaeed for the same reasons as Grunt.</p>

    <title>Controller repair cancelled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> supremekai0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Controller repair cancelled</h2>
                    
<p>Exactly one month ago I did send in my Xbox One Controller to get it repaired (one analog stick was a little loose, and playing with it was very unprecise). I live in Germany and had to send my controller with UPS. I do have proof from UPS that my package
 arrived. Over the past month I was waiting for my controller to get repaired, today when I checked the status of the repair on the Xbox Service Center, I saw that the repair order was cancelled. I found out that it gets cancelled one montch after ordering
 the repair.</p>
<p>So someone at the repair center lost my controller... awesome! It was the Day One Edition Controller, and I would be pretty mad if it is just gone. I can't get help by the Xbox Support, since it is currently unavailable.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>

            <p>Thank you so very much for providing your tracking number to me, ATOM. I've looked into everything, and it seems that your controller was delivered. I've gone ahead and bubbled this all up to the appropriate teams. Please make sure your contact information is accurate on your account. And please do keep us updated on the situation! :)</p>

<p>Hey Cerb,</p>
<p>Thanks for taking your time and trying to find out solution for this issue.</p>
<p>Physically I am in Afghanistan and a few weeks ago I switched my Windows Live Account region also to Afghanistan (a week before updating). My Windows Live Account is not connected to my Xbox. Just I wanted to connect it to my Xbox in order to keep my save
 games and scores safe, so it asked for an essential update just before connecting and if I don't update, it won't connect.</p>

            <p>Hey again Ghost! Thanks for getting back to us!<br /><br /><strong>It looks like the issue lies with you being in Afghanistan, which is not a live supported region.</strong> Ordinarily, we would suggest using the USB update method instead of the download update method, but since this most recent update converts Microsoft Points into local currency, and Afghanistan is not a Live supported region, I think that's where the hangup is. Just for clarity, here's a list of <a href="http://www.xbox.com/live/countries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Live Countries and Regions</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Are you going to be in Afghanistan for long?</strong> I'm not sure if you live there or are just visiting.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you're just visiting, we can try seeing if we can get your console to do without the update until you are able to download it from a Live supported region.</li>
<li>If you live there, there's a couple things we can try to see if we can get your console to update even if you're not in a Live supported region.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />Let us know and we'll be happy to keep working with you to get this sorted. =)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Actually, lets clarify things, I'm an Afghan and hopefully will live here permanently ;).
</p>
<p>About the USB update, I also tried that, which came up with the same error code.</p>
<p>I have a question, how is Xbox knowing about the physical address? Does that us any build-in GPS? cause when updating, it did not ask me for sign-in.
</p>
<p>And one more thing that my Xbox is J-Tagged, I mean some sort of hacked which helps me play home brew games and playing directly from hard disk without need for the original disk. So does that effect the update and preventing Xbox from updating?</p>

<p>Hi Ghost,<br />
<br />
Seeing as you are in an <strong>unsupported region, AND you are using a modified console</strong>, we are no longer going to be able to provide you support.
<br />
<br />
For future reference, I would not suggest investing in a modified console.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Chances are there was a different reason ........ </p>
<p>They dont ban someone for ranking high on the leaderboards unless they see they cheated their way there..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about it ... with the hundreds of thousands of people on the leaderboards, dont you find it a bit suspicious that the 3 of them held positions 1, 2, and 9?</p>

<p>I'm sorry, I'm not following <strong>this.</strong> Are you saying that other people in their clan were banned who weren't even playing Black Ops?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, I highly doubt that's the case. You should really call out to <strong>MaTtks</strong>. He can fill you in on what was done to warrant a suspension.</p>

<h2>            nVidia Quadro FX 330 Driver for Win7</h2>
                    My company develops CAD applications. I have to check W7 compatibility with all of our products.<br />
My test machine specs:<br />
CPU: P4 3.0 GHz HT<br />
RAM: 2.5 Gb DDR2 533 MHz<br />
VGA: nVidia Quadro FX 300<br />
<br />
I know that Quadro FX 330 is not one of Win7 compatible video cards by it supports DX9 an SM 2.0<br />
Windows Update downloads FX 330 drivers automatically, but they are too old as for me (August 2006)<br />
I get lots of artifacts even on desktop with classic theme and continuous blue screens and errors with Aero interface which is supported by this graph. adapter.<br />
Can you update Quadro Series drivers since they are commonly used by our customers (in small business).

<h3> renljl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removable Storage Management in Windows 7 Home Premium - to use NT Backup Restore Utility &#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    How does one 'turn on' a feature in Windows 7 that apparently does not exist ? ..
<br />
found the procedure description in the NT Backup Restore site - but cannot find any reference to the feature in Windows 7.<br />
Therefore, cannot restore BKF file from my XP 'puter [which crashed/burned, unable to reload XP - motherboard was the conclusion by Geek Sqd].<br />
Suggestions ?.. short of purchasing specialty software for $100 or so ?: .. <br />
<br />
Thanks

<p><span><span>Hi<span> RENLJL,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may try running the restore utility in compatibility mode of Windows Vista and check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7da725e2-8b69-4c65-afa3-2a53107d54a7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7da725e2-8b69-4c65-afa3-2a53107d54a7</span></a><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>To run the Program Compatibility troubleshooter</span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, and then clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>. In the search box, type
<strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Under
<strong>Programs</strong>, click <strong>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</strong>.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</span></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the troubleshooter, browse to the program's
 setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something similar. The troubleshooter is not designed to work on programs that have an .msi file name extension.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If that does not help then r</span><span>efer to the link given below and try the steps
 given by ‘ChromaChem’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>These are the steps mentioned by the user.<strong>
</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>“</span></span></strong><span><span>Copy 3 files from an
 xp installation into a folder on the Windows 7 machine:<br />
ntbackup.exe<br />
ntmsapi.dll<br />
vssapi.dll <br />
<br />
These files are located in c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Run ntbackup.exe from the folder you created on&nbsp; the windows 7 machine.<br />
Click on do not show this message again when warned that removable storage service is not running.<br />

            Well.. to wrap up this thread ..<br />
I had a BKF file created under Windows XP that was corrupt.<br />
I do NOT have access to a PC with Vista - I do have access to a notebook with Windows XP.<br />
I am trying to recover my photos and music from the BKF file - and load the files to my 'new' Windows 7 machine ..<br />
<br />
Resolution - <br />
Purchase the software from SysTools and run it from my Windows 7 machine.<br />
<br />
Result:<br />
I was able to salvage my 7.5 gb of photos and 11 gb of music .. <br />
Cost me $89, but it is worth it to me .. for sure for sure .. <br />
<br />
Thanks for those that contributed ..

    <title>Can&#39;t read 720KB diskettes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> snappyuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t read 720KB diskettes</h2>
                    
<p>I bought a multi-format USB floppy drive to read some old word processor diskettes that are DSDD 720KB. While Vista recognises the plug &amp; play drive, it regards the diskettes as unformatted, but then is unable to format them.</p>
<p>I know XP removed the capability to format 720KB floppies, but according to MS the ability to read them (which is all I need) was retained.</p>
<p>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/302113/en-gb refers.</p>
<p>Has the ability to read such diskettes been removed now from Vista?</p>

<p>Have you considered the multi-format USB floppy drive you purchased it faulty. You say it's capable of formatting DSDD 720KB, but it faults. The only way to verify that your disks are valid, IMHO, is to take them to a WIN 98 machine that has a factory DSDD
 drive.&nbsp; Somewhere in the UK there has got to be either&nbsp;a WIN98 (will have a floppy drive) or an Amiga (CBM) user near you. Amiga's were able to read WIN disks via Cross-DOS. The only UK Amiga forum still functioning that I know of is:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.lemonamiga.com/</a></p>

    <title>Taskbar and system tray on Windows 8 does not refresh. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Taskbar and system tray on Windows 8 does not refresh.</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am having a problem that is becoming increasingly recurrent (daily basis) on my freshly installed Windows 8 PC. After a few hours of use, the typical symptoms are:<br />
<br />
- The clock will no longer be on time.<br />
- System tray icons are not in the correct place - or closed applications still appear there.<br />
- Left over icons remain in the task bar of applications that are no longer open.<br />
<br />
I have to constantly have to go back and forth between the desktop and the modern start menu in order to refresh the screen (doesn't work all the time either).<br />
<p>I am currently up to date in terms of Windows 8 updates.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Nadil.</p>

            <p>Hi Nirmal,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Many thanks for your reply - I found the cause of the bug. Apparently Coretemp doesn't handle Windows 8 well, I figured this out by the elimination process you suggested above. Consider the probem resolved for me.</p>
<p><br />

            Did the problem exist with the other mice you tried? Also a possible fix: search mouse settings in the start menu, press enter. Then click additional mouse options. Navigate to the pointer options tab and toggle the “enhance pointer precision” box. Probably
 didnt help, but just a thought

<p>The error code: 0x800f0826.</p>
<p>I already tried to install SP1 like 6 times. I tried using both Windows Update and the stand-alone installer downloaded from Microsoft. I also used the fix windows update tool and the 300 MB hot fix (KB947821). It fails always at 2%. I even tried installing
 from a clean boot and in Safe Mode. The some error all the time.</p>
<p>Any ideas? Is there a solution for these?</p>

<p>There's some kind of problem with SP1. Everyone is complaining. Those steps are basic aspects to look out for, but I think any user with some computer use experience always will have those steps into account.</p>
<p>The problem is related with the error message, not with a configuration problem or disk space available in the computer. Users ask for solutions not for answers that just fill the void.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I'm having one of those days with support teams...</p>

<p>Still fails with MSES and Spybot turned off. Mr Stuart, nothing in that link either applies to my case or made a difference. I've tried a clean boot, the hotfix, disk cleanup and it still fails at 2% after rebooting. My boot drive has 27.5GB free and my
 storage drive has 316GB. I'm running 64bit Win7 and I've been using Windows Update.</p>

<p>Nope, none of that helped.</p>
<p>Question...when checking my update history, I see that none of my previous updates are installed and the only update offered on the MS website is SP1. Does this mean that SP1 is the&nbsp;<em>only</em> resource I have for bringing my system up to date?</p>

<h2>            HBO GO not working on XBOX One, Microsoft Edge app, build 14393</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to get the hbogo.ro site to work on my XBOX One using Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>The HBO GO account works on Microsoft Edge on my laptop (BUILD 14393), it does work on&nbsp;Edge on&nbsp;my Lumia 950 XL (build 14393), but it does not work on Edge on my XBOX One (build 14393) -&nbsp;I get a message "Player error, try again".</p>
<p>What is the difference between the Microsoft Edge on XBOX, Mobile and PC? Are they completely different browsers? Is Edge a Universal App? Is there any solution to get HBO GO work on my XBOX, too?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hey, vrshetz! HBO Go itself has an app that you can use on the Xbox One console, instead of using Edge.</p>
<p>The issue you are likely running into is that the website uses Silverlight, and the Edge app on the console doesn't allow for Silverlight, Flash, or anything else that requires a "download". Additionally, the end of your link is ro, which gives me the hint that I believe you are located in Romania. <a href="http://www.xbox.com/live/countries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Live is currently not supported in Romania</a>. Outside of using the HBO Go app, we cannot offer any further suggestions to help get this running. Regions outside of our support boundaries will have varying experiences on Xbox Live that we cannot guarantee.</p>
<p>If you move to a region that we support, we will be more than happy to further assist you. Until then, if the steps above do not work for you, we suggest watching HBO Go on a device that it currently runs on. Thanks for understanding!</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback. HBO availability is up to the discretion of HBO so if you have questions regarding when it will be available in your region, you will want to reach out to them directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the rest, definitely head over to the <a href="https://feedback.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Feedback Site</a> and leave that feedback there so the appropriate teams can gather all the information. :)</p>

<h2>            Downloading a web page in Edge</h2>
                    I have upgraded to Windows 10 Pro from Windows&nbsp; 8.1 Pro yesterday.&nbsp; While I was using EDGE I could not find a feature that would allow me to download a web page.&nbsp; It was very easy to do so on the IE 11.

            <p>I presume you mean you want to <em>save</em> a web page. Believe it or not: Edge can't do that, yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Edge is due for a major upgrade in 2016. I'm pretty sure this function will be included in that. Until then, you can save a web page as a PDF.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Mouse 3500 Issue</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Microsoft Mouse 3500 and it's working smoothly on other computer devices except mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I face is, if I left my mouse for like <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
15 seconds</span> or more, when I try to move it again, it lags for like 1sec then continue moving around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to update/reinstall drivers and the windows. But the problem is still persistent.</p>
<p>I also tried all of the things like changing ports and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That problem has no existence on windows 7 only, and it runs smoothly there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Laptop Model : <strong>HP Pavilion 15-e052se.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope my problem would be solved asap.</p>

<p>I have also read and done everything in this article several times. Wondering if someone is going to look into this issue, as I am also having the exact same problem with my 3500 on my windows 10 desktop. After just a few seconds of the mouse being idle,
 it lags for a second or less when I go to use it again. It is extremely annoying, especially in video games. Please, resolve the issue. =/&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            c&#58;&#92;windows folder is 84GB&#33; Can I shrink it&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am out of c: drive space, so I poked around to find stuff to delete. In so doing, I found that the c:\windows folder is 84.6GB. Is this normal?? Is there perhaps some legacy fodder in there I can delete?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 7 Service Pack 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: It appears that 31.6GB is in the "Installer" sub directory, which basically contains hundreds of files ranging from 200MB to 20KB. Is there old stuff in here that can be deleted?</p>

            Thanks Andrew. I can't quite figure out what you mean for the first part, but I used CLEANMGR and it freed up about 7GB. That's a start, I suppose!

    <title>Wifi not reconnnecting on return from sleep after updating to Win 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> einglasschnaps  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi not reconnnecting on return from sleep after updating to Win 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello community<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problem:<br />
</p>
<p>Yesterday I updated both my Laptop and my tablet (Acer Iconia W510) to Win 8.1 and this left me with a connectivity issue on the tablet.<br />
In my home network, both devices still work fine after startup and waking up from sleep mode. But the tablet which I use at my university doesnt automatically connect to the wifi there anymore even though i check "Automatically connect to this network" everytime.
 After startup and waking up the symbol in the system tray shows a standing connection but after a few seconds it switches to "networks available" and I have to manually log back in, which works but its annnoying since I didn't have to do that before updating.
</p>
<p>Also the connection gets cut about every hour without the computer even going to sleep.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What I tried:<br />
</p>
<p>Of course I googled this issue with several keywords and, following some tips from other forums, I disabled bluetooth and unchecked "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" on the "Microsoft Wi-Fi direct Virtual Adapter", which only showed
 up in the device manager after ordering it to "show hidden devices". But none of the mentioned tricks worked.<br />
</p>
<p>The only thing that shows up by default in the device manager is the "Broadcom 802.11abgn Wireless SDIO Adapter" but it doesnt have any power management options. In fact the MS Wi-Fi adapter I mentioned is the only device in the manager (under "Network adapters")
 to have any power management options.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What I noticed: While in sleep mode, the tablet cools out completely now, while before the update, it would stay warm while sleeping so I guess they made the sleep mode "deeper", so that more systems shut down in that mode. Could this be responsible for
 the problem?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>All help will be highly appreciated :)<br />

            <p>Okay, I tried the troubleshooter with IE open and it actually found an issue but couldnt solve it. It read: "Network authentication failed". To connect to that network, normally I have to put in login information once and from then on it connects automatically,
 but now it won't even show any login window...<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: Oh man, forget I said anything... Could the solution have been any simpler?! I just made windows "forget this network", then found it again and connected properly without any issue; even after wakeup.<br />
Thanks for your answers. I hope this solution helps others with the same issue.</p>

            As of May 8th 2016 I have the same problem and on top of that I just bought the SP3/SP4 dock to try to get it to work... Very frustrating to have this not be compatible. I have done all of the updates for windows and for the display link software. I even
 downloaded the multiple monitor software from display link but still will not work. I have run out of ideas. I really hope that somebody will be able to find a solution before I through this screen out the window like a Frisbee.&nbsp;

            <p>I have tried using my USB 3.0 based ASUS MB169B+ , external monitor, and the result has been disappointing.</p>
<p>The monitor was connected using a USB Y cable, as the USB 3.0 ports in the dock do not provide the required amperage.</p>
<p>The monitor starts well with the extended display for my surface pro 3, but after a few minutes, it disconnects it and the last visual on the screen remains frozen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It works only if I connect the main USB of the Y cable with the port of the SP3, and the secondary USB of the Y cable with the one of the ports on the dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This option was valid even with the normal charger of the SP3 , as it has a USB port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence the purpose of using the dock for the monitor is defeated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone provide a solution to the problem ?</p>

    <title>API to programatically change bitlocker PIN and recovery key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petrika  say:</h3>
<h2>            API to programatically change bitlocker PIN and recovery key</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I need to programatically change the PIN and/or recovery key after user forgets the PIN and unlocks the encrypted drive using the recovery key he retrieved by phone from tech support.<br />
<br />
I need to write a small C# application running from admin account in the machine that changes the recovery password (that resides in Active Directory) and Bitlocker PIN. I cannot find an API to do this: I&nbsp;looked at calling manage-bdi.exe or Win32_EncryptableVolume
 Class methods but could find anything helpful or did not understand how to use.<br />
<br />
Any idea will help. Thanks in advance.
