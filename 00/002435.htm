    <title>When typing in a date in a cell without hyphens&#47;slashes, it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gachzorge  say:</h3>
<h2>            When typing in a date in a cell without hyphens&#47;slashes, it changes the date.</h2>
                    So I'm filling out a spreadsheet, and I have one row be our dates, in the past I could put in "022112" or "02212012" and it comes out "2/21/2012" just like I want it to. However, something has changed, and now when I put in "022112" it comes out as "41/76/1960"
 or something random like that, it's usually not even a date. If I put in 2-21-12 it will auto correct it to "2/21/2012" but only when I put in a hyphen or a dash. Any tips on how to fix this issue so that I can avoid any hyphens or dashes when inputing to
 make it a little faster on me?

            <p>No version of Excel has had the feature you speak of............entering dates without hyphens or slashes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must have had some event code that interpreted the entries as dates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See Chip Pearson's site for code which does as you want.</p>

<h2>            Emails in sent folder not being received by recipients and Nokia Lumia stopped syncing emails - help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stupidly downloaded Outlook 2013 onto my Laptop, which seems to have also downloaded a copy of Office 365 too (assume they are linked but I am not teccy enough to know what I am doing!). I did this because I prefer outlook to Windows Mail but I regret
 it now. Since putting Outlook 2013 on my laptop, all sent emails have not been received by the recipients, which as I work from home is a total disaster as I cannot confirm orders so am losing a ton of money now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done a test email to my husbands PC in the same room and he gets the email but he is the only one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Nokia Lumia stopped syncing yesterday and I have no idea why other than it says it cannot find the eas.outlook.com server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on? Please can someone help me but in a way I can understand. Checked the ports. Pop used. Port 995 I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The emails are going into the sent folder so they look like they have gone but clearly they have not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed Office 365, which has in turn removed outlook (I did not pay for Office 365 so no idea how it even ended up on my PC - assume that might be relevant?). Now using Windows mail but today people are still not getting my emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            E75 Email Setup</h2>
                    
<p>Hi fIrst time on this discussion board, my boss recently bought himself an E75, he started to setup his mail for himself, unfortunatley he came to a grinding halt for some reason &amp; has now asked me to sort it, the problem i have is that even after a factory
 reset then setting up the mail again if&nbsp;i click the options button, the "send &amp; receive now" sentence ends in (9) it looks like this "send &amp; receive now [9]" i am assuming that this means there are 9 messages somewhere, however i cannot find them anywhere
 i have even changed the SIM to ensure they weren't stored somewhere on there. i can currently receive mail but sending just doesn't happen. Any help advice would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>i have actually researched the forums before making my first post, if the answer to my question had been in the forum i am sure i would have found in the 2-3 days research, this is the only reason i have asked the forum for help. if you know of a specific
 answer elsewhere on the forum to this particular question could you post a link that twould be much&nbsp;appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Erik8_064,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please perform following troubleshooting steps to narrow down the possible cause of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>After sending the emails, are there any emails stuck in your Outbox? Please check the status bar at bottom right screen, is there a send/receive error? If
 so, please collect a screenshot and send it to me, I will further check it. </span>
</li><li><span>If this is not the scenario, may I ask how did you know the emails are not sent our successfully? Did you get NDRs (Non delivery report)? NDR is a kind of bouncing
 back email from system indicating the sending email is blocked by system. If this is the scenario, please send a copy of the NDR to me in
</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox"><span>PM (Private Message)</span></a><span> and I will further check it.</span></li><li><span>Please download
</span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>OffCAT</span></a><span> and run an analysis of your Outlook and export &amp; send the report back to me in PM.</span></li><li><span>Please provide Outlook detailed version. Choose File &gt;Office Account. It's like Version XXXX (build XXXX.XXXX).</span></li><li><span>What is the mailbox you use to send? It's a user mailbox or a group/shared mailbox?</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me provide you with the information in regards to the re-installation of Office 2013 suite on the same computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the desktop/laptop is reset to factory settings, you will be still entitled to re-install the Office 2013 suite on the same machine without losing the number of license that
 is provided for the Office 2013 suite purchased by you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, before you reset to factory settings, it is advised to remove the Office suite from the machine. Follow the steps from the article below to do so:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</font></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(58, 56, 56, 1)"><font>Once the machine is reset. You may reinstall the same by logging into
</font></span><a href="http://www.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>www.office.com/myaccount</font></a><span style="color: rgba(58, 56, 56, 1)"><font> with the registered email address and click Install Office.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if the suggestion provided is helpful.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Aravinda, (for my information) why do you recommend the remove Office before doing the refresh/reset?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Office 2013 uninstall does not communicate with the activation system, so it makes no difference.&nbsp; If they were talking about 365 I could see it may be easier to deactivate it in the myaccount page before the reset, but 2013 has nothing to do with the myaccount
 page.<br />
<br />
John, did your computer come with a factory installed Office 2013 or Office 365 (2013)? You can tell by going into the File menu &gt; Account Command. The information on the "Backstage Pane" will identify if it is a 365 or 2013 installation.&nbsp; There is a significant
 difference how they are handled for install and activation.&nbsp; These days, most new computers come with a free trial of Office 365.&nbsp;&nbsp; In theory, either way you should be able to do the reset without uninstall and then re-install your copy of Office on the same
 computer with (again, "in theory") no problem. <br />

    <title>Ovi Store issue with my 5800XM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yaserkelany---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ovi Store issue with my 5800XM</h2>
                    I cannot use Ovi Store application on my 5800XM. Everytime I run it I get a message saying that a new version must be installed, I follow all steps downloading it then installing until at a certain point it says that some applications must be closed in
 order to continue installing. I confirm installing it by pressing YES, but then the installation process stops and says "Error Occurred". I have uninstalled Ovi Store then re-installed it, but the issue still exist. I have reinstalled the phone's firmware,
 but it didn't help solving it. I have to mention that the current installed version is the same as the one I am being asked to install again and again. I am using Ovi Store through the website but I always get redirected to the Ovi Store application and then
 the whole story starts allover again.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

                    <p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>recently i upgraded my windows to 14316 build,</p>
<p>and from that update i experienced heavy lag in every game using a Xbox One Controller Wireless. Only if i use the controller and for some reason especially if i use the left stick of the controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Internet i found some solutions but related with Xbox 360 controller. I tried some work around but nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope in some help or that this "strange" issue could be fix soon.</p>
<p>

            1. Your files should of been where you left them, now try looking<br />
in c:\windows.old\users\&lt;your user name&gt;<br />
<br />
Save your data to a USB and remove the USB and keep it safe.<br />
<br />
2. <strong>If it is less than 31 days</strong> since you updated to windows 10<br />
<br />
Click start, settings, Update &amp; security<br />
Recovery<br />
Go back to previous windows version (windows 8)<br />
click [get started]<br />
<br />
3. <strong>If more than 31 days</strong> and the return to previous windows is no longer available.<br />
<br />
Create installation media for Windows 8.1&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

<br />
Do not use your data USB as this will delete all the saved data.<br />
<br />
If you only have one USB then copy your data to another device or buy another USB.<br />
Boot with the windows 8.1 DVD or USB (you may need to change boot option in your Bios)

<p><span>Hi Anton Boritskiy,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You cannot bulk set the default time zone for all users in your organization. Regarding your requirement, I suggest you to let your users set their
 own time zone in <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a> (OWA). When your users sign in OWA at the first time, they will be informed to set their language and time zone. Or they can change it as following link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-your-display-language-and-time-zone-in-office-365-for-business-6f238bff-5252-441e-b32b-655d5d85d15b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-your-display-language-and-time-zone-in-office-365-for-business-6f238bff-5252-441e-b32b-655d5d85d15b</a>
 &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Besides, you can use PowerShell command to perform it for your users:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>yes, the major thing is that I'm more interested in how to change the default setting, so that new users receive the right configuration, I'm not that much interested in existing users, cause I don't want to fix that every time we add a new user.</p>

    <title>Paragraph indents are messing up my margins. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> travissimmonsauthor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Paragraph indents are messing up my margins.</h2>
                    I have this document that I'm formatting. I've set margins and gutters, but every other page has different margins, though it says the parameters are the same. I've tried several things, and I've noticed that the margins are fine if there are no paragraph
 indents. When I move the paragraphs to 0.1 indent, they're still fine, but when I go to 0.2 or higher, it messes up the margins on every other page. I thought maybe altering the left margin by -0.2 would help, but then it messes up the margin of the last paragraph
 of the previous page. I don't know how to fix this. Can anyone help?

            <p>Page margins apply to the whole document unless it contains section breaks. Verify that the margins are set the way you want them; look in the Page Setup dialog box which you can display by double-clicking the upper part of the horizontal ruler. Indents,
 in contrast, apply to individual text paragraphs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you have to take into account that text boxes and table cells have their own margins, which will affect text that you add into these locations.</p>

<h2>            5800 SatNav questions.</h2>
                    
<div>&nbsp;<font>I've been learning about the satnav on the 5800 and need a bit of help if possible.
</font><font>I believe I can use the satnav without connecting to the internet.&nbsp;
</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>From OVI maps In the tools setting I&nbsp;have Internet &gt; Connection ( offline )&nbsp;- Network Destination : &nbsp;Internet and Roaming Warning : On&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>If the phone is in&nbsp;Dual&nbsp;mode, I can locate my position, search destination and&nbsp; If I check&nbsp; Settings &gt; Connectivity&nbsp; &gt; Connection Manager : It shows no active connections ( as it should do )</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>However</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>If the phone is set in GSM mode and&nbsp; I locate my position.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I check&nbsp; Settings &gt; Connectivity&nbsp; &gt; Connection Manager : It shows&nbsp; Tesco MMS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (
<em>I'm on the Tesco UK network</em> ).</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>So a couple of questions.&nbsp; Why has it connected and why&nbsp;is it showing&nbsp;Tesco MMS and not Tesco WAP ?</font></div>

<div><font>If I switch back to Dual mode and allow OVI maps to connect. Its either connected to TEsco Wap or my Wifi connection.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>Many thanks</font></div>

<p>This was more for when I was abroad.&nbsp; Within the UK is the assisted navigation makes a vast difference and uses minimal data, then I may as well leave it on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what exactey does the function within OVI Maps &gt; Tools &gt; Interent do ?&nbsp; ( online - ofline ) .&nbsp; IS that for when you get the maps in real time from the nokia server ?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assisted gps will speed up position fix and only uses around 16kb of data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting Maps to online does exactly as you described.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still a little puzzled with the map data. I would recommend you do as JJ suggested to make sure you have the correct map data downloaded and do not accidentally end up with a huge data bill for downloadinng map data in real time.</p>
<hr />

<p>I took JJ's advice and reloaded the maps from the OVI suite.&nbsp; I rechecked my cities folder and its still the same size .&nbsp;&nbsp; I just bought my 5800 ( can yer tell :) ) and although it came in a standard box, the manual was marked Navigation Edition.&nbsp; So I think
 the the UK maps come pre-loaded .&nbsp; That could explain why I have the full UK maps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now ( while in the UK ) I have put all the assist nav back on and turned the internet to offline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would just like to know if I can delete the OVI map history :)</p>

<h2>            automatically link text boxes</h2>
                    I find multiple references in Help to Publisher's ability to automatically generate new text boxes and link them for text overflow. I find no instructions on how to do this. Even if I have a page with linked text boxes, I cannot duplicate that page to
 produce more linked boxes, they all must be linked by hand. Is this feature available, and if so, how does one access it? Thanks!

            Thank you, David. I've been to these Help pages before. :(<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">To handle overflow text, you can choose to either
 have Publisher find an empty text box (or create a new one) to hold the overflow text and automatically connect this text box to the first text box or you can connect text boxes manually. &lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
However, everything I can find is how to create and connect text boxes manually. Since I am looking at pasting in hundreds of pages of text for this project, the "create a new text box for each overflow" method described is, at the least, inefficient. :)<br />
<br />
All your links have great info for creating and linking each new text box manually, but I can't find anything on the mythical "have Publisher create a new one and automatically connect" feature.<br />
<br />
I think I'm going back to Word, where at least I know I can get it done without developing text box carpal tunnel. ;-)</span>

<p>Sorry...MSFT changed the way Publisher works after Pub 2007. In Pub 2007 and earlier you could paste text into a text box and if it overflowed a dialog would pop up and you would be given the option to automatically add enough linked pages and text boxes
 to accommodate the overflow. As of Pub 2010 this was changed. (lots of changes/downgrades as of Pub 2010 and newer versions)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of Pub 2010 if you create a text box &gt; right click &gt; change text &gt; browse to your Word file and select it, Publisher will not offer the dialog option and choices as it did in Pub 2007 but instead will automatically add enough pages/text boxes to accommodate
 the Word file.&nbsp; I prefer working with the right click context menu but if you prefer you can also go to Insert &gt; Insert File and accomplish the same thing. Unfortunately MSFT decided to strip that functionality from when you pasted text instead of inserting
 an entire file. As you have discovered you have to manually link the overflow when you paste.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said if you are combining hundreds of pages of text then you should probably be using Word anyway. It is generally the better choice for larger publications. You get a lot more word processing choices using Word.</p>

<h2>            Inserting a Future Date - Help with Graham Mayor&#39;s Code</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a set of documents that need a future date inserted. I have used the code taken from Graham Mayor's website however I am having a few problems with it:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data source is our AS400 system. The date field being used is a character field formatted as dd/mm/yy. With the date in the AS400 table populated as 7/02/12, I needed to add 91 days to it. I added the code to the template twice with a formatting switch
 on the end of each as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>\@ "d" \*ordinal (to hopefully show 7th)</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>\@ "MMMM yyyy (to hopefully show&nbsp;May 2012)</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Based on today's date, the returned date was 10th January 2012. Is this because the source data is not a numeric field? If so, is there anything I can do to make it work?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Many thanks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

            If it helps -&nbsp;I have just noticed that the code seemed to work fine on 20th January. It seems to be that now the day of the month is in the field just as 7 instead of 07, it doesn't work.

            Your formatting switches look correct, assuming that there is a closing quotation mark.<br />
<br />
It is almost always easier to handle such calculations in the data source rather than in Word.<br />
<br />
I suspect what you are referring to is <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/downloads.htm#Third_party" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DateCalc.zip</a> by Paul Edstein. He posts regularly as Macropod on the <a href="http://windowssecrets.com/forums/forumdisplay.php/20-Word-Processing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Secrets Lounge</a> and you may be able to catch him there. My page on <a href="http://addbalance.com/word/datefields2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
calculated dates</a> is based primarily on Chris Woodman's work which only applies to a 30-day period.<br />
<br />
For help here it would help if you set forth the actual formula you are using.<br />

            <p>Thanks Charles. I did indeed get the code from the DateCalc file. Further to my last note, I have looked at a date of the 10th January, and this doesn't work either although I do have an example that is using a date of 20th January and that correctly put
 in a date of 20th April 2012.</p>

            I tried your code with <br />
{ SET eefpz1 7/1/2012 } <br />
and various other date combinations and substituting eefpz1 for your mergefield. It works fine.<br />
I also tried 2012-11-1 as the date and it worked. It also worked with European style dating of d-M-yyyy
<span>15-3-2012.</span><br />
<br />
It does not work with Words in European Style <br />
<span>7-July-2012 or "7 July 2012" return a date in June.<br />
<br />
</span><span>20121101 or 11012112 returned what appear to be nonsense.</span><br />
<br />
You appear to have correctly set the field up. The problem must be with the way your data is coming in. It is not a problem of single digit days or months.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but I don't pretend to understand Paul's field codes, just use them.<br />

            <p>Thanks again for your help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In answer to your earlier question, the content is a character field, 8 ch. long and views, in this case,&nbsp;as 7/02/12.&nbsp;I also tried a backdated record set with a date of 10th January; this shows in the data as 10/01/12.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't hard code the date as you have described for obvious reasons. In the meantime, i will try recreating the template and the date code to see if it is just a document corruption isse; we have had problems similar to this in the past and recreating the
 merge fields often helps. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone has any other suggestions, they will be gratefully received.</p>

            Instead of calculating the date twice, calculate it once. Assuming UK format dates: -<br />
<br />
{ SET MyDate {QUOTE<br />
{SET Delay 91}<br />
{SET a{=INT((14-{MERGEFIELD EEFPZ1 \@ M})/12)}}<br />
{SET b{={MERGEFIELD EEFPZ1 \@ yyyy}+4800-a}}<br />
{SET c{={MERGEFIELD EEFPZ1 \@ M}+12*a-3}}<br />
{SET d{MERGEFIELD EEFPZ1 \@ d}}<br />
{SET jd{=d+INT((153*c+2)/5)+365*b+INT(b/4)-INT(b/100)+INT(b/400)-32045+Delay}}<br />
{SET e{=INT((4*(jd+32044)+3)/146097)}}<br />
{SET f{=jd+32044-INT(146097*e/4)}}<br />
{SET g{=INT((4*f+3)/1461)}}<br />
{SET h{=f-INT(1461*g/4)}}<br />
{SET i{=INT((5*h+2)/153)}}<br />
{SET dd{=h-INT((153*i+2)/5)+1}}<br />
{SET mm{=i+3-12*INT(i/10)}}<br />
{SET yy{=100*e+g-4800+INT(i/10)}}<br />
"{dd}-{mm}-{yy}" \@ "dd/MM/yy"}<br />
&nbsp;}{ MyDate \@ "d" \*Ordinal } { MyDate \@ "MMMM yyyy" }<br />

            <p>Many thanks Graham. I'm assuming that MyDate is to be replaced with my mergefield EEFPZ1? I've tried it and, based on the current data which has that field set as 10/01/12, the future date has come out as 1st October 2012.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have I understood this correctly? The date format switches sit outside of the main formula? It makes sense that it would as the date is being declared at the top of the code.
</p>
<p>All I did was to create a new set of field braces, to which I added SET MERGEFIED EEFPZ1 and then copied the rest of the code into that set of braces. Then I just put the 2 sets of field&nbsp;format switches on the end. can you advise if I have missed anything?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks once again.&nbsp;</p>

            No MyDate is a bookmark holding the calculation and the whole structure replaces the mergefield in the document exactly as written.
<br />
<br />
Copy the original from Paul's document to a new document (or use the macro from my web site to convert the text posted from text to working fields -
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/export_field.htm#TextToField" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/export_field.htm#TextToField</a>)<br />
<br />
With Paul's original use the replace function to change DATE to MERGEFIED EEFPZ1<br />
<br />
Change the delay to 91<br />
<br />
Surround with another set of Field brackets and add Set MyDate and change the final switch to \@ "dd/MM/yy"<br />
That will then assign the calculation to the bookmark MyDate<br />
<br />
You can then use MyDate to create the calculated datein the document - <br />
<br />
{ MyDate \@ "d" \*Ordinal } { MyDate \@ "MMMM yyyy" }<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
{ REF MyDate \@ "d" \*Ordinal } { REF MyDate \@ "MMMM yyyy" }<br />
<br />
Copy the lot to your merge document at the place you require the calculated date.<br />

            Many thanks Graham. As a final check, would I be able to e-mail you the code as I have created it so I can confirm that I have set it up correctly? It is still coming out as 31st December 2012. I am expecting 10th April 2012, as it supposed to be taking
 the date of 10/01/12. It looks like it is seeing that date as 01/10/12, which would make the date 31st December. Is there something in the code perhaps that is transposing the date structure to American format? I have set the template to default to&nbsp;UK Language
 settings.

            HI,
<br />
<br />My name is Victor and I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />Folders may contain both messages and subfolders. In other terms, the Destination may allow you to have a folder A containing a subfolder B, or a folder A containing email items, but not both at the same time. So, if folder A contains email items, trying to create subfolder B results in a "Mailbox doesn't allow inferior mailboxes" errors.
<br />
<br />Resolution:
<br />One solution is to ensure that each folder that contains subfolders does not contain any email items. Review your Source mailbox's folder structure and compare it to the Destination's. If any folder at the Source has subfolders, and the Destination folder does not yet have these subfolders but does contain email items, consider either manually creating the subfolders (although this may fail with the same error), or move contained email items to a new location. Also consider upgrading the IMAP system to see if a more recent version solves the problem.
<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t hear my phone calls on my Microsoft 640</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't hear people that are talking to me when I am on a phone call. Every time I get one I have to activate loudspeaker.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I activated my bluetooth headphones, played a song, stopped it and disconnected it and this step didn't work.<br />
<br />
I even did a soft reset and a factory reset but still no joy.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there anything else I can try and do to get the earpiece to work before I return the phone to where I bought it?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<li>remove the microSD,</li><li>apply the&nbsp;<a href="http://download-fds.webapps.microsoft.com/supportFiles/phones/files/recovery/WindowsDeviceRecoveryToolInstaller.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Recovery Tool</a>&nbsp;via a Windows computer,</li><li>do not add any Wi-Fi, and</li><li>do not add your Microsoft account.</li></ol>
<p>Now, you ruled out all configuration issues. If the issues persists your phone (perhaps its earpiece) is faulty. In that case, I would return it to my retailer. The retailer in turn sends it over to a local
 but&nbsp;authorised&nbsp;repair centre.</p>

            Yes I was thinking there was a fault with the&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>earpiece. Thanks @Abi99 (2) but after running the&nbsp;recovery&nbsp;tool I still have this problem. Would I be able to get a replace (since I
 bought it in Argos) rather than sending it away to get repaired?&nbsp;</span></span></span>

            I do not know about return policy of Argos UK. Normally, you have to go for a (lengthy) repair.

 and go into the proper hotmail site the problem is when i use the built in mailbox thing it says always<strong> the file path is not valid.</strong></p>
<p>i also can't see any older inbox message or draft messages,is this a function of the phone so it doesn't get to full up with clutter and if so how can i see my drafts using the built in mailbox cause nothing happens when i refresh/sync

            <p>Actually, a number of people have complained that the recent 'update' of Adobe Reader for WP took the version #

<p>Maybe try de-installing and re-installing Adobe Reader X from the Marketplace.&nbsp; The current version I have installed on my Lumia 900 is 10.1.1.</p>

            <p>Only thing I can think of is that there is some problem with Hotmail's downloading of the file to your phone when you try to open it.&nbsp; Or Hotmail is not sending the Adobe Reader app on the phone the right info.</p>
<p>Sorry, I don't have a Hotmail account, so I can't test it directly for you.&nbsp; I know that PDF reading works fine from my Outlook and POP3 accounts, tho... So I'm pretty sure it's not the Reader app.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Live Movie maker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brendalasch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Live Movie maker</h2>
                    <p>Why do Microsoft think it is a good idea to remove the 'Burn DVD' option on Movie maker for Windows 10?</p>
<p>I often burn DVD's of my photos to&nbsp;mail them&nbsp;to my relatives around the world. Some of whom do not even have a computer, but DO have a DVD player. Not everyone wants their photos on the World wide web &amp; wants to keep them for the eyes of Family &amp; friends
 only. Not everyone is on Facebook, Twitter etc.</p>
<p>I think Microsoft have made a huge mistake with this.</p>
<p>Any chance of a rethink Microsoft &amp; bring back the DVD Maker element of Movie Maker?</p>

<p>I am using WMDC 6.1.6965 on a vista computer to sync files between multiple Mobile 5.0 devices.&nbsp;&nbsp; I dock the scanner, bring up the sync center application and select the Sync ALL option to copy my updated database file from the device to the computer before
 processing it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Status indicates the sync was completed.&nbsp; Process the database file to find out, it contains the previous version of the database.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looked at file dates&nbsp;&nbsp; 7/21/2010 on computer and 7/28/2010 on the device.&nbsp; Device file gets overwritten with
 older version and I loose my data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a intermitten problem, but lost data is a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone seen this problem?&nbsp;&nbsp; The device is contains two partnerships.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I wish we could copy a file directly from the Mobile 5.0 device to the desktop computer and process the data like I did with ActiveSync.&nbsp; DevicetoDesktop.</p>
<p>Do the MightSync only use flash cards?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Other users have reported issues with file synchronization like you described. At this point, I would consider using a 3rd party such as MightSync or use a flash card to store and transfer the database.</p>
