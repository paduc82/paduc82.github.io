    <title>Windows 7 Unable to Start After Forced Shutdown - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Unable to Start After Forced Shutdown</h2>
                    
<p>My System specs are: <br />
<br />
Motherboard: Asus P5Q Pro Turbo <br />
CPU: Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 2.40 GHz <br />
Graphics card: EVGA Nvidia GeForce GTX 460 <br />
Memory: 4x2GB OCZ Gold XTC OCZ2G10664GK DDR2<br />
OS: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit</p>
<p>So here's my problem description. Last night I was powering down my PC like I always would using Start &gt; Shutdown button. I went to sleep but noticed my computer was still running after several minutes so I turned the monitor back on and it was showing the
 "Windows is Shutting down" message with the animated icon. I waited a few more minutes but it never shut down so I pressed and held the power button on my case to force it to shut down.</p>
<p>This morning when I tried to start my PC, after the BIOS screen Windows prompted me to either "Start Windows normally" or "Launch Startup Repair (recommended)".</p>
<p>I chose starting it normally and what would happen is I would see the Windows logo animation play with "Starting Windows" underneath and it would freeze. I pressed the restart button on my case and chose "Launch Startup Repair" this time. A load screen with
 "Windows is loading files..." would run and I would briefly see a green load bar (the one with 3 vertical bars moving from left to right) with Microsoft Corporation underneath it and it would disappear to a black screen and I can wait as long as I wanted to
 but nothing else would show up (Black screen of death).</p>
<p>So I tried getting more sophisticated by rebooting while tapping F8 to bring up the Advanced Boot Options. If I try "Repair Your Computer" I get the same load bars and black screen as if I had selected "Launch Startup Repair". If I select any of the 3 Safe
 Modes I get stuck at CLASSPNP.SYS. I also tried most of the other options below including Last Known Good Configuration, Directory Services Restore Mode and Debugging Mode but none of them worked.</p>
<p>I also tried booting from my Windows 7 disc after setting the boot order in my BIOS. I get a "Windows is loading files..." load bar followed by the animated Windows logo with "Starting Windows" underneath and do nothing (like I mentioned above) and it would
 just sit there.</p>
<p>I've Googled for hours including finding several topics related to mine on this forum but still could not find a solution. I'm currently working from my laptop. There are files on the hard drive (which I only have one and is not partitioned) that I really
 want to save. Can anyone help me?</p>

<p>There appear to be two issues here:</p>
<strong>a) Your data files</strong> <br />
Many PC users believe that backing up files is for wimps. Some of them are in for a rude shock. You're probably lucky in that your files are safe even though they are inaccessible. Here is what I recommend:<br />
<ol>
<li>Buy a 2.5" hard disk in an external USB case. 250 GBytes would do nicely.</li><li>Boot your machine with an Ubuntu boot CD (http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/) and use its GUI to save your files to the external disk. Note that downloading the Ubuntu CD image
 of 720 MBytes can take a long time. </li><li>Try to fix Windows (see below). </li><li>When all is fixed, use the external disk to create regular (e.g. weekly) backups of your files.</li><li>Make sure to keep the disk well away from your PC for most of the time. </li></ol>
<p><strong>b) Windows start-up</strong> <br />
It appears that your installation was already damaged when you tried to shut down Windows, which is why the shutdown never completed. You can most likely fix your problem by using System Restore. Here is how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep tapping F8 during the early boot phase. </li><li>Select Repair from the menu. </li><li>Enter the Administrator's password when prompted. It is often blank. </li><li>Select System Restore when prompted. </li><li>Set Windows back to a point before this problem occurred. </li></ol>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>You can get into Repair Mode independently from whatever is on your hard disk like so:<br />
1. Set your BIOS so that it uses the DVD drive as its primary boot device.<br />
2. Boot the machine with your Windows 7 Repair CD.<br />
3. Press a key if prompted to boot from the DVD.<br />
4. Select "Safe Mode Command Prompt" when prompted.<br />
5. Log on as Administrator if prompted.<br />
6. Select Repair when prompted.<br />
7. Select System Restore when prompted.<br />
8. Set Windows back to a point before this problem occurred.<br />
9. When finished, remove the CD before rebooting the system.<br />
In Step 2 you could also use your Windows 7 installation DVD. The subsequent steps are similar to the ones above.</p>
<p>If this still fails to work then it is likely that you have a hardware problem.</p>

<p>Hi James66,</p>
<p>Let’s try these steps which should resolve the issue.</p>
<p>1.Type computer management in the start search box and open it.</p>
<p>2.In the left pane of computer management, you will see Local Users and Groups. Expand it.Click on the Users folder.</p>
<p>3.In the right pane, you will get the list of user accounts present on your computer.</p>
<p>4.If you find any other user account other than the built-in Administrative account, built-in Guest account and the user accounts which are already present on your computer delete the other user accounts.</p>
<p>Then try creating a new user account named ‘Kirsty’ by following these steps:</p>
<p>1.Open User Accounts by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking User Accounts and Family Safety, and then clicking User Accounts.<br />
<br />
2.Click Manage another account.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
3.Click Create a new account.<br />
<br />
4.Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click Create Account.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Create a user account</strong></p>

<h2>            Does the Mail app in Windows 10 have the SWEEP function&#63;</h2>
                    I love the SWEEP feature, it makes cleaning out my inbox a breeze, but I can't seem to find it in the Mail app of Windows 10... Does the app have this feature? I just installed the upgrade yesterday, so I'm still familiarizing myself with it... Thanks!

<h2>            Computer won&#39;t boot after upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I have a Lenovo Yoga 13" laptop that I was trying to upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 10. &nbsp;I used this website to get the upgrade to Windows 10:&nbsp;http://www.howtogeek.com/272201/all-the-ways-you-can-still-get-windows-10-for-free/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I let everything install overnight but Windows won't boot-up anymore in the morning. &nbsp;There is just a Lenovo logo with a black background on the screen. &nbsp;I tried to re-start the computer by pressing the power button but the computer just gets stuck on the
 Lenovo logo. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't save a recovery boot disk and the Lenovo doesn't have a CD ROM drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

</p><p>If so unplug the USB receiver, then press and hold the Power button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down. Restart your system and the upgrade should finish. Then you can plug the USB receiver back in.</p>

            <p>Speccy works just fine with W10. All you have to do is run Speccy64.exe as compatible with Windows 8. If you go to options in Speccy you can have it run in the tray automatically where it will display the temperature of your CPU updated every second. If
 you have multiple cores it will show an average temp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think Speccy is the cause of this problem. Microsoft is just looking for scapegoats and any "<em>third party</em>" software will do just fine. I think "<em>moderators</em>" like "<em>Yaqub K</em>" are like the folks who work in call centers (her/his
 "<em>profile</em>" - "Yaqub K has not yet shared any information") and s/he's just following a script s/he's been given by MS.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What MS <em><strong>should </strong></em>be doing is working on making sure W10 is compatible with
<em><strong>whatever </strong></em>third party apps people want to use rather than trying to
<em><strong>force </strong></em>us to use <em><strong>only </strong></em>Microsoft products. Monopolies are not good for anyone, no matter how rich they make a small number of people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll find a better solution here I think:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Download the appropriate ISO for your system and follow the instructions. Of course, just because it worked for me doesn't necessarily mean it will work for you. But how much worse could it be than what you're already dealing with?</p>

    <title>Windows 1803 upgrade broke Microsoft Bluetooth protocol support driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stancrook  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 1803 upgrade broke Microsoft Bluetooth protocol support driver</h2>
                    <p>After the upgrade, Microsoft Bluetooth Protocol no longer functions.</p>
<p>This is a problem with Windows, not a 3rd party or add on driver problem.</p>
<p>There are several problems here. The first is&nbsp;<strong> bthl2cap.sys</strong> is no longer in windows\system32\drivers directory (it still exists in windows.old\system32\drivers directory).</p>
<p>If I try to update the driver and have windows look in <strong>windows.old/system32/</strong> for the correct driver, I will report Windows found the driver but could not move/copy it.&nbsp; When I try just
<strong>windows\system32/</strong> Windows reports there are no drivers to be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried all the common trouble shooting procedures such as installing new drivers, but this is an issue where the problem lies completely on a bug that does not let one fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read solutions where the only way to resolve this is by doing a refresh of windows. I shouldn't have to do a refresh to fix Microsoft bugs.</p>

<p>I think the parent's issue is the same issue I had and fixed but I'll restate it for clarity:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a Windows 1803 upgrade,&nbsp;Device Manager has an unknown device with hardware ID BTH\MS_BTHL2CAP. Bluetooth works in spite of this so the issue appears to be cosmetic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution (only for Windows 1803 with unknown device BTH\MS_BTHL2CAP):</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\BTHPORT\Parameters\PnpId.</li><li>Delete the value BTHL2CAP.</li><li>Navigate to the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\Upgrade\Pnp\CurrentControlSet\Services\BTHPORT\Parameters\PnpId.</li><li>Delete the value BTHL2CAP.</li><li>Uninstall the unknown device from Device Manager.</li><li>Restart Windows.</li></ol>

<p>There was no BTHL2CAP.</p>

    <title>Notifications&#58; How can I see them after they&#39;re gone&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlanderson3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Notifications&#58; How can I see them after they&#39;re gone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I saw a notification on my screen. I was concentrating on something else, so I didn't note what it said. The notification is from Hewlett-Packard (not Microsoft). How can I see notifications AFTER they have disappeared from the screen?
<br />
<br />
By the way: I just changed the duration from 5 seconds to 30 seconds -- that's not on"System&gt;Notifications &amp; actions", where it would be easier to find, but it's under "Ease of access&gt;Other options" -- so I already know how to do that. (I'm using Windows 10
 Home.)&nbsp; Is this some subtlety of the "Action Center"?</p>

<p>
</p><p>The article and link aren't very helpful. Maybe it's a limitation of the whole idea of "notifications", which is that they
<strong>aren't saved</strong><strong>?</strong> That's odd -- computers aren't supposed to forget things until you tell them to. But in this particular case, Hewlett-Packard re-sent their notification, and as previously noted, it stayed on the screen long enough
 for me to figure out what it's about. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it looks like Microsoft has been hacked. I found this sentence: A e zgjidhi kjo problemin tënd?&nbsp; I suppose that means "did this solve your problem" in some language like Hungarian.

<p>1. This answer rates only 1 star. To repeat from my prior response, re "notifications": The article and link aren't very helpful. Maybe it's a limitation of the whole idea of "notifications", which is that they aren't saved? That's odd -- computers aren't
 supposed to forget things until you tell them to. But in this particular case, Hewlett-Packard re-sent their notification, and as previously noted, it stayed on the screen long enough for me to figure out what it's about.
<br />
<br />
2. You suggested the thread by Bruce Hagen. That thread is about a different kind of hacking, which uses a pop-up. To repeat: I found this sentence: A e zgjidhi kjo problemin tënd?&nbsp; I suppose that means "did this solve your problem" in some language like Hungarian.

<p>Suggestion 1 didn't work for me, but I did find out what the message was. That's because HP re-sent the notification.&nbsp; As to Suggestion 2, I'm not sure I found it thru the HP Support Assistant; but thanks for the reminder that I can look there.

Thanks - I could tell that the language wasn't among the Germanic, Romance, or Slavic languages, but I didn't know what language it was.&nbsp; You have answered that particular detail.

                    Hi. I'we got a problem.<br />
I have AoE III and it's 2 DLC. The DLC's are working, but the original game not. Before it starts, it warns me that it have a known compatibility issuses. When i try to launch it, it crashes. I'm running Windows 7, 64x bit version. Anyone here who can help
 me?<br />

            It's interesting that you are having a problem with the main game and not the expansions.<br />
It's more common to have problems running one of the expansions. <br />
- Is there an error message when the game crashes ?<br />
<br />
- I don't know what the compatibility issue would be. The expansions are running, so there should<br />
be no need for Direct X or other updates, but if you have not patched the game you should<br />
try installing the patches.<br />
AoE3 will install on 64bit Win7 without using any compatibility settings. <br />
However, there was an occasion that I had to set compatibility to XP sp2 for the game to launch. Later, I removed the compatibility setting and the game&nbsp; still launches - go figure&nbsp; :/ ? .<br />
- So ! Try using Compatibility for XP sp2.&nbsp; If you don't already know how -<br />
Open the games install folder and R/click on the games executable (age3.exe) and go to
<br />
<i>Properties</i> &gt; <i>Compatibility</i>. Also tick the box next to 'Run as... administrator' as an added precaution.<br />
You may want to do the same with the <i>Age3Launcher.exe</i> and the expansion pack &nbsp; .exe's.<br />
<br />
Two potential options;<br />
- Disable your Anti-Virus.<br />
- Uninstall and reinstall, but don't install the expansions until the main game is patched and
<br />
running properly.&nbsp; Then install the expansions in order of their release, which I believe would<br />
be War Chiefs followed by Asian Dynasties. Also patch the expansions.<br />
<br />
There are a number of AoE3 threads on this forums where you may find a fix. If you type aoe 3
<br />
into the search bar and you will find a full page of threads.<br />
- There are also dedicated AoE3 forums where you may find a solution -<br />

    <title>Advanced customization &#40;remove window borders, get rounded - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pantalonsfancie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Advanced customization &#40;remove window borders, get rounded corners, increase drop shadow&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm interested in customizing the appearance of my windows. I've managed to decrease the size of the title bars, scroll bars and window borders as much as accessing the Registry Editor has allowed me to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I'd like to get rid of window borders completely somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also interested in increasing the size of the window drop shadow and rounding off the window borders. Is any of this possible?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen a few Windows 8 skins that managed to get everything working the way I'd want it. I'd use a skin but I really haven't found one that offers the features that I want while still actually looking like Windows&nbsp;8&nbsp;(for some reason they all look like
 OS X and I don't really want that). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps there's some customization software that I could use? Something that would allow me to modify these three things while leaving everything else the way it is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            The best software I've ever seen for skinning the interface or even building your own theme comes from Stardock.&nbsp; Do a web search for "Stardock windowblinds" and you'll find it.&nbsp; The company is actually a Microsoft partner that worked to build the display
 technology to power DWM graphics aka "Aero".

            Thanks! I'll give it a try again. I briefly installed it and gave it a try already using one of their stock skins but it messed up my taskbar icons so I uninstalled it. I didn't really try to create my own skin though, hopefully I'll manage to do that
 this time without messing with anything else.

 ask?&nbsp; Why is Microsoft ripping me off?&nbsp; I do not want to play an app.&nbsp; I want the desktop version back.&nbsp; How can I make these Windows 7 applications run under Windows 10?

Hi, I totally agree, I paid for the games and who gave anyone permission to delete them. Is there a way to copy the games from the windows 7 CD???

<h2>            GL Rendering Context Error Message</h2>
                    I have a Dell 320 Vostro and it has Windows 7 installed on it. &nbsp;It's only a few months old and until yesterday I had never tried to use the media player on it. &nbsp;I decided to try it out yesterday and it worked fine. &nbsp;I downloaded some visualizations and
 skins from the microsoft page and everything worked beautifully. &nbsp;I used it again earlier today with no problem. &nbsp;Tonight, I attempted to use media player and it will work just fine in library view, but when I right click and try to change it to Now Playing,
 I get an error message that says "Can't create GL rendering context" and then media player crashes and closes. &nbsp;Media Player is the only thing I get this error message with. ITunes works fine and all my games work fine. &nbsp;Does anyone know what this is or how
 to fix it?

Change screen resolution
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Screen resolution refers to the clarity of the text and images on your screen. At higher resolutions, items appear sharper. They also appear smaller, so more items fit on the screen. At lower resolutions, fewer items fit on the screen, but they are larger
 and easier to see. At very low resolutions, however, images might have jagged edges.<br />

    <title>Help&#63; Xbox not powering on consistently after October update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waldo15a  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help&#63; Xbox not powering on consistently after October update &#40;via IR remote&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have my Xbox One X as part of my home entertainment center that is all controlled via Harmony Universal remote. Up until prior to the most recent October update, I have never had issues with the Xbox turning on whenever I start the activity of Playing
 Games in my universal remote. I keep my Xbox configured to be Instant ON in the power settings so I can quickly turn it on and keep it updated btw.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the October update, I have noticed that whenever I start the Play activity in my Harmony app and my remote IR blaster sends the Xbox turn ON command, the Xbox will briefly power on, but then it powers off (about 2-3 second ON then OFF). If I send the
 IR command again, the Xbox will power on but it comes up with the green logo screen as if I had completely removed power to the console and not from the Instant-on state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried turning the console on and off directly with my Elite controller and that works just fine, it seems for some reason the IR blaster makes the Xbox hard reset itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help to get this sorted out and fixed will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hey Waldo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to us today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest looking over the <a href="https://support.myharmony.com/en-us/harmony-experience-with-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
FAQ</a> regarding your harmony remote and Xbox found on Harmony's website. You may find some helpful information there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did not have this issue prior to the recent system update it may have gotten corrupted while installing and it may be a good idea to perform a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soft factory reset </a>and download it again. <strong>Make sure before you perform the factory reset that you know 100% the login information for your accounts as they will get removed from the Xbox. Your games and apps will not be touched if you follow that
 guide and select "Keep My Games &amp; Apps".</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information is helpful.</p>
<p>

<p>Diego,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion. I have been trying a number of things, including the soft factory reset and the behavior is still the same. One more data point I have found is that this happens also when I turn on the console with my controller! though it seems
 to be intermittent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a full reset (erase everything!) and it did not solve the problem, so not sure what else to try? Again, I have not had any changes on the hardware side, is the same console, controller and remote I have had for the past 2+ years so the only change
 was the software via October update.</p>

            This sounds like a bad update. Lots of people are having issues. Hopefully it’s under warranty because you’ll need to send it in if none of the troubleshooting steps have worked.

<p>OK this is now definitely an Xbox console problem. I have now experienced the same behavior (on for a few seconds, then off, then have to turn it on again) EVEN WHEN DIRECTLY PRESSING THE POWER BUTTON on the console itself.</p>
<p>

<p>OK I think I FINALLY got to the bottom of this. The problem is not with the peripherals or the console, the problem is the Instant-ON feature for the Xbox gets bugged and you cannot make it work reliably once you get hit with the bug. It is a known thing
 in the preview program that made it all the way to the fully released version:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span>Power</span>
</p><ul>
<li>We are tracking an issue in which the console is fully powering off when it is placed into Instant On mode.</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So we are left to see if Microsoft can fix it!</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I would suggest Run the DISM Tool. The DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.
<br />
<br />	1. Click on 'Start'.
<br />	2. Enter 'Command prompt' in the Search box.  
<br />	3. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command prompt, and then tap or click 'Run as administrator'. 
<br />	4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.
<br />
<br />Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it.
<br />
<br />Restart your device.
<br />
<br />Hope the information provided is useful. If the issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you.
<br />
<br />Angel.

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Adviser and Office Insider for Android. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Try using DISM Tool, 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/947821...</a>
<br />
<br />If it is not working, you can try SFCFix. 
<br />
<br />Open a command prompt as administrator.
<br />
<br />1: Type in "SFC /SCANNOW."
<br />2: Download SFCFix from this page and run it. It may take up to 15 minutes.
<br />
<br />Once the scan has completed a notepad file called SFCFix.txt will launch with the results. A text file will open showing you the results. In a perfect world, it will tell you what file was corrupted and that it was fixed.

I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Adviser and Office Insider for Android. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />
Try using DISM Tool, <br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/947821...</a>
<br />
<br />
If it is not working, you can try SFCFix. <br />
<br />
Open a command prompt as administrator. <br />
<br />
1: Type in "SFC /SCANNOW." <br />
2: Download SFCFix from this page and run it. It may take up to 15 minutes. <br />
<br />
Once the scan has completed a notepad file called SFCFix.txt will launch with the results. A text file will open showing you the results. In a perfect world, it will tell you what file was corrupted and that it was fixed.

<h2>            Windows 10 mess--where is start button&#63; where is address&#47;contacts book&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>just upgraded from 8.1 today pn my 18 month old computer&nbsp;and nothing but trouble and suspect offers to fix my computer for $xxx from MS or MS pretenders.&nbsp; Cannot find address/contacts book although a contact will pop up when entering email address.&nbsp; Just
 can't see the whole book.&nbsp; And the MS&nbsp;instruction sites say to click on start button and after name appears type in address book to find its location.&nbsp; But can't find the start button either!&nbsp; For that matter, can't reach Store either.&nbsp;&nbsp;These problems are
 not unique to me!!!!!&nbsp; What's more, even MS itself&nbsp;and not just its imitators&nbsp;claims it can fix&nbsp;the&nbsp;many&nbsp;problems I did not have until upgrading to 10 today&nbsp;only by having me subscribe to some darned tech service at $149.&nbsp; Why should I have to pay $149 to
 get back something taken away from me in the Windows 10 upgrade? Frankly, I don't see anything that spectacular about Windows 10 features that do work so if it ain't simple to fix, I will go back to 8.1 and remember this whenever I think of buying any other
 computer product.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is bad enough that MsOffice became a money cow with annual subscriptions. I will not tolerate it at another $149 per year for Windows 10.&nbsp;

            Hi, Microsoft removed the option to adjust the font sizes in the Creators Update
<br />
<br />Most Users are using a great small free utility called Winaero Tweaker, which will let you adjust font sizes anywhere in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />To adjust the font and font size in File Explorer:
<br />Open Winaero Tweaker
<br />On the left click Icons in the Advanced Appearance Settings Section
<br />Then click 'Change Font'
<br />Set your Font Size . . . etc.
<br />Click Apply Changes
<br />
<br />Then either log out or restart your PC for the change(s) to take effect
<br />
<br />Click the link below to get WInaero Tweaker:

    <title>Upgrade from Win 7 SP1 to Win10 on a MacBook pro&#59; no cursor at the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jean-michel dengler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade from Win 7 SP1 to Win10 on a MacBook pro&#59; no cursor at the screen &#34;Welcome to Windows 10&#34; to click on &#34;Continue&#34;</h2>
                    <p>The MacBook pro&nbsp;was purchased in 2012 and Windows 7 was installed from a DVD.</p>
<p>Before starting the upgrade procedure OS X was completely updated including&nbsp;the 10.11 El Capitan version, all other updates for Apple under Win 7 as well as Win 7 updates&nbsp;were performed. A system repair DVD and a system image were created still under Win
 7. </p>
<p>The upgrade went well so far until the screen "Welcome to Windows 10", name,&nbsp;"Continue"&nbsp;was shown alas without a cursor to click on "continue"; it seems that the keyboard is not activated neither the touchpad.
</p>
<p>What can I do to continue the upgrade or return to Win 7 without destroying all data stored on the computer?
</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance for your kind help.</p>

    <title>Print to PDF from OneNote - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stacye84  say:</h3>
<h2>            Print to PDF from OneNote</h2>
                    I have taken notes in the Windows OneNote app and it is a fairly long page. I go to print, print to pdf, and it goes through the process of doing this, however, when I try to open the saved pdf it will not open and I get an error. The error says "somethings
 keeping this pdf from opening." This has worked for very small pages but not for longer ones. When I try to do this with an entire section, it also does not work. How can I fix this?

            Hello my name is Bradford and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I will try to resolve your problem with printing from OneNote. 
<br />
<br />Have you tried exporting notes from Onenote instead of printing from Onenote? 
<br />
<br />Below is a link to a step by step tutorial on using the export to PDF feature instead of the print to PDF feature. 
<br />
<br /><code><a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/export-notes-from-onenote-as-a-pdf-13d173b5-7f4c-45a8-94eb-9354d63af5cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/export...</a></code>
<br />
<br />Please let me know if after trying to the export feature if you're still getting that error of unreadable PDFs being the output.

            There is no export button because I am using the windows app and not the 2016 desktop version.&nbsp;
