<h2>            Sharepoint formatting messed up and now I can&#39;t edit the view</h2>
                    <p>I have been working on my companies Sharepoint and this morning while editing settings it now is erroring out then I select "Edit Current View". See the below image.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Correlation ID: b***3</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The formatting is messed up - I believe it is due to the fact that I switched the "Style" of the view from Default to Preview Pane? I am not sure.. See the below image of the formatting being incorrect.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a big gap to the left and it is not showing the file symbol and folder symbols etc.<br />
<br />
When I select "edit Current View" it errors. (See above image and correlation ID)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how to fix?</p>

<h2>            Taking data in one cell and moving it to multiple rows- cells</h2>
                    &nbsp;I am trying to split data in one cell into multiple cells (rows). I tried to use the &nbsp;Text to Columns option and it did not work.&nbsp;It deleted some of the content of the call. &nbsp;In example below, there are 4 entries&nbsp;in the first row. I would like to split
 the cell into 4 new rows with the delimiter to be the hard brackets. So after the&nbsp;[2491] it creates a new row with data for the GYNE LAPAROSCOPY SURGERY POST-OP (DSUR) [2420]. The next row would contain GYNE MINOR SURGERY (D&amp;C/HYSTEROSCOPY/LEEP POST OP) POST
 OP [756] and so on. Any options?
<p>

<h2>            Run-time error 5941 - Not always, But Annoyingly Often</h2>

                    <span>I have been recording Macros in MS Word since the mid-90's. Never mind. That experience appears to be irrelevant now.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I recorded a whole bunch of very helpful Macros for the keyboard. Worked perfectly for many, many documents --<br />
<br />
and then suddenly I get this cryptic message: <b><span>Run-time error '5941' the requested member of the collection does not exist.</span></b><br />
<br />
Now it wouldn't do much good to post the macro's vb code, because </span><u><span><b>None of the VB code has been altered in any way.</b></span></u><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Nevertheless, all macros have suddenly and inexplicably been disabled.
</span><span>Sometime these macros perform flawlessly at times and then suddenly I get
<b><span><i>Run-time error '5941' the requested member of the collection does not exist.</i></span></b></span>
<p><u><span><br />

<p><b><u><span>Please note: I use exclusively Keyboard Commands: Cntrl/Alt/Letter.

<p><b><u><span>Repeat: These macros run perfectly sometimes and then I get that

            Bingo!<br />
<br />
In order to minimize Word's startup time, Microsoft programmed it to not load building blocks into memory until the first time you do something that uses them -- such as clicking the Quick Parts button or using one of the galleries that insert a building block
 (page numbers, cover pages, canned headers or footers,...).<br />
<br />
If you happen to do one of those actions before you run your macro, the template Built-In Building Blocks.dotx has been loaded and added to the Application.Templates collection. But if you haven't yet done any of those actions, the template hasn't been loaded...
 there is no member of the Templates collection corresponding to that name, and BOOM -- error 5941.<br />
<br />
This is one of those things the macro recorder has no way to anticipate, so the code doesn't do anything to avoid it. You can add one line to fix it. After the comment lines at the beginning<br />
<br />
'<br />
' PageNumber Macro<br />
'<br />
<br />
add this line:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.Templates.LoadBuildingBlocks<br />
<br />
If the building blocks haven't been loaded yet, that will force them to load. If they have already been loaded, then that line doesn't do anything.<br />

            If you've been recording Word macros that long, you must have run into macro recordings that don't work properly, or at all, when played back -- either in certain situations or every time they run. I've written a whole page about such problems (<a href="http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/MacrosVBA/ModifyRecordedMacro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/MacrosVBA/ModifyRecordedMacro.htm</a>)
 and barely scratched the surface.<br />
<br />
The message about "the requested member of the collection" is a very common one. Your code tries to do something with one of Word's many "collections" such as Paragraphs, Fields, Tables, and so on -- and in a particular document that specific collection may
 have no members (for example, the macro tries to add a row to a table, but the document doesn't contain any tables). Or the macro tries to do something with a specific numbered member, like ActiveDocument.Tables(3), but this document contains only a smaller
 number of those things, like there's only one table.<br />
<br />
You can spot a collection in VBA code because its name is plural, as in the examples I mentioned.<br />
<br />
When the error occurs, you get the choice to exit the macro or to debug it. Click the Debug button, and look at the line of code in the macro that has a yellow highlight. What does that line say?
<br />
<br />
While the macro is paused in debug mode, you can also select the collection in that line (for example, ActiveDocument.Tables), right-click it, and choose Add Watch; then click OK in the little dialog. You'll get a window at the bottom of the editor, with the
 collection's name; click the plus-in-a-box to its left to expand it. You can see its Count property, which says how many items are in the collection; and if the count is greater than zero you can see Item 1, Item 2, etc. that can be expanded to show the properties
 of the individual members.<br />
<br />
To your "sidebar question": Most things are not so much more difficult in newer versions -- the menus or buttons may change, but the internal behavior is exactly the same. There have been relatively few changes in macros and their behavior since Word 2003 except
 to add objects for new features in the user interface. Yes, there are some things that take more button clicks to get done, and some features that have been removed, but on the whole I don't find the newer versions to be more difficult, just different.<br />

<h2>            Locking Shape In Powerpoint</h2>
                    <p>I'd like to lock a shape and prevent it from accidentally being moved or resized in Powerpoint. I am running on Windows 10 and have Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 installed. I have found a way to make new themes, which protect shapes, but I need
 flexibility to change colors between slides, so that doesn't seem to work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a link on the Microsoft page that talks about the "Developer" tab, but when I go File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; General (as is suggested on the post), I don't see an option to allow the Developer tab to be turned on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>Developer</strong> tab can be used as a workaround for the function you wish to achieve. By default, it is not visible. Adding it to the ribbon can make it visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following steps and see if it makes the <strong>Developer </strong>tab visible:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the <strong>File</strong> tab</li><li>Click <strong>Options</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Customer Ribbon</strong></li><li>Under <strong>Customize the Ribbon</strong> and under <strong>Main Tabs</strong>, click the
<strong>Developer </strong>check box</li></ol>

<p>Enabling the developer tab will not help you to lock shapes in PowerPoint. The only way to do this is to edit the underlying XML (not straightforward) or to use a third party AddIn like ShapeLocker from OfficeOne (not free)</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/aeacfeea-9f44-4173-ad5c-04b2d653d546" title="The Beach House, Kaua'i">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For you to initiate a Skype to Skype video call, you need to add them to your contacts first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do that, just simply search the registered Skype Name, email or phone number of the contact that you want to add.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you see the contact, just simply send a message which will automatically send them a contact request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They will be added to your contact once they accept your request. You can start call, video call, chat once they are already added to your contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Do not print a cell</h2>
                    <p>To make it easier to understand, let's use this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to print A1 and A3, but I wouldn't like to print A2 and A4, but I would like to see all of them on the screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can remember a few years ago you've got the choice to set as do not print, cell by cell, in Format cell options, but now it's not in there any more. So, Am I still able to choose which ones&nbsp;do I want to not print?</p>

            <p>You are mis-remembering a feature. You have never been able to set cells to not print, unless you set the print area to not include them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a lot of options - create a print sheet that excludes those cells, format the cells for custom ;;; &nbsp; or set the font color to the same as the background, or create a formula for each cell that looks at the value of one master cell to decide whether
 or not to show a value:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF($F$1 = "PRINT","", link to other cell or formula)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or use a macro to do any of the above changes, print the sheet, then reverse the changes.</p>

            <p>Dear Bernie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thank you very much for your early answer, I think I was confused. I didn't misremember it's just it was another software, it was openoffice (http://www.aulaclic.es/openoffice/a_13_4_1.htm), if you follow the link, they've got that option at the bottom
 "Impresion" and then says "Ocultar para la impresion" and that's mean hide to print, I think our friend from microsoft can do it too, I wonder why they didn't yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>

            Unfortunately, this issue is affecting all 3rd party SiriusXM applications and there doesn't appear to be a solution.&nbsp; The bottom line is that as of June 17th SiriusXM's legacy internet stream stopped working.&nbsp; No-one seems to know whether this is a permanent
 condition (SiriusXM has turned it off) or a temporary glitch .&nbsp; SiriusXM does not use this stream for its own applications, but this stream is used by all 3rd party applications and so none of them are working.&nbsp; Seems like the only way to listen to the SiriusXM
 internet music right now is through SiriusXM's official applications and unfortunately, there isn't an official windows mobile application.<br />

                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering, is it possible to import data to an existing list in Sharepoint Online? I understand this is not possible since it will create a new list if imported from either Excel or an Access table</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advanced!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aside from the rather awkward copy/paste idea suggested, another option is to use an Access database as a bridge. This works because:</p>
<p>1/ you can create a 2 way connection between Access and a list</p>
<p>2/ you can import from excel and <strong>append</strong> data to an Access table</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you import into Access, a connected list will be automatically updated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3> richardberryhill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2007 removes comments from 2013 saved files</h2>
                    <p>I just updated Office to 2013 and saved a massive Excel workbook in Excel 2013.&nbsp; I wanted to keep working on it in 2007, but when I opened it I got an error; Excel found unreadable content.&nbsp; Removed Part: /xl/comments1.xml part with XML error.&nbsp; (Comments)
 Load error. Line 2, column 177.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I let Excel repair at the cost of all my comments being removed.&nbsp; Now I can't mouse over cells and see the popup comments that explained what that cell was for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news is the 1500+ lines of VBA still all work.&nbsp; The bad news is, users don't have a clue now how to use the workbook if they use Excel 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do to get the comments to not be removed when opening this workbook in Excel 2007?&nbsp; Why does it remove the comments in the first place?&nbsp; What did Microsoft change?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

            <p>I don't have a clue why Excel 2013 created XML that 2007 could not read.&nbsp; I would not expect that to happen and I would be equally annoyed if it had happened to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still have a copy of the workbook in the state which failed to load in 2007, I would suggest sending it to Microsoft as a support incident.&nbsp; I am fairly certain that they would treat the generation of content by 2013 that was unreadable by 2007 as
 a bug and would want to investigate and fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would, however,&nbsp;like to make 2 observations based on many years of experience:</p>
<p>a) If you are creating an Excel workbook that is to be used in different versions of Excel you should always do the development in the earliest version with which it will be used, to avoid potential backwards compatibility problems<br />
b) For a major piece of work like this you should always have a good backup strategy so that if the workbook suffers a significant failure you can retrieve a previous state easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully you do have a backup even if it is a bit old.<br />
You should be able, in 2007, to copy the cells from the worksheets in the backup file and paste special &gt; comments into the version that has currently lost its comments.</p>

            <p>I had checked a few things and alrady started finishing this project with Excel 2013.&nbsp; I have about 28 backup files.&nbsp; Ones such as "Calculations_2007.xlsm".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will keep working on this project and at the end will open the workbook backup in 2007 and see if the comments get removed again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to be clear; the comments don't disapear in Excel 2013.&nbsp; The comments are still there.&nbsp; This isn't an issue with this project as I am able to create a blank Excel file in 2013, add one comment, and then save as test.xlsx to the desktop.&nbsp; When I open
 it with Excel 2007; Excel repairs the Excel file and removes the comments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try doing a few updates as well to see if things imporve.</p>

            <p>That's interesting.</p>
<p>I tried the same - new blank file in 2013, add comment, save, close, open in 2007.&nbsp; No problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there must be some difference in our setup.</p>
<p>2007 is version 12.0.6665.5003 SP3<br />
2013 is version 15.0.4517.1503 32-bit</p>
<p>Windows 7 Pro SP1 32-bit</p>
<p><br />
Admittedly I have 2007 and 2013 installed in parallel on the same machine (along with 2002, 2003 and 2010).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps you could put your failing blank file + 1 comment on a file-sharing website and I could then check whether I can open it without problem in 2007.&nbsp; If I hit the problem it would suggest the problem is in your 2013; if I don't get the problem it would
 suggest that the problem is in your 2007.</p>

<p>Admittedly I have 2007 and 2013 installed side-by-side which might conceivably&nbsp;change the behaviour of 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I also checked on an old Virtual PC that had only had 2007 installed.&nbsp; Same result.</p>

<p>So, I think there is&nbsp;something amiss with your version of 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, I made the <strong>mistake</strong> of using the SpeedyShare copy.&nbsp; I ended up with a download app being installed together with a Snap.do add-on to internet explorer; my Internet explorer task was killed and my IE icon was unpinned from the
 taskbar and replaced by a search icon, it changed my home page and my default search provider.&nbsp; Cleaning up after it has taken me&nbsp;20 minutes.&nbsp; I will not be using that site again!&nbsp; Others be warned.</p>

<p>Ohh I am sorry for that.&nbsp; I didn't know what site to use for uploading files.&nbsp; Pictures, I use ImageShack.&nbsp; I will add the SpeedyShare site to my block list.</p>

Well, I'm glad others won't be having issues with the comments when viewing things in Excel 2007.</p>

            Hi Richard and Bill.
<div>I have found this article to be helpful in an issue encountered at my workplace.</div>
<div>I found the issue was due to the version of 2007 being installed on some machines was missing SP3.</div>
<div>After installing SP3 it was possible to open excel workbooks created in 2013 with comments without any issues.</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

<p>Open the same file Excel 2013 and Save as "Excel 97-2003" instead of regular xlsx format. This should fix it however the size of the file would increase.</p>

            <p>If you <em>don't</em> tick the check box "Stop if true", Excel will evaluate each rule in the list, starting at the top and working downwards, and apply each one for which the condition is true.</p>
<p>So for example, if F6 is 0,001, the first condition =F6&lt;0,002 is true so E6 is colored red. But the second condition =F6&lt;0,005 is true too so the cell is colored blue.</p>
<p>Ticking the check box "Stop if true" makes Excel stop evaluating the rules at the first condition that evaluates to True.</p>
<p>In the above example, since the first condition is True, the second condition won't be evaluated. So the cell remains red.</p>

<h3> pat_40  say:</h3>
<h2>            BLUETOOTH SWITCHING ON AND OFF &#42;SOLVED&#42;</h2>
                    <p>Right I think i have solved it and so far so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last three weeks I have had a nightmare with my MICROSOFT LUMIA 950 constantly cutting off whenever I have answered a call using my bluetooth headset, which is a HM1100. I have posted several questions on here and so far no one has responded and
 I know there are loads of other people suffering the same problem. I even contacted Microsoft yesterday via online chat, who then passed me onto customer support UK, who basically said to do a hard reset, which I do not want to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solution that has now worked for 24 hours without one drop off, which even if it does do so now I would still be happy is this simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your phone</p>
<p>Go to the store</p>
<p>in the search bar type in bluetooth</p>
<p>download a bluetooth app its free (I chose the first one)</p>
<p>and that is it, use the bluetooth app downloaded to connect to your headset or anything else. do not use the one that came installed in the phone, bottom line is it is rubbish and does not work.</p>
<p>this has so far worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks microsoft, no problem, i accept cash or cheque : )&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am at a client that has a local exchange server that we're migrating to Office 365 however I need to setup a separate profile for Outlook and I need to find the server name for each user. I've previously used testconnectivity.microsoft.com and run the
 Outlook Connectivity test but it does not seem to be working this time around.</p>

    <title>Changes to Word Online document not saved. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Changes to Word Online document not saved.</h2>
                    <p>Desperately need help. &nbsp;After working on a Word document for several years, I got a new computer and emailed the document to myself from my old computer using my Hotmail account. &nbsp;Unbeknownst to me, when I opened the document from my Hotmail account on my
 new computer, it opened in the new Word Online, rather than my locally installed Microsoft Word. I worked on this document for several hours, adding 10 total pages or so, and was surprised to find that Word kept popping up a message that said it was automatically
 saving the document, which I thought was great. &nbsp;But after I was done. &nbsp;I couldn't find a place to do a final save, but saw a button that said "Reply With Changes," or something similar. &nbsp;To my horror, I have never been able to find any of the changes I made.
 &nbsp;Even the "Previous Versions" are all identical, showing the state of the document BEFORE all the work I did. &nbsp;I've left my computer on and the browser window open, in the hopes that somewhere in the internet cache, some of the changes might still be recoverable.
 &nbsp;I've had an IT company work on it for a while, but no luck, although at one point, I swear I saw some of the new changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>I'm no expert but I'm having a problem with the One Drive/Cloud which I am not familiar with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because you mentioned it kept saving the doc, do you have the One Drive on your new computer, the icon may be on the taskbar or program files</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think your document was saved on One Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping you find it there : )</p>

            Since you were working in Word Online, your document should be saved to OneDrive. Have you tried signing in to your OneDrive account? The file might be shared with the sender's OneDrive account.

<h2>            Office 365 Web App - Can I recall a message&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Desktop Application of Outlook 2010, the user can easily recall and delete unread messages that have been sent out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However under Office 365 - Outlook Web Application, I could not find any button for this function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know if this task is possible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Low</p>

            <p>It's not possible to recall from OWA - not that it really matters because recall rarely works and only to mail sent to other people using your exchange server.

    <title>Word Count Position in Document - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word Count Position in Document</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies if this is answered somewhere, but I can't find the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from Word 2011 to 2019 for Mac. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2019 version has the word count at the bottom bar still, but not the position in the document (like 2011 used to have).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it used to say something like, "2604 out of 32,000 words" etc showing my position in the document.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to I get that function back? The only way I can see to do it is by manually highlight pages of text, which is not practical with such large word counts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
                </div>

<p>The feature isn't gone, but there's one extra step now. To find the Word count from the beginning, press
<strong>Command +Shift + Home</strong> at the same time. Everything is selected from the beginning to your cursor and the status bar reads something like
<em>433 of 525 words</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Command + Shift + End</strong> will display the number of words until the end of the document.</p>

<p>Use the Smiley control to send Microsoft feedback and request this feature to be added back into the product. The Smiley control is in the upper right corner of Word's active window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this particular case use the Frown submenu control.</p>
