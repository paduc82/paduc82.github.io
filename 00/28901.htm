<h2>            Calculating Persons Age in Access 2013</h2>
                    <p>I have read the post aboyt how to do this in the Web App, but I didnt find it useful for the Desktop Product.&nbsp; I have already imported a table from Excel that had a field called "AGE" (see screenshot below).&nbsp; Now when this table was in Excel it had a formula
 in the box that would update the age each time the product was opened or refreshed.&nbsp; Now that I have imported that spreadsheet, I can not figure out how to have the same thing happen.&nbsp; I am not by far an expert at Access, so please bear with me here.&nbsp; Also
 as you see in the picture I have two other fields that will need to have the same sort of function happen, "Time Remaining" and "Length in Office".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You in advance</p>

<p>

            <p>As a General rule we don't store calculated values. Access is not a spreadsheet. To return the elapsed time as a text string containing years, months and days, you &nbsp;need a function like RunningMan gave you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would put the code in a global modules (name it modUDF), then use the function in a query. You pass the beginning date (i.e. DateofBirth) and it will return the elapsed time as you want it.</p>

            <p>Before getting into your age issue, first I'd like to address your table.&nbsp; As Scott mentioned, Access is not a spreadsheet, and though it has some similarities, does not function like a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that it's nice to see your column names in normal English format with spacing and such.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;database development can become problematic if your fields contain such formatting.&nbsp; You need to remove all spaces from your field names and attempt
 to be as brief in your naming as possible.&nbsp; When you name your database objects such as tables and fields, try to use Camel-Case notation e.g. TableName, FieldName.&nbsp; Using the fields visible in your table image, the visible fields should be named as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>…</span></p>
<p><span>AssumedOffice</span></p>
<p><span>DateOfBirth</span></p>
<p><span>TermExpires</span></p>
<p><span>LengthInOffice</span></p>
<p><span>Age</span></p>
<p><span>TimeRemaining</span></p>
<p><span>Ethnicity</span></p>
<p><span>Gender</span></p>
<p><span>…</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you design your interface, forms and reports, it is in those places that you will show your field names in normal English format using labels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting back to your age issue, you will want to remove the fields LengthInOffice, Age, and TimeRemaining from your table.&nbsp; These values will be calculated just as you did in your spreadsheet.</p>
<p>You will create a query using your table.&nbsp; For the fields that you removed from the table, we will create columns in the query to calculate those values.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>SELECT *, </span>GetAgeYMDTxt([AssumedOffice], Date()) As TimeInOffice, GetAgeYMDTxt([DateOfBith], Date()) As Age, GetAgeYMDTxt(Date(), [TermExpires]) As&nbsp;TimeRemaining
<span>FROM Demographics;</span></p>

<h3> rmdeq  say:</h3>
<h2>            An encrypted connection to your mail server is not available</h2>
                    <p>My Exchange Server is Office 365. OWA works fine, I'm able to login, read email, view calendars, etc. I'm able to get to everything on my Exchange from my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Outlook 2010 client (32-bit) on WIndows 7 64-bit cannot access my email through Exchange. I've tried numerous attempts to fix it based on what I've read on the forums and can't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem started when I kept getting little popups from the tray saying that my Outlook password was about to expire. I ignored them until the count got down to two days, but the pop-up said to click there to change it, so I did. I'm confident it was
 a real notification from Outlook, although I don't understand why I was receiving the prompt. My password age in Office 365 Admin is 730 days, and I had already been prompted to change it in March.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be the first time I was prompted to change the password since the Office 365 service upgrade. I know I'm on the new Office 365 service (post upgrade).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere I read that the way to fix it is to create a new profile, and that Exchange accounts cannot be created while Outlook is running. So, I launched Control Panel and found the "Mail (32-bit)" applet. The instructions said to create a new profile, but
 then cancel out of it before adding an email account. So, I did that, but I received a popup I wasn't prepared for saying "if you want to create&nbsp;a profile with no e-mail accounts, click OK. If you do not want to create a profile at all, click Cancel &lt;OK&gt; &lt;Cancel&gt;".
 I tried it both ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My existing Outlook 2010 profile is called "Outlook". It used to have my Exchange Account and several IMAP accounts. At some point trying to fix this, I deleted the Exchange account because I figured I could just get almost everything back when I re-establish
 the link with the server. Setting up the IMAP accounts (in a new profile) would be&nbsp;a small pain because it means chasing down all the server settings and passwords.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I try to set up the Exchange account, I receive the "Windows Security" pop up asking for my password four or five times, and then I'm told that an encrypted connection to my mail server is not available, and would I like to set up an unencrypted
 one. No, I would not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running the Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer. It succeeded with warnings; one warning was that the security certificate (from sharepoint.com) did not contain the domain name of my domain (contoso.com).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Office 365 login is 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, but my email address is 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Control Panel Credential Manager and removed anything that looked like

*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and now at least I don't receive the redundant and repeated Windows Security popups for my password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a number of questions with #1 being the most important:</p>
<p>1. How do I re-establish the link between Outlook 2010 and my Exchange account?</p>
<p>2. Why do I receive the password prompt after about 90 days when I've requested it after 730 days?</p>
<p>3. What is the correct way to change an Exchange password when Exchange is forcing a password change so that Mail 32-bit profiles and Credential Manager stay in sync? Is it wrong to click the notification from Outlook to click the window to change your password?</p>

<p>Me too, Bill, and it just started - with Windows 10 Pro and Outlook 2016 (that came as a part of Office 365 ProPlus institutional subscription). I haven't found a solution yet. :(&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't exactly recall what happened after this because it was over four years ago now, but when I went to look, I discovered that my questions in the support forums immediately after this were problems with installing Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the best of my recollection, I completely uninstalled Outlook and then re-installed Outlook. It got rid of this problem (and replaced it with others, at least temporarily).</p>

            Thank you for your response. Unfortunately, repairing or uninstalling-reinstalling Office 365 (of which the Outlook 2016 is a part) did not resolve this issue for me.&nbsp;

<p>I just noticed I reported this with Outlook 2010, and my installation problems were with Outlook 2013. So, wait for the next upgrade.

<p>
</p><p>You've probably already done this, but I probably wiped my existing Outlook&nbsp; profile completely and re-added all my email accounts to a new profile.</p>

<p>Yes, I did try that. I have Outlook 2016. That's where in the past two days I have run into a severe issue, likely related to my institutional mailserver and autodiscover. I discovered that none of the mail clients (Outlook 2016, Windows 10 Mail) on my Windows
 10 Pro 64-bit machine want to connect to the mailserver via the institutional Exchange ActiveSync process. Various error messages are coming up, but researching on the net has got me precious little so far. I'm still trying.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Unroutable address</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a situation when one customer sends to a specific they receive error and unruoutable adress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This message was created automatically by mail delivery software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A message that you sent could not be delivered to all of its recipients.</p>
<p>This is a permanent error. The following address(es) failed:</p>
<p>&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&lt;<em>modified by moderator due to privacy</em>&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unrouteable address</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p>It does not happen to all users at oxxxx.nx&lt;<em>modified by moderator due to privacy</em>&gt; but some. What I suspect, after done som investigation, is that it happens when the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** has set up a permanent forwarding. But I am not sure how to verify
 that.</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>

<p>Hi Geir,</p>
<p>I would like to know whether you have recently created DNS records at DNS hosting provider for Office 365.</p>
<p>Could you please troubleshoot this issue via using the default "onmicrosoft.com" -based email address
<em>(&lt;user&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;.onmicrosoft.com</em>) to determine whether it can be reproduce?</p>
<p>However, I have checked DNS records for your domain and found that MX/SPF/CNAME records hasn’t set up.
<br />
•&nbsp;The MX record you need to add includes a value (the Points to address value) that looks something like this:<strong> &lt;MX token&gt;.mail.protection.outlook.com.</strong></p>
<p>Set the priority of the MX record to the highest value available, which is typically 0.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;The TXT record for SPF looks something like this: TXT Value: <strong>v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all</strong></p>
<p>•&nbsp;The email (Exchange) Autodiscover CNAME record points to Address: <strong>autodiscover.outlook.com</strong></p>
<p>For more detailed information, please refer to the article: <a href="https://support.office.microsoft.com/en-in/article/Create-DNS-records-at-any-DNS-hosting-provider-for-Office-365-7b7b075d-79f9-4e37-8a9e-fb60c1d95166?CorrelationId=f38c4942-5192-45e3-8295-ae037e22a8cf&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-IN&amp;ad=IN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>hi geir,</p>
<p>thanks for your update.</p>
<p>to do further troubleshooting, i’d like to collect the information below:<br />
1. have you deployed&nbsp;&nbsp;simple-domain-sharing-for-smtp-email-addresses?&nbsp;<br />
2. if you have deployed simple domain sharing, are these affected users located in office 365 or any other server?
<br />
3. about “the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** has set up a permanent forwarding”, please give more descriptions of the forwarding rule.<br />
4. do these affected users have anything in common, such as the same location?<br />
5. a screenshot of “when i go into the admin panel, and check dns-settings, i receive a message that everything is correct. no errors.”.
<br />
6. does the issue exist if you create the mx record pointing to office 365 like <strong>
&lt;mx token&gt;.mail.protection.outlook.com</strong>? here is an article for your reference:<a href="https://support.office.microsoft.com/en-in/article/create-dns-records-at-any-dns-hosting-provider-for-office-365-7b7b075d-79f9-4e37-8a9e-fb60c1d95166?correlationid=f38c4942-5192-45e3-8295-ae037e22a8cf&amp;ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-in&amp;ad=in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create

<p>Hi Poppy,</p>
<p>I have not get any information from the customer. I guess they are happy, as long as the email gets thru, and that the error is caused by configuration outside Office 365.</p>
<p>So you can just close this case.</p>

<h2>            Excel 2013 CTRL&#43;C and CTRL&#43;V &#39;broken&#39; &#40;False functions are getting called&#41;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
Hello,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
I'm a long time Office user and just made the switch to Office 365 when I got the free student version (using the offline applications which are labeled as Office 2013).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
I immediately ran into one huge problem:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
The CTRL + C and CTRL + V shortcuts seem to be broken. They are affiliated with different functions than usual. Most other keyboard shortcuts work, but those two don't. CTRL + C in Word was bound to GrowTextSizeByOne (Or whatever it is called) and CTRL + V
 was bound to the symbol '-'.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
In Microsoft Word I were able to simply change the shortcuts back to their real ones easily (EditCopy and EditPaste). Microsoft Excel doesn't offer this feature though. I tried changing my keyboard layout (and the default language options in Excel) but this
 didn't change anything when it comes to shortcuts.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
I installed Office 365 on my laptop (Windows 8.1) and on my PC (Windows 7), both are working exactly the same with the shortcuts messed up (Before I even logged into my Microsoft account, so I doubt there was any option syncing between the two machines). Copy/Paste
 works fine in every other application on my two PCs.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
Strangely Powerpoint seems to be fine, this only affects Word (Which I was able to fix due to the shortcut options) and Excel (Which I'm totally stuck even after over an hour of research). When I hover over the copy function in the toolbar it even shows me
 CTRL + C, but when I try to use it in Excel it calls a function to show all cells referencing the one selected.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
Neither repairing nor re-installing helped, but that would have surprised me anyways due to two independent machines having the same problems.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
Starting Excel in /Safe mode didn't work either.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
I count myself as advanced user but I'm still absolutely stumped.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">

One thing I can think of is that Office somehow interprets my keyboard layout wrong (I usually use NEO2, but also use QWERTZ and sometimes QWERTY, all shortcuts, including cut, work great. Only copy and paste are giving me problems.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">

Could anyone help me, please?</p>

            <p>Nope, running Excel as administrator doesn't change a thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled using the 'normal' Windows uninstall functionality via the Control Panel. Also tried the "Quick fix" and the "Fix" (using Internet files), all three options didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried different accounts too (and of course simply never signing into one), no change at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is neither a corrupt installation nor an account issue, and no OS issue (Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 have exactly the same problem).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sets it up wrong and I have no clue why and why it only happens to those 2 keyboard shortcuts. If all of them are broken it may have been my keyboard layout, but even after changing that it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CTRL + X works fine, so the CTRL key shortcut combination in general aren't broken.</p>

            <p>Alright, I finally found out what the problem is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Control Panel → Languages → Advanced Settings → <strong>Override default input method</strong><br />
</p>
<p>When I let this option on QWERTZ (The standard German keyboard) everything works great, even if I switch to another keyboard layout (NEO2) in Excel afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this option is on NEO2 and I switch in Excel to QWERTZ it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like Excel doesn't take into account the actual keyboard layout when starting up, but always uses the Override one first and then breaks when it's not the German or English standard one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't fully break though: All shortcuts except Copy and Paste work splendid, even CTRL + X for Cut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to submit a bug-report?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use QWERTZ as default Excel may work, but then I have to manually switch my keyboard layout all the time for every single window I open and whenever I start up my PC, so this is not really a good solution :-/</p>

<div>Hi Chris,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>We had someone recently asking the same kind of question on the MSDN developer forum. A lot of my response here is a direct copy of what I wrote in response to that question.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Following the release of Access 2007, and now 2010, I and others no longer recommend&nbsp;employing the built-in Access user/group security for new databases, because it's been deprecated. It's supported now only for backwards compatibility,
 but that compatibility cannot be guaranteed for future versions. That said, I recommend creating your own securiy model.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Security and access control can be a very complex subsystem. In general, the following is what you need, and they should be addressed separately.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Create a security/access control schema. This generally consists of&nbsp;six tables:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A table for users, which includes passwords;</div>
<div>&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;a table for groups;</div>
<div>&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;a table for groups to which each user belongs;</div>
<div>&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;a lookup table of possible permissions;</div>
<div>&nbsp; (e) a table for permissions assigned to individual groups;</div>
<div>&nbsp; (f)&nbsp; a table to record login attempts; and</div>
<div>&nbsp; (g) physical/logical security controls on tables, views and so on.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Create security/access control forms:</div>
<div>&nbsp; (a) Login dialog;</div>
<div>&nbsp; (b) user/group management dialog (which may also include permissions);</div>
<div>&nbsp; (c) permission management dialog; and</div>
<div>&nbsp; (d) login audit form/report.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3.&nbsp;Security and&nbsp;access control procedures.</div>
<div>&nbsp; (a) Centralised procedures;</div>
<div>&nbsp; (b) custom calls added to the Open event of each form to check and set rwed permissions for the form itself; and</div>
<div>&nbsp; (c) custom calls added to other events in each form to control access to controls/data.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Before&nbsp;you start designing anything, you need to write specifications for the type and level of security and access control you want your system to employ.&nbsp;If you don't get it right now, it'll be a nightmare to do later. So
 when you've done that, come back here and we can guide you through the process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>It sounds like you're using "2 pages per sheet" both in the <strong>Page Setup</strong> dialog and in the
<strong>Print</strong> dialog. These are two different things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The "2 pages per sheet" setting under "Multiple pages" on the <strong>Margins</strong> tab of
<strong>Page Setup</strong> gives you an A5-size page. If you want portrait pages, you have to set the page orientation to Landscape. You can either duplicate the content of one page or just create a single page and print pages 1,1. (See
<span><a href="http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/2PagesPerSheet.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/2PagesPerSheet.htm</span></a>.)</span></li><li>The "2 pages per sheet" setting in the <strong>Print</strong> dialog reduces an A4 page to A5 size so you can print 2 on A4. If the A4 page is portrait, you'll get two A5 pages on a landscape sheet. Again, you'll need to print pages 1,1.</li></ol>

<h2>            text becomes invisible low down on a large onenote page</h2>
                    <p>I have a particular large Onenote page containing only text and hyperlinks.</p>
<p>This registers in the directory at just under 30 MB in size.</p>
<p>On this large page, roughly the last one third of the text has become invisible after a Windows system reload.</p>
<p>Cursor movements and copying show the text is still there, it is just not visible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The whole page, at the same size as now, was previously easily readable.</p>
<p>I have checked other threads on this site bearing on large Onenote notebooks, but there is nothing about this invisible text problem.</p>
<p>What can I do to restore visibility to this text?</p>

<p>Many thanks for your attention, Charianne. I am sorry for delay in this reply. I am afraid that a workaround I have since implemented means I cannot send a screenshot of the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround involved splitting the partially-invisible 30 MB page into two roughly equal pages. The formerly invisible text then became visible in the new second page. Although more cumbersome, this is so far working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is difficult to be more specific about the original problem. One further detail, is that the reason for the Windows reload that preceded it, was that OneNote was experiencing difficulties with searches. A search of any one page took a long time and a
 full search of all notebooks was failing to complete. This problem was evidently solved by the Windows reload.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not&nbsp;<span>tried removing and re-adding my account in OneNote. To be honest, the complexity of OneNote inetractions between remote and laptop and web and desktop versions makes me cautious about causing more difficulty
 than I resolve for my present rather elaborate note structure ? For the same reason, I have disabled synching, which was causing much confusing in duplications and ambiguous versions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for any general advice you have on the original problem or concerning the managing of the scale of pages and notebooks and optimising the functioning of indexing and searches.</p>

            Have you checked to see if the option on the device is set to provide notifications?<br />
<br />
I can do this on my IPAQ hw6925 by opening up the messaging application, then tapping Menu &gt; Tools &gt; Options &gt; select the Text Messages account &gt; and placing a checkmark in the box next to "request delivery notifications"<br />

            Have you check the notification settings within the pocket pc to see if they are set up to notify you?<br />

Tap Start &gt; Settings &gt; Personal tab &gt; Sounds &amp; Notifications icon &gt; Notifications tab &gt; review the items in the "Event" window.<br />

            well i checked &amp; i dont have an exact "notification &amp; sounds" setting.<br />
i go to messages and then settings, and it tells me whether i want the notification or not<br />
and i put the checkmark, and it doesnt do it .. but that's the only setting i can find in the phone referring to it.<br />

<h2>            Error 30015-11 &#40;-107374170&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a new Dell computer that has Windows 10 and an Office 2016 Suite.&nbsp; I have tried several times to download Office several times and keeping getting the error code 30015-11 (-107374170).&nbsp;&nbsp; The download gets to about 95% and then the error pops
 up. &nbsp;I confirmed that I do not have AV running and rebooted my computer several times.&nbsp; I think the Suite is making a partial download because I found Office files on my computer after a couple attempts to download and uninstalled them.&nbsp; But downloading afterward
 still resulted in the same error.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I paid good money for the Office Suite and am beyond frustrated with the inability to successfully download and use the products.&nbsp; Please tell me how I can resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Elizabeth,<br />
<br />
It might be due to some corrupted installation files. We recommend running system file checker
<strong>(SFC)</strong> to check and verify the missing and corrupted files in the operating system. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>On the Command Prompt, type <em>sfc/scannow </em>and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After performing the steps above, we suggest installing Office again.<br />
<br />
Get back to us if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestion but it DID NOT fix the problem.&nbsp; When I ran the SFC, it returned negative results and did not find anything that needed to be fixed.&nbsp; I then rebooted my computer for the millioneth time and tried to download Office&nbsp;AGAIN and
 it returned the SAME&nbsp;error.&nbsp; It got to about 90% downloading again and returned the error.&nbsp; I am HIGHLY dissatisfied with my experience with MS and am regretting not buying an Apple.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestion but it DID NOT fix the problem.&nbsp; When I ran the SFC, it returned negative results and did not find anything that need to be fixed.&nbsp; I then rebooted my computer for the millioneth time and tried to download Office again and it
 returned the same error.&nbsp; It got to about 90% downloading again and returned the error.&nbsp; I am HIGHLY dissatisfied with my experience with MS and am regretting not buying an Apple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please escalate this issue to the next level of technical support and give me a solution ASAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<h3> jimmy fallon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t rename a notebook and have it sync the new name to phone&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I LOVE the one note syncing, it's a little quirky but, I'm used to it now.</p>
<p>Problem is if I rename a notebook on the computer, it still syncs the notes under the old name. I'm guessing this is a known issue? I can still sync the actual notes but the name on the pc is different than the name on the skydrive and on the WPH7. I am
 NOT using Live Mesh to do the syncing, I am creating a notebook on the pc, and using the option to sync to skydrive from within Onenote.</p>
<p>PS, and it is bizarre to me that I have to open the notebooks using Mobile IE instead of from within Onenote, but I'm sure they are working on that as well.</p>
<p>Thanks... JF</p>

<h2>            Scanpst.exe</h2>
                    I have suffered Outlook&nbsp;Inbox corruption twice since installing MS Office Professional 2013. I always backup outlook.pst but in these two cases I effectively exported corrupt .pst files. So when Outlook began acting up&nbsp;it continued act up because I unknowingly
 imported my corrupt backups.&nbsp;There is no Inbox repair tool&nbsp;that should have come with the software.&nbsp;A Google search indicated where to find the Inbox repair tool but it was not there. So I have this corrupt .pst file with emails dating back to 1997 that I
 cannot recover. Third party apps have not worked. &nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried repairing the entire Office suite both with quick repair and online repair. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled MS Office Professional 2013 to see if that would help but&nbsp;nothing helped.&nbsp;I
 never had problems with MS Office Professional 2007. This is unrelated to my problem&nbsp;but the entire look of MS Office professional 2013 is hideous and the toolbar borders are so

<p>Note that using Export and Import aren't good methods to backup and your restore pst-file. Simply copying your pst-file to a safe location would have been the proper way to backup your pst-file.<br />

<p>Whether or not scanpst.exe can repair the pst-file depends on the level of corruption.</p>

            Scanpst.exe does not exist in my version of MS Office Professional 2013. Dell's Technical Support remoted into my laptop and confirmed what I'm saying. Is it available as a separate download? I've had nothing but problems with Outlook 2013 since installing
 MS Office Professional 2023. I never had problems with MS Office Professional 2007. I've demanded my money back but because I "activated" the software I've been refused. Now it looks like I've lost all my emails dating back&nbsp;to 1997 because I can't try to repair
 anything with the absence of Scanpst.exe. Some of these emails are very important. What I've learned about Microsoft is that they now produce a bunch of crapware.&nbsp;

<p>A repair of Office would have reinstalled scanpst.exe if that was the case.</p>

            Numerous repair and reinstallations of MS Office Professional 2023 has not made Scanpst.exe reappear. I think I asked nicely if Scanpst.exe is available as a separate download. I&nbsp;use no third party utilities. Who cares if I have a drive problem. My problem&nbsp;which
 I keep stating is that I don't have Scanpst.exe to see if I can repair the .pst file.

            In case anyone is interested I have found that Scanpst.exe is finding errors in Outlook.pst every time I run it. In an earlier thread I mentioned that I felt MS Office Professional 2013 was crapware. I feel vindicated. However, I'm very angry that I cannot
 my money back. MS Office Professional 2007 never caused this kind of grief. Perhaps I should sue Microsoft to get my money back.

            <p>I suspect nobody has answered your query in the past 4 years because they simply have no idea what the answer is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I agree my version of Outlook 2013 also has no version of ScanPST.exe. &nbsp; And most of the places it appears to be available could be spyware as easily as it could be a microsoft version of the file.</p>

            <p>Actually I had someone from Microsoft's management call me. Scan.pst is a hidden file. You might Google on how to show hidden files. I've included a screenshot. You can see the path to scan.pst on the screenshot. There's too many "experts" in this community
 that aren't experts at all. Someone should have been able to answer our question.

            <p>Thank you. &nbsp;After several hours I did find that out. &nbsp;The Peer to Peer help systems that are around are generally helpful until they are not. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately ScanPST did not fix my problem nor did a complete uninstall and reinstall of 2013 Office. &nbsp;So I went back to Office 2010. &nbsp;And that works except for Outlook 2010 which has the "synchronization hierarchy" error which is the reason I purchased
 2013 and 365 in the first place. &nbsp;Unfortunately neither are as good as 2010 as far as a mail client goes and that is my most important tool from Office these days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I will investigate other companies mail clients. &nbsp;I am not happy with Live or Outlook.com as they have moved to a look and feel like 365 which I find nearly unusable unless I am on my desktop with two 27s.</p>

    <title>Multiple Forest to Exchange Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonathansheehy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Forest to Exchange Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>We have 3 separate forests connected via Trusts, and would like to eventually migrate all mailboxes to Office 365. &nbsp;Here are some specifics:</p>

<ol>
<li>Forest A - Exchange 2007 SP3 UR17 </li><li>Forest B - Exchange 2010 SP3 Latest UR </li><li>Forest C - Exchange 2013 CU 10 - MAIN FOREST </li></ol>

<p>Forest A and Forest B were companies that we purchased and we would like to consolidate everything into Forest C. &nbsp;In order to utilize Office 365 would we need to ADMT and perform mailbox moves into Forest C and then to Office 365?</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to have all users on Forest C and all of their email onto that domain as well. &nbsp;If you require more detail, please let me know.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Jonathan,<br />
<br />
Theoretically, you don’t need to put all mailboxes into one forest. Generally, a cutover migration will migrate all the existing on-premises mailboxes from an Exchange organization.
<strong>As long as the trusts between your forests are OK, it can be treated as one Exchange organization.</strong><br />
<br />
Moreover, if it is convenient for you to move those mailboxes from Forest A and Forest B to Forest C before performing the migration to Office 365, I suggest you do so. It may avoid some potential migration issues based upon our experience.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Allen<br />

<p>Hi Jonathan,<br />
<br />
Generally, we don’t link an AD account with an online mailbox. Instead, an AD user account can be linked with an Office 365 cloud user account, as long as they have the same SMTP email address. This solution is called the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2641663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SMTP matching</a>.<br />
<br />
However, please be aware that the Directory Synchronization cannot work with an ongoing cutover migration. If you have already activated the Directory Synchronization, it is suggested that you move all your on-premises AD user accounts to Forest C and build
 an <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200581.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange hybrid deployment</a> based on the Exchange 2013 server in Forest C.<br />

            Sounds like there is a disagreement between Excel and the Printer who is boss.<br />
<br />
Just to confirm, both the printer and are set to landscape on legal paper.<br />
<br />
Just for the halibut, try setting excel to lettersize portrait and only the printer to legal landscape. Then try switching them around.<br />
<br />
What make and model of printer are you using?<br />
<br />
Go to the makers web site and confirm that you have the most current printer driver.<br />
<br />
Actually, as a test, try printing to PDF or XPS formats and see what happens.<br />
<br />
<b>The printer settings are ignored when you print a Word document</b>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/904805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/904805</a>
</p>
<div>
<p>
When you print a Microsoft Word document, the printer settings are ignored. These printer settings include the paper size, the page orientation, and the page margins.</p>
<p>
Consider the following scenario. You change the properties of the printer driver to specify paper size, page orientation, or page margins. However, when you print a Word document, its paper size, page orientation, or page margins differ from what you specified
 in the printer driver properties.</p>
<p>
This issue occurs because the Page Setup settings that you specify in your Word document override the settings that you specify in the printer driver properties.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Oddly enough, this ended up being the cause of my problem. I had an older print driver installed on my Win7 machine and once I removed that driver, Word started working without any problems!</p>
<p>You can delete individual printer drivers by going into the registry. Note that simply going to Printers and Faxes and deleting a printer there does not delete the printer driver.</p>
<p>Follow <strong><span>Step 3</span></strong> in my previous post about a printer error to remove the printer drivers:</p>

<span>This link describes how the user solved an Excel crashing problem by switching to an alternate printer driver.</span></p>
<p>
<span>I find it surprising, but it shows how closely Excel (and Word) are tied to the printer and printer driver.
</span></p>
<p>I had faced this issue as the printer driver caused the problem.</p>
<p>In my case,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Fault Module Name:&nbsp;hpz3r5k2.dll&nbsp;caused by the printer Officejet K8600 driver.</p>
<p>It is not compatible with excell 2010 during print preview.</p>
<p>After work out almost 2 weeks, I figured out the solution, found that printer driver Officejet K7100&nbsp;solved the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the printer Officejet K8600, I change the driver to Officejet K7100 series.</p>
<p>Voila, no more crash and restarting when using print preview and printing working great.</p>
<p>(You need to download the driver if you don't have it)</p>

<h2>            Yammer - one network for two verified domains</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>We have two domains verified in our Office 365 (each domain for one type of users). We have some projects in which there are users from both of them involved and we would like to use Yammer as a communication platform for them. Could you please tell me if
 it is feasible to do this and create one network for those two domains? If not, what are other options?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jan</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read this before you turn off your security settings, reformat your disk, or any other time consuming tasks involved with installing Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I have a very easy solution for those with Windows 10, but this should also work with Windows 8. &nbsp;Windows 7 does not utilize the app store so I do not believe this is a problem for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a problem with the online installer for Microsoft Office 365 on 2 brand new computers, 1 was about 4 months ago, the other was today, 7-28-2017. &nbsp;The computers in question are 2 completely different brands and builds, both with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solution does not fix the problem, it merely installs Microsoft Office 365. &nbsp;The problem lies within the app installer on Windows 10 and Windows 8. &nbsp;If you don't believe me simply open your app store and try to update your apps. &nbsp;I bet they all get stuck.
 &nbsp;If they don't get stuck but you are still having a problem installing office I do not know what your problem is but read on because this might help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 has an offline installer. &nbsp;The file is large, like 5 gigs maybe. &nbsp;Go to Microsoft.com and sign in. &nbsp;Then scroll down until you see "My Account" and click it. &nbsp;A new Internet tab will open and you will be on the Office home page (at least that's
 where i got redirected). &nbsp;Click the button that says "Install" and you will be redirected to a new page that has the online installer readily clickable. &nbsp;Don't do it. &nbsp;Instead, click the link that says "Language, 32/64-bit, and other install options". &nbsp;You
 will again be redirected to a new page and given 2 installer options. &nbsp;Choose the one that says offline installer. &nbsp;After you download the installer (took me 20 minutes), open the download file and run the "Setup" application. &nbsp;This program should not take
 more than a few minutes to install, and you should see progress bar move.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked for me, but the Windows 10 App Store still has problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck everyone, I hope this post helps at least 1 person.</p>
<p>-Colton<br />

<p>At the moment it's not possible to use the front camera straight out of the box for video calls, taking pictures&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an application called Mirror that enables you to use the front camera as a mirror but that's it for now</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe a later Firmware update will eventually enable full use of this</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 stopped working after .pst import - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martinlafica  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 stopped working after .pst import</h2>
                    <p>So... I was humming along nicely with Windows 10 and Office 2016. Then I got courageous and tried to import a 7GB .pst archive of my old email so I could search for some content. During the import it stopped, never finishing the import and restarted outlook.
 Since then I have not been able to keep Outlook running. I get the error that Outlook has stopped responding, Windows is searching for a fix and then Outlook closes. I cannot even keep Outlook running with the /safe switch. I tried repair via control panel...
 no love. I use Outlook &amp; imap for Gmail so I can simple use Chrome and check my email but I prefer to use Outlook. Any suggestions? TYIA!</p>

 and re-adding your Gmail account. &nbsp;If this works and the crashing stops, just open the old .PST, don't import it. If you need to add something from it to your Gmail account, drag and drop works fine.</p>

            Use "Forward as Attachment" to add the selected email message to a new message.<br />
<br />
Another option is to drag the message to the Desktop then attach to a message.<br />
<br />
To get the same option as Outlook for Windows, send Microsoft feedback.<br />
