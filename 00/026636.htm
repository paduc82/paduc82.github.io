            As G.Ilex told, it is not possible to have CONTROL PANEL on your phone! There is no sense of having it. You already have the Settings app pre-installed on your device!

    <title>How to completely uninstall Outlook 2010&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> languageservicesco  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to completely uninstall Outlook 2010&#63;</h2>
                    Please bear with me on this one, as I shall try and give all the relevant information and it might get a bit long. The basic problem is that I have a laptop running Windows 7 64-bit on which I have had Office 2010 installed since around 2010 I guess! This
 used to be my main work machine until I got a PC for that, but I do use it for travelling etc. Until about a month ago, Outlook worked fine. Then suddenly it wouldn't even open and I get the "Outlook has stopped working" message. I would like to solve the
 problem as I will need it over the Christmas/New Year period. Here is everything I have done:<br />
<br />
1. Tried to open in safe mode - no success.<br />
2. Tried to open with "resetnavpane" switch - no success.<br />
3. Did a repair of Office and rebooted - no change.<br />
4. Renamed the pst file. It asked for the location, I made it create a new pst file - no success.<br />
5. Uninstalled Outlook, rebooted, reinstalled Outlook - no change.<br />
6. Uninstalled Office, rebooted, reinstalled Office - no change.<br />
What worried me was that even after uninstalling (either Outlook or Office), when I restarted Outlook, it immediately went to the folder I store my pst files in and tried to open the last one used that I created in 4 above. It then, naturally, stopped working.
 So I manually searched the registry for any entries that might be sending it there, found one, tried to restart Outlook and it still went to the same folder! This folder is at D:Business/Admin and Resources/Computer/Outlook and includes 5 pst files. My point
 being, even if it scanned the system and found the folder, there is no reason it would go for the exact same pst file that had been last used before uninstalling Outlook. Also, it cannot be caused by the file because it is trying to use a file that it just
 created.<br />
<br />
What I would like to do is ensure I have a completely clean uninstall first. I even ran the "Fixit" from the Microsoft web site to completely remove all the installed components and then reinstalled Office, but everything was the same - Outlook would stop working
 but showed it was going to the pst file that had previously used, so clearly this had not uninstalled everything.<br />
<br />
So, that's it. I have spent a lot of time researching this problem, and I am fairly sure I have done everything I could, apart from getting an absolutely clean install. I really don't want to reinstall Windows, but I might if I can't get Outlook to work any
 other way. Any help greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />

            Hi marinescu<br />
<br />
Unfortunately you need to place RV-MMC into card reader on your PC as N70 does not have a data transfer connectivity option like S60 3rd edition devices.

            Hi marinescu<br />
<br />
You have run Maps application on your N70 at least once with memory card in phone as this defines folder structure on memory card on exiting application? Maploader looks for this before allowing maps to be downloaded.

            yes I run nokia maps twice. Somebody told me "the problem appear because you don`t have GPS device attached". What do you think, is correct?

If you are not using a BT GPS receiver it is not going to be able to "save" relevant positional data as you could be anywhere in the world.

            I solved the problem. My printer card reader can`t read MMC up to 1GB, so I use my Panasonic dvcam (with card reader) and works. Thank you for your support!

    <title>BSOD with error message &#34;WDF VIOLATION&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cyrusnima  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD with error message &#34;WDF VIOLATION&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I gave up on evaluating win10 on my existing laptop, so I went and got this&nbsp;Band new
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Dell 5000 Inspiron 64 bit laptop with Win7 Professional.</strong></span></p>
<p>Got rid of all non essentials. I only have .NET and C++, etc. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After 2 days of installations, I finally got win10 loading. Then to my surprise it even got the right screen resolution by itself, and I was finally ready to explore.</p>
<p>Then after 3 minutes and right out of nowhere, it said "your computer has encountered a problem and needs to restart".</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I got a few&nbsp; automatic restarts, and then it said <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>search&nbsp;WDF Violation</strong></span> to fix the problem.... I looked it up, but couldn't&nbsp;come up with anything actionable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, If this has anything to do with my internal disk drive,&nbsp; again, this is brand new laptop with only&nbsp;1 gig internal drive which is 90% empty. There maybe a unallocated partition that is&nbsp;not yet added to my C drive, but I need windows to come before I
 can use the Disk Manager.... Beside that is a silly reason to crash the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, finally it gave me the Advanced Options, and chose <strong>Refresh My Computer</strong>, and right now it is at 8% completion. I am not optimistic this refresh utility is going to fix anything, because I have&nbsp;tried once before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think an OS should recommend to&nbsp;the user to Research something to fix a problem. It should fix it or at least provide an actionable solution, regardless of how early of a version it is.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>very typical</strong></span> business laptop, brand new with no additional&nbsp;software, and no external hardware. If Win10 Preview can't even recover from an error on this computer, I think win10 project
 has a real problem with it's Management.</p>

            <p>Hello Geethu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding to this issue. I truly appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>it was doing Refresh, until the next time I looked, and it is at 50% "installing win10 tech preview". &nbsp;</li><li>No it does not have iTunes. As I said, it's a brand new laptop and I even got rid of everything except just the essentials like .NET and C++ libraries and such.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Whats really interesting and unusual to me, is that it almost finished the installation. It even came up with the right resolution on the display. &nbsp;That's a long way to come, to all of a sudden get back to Restart Looping with no where to go. So I am wondering
 what could cause such a set back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way since this is a brand new laptop with no proprietary stuff on the disk, and me living only 10 minutes away from Microsoft Campus in Redmond, I could drop the PC off so technicians can look at it. Just an idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>Update build 15048 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wellside46  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update build 15048</h2>
                    <p><span>I have been away from the Insider program with my 32bit laptop, which was running build 1493.726 very satisfactorily. Today I went to slow ring and updated to 15048. Unfortunately
 Wi-Fi and other devices did not work. Investigation showed that the device manager had multiple instances of each device all marked with a yellow triangle, Properties show that only one device of each group is actually working. Device properties showed "this
 device cannot find enough resources that it can use Code 12". See before and after screenshots below.</span></p>
<p><span>Disabling all the duplicates removed the yellow triangles but these returned on a reboot.</span></p>
<p><span>Update, Clean Install and install to an empty formatted drive all produce the same result.</span></p>
<p><span>Update troubleshooter cannot find any fault</span></p>
<p><span>A wi‚Äìfi connection can be established via an external dongle but any attempt to update drivers gets a response that ‚Äúbest drivers are installed‚Äù
</span></p>
<p><span>Any Ideas. Is this a bug in the build?</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a0fca14-5b98-4196-ac30-5c822e3fb985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a0fca14-5b98-4196-ac30-5c822e3fb985" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e8e08b9-93dd-47a6-b6b6-0c29b05b903d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e8e08b9-93dd-47a6-b6b6-0c29b05b903d" /></a></p>

            <span>thank you for your comment. Like you I have searched google without success of finding any help. Laptop is an old gateway MT6833 with 2 gb ram., Not the highest of specs but has performed on the
 varios versions of windows 10 so far without a falter. I have gone back original version meanwhile. Hope a later update may help.</span>

            The clue is older as right now I'm having issues with some older Dell's about 20 &nbsp;at the moment all updated to the Public build from Windows 7 when W10 came out and updated to the newest public build without any issues, now here is the issue as I've been
 testing this model Optiplex 755 for a couple of weeks with the newer Preview builds all ok until the 15*** started now each one has issues with display and I have tried changing drivers without any change, have posted to the Feedback Hub with the question
 "will we be able to keep the current public build and still receive security updates on older system as they won't be able to handle the newer builds 15*** series which will soon be the RTM?" still waiting for input as I'm going to repost it again. &nbsp;

            <p>I read that support for Windows 10 version 1507 ends May, 2017. That might suggest a timeline for when support for version 1607 will end.</p>

</p><p>My 2007 Dell XPS M1710 laptop (came with Windows Vista) still runs the latest Insider builds. A couple of issues that were causing blue-screen crashes in earlier Insider builds seem to have been addressed and no longer are a problem. I reported driver problems
 via Feedback Hub.</p>

<p>On the OP:</p>
<p>What happens if you remove all of the extra devices that show as disabled? Have you also turned on View - Show Hidden devices in Device Manager?</p>

 the account properties "More Settings" dialogue.&nbsp; Tools&gt;Account Settings.&nbsp; On the E-mail tab, select your account, click Change, then More Settings.&nbsp; Select the Advanced tab.&nbsp; Check the box labeled "Leave a copy of messages on the server".&nbsp; If you had done
 this when you created the account, your mail would have remained on the server.</p>
<p>Now that the horse is out of the barn, as long as you are restricted to POP, you're out of luck.&nbsp; You cannot move the messages back to the server.&nbsp; You can email them (as attachments is best) to yourself but they'll come from you not the original sender.&nbsp;
 If they're attachments, you can open the attachment in order to access the original sender information.</p>
<p>If you can set up an IMAP account, you can move things back.&nbsp; If you can create an IMAP account, you can then copy all the messages in your default Inbox to the IMAP account's Inbox to put it back on the server exactly as it was before.&nbsp; Check with Road
 Runner support to find out if they support IMAP.&nbsp; My cursory research indicates they don't, however.</p>
<p>Another thing to try is to create a Google Mail account, which can be IMAP, and copy the data to the gmail Inbox.&nbsp; From there you may be able use Road Runner's web interface to your RR mailbox and see if it has settings that will allow it to POP messages
 from another mail provider.&nbsp; You can then POP the messages from your gmail mailbox and they should move back to the RR mailbox, although I don't know how the sender and recipient fields will transfer.&nbsp; At least you'd have your messages back on RR.&nbsp; Alternatively,
 you may be able to have the gmail mailbox forward the messages to your RR mailbox, but again, I don't know how the sender/recipient data will appear afterward.</p>

<h2>            Unable to access user account and want to change domain administrator.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: outlook.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have my own outlook account (i.e. the one I am posting from).<br />
<br />
I had just added my own domain (say pathwayt.com) - which is authorised and working - and I use my outlook.com address to sign in and administer the domain.<br />
<br />
I have created a few users and these are working fine. but I have run into a problem.<br />
<br />
I created an account for me (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) and for some reason I cannot login to this account. There was a message flashed on these screen when I created the account (something about merging) and unfortunately this happened at the same time as a bit of
 a disaster in the office (which I am still dealing with!) and I confess to pressing the next button and I think I agreed to the merge - but I am not sure.<br />
<br />
Also, I have created and *** Email address is removed for privacy *** address and would like this to be used as the domain administrator from now on. How can I change this?<br />
<br />
I can't see why I cannot get into my own account in the domain and cannot see what I have done wrong. Can anyone help me please?<br />

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for coming back and providing us more details about your concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the user that you are not being able to access the Inbox, please be informed that was not yet registered as a user account on your domain (pathwayteaching.com) in Windows Live Admin Center. Make sure it was
successfully </span>registered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the admin account that you wanted to changed the MX records, and you still not to configure some settings on it. You can refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Delete all existing MX records configured in his registrar wait for an hour or two.
</p>
<p><span>2. Go to </span><span><font color="#0000ff"><a href="https://domains.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://domains.live.com</a></font></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Get the MX record from there and it should be in <strong>xxxxxxxxxx.pamx1.hotmail.com</strong> format if it‚Äôs in xxxxxxxxxx.msv1.invalid format, please replace it with xxxxxxxxxx.pamx1.hotmail.com format.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let me know if we can help with anything else.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply Jessa_R</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have sent the new MX record rquest to our hosting company and they will change it first thing in the morning.</p>
<p><br />
At that point, once admin@ account is established as the administrator, I will delete the paul@ account - which is showing as a user when I login at domains.live.com - but obviously has not been registered correctly - and then will re-create the account.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hopefully this will resolve the issue once and for all.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I will post back how I get on,</p>
<p><br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p>I changed the MX record to as you suggested and then I was able to remove the problem account and re-create it without any further issues. Success!!!</p>
<p><br />
Could I make one suggestion? - </p>

<p>It would be great if there was a FAQ / Support Centre for&nbsp; Outlook.com that specifically deals with advice for working with your own Domain Name.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are some great resources already available for Outlook.com but finding information for working with your own Domain is intermingled with working with an Outlook/Live/Hotmail address and a lot of that information is not relevant to the issues that can
 arise with Outlook.com and your own Domain Name.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Thank you very much for your assistance. I greatly appreciate your patience and support.</p>

<h2>            14267&#58; problems with boot and dual-boot &#40;with 8.1 Update&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I upgraded my copy of Windows 10 to build 14267, I've had issues with booting my PC: regardless of hybrid startup being enabled or not, on both OSes, my computer gets stuck on the startup screen, and will stay there forever if I don't press the Power
 button to end its suffering. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried with both Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 as default (using EasyBCD), I've enabled then disabled, then re-enabled hybrid startup on both OSes in sequence, and I'm still having issues, the more worrying being that even if I put one or the other OS in
 hibernation, it won't boot the next morning... </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found some tips and tricks here (http://betanews.com/2016/02/22/windows-10-insider-preview-build-14267-bootup-fix/) that don't entirely satisfy me because I like my PC to boot on auto logon.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you guys experienced those issues too, and if so, have you found some workaround measures and/or solutions?

You could try turning off fast startup and see if you get the startup issue.<br />
<br />
1. Right-click start, Power Options<br />
2. Click Require a password on wakeup<br />
3. Click Change settings that are currently unavailable<br />
4. Untick [&nbsp;&nbsp; ] Turn on fast startup<br />
5. Click [Save changes] button<br />
6. Shutdown<br />
7. Start your computer and login.<br />

            <p>Hi Lawrence, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't take it bad, but did you read my OP at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mentioned that I tried both case scenarios, with or without fast startup (aka hybrid boot) enabled, and still got the issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since fast startup works by storing session components √† la hibernation, it was the obvious culprit, but even with fast startup disabled on both OSes, the issues are still here.

            <p>I did not read hybrid boot as Fast boot. but you should still unclick it as that is what is making the dual power up necessary.</p>
<p>Try right click start, Command Prompt (Admin), type netplwiz and remove logon</p>

You could try turning off fast startup and see if you get the startup issue.<br />
<br />
1. Right-click start, Power Options<br />
2. Click Require a password on wakeup<br />
3. Click Change settings that are currently unavailable<br />
4. Untick [&nbsp;&nbsp; ] Turn on fast startup<br />
5. Click [Save changes] button<br />
6. Shutdown<br />
7. Start your computer and login.<br />

<p>Thanks for that, major&nbsp;glitch removed for me.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I must admit that 14267 is the worst upgrade I've done so far.&nbsp; Okay, I'm using an ancient HP 2560P laptop, with 2 GB RAM, Intel i5-2450, but apart from the stupid fastboot issue, I'm getting occasional random BSOD's on boot with a&nbsp; system exception error
 on DXGKrnl.sys, despite having all the right video drivers installed...&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>All through the INsider program, this is the one that's got me closest to reverting to the previous build.&nbsp; Hope beyond hope, MS don't think THIS one is close to RTM</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Now this might sound absolute mad.&nbsp; Had an issue similar to you.</p>
<p>I downloaded a piece of free to use backup software called Macrium Reflec</p>
<p>Produced the bootable CD, then booted the system from cd</p>
<p>There is a section from the menu after boot that gives options to fix multi-boot systems</p>
<p>After following the instructions i had a perfect booting system</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try it.&nbsp; It may just help</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the tip, but I'm a bit reluctant to install third-party software I don't know, especially one that can interact with the MBR (or what's now replaced it in modern-day versions of Windows).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could boot on the USB device I (re)installed Windows 8.1 from, open a console and fix the BCD, but it's time-consuming, and I'll keep it as a last-resort measure.

</p>
<p>There's an option to repair/fix BCD on this software. I might try it. Push come to shove, I'll insert the USB device in a port and fix it in a console.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, and FWIW, the problem doesn't arise when restarting the PC, only when I shut it down, then try to start it up again.

<p>Hi JacquieCC,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not feasible to clear Recent list on Word 2016 for Mac or Excel 2016 for Mac.</p>
<p>We can only delete the items one by one.</p>
<p>You can refer to the following article:</p>

    <title>What is syncnode and is it safe&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrsbeebuzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is syncnode and is it safe&#63;</h2>
                    I got a phone call from India, intimated he was from Microsoft. supposedly T/f me to supervisor. Prompted me to open a thing that gave them remote access to my computer by typing in the 'run' box, syncnode.<br />
After they had then run a supposed virus removal programme, (or whatever it's called) I got a bit suspicious &amp; loged it all off, saying I wasn't happy with someone in my computer like that?&nbsp; I Googled syncnode&nbsp; and it seems to be a fairly new thing. But I can't
 find out much about it, only how to use it &amp; suchlike. I just want to know that I didn't do the wrong thing in allowing them access to my computer. They gave me a telephone number, but that could be anything, couldn't it?<br />
Can someone please put my mind at rest? I am a pensioner &amp; can't afford to have any hiccups at this late stage in my life. ie, I have no money!!<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Hi Mrs. Beebuzz,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a scam!&nbsp; It was not a good idea to give them access to your computer, but I believe that they may be deciptful and lying tricksters to suck people into there schemes, but I don't believe they are malicious or did or will seek to harm you or your computer.&nbsp;
 See this article and in particular the response specifically about Syncnode: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10</a>.&nbsp; The article also includes links for things to do if you think you've been a victim of this type of scam and information about what Microsoft
 does and doesn't do so you won't be tricked again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe the safest thing to do at this point is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do a System Restore to before the call and giving them access.&nbsp; That will hopefully remove anything they may have installed and undo any changes they might have made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then to make sure you weren't infected, please do the folllowing;</p>

            <p>You should never have more than one security product installed on the PC providing active protection/scanning. This can cause performance issues, system instability, and can hinder the effectiveness
 of both products at providing protection.</p>
<p>You cannot have MSE and AVG on the PC together. You must remove AVG and use the removal tool if you prefer to use MSE. MalwareBytes free is fine as it has no real time components and only works on demand.</p>
<p>The AVG removal tool can be found from this thread: </p>

<p>
</p><p>Is there any 3rd party application or plug in that I can use for Microsoft Word 2010 to replicate the repeating section content control in Microsoft Word 2013?&nbsp; I'm currently using a 2013 Word template and OpenXml but when I open the document in Word 2010,
 the repeating section content controls (I'm using it in a table) only displays the first row.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

<p>The links show how to do much what that control does, I believe, in Word 2007 and 2010.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>New, means, ... new. That content control is not a feature in Word 2010. Word 2010 does not have a repeating content control, as such.</p>

<p>
</p><p>What, specifically, are you trying to do that is not addressed by the two articles? The first shows how to repeat information typed in one place throughout a document. The second shows how to make it so that changes in one place change the content in all
 similarly mapped controls.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The answer to your title question: "Does Word 2010 have a repeating content control like Word 2013" is "<strong>NO, this is new to Word 2013.</strong>" It does not work in earlier versions of Word; they do not know what to do with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to do this in Word 2010 you have to use something different. The Word 2013 control will not work in earlier versions of Word. If you want your document/template to be used in those versions you have to do something else. Generally when MS adds
 a feature to the program it is so that a user can do something that would be difficult to do without the feature (or because it looks pretty to corporate buyers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please expand on what you mean by "the data will come from the XML file that I programmatically load to the Word template." In what way is this different from a mail merge? Could a label or directory mail merge serve the same purpose?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that this may mean that you will have to restructure how you get your data into your document and mean extra work.

            <p>Hi Charles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank for the input.&nbsp; That's why I'm looking for alternatives like plug-ins, add-ins or any library that can replicate the repeating section content control for it to work in Word 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the XML data, I have a code in C# that connects to SQL, I then convert that data into XML to feed it into the Word template that I have also created.&nbsp; I used this code from Christopher:

            Since Excel does not save in a Word document format I'm in the dark about what you mean by "<i>converted</i>"... converted
<i>how</i> &amp; to <i>what</i>? That may be the cause of the problem. Have you opened that data source document to see what it looks like? In particular, how does the 3rd record differ from the first 2? That message just means that the data cannot be read.<br />
<br />
The options I've used most successfully are:<br />
<ul>
<li>Save in a .xlsx or .xls format. It's best if the data is the only content on the sheet &amp; begins with field names in Row 1. The records should be consecutively listed beginning in Row 2 with no breaks between records. Also, Merged cells must be avoided [under
 any circumstances], or</li><li>An actual Word document [.docx or .doc] consisting of nothing but a Table containing the records as described above.</li></ul>

            I copy and pasted the information from the cells on the excel sheet onto a word document which automatically formatted it with rows and columns. &nbsp;That wasn't as clean. &nbsp;I had to go through and add missing data and format it a little bit. &nbsp;Its frustrating
 because I have been doing mail mergers for about 10 years and never had issues until I switched to my Macbook Pro. &nbsp;I've tried saving with different formats. Row 1 has just field names. &nbsp;Row 2 has all the data to be merged. &nbsp;There is one column that is Address
 2 for suites, etc. So some records will not have an address 2. &nbsp;But other than that, every field has information in it. &nbsp;And yes, I did the word document that created the table (copy &amp; paste method). &nbsp;Not sure why all won't merge, though. &nbsp;Thanks for trying.

            Thanks for the help, Phillip. &nbsp;That's basically what I've done. &nbsp;The only difference is after it talks about conversion, and I press OK, a box comes up that says there is an error.

            Hi Linsay,
<div><br />
<div>There are two general areas where the trouble could be. It could be with your installation of Office, or it might be a bad preferenece file. Let's do an experiment that will tell which might be the case.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In System Preferences make a new user account. Log into that user account and try the mail merge there. If it works OK, then there's likely to be a bad preference file in your regular user account. If the problem is still the same, we might next explore
 fixing the Office installation.</div>

<h2>            language accent marks English keyboard windows 8</h2>
                    While I can change to a Spanish keyboard and make the accent marks for the Spanish language, sometimes I want to use only one or two words in Spanish while using the English keyboard.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to make Spanish accent marks on an English keyboard?&nbsp;
 Thanks - Ricardo61zt

            <p>In Windows 8, go to the Control Panel, then "Clock, Language &amp; Region" then "Change Input methods."&nbsp; (To get to the Control Panel from the Start page, just click any blank area of the page and type the words "Control Panel.")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where it says "English - United States," click "Options."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click "Add an input method"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the search box, in the top-right, type "international" then select "US-International" and click "Add" and then "Save."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should now be able to use the Windows key and the space bar to toggle between your two keyboard layouts.</p>

            <p>If you only need to type an occasional accent and you are running Windows 8, you can also open the touch keyboard and touch-and-hold the letter you want to put an accent on. You can also click-and-hold the letter on the touch keyboard. When you click-and-hold
 or touch-and-hold on the touch keyboard, alternate characters show up, then you can slide to the character you want.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I found this out by accident one night. I'm not sure if this work on devices that are not touch-enabled, but it worked on both my tablet and my l√§pt√≥p.</p>
