            Many thanks Sachin.V, I've tried the Windows DVD Player, which hasn't worked (managed to get a refund). I'm now sharing a CD/DVD driver from another machine for loading programmes etc. Just staggering that the CD/DVD software is left off of&nbsp;Windows 10,
 should certainly be included in the paying version.

<h2>            Skype for Business CRASHES&#47;FREEZES&#47;HANGS&#47;DISCONNECTS when using Desktop Sharing.</h2>
                    <p>We are experiencing issues in our organization using Skype for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Users are&nbsp;having issues&nbsp;with Skype for Business disconnecting&nbsp;from Desktop Sharing&nbsp;during a&nbsp;meeting in progress without&nbsp;alerting the presenter that it got disconnected, so the presenter has no clue that&nbsp;all participants who joined the meeting are not
 able to see&nbsp;the screen unless someone notifies the presenter of the issue and then they have to restart&nbsp;Desktop Sharing again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. As the host of the meeting, if the meeting organizer joins the meeting without audio, they don't seem to have the option to Mute Audience, but if they join the meeting with audio then the option to mute audience is there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Users are also reporting that when they click on the link to Join Skype Meeting from their calendar, the link is clickable but skype doesn't open the meeting. (this is most likely an issue with Skype not responding).</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. During a meeting, Skype for Business crashed and it did not respond until we ended the lync/skype process from task manager. Unfortunately, when Skype started up it crashed once again, it crashed another 2 times and eventually the computer had to be restarted
 and the user decided to use Live Meeting instead since it's more reliable. This issue with Skype happened in the act when the host started Desktop Sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>All users reporting these issues have been verified of using the latest version of SfB 2016 MSO (16.0.6701.1036) 64bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if at this time there's a solutions to all these issues users are experiencing when using SfB but so far the feedback from our users has been very poor when they rely on using SfB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi Jon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing this workaround on this Skype for Business VBSS crash issue. Based on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3150900" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a> you shared, the fix is already released in April for the Click-to-Run installation, so I suppose the users in your organization were installed with MSI installations. We hope you understand
 that we are working to fix this issue soon, for now you can apply the workaround. We suggest you to regularly check this KB for future updates:

<h2>            Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm running 7 home 64bit (8Gb RAM &amp; 1Tb HDD), used to run 10 on laptop until it crashed over a year ago, it wouldn't load as if there was nothing to load just hanging on the boot, I thought I'd try the upgrade again but i've had the same result, hang on
 boot, I tried the upgrade from within 7 and a clean install however neither worked, so I've reloaded 7 back onto the laptop from a backup I did previously ready for this. I am wondering if anyone knows why this is happening or whether it has happened to anyone
 else? I would appreciate any assistance that people can give as I would like to run Windows 10 on the machine again. If it helps, the machine is an Acer Aspire E3-112.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I have several other computers running 10, so would I be able to take a backup from one of those and restore it to this laptop (Acer) and restore the program and data from the Windows 7 backup? Not even Acer understand the problem, telling me to do
 a factory reset, which again ended with the same result.</p>

<p>Well Acer does support Windows 10 on your&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Acer Aspire E3-112, so in theory there should be no issue running Windows 10 on that system . . .</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Certainly a clean install would be preferred over an upgrade from Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you previously clean installed Windows 10 on your&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Acer Aspire E3-112 what error(s) were you getting?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I you have several other computers running Windows 10 happily, have you tried pulling the hard drive from one of the working systems and putting it into the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Acer Aspire E3-112 to see if it runs . . .</span></p>

<p>I'm sorry I can't help with error codes as I haven't seen one, on the upgrades I'd be lucky if the computer restores the previous OS and with the clean installs it hangs so I can't see anything if there is something to show. It'd be easier for me to take
 a clone of my other laptop (Dell Inspiron 1750) using clonezilla (used to use for work when a new computer needed windows so I'd copy from one computer to another to save me time installing and updating another windows system), I'll post to tell you how that
 goes.</p>

<p>Which version of Windows 10 are you attempting to install (Creators Update), Anniversary Update?
<br />
</p>
<p>I don't see the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Acer Aspire E3-112</span> listed as supported by the Windows 10 Creators Update, so you might want to revert to an older supported version such as the Anniversary Update, which might work.

            Hello, I went back and found the original windows 10 &nbsp;iso, 1507, still didn't work, it installed ok going through the steps as usual, getting started &gt; unpacking files &gt; installing features &gt; installing updates &gt; completing, at which point it restarted
 and as usual froze on the circling dots. I don't understand why I can't get it to work again, when i know it's worked before on the machine. I'm still going to try reimaging the system from another machine, but not tonight

            Thanks, tried that, I had a usb reciever for a wireless trackball, still no joy, exactly the same, the install went ahead as normal but stopped on the spinning dots. I've spoken with acer who said to use a factory reset disk, which i have done with no
 joy.

<p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes the problem still persists, I tried upgrading through Windows 8.1 (Laptop originally came with 8.1) but same problem with 8.1 as with 10, installs ok but until the first boot where it freezes on the spinning dots. I also tried a system image from another
 computer but that didn't work either. I removed all usb for the first boot (boot disc and usb mouse receiver).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone back to 7 to think more on the problem, and to have it working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>

            <p>No Help. </p>
<p>I first ran Microsoft Memory check - no errors.<br />
Then ran SFC - no errors.</p>
<p>Had the system scan for drivers with "wuapp" - said "all are current" and so would NOT allow me to reload any. IS THERE a way to force a reload in WIN10? For this problem, which would I reload?? The Broadcom WiFi Adapter? I guess I could UNINSTALL that as
 long as I connect an ethernet cable for an internet connection until re-installed.</p>
<p>WHICH gives the testing idea -- I could run a cable for a few days/weeks and see if it ever fails. Not a 100% reliable check, but if it fails, I know it isn't this driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because it was happening in Chrome, and getting Worse (more frequent) I first tried loading some other program, then Chrome, so that it would occupy a different place in memory (maybe address related -- I've seen weird stuff in 40 years of mainframe computer
 repair) - but when it happened again, I removed Chrome and started using Firefox. That only took a couple days to error, though slightly different -<br />
"Driver IRQL not Less than or Equal to NETIO.SYS"</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO it seems the problem is centered around that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Send me a new copy of NETIO.SYS and I will put it in place of the current one -- in case it is a bad spot on the hard drive - though there may be some other way to test if it is reading that routine correctly every time. On mainframes of 70s and 80s, we
 could do that. Or write into the tables tracking errors so that sector is skipped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - next idea? Thanks.</p>

            <p>Blue screen errors involving&nbsp; the netio.sys are often caused by third party filter drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a couple of links on using OneDrive (SkyDrive):</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time</p>

            <p>I zipped 4 DMP files last week -- but the ONEDRIVE wants me to "sync" all my files -- I do NOT want to sync PRIVATE files.<br />
<br />
How can I send ONE or TWO Zipped files only??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also zip the 2 latest DMP from using Firefox --- figure you can 'cross reference' any problem in the two types of failures.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT -- the 2 latest failures did NOT create minidumps. They happens in past couple days, but only the failures from Chrome are in there.</p>
<p>I moved the zipped file to my 'onedrive' folder - can't figure out how to get it to the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there no FTP place to send it??? So much easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW - I already uninstalled/reinstalled the WiFi driver -- testing now.</p>

            <p>I took a look at the dump files and the driver that appears to be causing is the vsdatant.sys which is causing a crash&nbsp;with the netio.sys&nbsp;:</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is the same error as reported in the following topic:</p>

<p>Power brick goes orange when Xbox One is off then bright white when on?. Is this normal?. I have it plugged into a power bar because there are no plugs near it. I heard it's not safe to do that and some say it's fine. What can I do?</p>

<p>Hi TheMadGamerMan</p>
<p>What setting is your console set to instant on or energy saver? If set to instant on would mean your power brick light stays white all the time unless unplugged, Energy saver means the light is orange when the console is off and white when on. As far as
 your console being plugged into a pwr strip its all on the consoles owners choice.</p>

<p>I to have my Xbox One plugged into a "power strip" but the advise from MS is that you should avoid plugging the Xbox One into something that has a surgeprotector, as this can cause issues with &nbsp;the built-in surge protector in the XB One's Power brick.. stricktley
 speaking they recomend plugging the console directly into a wall socket, but I dont have enough of them where my tv is so I really dont have a choice, &nbsp;I've had no issues using a plain "power strip" (without surge protector) as far as I can tell, it is however
 important that the power strip/bar is in good condition and not dammaged in any way :-)</p>

<p>100 percent correct about the surge protector/power strip problem - absolutely DO NOT use one, you'll have problems eventually. What happens is, the power brick already has a surge protector, and plugging into another one actually chokes the flow of power
 during startup (which is greatly needed to initialize all components properly.)</p>
<p>This actually leads to failure of components, and as a result, the system. This was actually a leading cause of RRoD on the 360, and I've helped a couple of people on X1 already whose problems were resolved by switching to a wall outlet. Speaking from experience
 on this, too - in the early days of the 360, this wasn't common knowledge, and I had a power strip. After about a year, the info started to seep out that they had to be plugged into a wall.</p>

<h2>            Windows Explorer Freezes When Clicking on Specific File &#40;flac&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm experiencing a very annoying issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Explorer has suddenly started hating flac files. If I click on a flac file, explorer freezes. I can mouse over the files, but as soon as I click down on one the window freezes. I can still use other explorer windows, but I can't close, move, or minimize
 the frozen explorer window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I open a zip file that contains flac files, the same thing happens. Any program I attempt to open the zip file with will freeze, I've tried explorer, 7zip, and winrar, all three with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I can grab an audio program and open the extracted files with no problems. Audition and audacity are both happy to open and play the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried disabling thumbnails, which hasn't fixed the problem. In safe mode things seem to work normally with no freezing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to fix or troubleshoot this issue?</p>

<h2>            PC keeps restarting</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated windows 8 to windows 10 and I am now having problems, I have updated windows 10 on my other PC and my laptop and they both work fine, but my main PC is having real problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some days I can turn on my PC an it runs fine all day, then other times ( like today ) it keeps on restarting!! I am getting no error messages so have no idea what is going on. This problem has only started since upgrading to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can any one help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mac</p>

            Hi  Pradeep
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If Sony stopped supporting the camera after Windows Vista, this means the camera is more than 10 years old. Some hardware is just not supported in the newer version.
<br />
<br />Your best option is to try installing the driver in compatibility then try connecting the camera:

            Hi Pradeep,
<br />if your camera has  i.Link (IEEE 1394)  interface you may try to add IEEE 1394 adapter card to your PC and try to use it. May be Windows 10 built-in drivers may work with a camera thru this interface. At least supported Windows versions did not require special camera driver.
<br />Or you may try to use PlayMemories Home program in compatibility mode..

<p>schau mal oben bei Support &gt; Mein Konto (wenn da mein Account steht kannst du erst noch unten links auf dieser Seite auf 'United States' klicken und die Seite auf "Deutschland" umstellen) dann auf Konto verwalten. Dort steht neben "Aktuellen Themen" ~ "Kinderkonten".
 Da wird dann erklärt wie auf der jeweiligen Konsole eine Wandlung in ein Erwachsenenkonto durchzuführen ist. (eigentlich auch gar&nbsp;nicht schwer solange man fließend Kisuaheli spricht ;*)) )</p>

<p>Ich nehme mal an, dass Du eine XBox 360 hast.</p>
<p>Wenn Du bei der Erstellung Deines Accounts Dein Geburtsdatum korrekt angegeben hast, "weiß" der Live Service, dass Du ein Erwachsener bist.
</p>
<p>Du musst dann nur noch ganz nach rechts zu den Einstellungen, dort unten links zu der Konto Kachel, und dort sollte es die Option geben, Dein Konto zu einem Erwachsenenkonto heraufzustufen.</p>

<p>Selber Unterschied ;-)</p>
<p>Egal ob er auf 360 oder One sein Kinderkonto zum Erwachsenen Aufstuft, sobald er sich bei der anderen Konsole ab- und wieder neu angemeldet hat, ist er auf der Konsole automatisch auch erwachsen.</p>
<p>Oder wenn er auf der One sein Kinderkonto aufstufen will:</p>

Heraufstufen eines Kontos auf der Xbox One von einem Kinder- zu einem Erwachsenenkonto
<div>
<p>Erreicht eine Person die Volljährigkeit auf der Grundlage des für das Xbox Live-Konto erfassten Geburtsdatums, stuft Xbox One bei der nächsten Anmeldung das Konto von einem Kinder- zu einem Erwachsenenkonto automatisch herauf. Wenn Sie die automatische Anmeldung
 mit Kinect nutzen oder bei Ihrem Konto angemeldet bleiben, müssen Sie sich abmelden und wieder anmelden, um die Änderung durchzuführen.</p>

</li><li>Folgen Sie den Anweisungen, um die Nutzungsbedingungen und Datenschutzerklärung von Xbox Live zu akzeptieren.

<span>Hi Mkress,</span></p>

<span>You might get this error if Windows Error Reporting Service is not started, you may try restarting the service on the computer and check, if the issue still persists or not, follow
 the steps below to Start the service:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type Services in the Start Search.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Search for Windows Error Reporting Service in the list.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on the Service.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Properties.</span></p>

<p>
<span>1. Steps to perform chkdsk:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>i. Click on start
</span></p>
<p>
<span>ii. Type cmd in start search box.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>iii. Right click on cmd.exe in the Program list and then select the option Run as administrator.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>iv. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>v. In the command prompt window, type the following command and press enter Chkdsk /r</span></p>
<p>
<span>Note: During the restart process, Windows checks the disk for errors, and then Windows starts. Now run the check disk in command prompt.</span></p>

            It looks like you're using a custom wallpaper, and that Wilson AU is the photographer for that image, his watermark.&nbsp; If you change to a different wallpaper, is the name still present?

    <title>Sprachchat auf der Xbox One deaktivieren - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shriimpyy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sprachchat auf der Xbox One deaktivieren</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo liebes Forum,</p>
<p>ich würde gerne mal wissen ob und wie man den Sprachchat auf der Xbox One deaktivieren kann. Gerade in Forza 5 ist es sehr nervig, wenn man in eine Lobby kommt und erst alle manuell stummschalten muss, da jeder Experte dort ja etwas zu sagen hat. Ich möchte
 den Sprachchat aber nur auf der One deaktivieren, nicht auf der 360. Ist dies möglich?</p>
<p>Danke schon mal für alle Antworten :)</p>

<p>HALLO.</p>
<p>Es ist möglich die Sprachfunktionen für die Xbox One seperat unter den Online- und Datenschutzeinstellungen des Microsoft-Kontos zu deaktivieren. Die Einstellung für die Xbox 360 ist dort auf einer seperaten Registertafel aufgeführt und und einstellbar.</p>
<p>Um diese Einstellungen zu ändern gehst Du zunächst auf die Xbox.com-Webseite und meldest Dich dort mit Deinen Xbox-Profildaten an.</p>
<p>Dann klickst Du auf Deinen Profilnamen und wählst "Konto" aus.</p>
<p>Jetzt wird die Hauptseite für Deine Xbox-Kontoeinstellungen geladen. &nbsp;Wähle nun die Rubrik
</p>
<p>"Sicherheit und Kennwort" auf der linken Seite aus, und klicke im Anschluss sofort die "Online- und Datenschutzeinstellungen" an.</p>
<p>Diese werden nun seperat für die Xbox 360 und die Xbox One auf einzelnen Registerkarten dargestellt.</p>
<p>Somit kannst Du nun die Sprach- und Kommunikationseinstellungen für die jeweilige Konsole (Chat-/ Viedeo-/ Kinecteinstellungen etc.) seperat nach Deinem Belieben verändern.</p>
<p>Am Ende jedoch das Speichern nicht vergessen...! &nbsp;;))</p>
<p>Ich hoffe das löst Dein Problem und wünsche Dir weiterhin viel Spass beim Zocken und Co. !!!!</p>
<p>Bei Fragen stehe ich Dir natürlich gerne wieder zur Verfügung!!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Tried several things, cannot get print spooler to start. Tried deleting the printer software, Canon MX410, &nbsp;and reinstalling. Will not reinstall because the print spooler is not running. The first few times the print spooler stopped I did a restore to a

<p>Does error code 0x800706b9 help?</p>

            <p>Hi Danial,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is often caused by Windows thinking (often incorrectly) you are running an application that uses a microphone/telephony, and lowers other sounds for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the following to disable this behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the Start menu, search in the <code><font>Settings</font></code> category (<code><font>Win+W</font></code>) for "<code><font>Change Sound Card Settings</font></code>".</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the Communications tab, change "When Windows detects communications activity" to
<code><font>Do nothing</font></code>.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Let us know if this helps.</p>
        </p>

    <title>Critical Process Died...... Surface dead&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevecampbell134  say:</h3>
<h2>            Critical Process Died...... Surface dead&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Last year my <strong>Surface 3</strong> (updated fully) started throwing up <em>
<strong>service exception</strong></em> error BSODs and earlier this year I seemed to cure it when I reset the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a month ago the service exception error start up (especially from sleep) crash reappeared but today this error has been replaced by<strong>
<em>'critical process died'.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the various Windows repair options available has proved fruitless:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Start-up Repair</li><li>System Restore&nbsp;</li><li>sfc /scannow</li><li>Reset this PC</li><li>Recover from the Cloud</li><li>Change Start Up settings</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>…… all these repeatedly fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Absolutely NOTHING works.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know whether this can be sorted or is my beloved Surface 3 effectively dead?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Steve</p>
<p>

            Hi Steve, your Surface is not dead, this is usually caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, and sometimes by a piece of software that is incompatible with Windows.
<br />
<br />To diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the speedy reply! Appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is I can't start up the Surface 3.&nbsp; No access to the OS apart from the outside of Windows recovery processes which fail..</p>

<br />Do all the options in the Windows Recovery Environment fail, can you even get into Safe Mode?

<p>Tried reinstalling Windows 10 from the Media Creation Tool/USB drive but then ran into a refusal to install because of Bitlocker.&nbsp; To disable/suspend this I have to go to Control Panel which would be fine if I could access Windows to start with…. a Catch

<p>This is what worked!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the Windows Recovery Environment <strong>Command Prompt</strong> couldn't proceed with the
<strong>sfc /scannow </strong>command&nbsp;I <em>was</em> <em>able </em>to disable Bitlocker using it:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>manage-bde -protectors -disable C:</strong></span></p>
<p>Successfully installed Windows 10 from a UAB drive (Media Creation Tool etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re-enabled Bitlocker with:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>manage-bde -protectors -enable C: </strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now setting up the Surface 3 again.&nbsp; Had to run <strong>Disk Clean-up</strong> as virtually no space left with old version of Windows still in the root directory of C:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surface 3 lives again!&nbsp; :)&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />3. Type sfc /scannow command and press Enter key.
<br />
<br />4. Let the command complete and then reboot the machine. 
<br />

            If you had already entered your key during the installation, then all you need to is just click the link to Activate under System Properties. If you didn't enter your key, then you will need to enter it when you click the link to Activate Windows.

<h2>            Transfer Windows 10 License&#63;</h2>
                    I’m building a new PC in a few days, and I want to know if I can use my Windows 10 key on my current computer on the new one. I’m fine with ‘deactivating’ Windows on my current computer.

            Hi CeramicTrauma,
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new PC, if it is OEM it will not . ..

            Hi CeramicTrauma
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with your license question.
<br />
<br />It all depends on the version of the license you got.  Here is a brief explanation on licensing.  Although it says Windows 7, licensing rules still apply.
<br />
<br />When we purchase Windows operating system, we purchase them through different types of licenses. These Windows License impose restrictions, terms and rights which are based on Microsoft Software License Terms. The most popular license terms are  Retail (FPP (Full Packaged Product)), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), and Volume Licensing.
<br />
<br />Retail license - yes. You can move it to a different computer as long as it's only installed on one computer at a time (and if it's a Windows 7 Upgrade version the new computer must have it's own qualifying XP/Vista license). The previous Windows 7 installation on the old computer must be formatted/deleted. You might have to call Microsoft and explain what happened to complete the activation. Activating it on the second computer will automatically in effect "deactivate" the license for the first computer. The key will work with both 32 and 64 bit, but only one can be installed at a time. 
<br /> 
<br />OEM license - no. OEM licenses, including Windows preinstalled on a computer before purchase, are tied to the first computer they are installed on and can not be transferred to a different computer. To install Windows on a different computer you will need to buy another copy. 
<br />
<br />Volume Licensing: Volume License Keys are issued by companies for use on client computers of its own organization. Volume License Keys and Volume Product keys are not-for-resale keys and they cannot be transferred if computer changes ownership. Volume License find applications in government and educational institutions. The prices for volume licensing varying depending on the type, quantity and applicable subscription-term. A volume license key (VLK) can also indicate the product key used while installing software licensed in bulk. It allows a single product key to be used for multiple installations. For example, the Windows Enterprise edition is activated with a volume license key.
<br />
<br />To determine what kind of license you have here is a link that will show you how.

<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

<p>Things to try:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Turn off the console and unplug it for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Uninstall the DLC if you have it installed in My Games and Apps &gt; Games &gt; Push START (3 lines button) on your game&gt; Manage game &gt; Uninstall the DLC. Repeat step 1. Then repeat step 2 but reinstall the DLC from that manage menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. A factory reset keeping games and apps: Settings &gt; System &gt; Console Info &amp; Updates &gt; Reset console &gt; "keep games and apps". (requires account redownload).</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Reinstall the game fully.</p>

<p>I ran into a similar issue with Assassin's creed Odyssey the other day.&nbsp; I did a Power cycle on the system and it worked just fine after that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
