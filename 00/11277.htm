<h2>            Lumia Beamer - WHY gone &#55357;&#56862;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Seriously - am starting to miss the Symbian days, when you could come home and your old Nokia could update your Outlook diary system on your laptop via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Though the hardware is improving, that is little good if the software is getting worse, together with the functionality of the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Why did you pull Lumia Beamer without replacement? You're about to loose a customer, on my next upgrade if you don't reply....</p>

            <p>I don't know about Beamer but my Lumia updates my laptop, desktop, and other phone's calendars and I don't have to come home first or actually be anywhere near them. Same for mail, contacts, and many other things that used to require me to be in relative
 close proximity to other devices. Using the cloud to sync is way more convenient, and flexible.</p>

            <p>...this was an overall comment about the general Lumia platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can have the best hardware in the world, but if the software / functionality of the phone is poor, it's useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What frustrates me the most is how distant Microsoft are when you want to give them direct feedback. I have spent hundreds of £s on Nokia hardware, for myself and my wife, and halfway through it's life it's getting worse, when one should be seeing tremendous
 improvements everyday. Microsoft have no excuse. They more than have the capacity to build good software for an already good platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lumia Beamer worked, why on earth when they were moving forward, did they pull it, making it worse?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If an actual Microsoft representative can explain to me why this happened, and reassure me that things are going to get better, I may decide to take this up with the Which? consumer magazine.</p>

<h2>            Contact lookup by Name</h2>
                    <p>Using Outlook 2010 I am running up against an issue I don't remember having previously. I have contacts and both the name &amp; email fields are filled. When I go to write an email, say I type Jim, I get a list of people with Jim in their names. However, I don't
 get all the names. If a person'r email address doesn't have his name, then I have to know his email address or else look them up in my contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea why not all the people having the same first name do not appear?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

</p><blockquote>&nbsp;Could this be because I am using Hotmail &amp; maybe Outlook doesn't support that? Just kinda confused.
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - Outlook definitely supports Outlook.com (formerly Hotmail) contact folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - The screenshot is strange in that you have no folders showing in the AddressBook drop down which is why you wouldn't be able to find anything and the action buttons being greyed out. On the surface - seems that your AddressBook service is corrupted</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestion would be to create a new Outlook profile and configure your Outlook.com account (new profile = starting from scratch, not making a copy of an existing profile and making changes to it). This also presumes that when you log into your Outlook.com
 (Hotmail) account via webmail (your browser) that the contact folder contains the contacts that you're expecting to find.</p>

<h3> joe kalinowski fv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Converting PowerPoint Shows to Video Files</h2>
                    <p>I created a narrated PowerPoint Show file (.ppsx) using PowerPoint for Mac 2011 (Version 14.6.1). I would like to convert that file to an audio-narrated video file for posting to YouTube. My version of PowerPoint does not support that function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open the existing file on a Windows PC running a later version of PowerPoint (say 2010, 2013 or 2016), will that PC allow me to generate the desired audio-narrated video file? If so, what steps do you recommend?</p>

            <p>You can export to video in a Windows version of PowerPoint and the narration will be captured.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There also are 2 ways to do this on a Mac. You can extract the narration and add it as a sound file to the video export, or you can record the presentation in QuickTime Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Method 1:</em></p>
<p>Please follow these steps to extract the audio:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close PowerPoint. Make a copy of your presentation and rename it, adding .zip to the end of the file.</li><li>Right-click on the file and choose Open With&gt;<strong>Archive Utility</strong>. The file is unzipped.</li><li>Archive Utility creates a folder with the same name as the presentation. Open it.</li><li>Open&nbsp;<strong>ppt</strong>&gt;<strong>media</strong>.</li><li>Your narration will be in a WAV file. If you only have one narration and no music, then there will only be one file. If there are more, play the files to find the narration.</li></ol>
<p>Now you can re-export the movie:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the presentation in PowerPoint.</li><li>Choose File&gt;<strong>Save as Movie</strong>.</li><li>Click on the&nbsp;<strong>Movie Options...</strong>&nbsp;button</li><li>Beside&nbsp;<em>Background soundtrack</em>, click the dropdown and choose&nbsp;<strong>Select soundtrack</strong>.</li><li>Choose the WAV file that holds your narration.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>, then&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>
<p><em>Method 2:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Open your presentation in PowerPoint and resize the window to the size you want your video to be (i.e. 640x480 pixels, etc.).</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Slide Show&gt;Set Up Show...</strong></li><li>Under&nbsp;<em>Show type</em>, choose&nbsp;<strong>Browsed by an individual (window)</strong>, then click on&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Start your Slide Show.</li><li>In QuickTime Player, choose&nbsp;<strong>File&gt;New Screen Recording</strong>.</li><li>On the&nbsp;<em>Screen Recording</em>&nbsp;dialog, click the&nbsp;<strong>red button</strong>&nbsp;in the middle.</li><li>Drag your mouse to select the PowerPoint window.</li><li>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Record</strong>.</li><li>Run your slideshow. When you're finished, click on the&nbsp;<strong>square dot inside a circle</strong>&nbsp;on the OS X menu bar to stop QuickTime. Save the video file.</li></ol>

<h2>            2 things I miss in Nokia PC Suite</h2>
                    
<p>Is there any plans of implementing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- A dialer, so you can dial any number from the PC Suite software, without using contacts</p>
<p>-Using your headphones through the computer when you are talking in phone</p>

<p>As for the dialler, there would be little point - PC Suite is designed mainly as a method of sharing data in various forms between the phone and PC, apart from when using the phone as a modem there are few occasions when you would need an open network connection
 whilst connected to the PC (and that doesn't need a number to be dialled). When sending messages through communication centre, you can enter a number without using contacts. The Contacts section of communication centre is for managing the contacts, not for
 initiating phone calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why use the headphones through the computer? Why pass the sound through another device? you won't be increasing quality by passing it through the PCs systems, it would just relay the sound from the connected phone to the connected headset.</p>

<p>The Communication Centre is ment to be used for calling you contacts without having to first pick up the phone, then unlock it, search for the contact and press the call button. You do it directly in the Comm.Centre. I love this, but I must admit I miss
 the function 
walterc asked for: a dialer.</p>
<p>But the dialer should be "intellegent". Whenever you copy a number to the clipboard, it should be grabbed by the dialer when I activate it.</p>
<p>I would like to see a full numeric keyboard, allowing me to send DTMF when making the call.</p>
<p>In the archived beta software&nbsp; "PC Phone" from Nokia Beta Labs, you can at least dial any given number. I still use it for that. Not easy to find on the web thoug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I don't need sound via the PC. I will use my BT headset. It works for me.</p>

<p><span>Thanks for the assistance, I spoke to a friend who indicated this is due tothe Symbian version used by the E71 (9.2), as this functionality is not present in the software.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>However 9.3 and later, support these features but apparently is considered a less stable&nbsp;platform, which is&nbsp;inappropriate for business phones.
</span><span>So I guess the question is will the stability issue be resolved and can we expect 9.3 be rolled out to the E71?</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I for one would love to see 'a great phone', realise its potential!</p>

<p>The E71 is based on Symbian OS 9.2 and S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are already newer versions of Symbian and S60. E.g., the E75 used Symbian OS 9.3 and S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also the E71x is based on S60 3rd Ed. FP2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, Symbian OS 9.3 is just as appropriate for business phones as earlier or later versions, I'd say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I do not think that the E71 will ever get such an update. New versions of Symbian/S60 has so far only been released with/on new device models.</p>

<p><span>Petrib,</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I&nbsp;fear your view&nbsp;might be&nbsp;correct we&nbsp;should not expect an update on this.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Although&nbsp;I don’t necessarily agree with approach from Nokia, it makes perfect&nbsp;business sense not to provide additional functionality to current models, so people like myself want&nbsp;to buy&nbsp;new phones.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The E75&nbsp;seems to be a great phone, no surprise there, but I am not convinced on the slide keyboard and prefer the slim form of the E71 at 10mm in comparison to&nbsp;the slightly&nbsp;wider girth of&nbsp;its&nbsp;sibling at 14.4mm. Personal choice I am sure!</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Previous experience is that a&nbsp;new&nbsp;model&nbsp;often lose some of the currently ticked boxes, unless they repackage/update the E71 pretty much as is, much like the iPhone transformation to the 3G version, I will not find&nbsp;the utopia I thrive for!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>(apologies for mentioning the apple product&nbsp;- Not a fan, but great approach to business, and I managed to convince my company not to rollout iPhone and go E Series)</span></p>

<p>I have to say I am totally for the Dialer of any number from the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact I would suggest it would be great to have a system like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.<br />
Dial Number (from a browser, application, keypad)</p>
<p>Assume phone is connected via USB and BT headset in place&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Keypad appears in case you need to send DTMF tones</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>End call on PC or Phone (skype like) then it asks you if you want to save the number to your contacts in a similar timeout fashion to the latest browsers asking you if you want to save a password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature would be extremely useful as I ONLY use my Nokia N95 for business, and would upgrade to a Nokia if this feature was available from the PC Suite, but at this time I am considering android or others (which ever makes this available)&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Styles&#63; with mixed hard-coding and numbering - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n.cortes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Styles&#63; with mixed hard-coding and numbering</h2>
                    <p>I use numbered styles for Headings and AppHeads 1-9.&nbsp; However, I also inherited a series of documents that have customized versions of these Headings (using the same default style names).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each&nbsp;document is part&nbsp;of a large document series (let's say denoted "H") and individually numbered by document.&nbsp; When the Heading 1 Style is applied to plain format-stripped text, this is the result:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Introduction ==&gt; H.62.1 Introduction</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heading 2 yields:</p>
<p>Subsection ==&gt; H.62.1.1 Subsection</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is I can't figure out how to recreate this scheme in new documents.&nbsp; I can't copy the styles over (because each document has a number, so 62 becomes 63 in the next document) and I've been through every switch and toggle and setting in modify styles
 and esp. in the numbering controls and cannot find a place to set this value such as "H.62" or "H.79" within each document's Styles (or wherever else it belongs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help with this?</p>

How to setup a virtual machine using Hyper-V</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Hyper-V role is missing from Windows Features in Windows 10 Technical Preview. I followed the instructions for adding the Hyper-V feature as per the above mentioned Wiki article. I have verified that virtualization is enabled in the bios and I have verified
 that my machine supports SLAT by running the coreinfo tool. From what I understand Hyper-v should be available in the Windows 10 Technical Preview? Running build 9926.</p>

With the release of Windows 8 in 2012, Microsoft made Hyper-V available to the Windows client for the first time, eschewing its previous consumer oriented efforts for a more robust solution.

            Actually - the one thing I found is by default the swim lane margins are large and you cannot resize the item into the margins.&nbsp; I selected the swim lane - clicked on Cross-Functional Flowchart and then clicked on the Margin dropdown selection in the ribbon.&nbsp;
 I selected 0 as the margin and had great flexability with sizing my swim lane.&nbsp; Hope this helps.

            You can fake having the equation on a line by itself ("Display" rather than "In line") by creating a borderless table of two or three columns, and placing the equation in a cell by itself.<br />

<h2>            Problem using self-generated certificate</h2>
                    I'm at my wits end here, I can't afford to loose more sleep (nor hair..:-D) over this:<br />
<br />
1. I've created a certificate and installed it on the SBS2003 server, no problem<br />
2. I've exported the certificate in DER-format, and put it up on a web server with correct MIME-types (actually tried both .der and ..cer-suffixes)<br />
3. The certificate downloads and installs correctly with IE6, IE7, Firefox 2 and with IE on Windows mobile 6 - ergo the certificate seems OK<br />
<br />
4. Downloading it onto an E90 with the internal web browser: 'File corrupt!' (both .cer and .der variations)<br />
5. Sending it via bluetooth to the E90, shows up in Messaging, and generates a 'Feature not supported' message<br />
<br />
AAAAAARGHHHH!<br />
<br />
Help, please?

</p><p>You should be able to change the storage location of the apps after receiving the notification advising you to install an app to the internal storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case you did not receive the option to change the <strong>Save locations</strong> for the apps, you can do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Storage</strong>.</li><li>Change the <strong>Save locations</strong> setting under the <strong>New apps will be save to</strong> drop down menu to the internal memory.</li><li>After making the changes, install the Skype app again.</li></ol>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The browser needs certain amount of video buffered into memory before it can play. If it doesn't have enough network bandwidth to buffer as much as it needs to, the browser will keep trying but never succeed at playing the video. Issues that could
 keep you from having enough bandwidth for buffering include:&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; <br />
a. A slow network connection (such as a dial-up modem). </span></p>
<p><span><br />
b. Too many services or applications using your local network (e.g., watching video while downloading files and surfing the Internet).
</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
c. Too many people using the local network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Check the internet speed with your Internet service Provider and then perform the steps mentioned below</span></p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below and check if it helps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<b>Method 1:</b> First you have to uninstall any toolbar present on the browser and also I would suggest you to disable any security program on your computer and check if it resolves the issue.<br />
<br />
After checking for the issue you need to re-enable the security program on your computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<b>I recommend you to update the Network adapter drivers and see if it makes any difference. You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.&nbsp;</b><br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager. If you are prompted for an administrator&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
b. In Device Manager, locate the device, and then double-click the device name.<br />
c.&nbsp; Click the Driver tab, and then click Update Driver and follow the instructions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<b>Now try to follow the below provided link to Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly and check for the issue.</b><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></span></a>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<b>Update drivers: recommended links</b><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows<span>.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links</span></span></span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<b><br />
<br />
</b></span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: If updating drivers does not fix the issue, I’d suggest you to run the built-in troubleshooter that can automatically find and fix some common connection problems.</span></b><span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Open the Internet Connections troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Network and Internet, click Connect to the Internet.<br />
No matter how fast your Internet connection is, there are times when things will slow down to a crawl. The article mentioned below will help you sort out what kinds of things can go wrong, learn what you can do about them, and discover how to get the most from
 your Internet connection.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Why is my Internet connection so slow?<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-is-my-Internet-connection-so-slow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-is-my-Internet-connection-so-slow</span></span></a><br />
<b>&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Perform these below provided steps to reset IE Settings to default.</span></b><span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. Click Start, please type “inetcpl.cpl” (without quotation marks) in the Start Search bar&nbsp;
<br />
and press Enter to open the Internet options window.<br />
b. Switch to the Advanced tab.<br />
c. Click the "Reset Internet Explorer Settings" button.<br />
d. Click Reset to confirm the operation.<br />
e. Click Close when the resetting process has finished.<br />
f. Uncheck the "Enable third-party browser extensions" option in the Settings box.<br />
g. Click Apply, click OK.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you find any difficulty in performing the above provided steps then you may follow the link below to run the fixit tool on your computer.<br />

            <p>Daniel - WOW, let me start by saying the link to the article you've written is awesome. I dont think I have ever seen such a well written and documented with individual screen shots support piece! If you wrote for MS_Support there would be a lot more happy
 people out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I have worked through it twice and am still experiencing an inability to connect. I am going to continue as well as begin an entirely new database (web app) and again work through from start to finish and see if I have any different results,
 I just wanted to update thread as this may take me some time to accomplish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where the process bombed on me this time is when using the FILE DSN I created in the example. I have reviewed it compared to your example and cannot determine any difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are any other ideas from anyone please contribute; otherwise I will post back my success or failure hopefully within 24 hours...&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Just an update. On friday after failing several more times to connect from local access database to access web app tables I decided to call microsoft (fully aware of the time consuming curve of their tech support services. I actually still did not know you
 could even call them without a $259 incident ding)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several calls and screen shares in with a technician who has collected all samples of my error messages and login info etc I just received call from tech support who also shared my screen and had me recreate situation (and error) and then proceeded to tell
 me it was not possible and not a supported feature of the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I politely disagreed and pulled up the backstage tab of access where it shows the "read-write connections" tab and asked if that was not what we were trying to accomplish. He has said he will check with supervisors and attempt creation of a work around in
 the lab and call me back...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will update this saga, however in the meantime, could anyone just re-affirm what I am trying to do here is possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>a&gt; I wish to create an access web app that would let users via a web browser add-edit and view records. (done)</p>
<p>
</p><p>b&gt; I would like to provide a traditional access 2013 front end on a client computer (locally on hard drive) that connects to the data in the web app. (done in a read only format using the create reporting tool above "connections" button in backstage)</p>
<p>
</p><p>c&gt; I would like to allow users on a client/local access database also add and/or edit these records that reside in the web apps tables. ( ???)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. I really hope this is not a dead end...</p>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The scenario you are trying to achieve is completely supported. The customer support technician conveyed inaccurate information when they said this was not&nbsp;a supported feature of the program. I can assure you that information is not correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daniel's blog post is very detailed in the steps necessary to complete this task. At the SharePoint Conference last month I even walked a customer through setting this connection up using Daniel's steps as a guide for the customer. It worked perfectly. I'm
 not sure what the issue might be in your case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our support team also has a blog post on this subject here. Perhaps it can help you get this working.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can you try working through those steps to see if that helps?</p>

            <p>&gt;Jeff: thanks for your contribution. Those steps are exactly what I am doing but with no success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The support issue is still open with MSFT_CS; they have done numerous screen shares to witness error message and after about 2 or 3 in each group pass it to another group. Started in Office2013, then Access2013, then SQL Azure, now passed to Office365 group
 and awaiting their reply. I have created several instances from new web-app creation all the way through the process of DSN, copying and pasting connection info into web-document within screen share to double check exact procedure...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The closest explanation offered is that the Office365/WebApp service is not "opening" itself up to outside requests and is blocking the external IP of originating request. Not a setting I can access/modify but within the backend web-app/sharepoint publishing
 process. (this apparently occurs even from their own tests to my account/site, not just the 3 different WAN IP's I was able to test).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your advice, it is spot-on with the procedure I have been following, &nbsp;(and yes, Daniels post is excellent in detail) I have tried additional things like qualifying login with @server name, attempting to manually code File DSN from scratch, creating
 local read-only database first then attempting to create external DSN from within that database etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have encountered or heard at the Sharepoint conference of anything similar to the current hunch customer support has offered please let me/us know. (I have seen this issue on many forums; none of which have a solution to the blocked IP address message.
 It seems to work perfectly for some and not for others :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>ThxAgain,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve</p>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you open the firewall to allow connections from any location in the Manage Connections area? This is a crucial step in order to light up this scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Daniel's blog post, it is in screenshot #14. Count your way down the screenshots until you get to #14 and you'll see that From Any Location must be clicked in that dialog. When selected, that option will appear like a toggle switch turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm that option is turned on?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I reached out to our primary support contacts for our team about your issue. It is my understanding that they have now been in touch with you and walked you through the steps you needed to take in order to complete your scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm now that you have successfully been able to establish the connection from the Access desktop application to the tables in your Access web app?</p>

            <p>Problem Solved – Thank You Everyone, Especially Microsoft!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; Daniel’s link is so well written &amp; illustrated I want to re-post it here</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span><span><a href="http://www.devhut.net/2014/01/13/how-to-hybridize-your-ms-access-database-in-office-365-azure-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.devhut.net/2014/01/13/how-to-hybridize-your-ms-access-database-in-office-365-azure-database<span><span>/</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While I was not able to get the file DSN component described in the link to work Microsoft swooped in via Jeff Conrad and his referral to Kathy in MS Support which provided me with the resolution using a System DSN. The
 missing piece of the puzzle was the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">absolute necessity</span> to
<strong>paste the database name into the &lt;default&gt; database name drop down list</strong>. This solved the problem and enabled the connection to be established.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A few notes: when attempting to use the drop down arrow you receive an error message. If you then leave the &lt;default&gt; selection in the list you are able to proceed to the next screen of setting up the DSN and then receive the message I first referenced:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>[Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client 11.0][SQL Server]Cannot open server 'cmqy8zg' requested by the login. Client with IP address 'x.x.x.x' is not allowed to access
 the server. To enable access, use the SQL Azure Portal or run sp_set_firewall_rule on the master database to create a firewall rule for this IP address or address range. It may take up to five minutes for this change to take effect.</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this may also be the message you receive if you have not gone to MS-Backstage and enabled the &lt;From My Location&gt; or &lt;From Any Location&gt; options, it led me and first tier MS Support to spin our wheels trying to debug the&nbsp; IP / Firewall implications
 until Jeff and Kathy got involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another side note: when I create the System DSN from within Access/external data connection option, it does not store or display that DSN even upon successful completion. Ironically the User DSN option, while not recommended does save itself in my list of
 available DSN’s regardless of establishing a successful connection or not. MS Support had me create the DSN using the ODBC settings outside of access and then it did show up and was usable within Access/external data/link table feature. I have tried this on
 multiple machines with the same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion,</p>
<p>&gt; Jeff your book arrived from Amazon yesterday (Access 2013 Inside Out) and I am already enthralled. I have been a mid-range access developer/business consultant for the entire life of Access (yes 1.0 on floppy). I honestly thought MS had jumped-the-shark
 with the ribbon control and now my faith has been restored. Web apps (now that local-client connectivity is accomplished) bring a whole new realm of possibilities to the front lines. Thank you everyone for your help.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 6120 Classic Lock code&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I need help! I forgot my lock/security code in my phone leaving me to not reset to default settings nor lock my phone again but the other day i came across with this site that tells me the code about forcing my phone to do the hard reset. The code is to
 press the asterisk key, the number 3 and the green call key so i tried it wondering if it will reset my lock code but unfortunately it didnt work out the code is still not the default key though it did reset my phone like it was the first time i use it out
 from the box. So anybody there knows how to solve my problem without going to nearest Nokia Careline?</p>

<h2>            How to make Autocorrect options work for ALL Office apps&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I always thought, that Office's AutoCorrect options are shared&nbsp;across all Office apps. This becomes e.g. apparent in that one can not open these options' dialog&nbsp;in two Office apps (e.g. Word and Excel) simultaneously. But in Office 2013 that does not seem
 to be the case! I have quite a list of AutoCorrect options that I entered in Word but these are not working nor showing up in Excel. Why is that so and how can I make these working across all apps?</p>

            <p>1) I am able to open Autocorrect for Word and Excel at the same time.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;I am a terrible typist so MAY often comes out as AMY. I added this as a correction in Word and it appears in both Word and &nbsp;Excel's autocorrect. It is also present in PowerPoint's.</p>
<p>3) The only items in Word that are not in Excel are things like ==&gt; to become a bold arrow. I can see how much more difficult this would be to program in Excel compared to Word. Not sure why these symbol changes do not appear in PowerPoint</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So do you have any real concerns about Autocorrect? best wishes</p>

            <p>In my case&nbsp;all changes from Word also appear in PPT. The notable exception is Excel where all these goodies are obviously filtered - which I find a big nuisance!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IMHO there is no danger that smileys&nbsp;like :-), &nbsp;:-(, or arrows like --&gt;,&nbsp;==&gt;, &lt;-&gt;, &lt;=&gt; etc. can be confused with mathematical operators. And if the user overdoes it so that this interferes with formula entry, he/she&nbsp;can&nbsp;easily delete such autocorrect options
 again!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another option would be to filter them only for actual formula entry (i.e. if a field starts with a '='). In all other cases the content is text and there is no need to filter autocorrect options!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents of wisdom...</p>
