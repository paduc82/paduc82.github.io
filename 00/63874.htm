            Hi Kathleen.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can uninstall any apps you don't use.  If you need to know for sure what they are for, you can ask Google or ask back here.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  
<br />
<br />First here are tips for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />As more space becomes needed, you can offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>.  I would not move program files or speed will be affected.
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version 1803 since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

<p>Uninstalling Windows Apps or programs you may have installed yourself does not really free up much space.</p>
<p>eg- I have 38 various programs installed on my D:\ partition and the total space used is only 3.7GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are desperate for more drive space moving your personal data - video, music, photos, in particular, to another</p>
<p>HDD is likely to free up more significant space than uninstalling the pre-installed Windows Apps (and new bloatware that comes</p>
<p>with Win10 version updates), which by the way don't really get fully removed from your system. They are just made unavailable.
</p>
<p>The main benefit of 'uninstalling' Windows Apps is to de-clutter the Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main problem with trying to free up space is it becomes and endless management chore. The most viable solution in most cases</p>
<p>is to get a larger HDD/SSD with enough capacity to allow for a minimum of 10-15% free space at all times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, if you are one of those poor souls who got tricked into buying a tablet/notebook with a criminally inadequate
</p>
<p>32GB 'SSD' , you will need to use an external drive to store most of your data on as many (all ?) of these so called 32GB SSD's</p>
<p>are actually just a chip soldered into the machine, so you cannot upgrade them.</p>
<p>( Not positive, but some of the 64GB 'SSD's' may also be soldered in chips.)</p>

            Hi Lindsey,
<br />
<br />This happens regularly, your Edition was Windows 10 Home, and the person that installed Windows installed a volume Windows 10 Pro Edition
<br />
<br />The only option you have to get back genuine Windows 10 is to backup your data and clean install Windows 10 Home
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi LyndseyThomas
<br />My name is Edward M.
<br />I hope to help
<br />
<br />	Depending on how you got your copy of Windows 10, you will need to activate a 25-character product key or digital license.
<br />
<br />Without any of these, you will not be able to activate the device. The product key or digital license can not replace each other.
<br />
<br />	Digital licenses are connected to your Microsoft account, so you do not need to search for anything on your PC. You will be ready as soon as the PC connects to the Internet and you have logged in to your Microsoft account.
<br />If you do not have a product key or a digital license, you can buy a Windows 10 license after the installation is complete.
<br />
<br />	Select the Start button&gt; Settings&gt; Update and security&gt; Activation.
<br />
<br />	Next, choose Go to Store to go to the Microsoft Store, where you can buy a Windows 10 license.
<br />
<br />	You can also go to the previous version. If you are Windows Insider and you have been running versions of Windows 10 Insider, you will automatically receive newly activated compilations, as long as Windows is activated on your device before updating to the new complication.
<br /> 
<br />	To check the activation status in Windows 10, select the Start button and then Settings&gt; Update and security&gt; Activation. If Windows 10 is not activated on your device, see Get help with Windows 10 activation errors for more information.
<br /> 
<br />	If you are not yet part of the Windows Insider Program and would like to sign up for it, select the Start button and then Settings&gt; Update and Security&gt; Advanced options and finally check the Get Insider compilations box.

<div>I am installing it onto a different computer, I used to play FSX on my old Desktop computer (Vista) and worked fine. &nbsp;But I just bought a new Toshiba laptop (Windows 7) and tried to install. &nbsp;Could it be a missing file or corrupt file on the disc? &nbsp;What
 could I do to fix it?<br />

<div>Thanks once again! :)</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 1: Check the CD for scratches and smudges.</span></p>
<p><span>Clean the CD with a piece of soft cloth and try to install.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 2: Try a flat installation:</span></p>
<p><span>Copy the content of the CD on the Desktop by making a folder of any name.</span></p>
<p><span>Find the file named setup.exe to execute the installation.</span></p>

                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to repair my Surface Pro power cable, I believe it is necessary to open the adapter but this type of charger isn't easy to open. Does anyone know how to open the surface pro power adapter (I've attached a pic showing the adapter with a temporary
 repair)?</p>

<h2>            Lag on Sharp&#38;&#35;39&#59;s new HDTV lineup</h2>
                    
<p>So I've gotten a new lineup of the Sharp HDTV and I'm running into a nasty pitfall where Game Mode is still not perfect (noticeable when playing Rock Band 3 without calibrations). &nbsp;This also cost me a lot of gun-on-gun fights in Battlefield 3 recently and
 I know I've played better than this on a tube television. &nbsp;The model I just got is
<em>LC-42LE540U</em>&nbsp;and those came out at the end of March this year. &nbsp;I don't know the brand of the HDMI cable because I got it with my order from a TV shopping channel, but neither that nor the first-party HDMI cable that came with my Xbox 360 Elite (2008
 model) solved this issue. &nbsp;Has anyone encountered this?</p>

<p>Greetings, ELRICH! Thank you for bringing your question to the forums. Would you mind describing the issue you are experiencing in a bit more detail? I'm especially interested to know whether this issue occurs when using any apps, when navigating the dashboard,
 or if it occurs solely during gameplay. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Well I experienced controller inputs that are not on sync with the LED-LCD HDTV (it's a common issue for any kind of gameplay on those kinds of HDTVs). &nbsp;I found out though that setting HDMI Mode to Graphic for the Sharp Aquos 2012 series on System Options
 is a lot better in video responses over Auto/Video. &nbsp;The biggest problem I had to encounter was turning off DI Film Mode because it couldn't be selected in the advanced video options while the console was on (it's selectable on the HDTV when the console was
 off as of version 2.08 on Sharp's HDTV). &nbsp;All that's left is keeping the other advanced options on the HDTV off and setting AV to Game mode. &nbsp;I'm wondering if there was a glitch in the HDTV preventing me from turning DI Film Mode off while the console was
 on, or is it because changes cannot take effect until restarting the console...</p>

<p>Greetings, ELRICH! Very sorry to hear about your situation. Do you have anything connected between the console and your TV? If so, can you remove it and see if that makes a difference? If the problem persists I would encourage you to get in touch with the
 manufacturer. They should be able to help shed some light on this situation. Thanks! Let me know if you have any further questions. :)</p>

            &gt; <em>I get no assistance in automatic correction<br />
<br />
</em>I'm not aware that autocorrection works in anything other than US English (and badly there). Autocorrection means that if you type
<em>teh</em>, the program will change it to <em>the</em>, and similarly <em>i </em>
to <em>I</em>. Flagging spelling mistakes with a wiggly red line (<em>Check my spelling as I type</em>) should work in any language for which the dictionary files are installed (Ctrl-Shift-O,
<em>Spelling </em>tab).<br />
<br />
You'll find some notes about checking spelling in more than one language here:<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 lags when downloading at 20MB&#47;s after 2 hours of up-time</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem where Windows 10 will lag when I download anything after 2 hours of up-time.<br />
<br />
My maximum download speed is 20MB/s (megabytes not bits)<br />
And my system can move data internally up to 300MB/s without lag.<br />
<br />
before the 2 hours are up, I can download anything without any lag at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that 2 hours are up, i get crippling system lag when I download litteraly ANYTHING. (mouse, video, and audio will all lag at the same time when downloading, the system experiences Stuttering)<br />
<br />
Edit: some people I've shown this too seem to think that i was trying to download for 2 hours at a time. this is not the case. the 2-hours up time meant the time my computer had to be booted up before the issue would present itself.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a solution to this?<br />
<br />
Things I have tried:<br />
-change timer setting to "False" via bcdedit<br />
-change steam bootstrapper to automatic<br />
-ensured my network drivers were up to date<br />
-updated to .NET Framework 4.7<br />
-cleared cache in multiple applications<br />
-set a manual page file size<br />
-disabled several unnecessary services</p>
<p>-used Windows Memory Diagnostic to detect for memory faults (No errors were detected)</p>

            No, because this is a software issue that is affecting my hardware, if this was an ISP issue, I would have problems actually preforming downloads or Inttermittent connectivity issues. And if there was a timer on my bandwith then my download rate would
 either shut off or lose 99% of its download speed. This isnt an ISP issue.

            No, the idea that an ISP has a severe hardware impact on a PC is rubbish. This isnt an ISP issue. This is a software issue that is causing system stuttering/lag. Internet has NO impact on hardware preformance. This is an issue with the Operating system
 not distributing system resources properly after a few hours of up-time.

<h2>            Videos won&#39;t work on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I have a DELL Pc on I which I installed Windows 10 a few months ago, media playing was working fine (I use VLC or the Movies&amp;TV Windows app).</p>
<p>Since a few days, I can't read the majority of my video files on any of these apps. Some videos work, others don't.
</p>
<p>AVI files work, but MKV and&nbsp;Gopro videos&nbsp;don't. They used to, I didn't make any changes to the apps. It just stopped working.
</p>
<p>I updated VLC, didn't change anything, did it for Movies&amp;TV too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me on this matter?</p>
<p>Thank you!!! :)</p>

<h2>            Changing the Age limits to make my account a mature&#47;adult setting</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased my xbox and a family plan was put on it. &nbsp;I now want to change it so that I can play, download, &nbsp;or buy any content rating. &nbsp;For instance, I cannot download or buy any games that are rated M or higher off of the Xbox Market place. &nbsp;I also cannot
 set up Uplay passport for Assassins Creed III either because of age restrictions. &nbsp;I want to adjust age restrictions so that these problems are fixed. &nbsp;<span>
</span></p>
<p>How do I change my account settings to make my account an adult membership with no restrictions? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Sires are the earliest verison of the Locust who are assumed to be humans that were experimented on. I don't think they are going to be in Gears 3 since they only existed on the one base and I have not seen them in any game pics or vids.</p>

<p>Locust have been around for thousands of years as evidence of the locust ruines. &nbsp;If you read the collectibles in gears 2 it says they are a batch of humans that "became sick" but were realy experimented on. I would assume this is an experment to mix locust

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0c93eae4-e0ae-40c3-9026-3bd0313f2aeb" title="NathanBen">
<p>
</p><p>Based on the post above, since the account is temporarily restricted, you need to recover the account by filling out the needed information on the page after
<em>"fix your account". </em>Also, with that restriction, any paid services of Skype like Skype credits and subscription, cannot be used, but still you were able to access your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would advise to answer the form again, but this time, make sure to answer the form as accurately as you can to successfully remove the restriction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to this link for more information. <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa10946/my-skype-account-has-been-restricted-or-temporarily-suspended" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">My Skype account has been restricted or temporarily suspended.</a></strong></p>

</p><p>Hope this information helps. Feel free to post back if you have questions and clarifications.</p>

    <title>Window 10 Mail Contact Caching - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window 10 Mail Contact Caching</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm using Windows 10 Mail to manage my Hotmail email.&nbsp; For some contacts, when I start a new email, I may have multiple email addresses.&nbsp; In more than one instance I have a contact that actually only has 1 email address (when I go to People or manage
 from mail.live.com), but in Windows 10 Mail, it shows an old email address and I can't for the life of me figure out where it's getting that from.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not in my corporate email (Outlook) and it's not in my Hotmail contacts.&nbsp; In Outlook, you have the option to delete when it pops up, but not so in Windows Mail.&nbsp; So I suspect it's cached, but I see no information about how to clear or even see contact
 caches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any information on how to view/manage/clear those contact caches, I'd appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>danbo</p>

            Hi Lenny, thanks for the reply, but that wasn't the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;I only had one Hotmail account (where the contact lived) connected, but an old email address for that Hotmail contact was cached.&nbsp; I've since gotten a new computer and voila the problem (as I'd
 expect) is gone.&nbsp; So, I'm pretty confident it was a caching issue, but from what I could tell, the cache is not documented nor exposed anywhere.

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Probably not as the receivers are keyed to the individual mouse.<br />
<br />
Best to check with Microsoft Hardware Support.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The mouse comes with 90 tech support from day of 1st incident which would start when<br />
you contact Microsoft at the below numbers.<br />
</p>
<p>MS Hardware Support and Warranty Claims<br />
Tech Support 1-800-936-5700 for MS Hardware or 1-800-642-7676.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps. </p>

<p>Hi there Mistaken,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you're having issues with your purchases.<br />
<br />
There have been a few people that had their billing information reset with the new update.<br />
<br />
I would suggest double checking your billing information on <a href="http://commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
commerce.microsoft.com</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Please let us know how that goes and we'll work from there.&nbsp;</p>
