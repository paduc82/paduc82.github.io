<h2>            ClickOnce application setup.exe detected as Virus</h2>
                    <p>We have several applications that are deployed by our customers via ClickOnce through our webpage. The applications are developed using VB.net and C#. Recently, whenever we prepare the application by first publishing it in our hard disk before uploading
 it to our web page, the Windows Defender application detects the setup.exe file as a virus and deletes it (Trojan.Win32/Gatrid.E!cl). If we disable windows defender, publish the application locally, upload it to our web page, Window defender&nbsp;still detects
 the setup.exe file as a virus. This happens with windows 10 no windows 7. Also, running the same applications via applicationName.application (which does not install the prerequisites) will not be detected as a virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is really hurting our business and need an urgent solution. Please help us solve it!!</p>

            No. I am not connected to a domain. The issue looks more like a Windows Defender issue, so I would think this is a better place to get proper support. Like Fretts, I also started experiencing this issue this weekend, so his&nbsp;theory about an update causing
 it makes sense.

Still no official response from Microsoft and so far I've wasted 2 days trying to resolve this issue. Now

            <p>Hi MSIS</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustrating. Isn't it?. I think Microsoft needs to take this issue seriously and address it immediately. It is going to affect most users trying to run ClickOnce applications in a Windows 10 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the workaround from Fretes111 will not do for us. Our applications need to pass Windows Defender in any computer around the world without the user having to do anything. Either Microsoft fixes Windows Defender or provide a solution so when
 we deploy to ClickOnce from visual studio, the setup.exe file gets ready to pass Windows defender.</p>

            <p>Though I don't have Windows 10 myself, nor ever had any of the&nbsp;small number of issues reported, there have been some initially noted definitions update delays back around the weekend of May 21st/22nd and then some&nbsp;additional issues experienced by others
 during the week following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the thread that contained discussion of the definitions release delay over the weekend of the 21st.&nbsp; Note that my final post mentions a possible reason, but was purely speculation as I mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_updating/no-defender-updates-for-over-48-hours-is-that/f3ebd4fe-5e4f-4187-a68f-adba27f8938a">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_updating/no-defender-updates-for-over-48-hours-is-that/f3ebd4fe-5e4f-4187-a68f-adba27f8938a</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After this the following thread was one I answered to direct that individual to the other thread mentioned within, which actually contained&nbsp;additional specific comments regarding the apparent Defender operational&nbsp;issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning/windows-defender-win10-very-slow-and-inconsistent/2f1b2964-85f3-4fe1-9823-f4d9bddfb14d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning/windows-defender-win10-very-slow-and-inconsistent/2f1b2964-85f3-4fe1-9823-f4d9bddfb14d</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I directed you to these threads so you can see my description of the additional antimalware engine releases which occurred first the weekend of the 21st, and then another the following Friday the 27th.&nbsp; Though none of this seems directly related to your
 own&nbsp;issue, it is strange to see two such antimalware engine releases within such a short time, since they typically only occur once every month or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The important thing here, is for all of you to determine which exact version(s) of both the antimalware engine and definitions are causing your specific detection.&nbsp; Since if these are different for the person who has supposedly fixed the issue, then the
 question becomes whether the others are having issues with updating.&nbsp; Once you are certain of where the true issues lie, you can more effectively report these issues in a more appropriate place, where other developers and possibly some higher level Microsoft
 technical support personnel might frequent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you've already been told, these forums aren't really the best place for your query, since this is a consumer oriented forum intended to resolve malware&nbsp;issues for all supported versions of Windows for that audience.&nbsp; You need to focus your efforts first
 on determining whether the problem is already fixed and then upon where best to report the problem if it still continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We may be able to aid you here if the issue pertains to Defender updates.</p>
<p>

            I did as you suggested, and after the reboot, turned IE back on via Windows features.&nbsp; After that reboot, I tried it.&nbsp; The IE in the menu did not work.&nbsp; so I drilled down to it's location and launched it from there, which did work.&nbsp; However, when I did
 so it used an upright folder as it's taskbar icon for running programs.&nbsp; but, it did show the blue "active" line under the icon and I was able to minimize and restore it from there.&nbsp; I right clicked on the program in its folder and pinned it to the task bar,
 which showed the standard blue "e" with gold circle, but when I launched from there, again it used a separate icon (the upright folder again) instead of the "e" to indicate running windows.

            I suspect that will resolve the problem however the user is unwilling to allow me to do so at this time.&nbsp; I didn't mention it before, but this is a domain user who has recently been issued a new computer with a standard domain image on it.&nbsp; This issue
 has not occurred on any other machines based on this image.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Usually it is the reverse, e.g. you can see the blue bar and can see the thumbnails but can't see the windows via Alt- or Win-Tab because they are on another monitor (possibly a phantom which really causes confusion.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if it is related to multi-monitor support anyway.&nbsp; For example, make sure that the Display mode is Duplicate (or the appropriate mode for the monitor being viewed) using Win-P.&nbsp; Also, play with the Taskbar Properties Taskbar settings, especially the
 ones for Multiple displays and Taskbar buttons to see if doing that can change your symptom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Taskbar button that you are looking at is pinned I&nbsp;would unpin it to clarify the symptom description.&nbsp; E.g. if the button goes away then you would know that it doesn't have anything to do with your open windows.&nbsp; Then I would consider how the window
 was being launched.&nbsp; E.g. if it is being launched from a shortcut make sure that the shortcut does not (somehow) have the ability to make the window (incompletely?) "hidden" this way.</p>

    <title>Cells with UDFs not updating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul domaskis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cells with UDFs not updating</h2>
                    <p>I've googled quite a bit about this, and the solution seems to be liberal placement of Calculate, CalculateFull, and CalculateFullRebuild.</p>
<p>Here's my situation...I've got a top-level multi-worksheet workbook containg a VBA sub that puts formulas into a suite of subordinate multi-worksheet workbooks. A VBA sub in the top-level workbook opens each subordinate workbook if it isn't open, copies
 the formulas into the it, saves it, then closes it if it wasn't open to begin with.&nbsp; The formulas reference range names associated with cells in a parameters worksheet the top-level workbook.&nbsp; These work fine (after much sleuthing of how Excel handles range
 names when copying ranges between workbooks).</p>
<p>The top-level workbook has two "dashboard" worksheets that each contain a large 2D array of cells.&nbsp; Most cells contain formulas that refer to cells in the subordinate workbooks.&nbsp; A VBA sub in the top-level workbook iterates through each subordinate workbook,
 opening it if it isn't open, writing the appropriate formulas into the "dashboard" cells for associated with the opened subordinate workbook, saving the subordinate workbook, and closing it if it wasn't open to begin with.&nbsp; These cells in the dashboards work
 fine.</p>
<p>Within each dashboard are also roll-up cells that use UDFs to aggregate the data of subordinate cells in the dashboard.&nbsp; There are several levels of aggregation.&nbsp; It is these rollup cells that seem to not always updating.</p>
<p>I've placed CalculateFull and CalculateFull[Rebuild]s everywhere.&nbsp; While there are many inter-worksheet and inter-workbook cell references, there is also a definite structure to them, and there are no circular references.&nbsp; Whenever I issue a [Shift-]Ctrl-Alt-F9
 outside of VBA execution (or a CalculateFull[Rebuild] in a VBA sub), the dashboard that is the active worksheet updates fine, but some of the rollup cells in the nonactive dashboard do not.&nbsp; Instead, they show symbols that the UDF provides for cases where
 the inputs are not valid values (for the problem at hand).&nbsp; I can't troubleshoot this because when I select the cell, put the cursor in the formula field (top), and press return (presumably forcing the cell to evaluate), the correct answer appears.</p>
<p>Is there a limit to how large the cell dependence tree can be?&nbsp; Maybe I exceeded it with all these tables of inter-workbook references.</p>
<p>1. Does the methodology in building the tree ensure that all dependencies are respected, or is it a heuristic methodology in which some dependencies might slip between the cracks?</p>
<p>2. What are some best practices for avoiding the problem of cells that contain UDFs&nbsp;but don't update?&nbsp; What are some practices that are asking for trouble, and&nbsp; thus should be avoided?</p>
<p>3. Some of my web wanderings advise on using Application.Volatile.&nbsp; But there are so many cells that use UDFs that I'd rather fix the problem (or at least know why it happens, and how to avoid it).</p>
<p>I tried pruning away dependencies by eliminating the dashboard formulas that reference subordinate worksheets.&nbsp; Instead, for each dashboard cell that refers to an external cell, my VBA sub simply stuck the result of that formula into the cell's "formula"
 property.&nbsp; This compromises the tracability of the results, since users can't just press Ctrl-[ to warp to the referenced cell.&nbsp; However, it didn't change anything.&nbsp; I can only get proper updating on the active dashboard.&nbsp; This severing of external references
 shows that the problem isn't with the volume of references, since there are now very few references.</p>

            <p>You can also fix it by not using the areas of the passed range, but passing the multiple ranges explicitly:</p>
<p>Fro example, change</p>
<p>Public Function RangeID(rngArg As Range) As Variant<br />
to</p>
<p>Public Function RangeID(rngArg1 As Range, rngArg2 As Range) As Variant</p>
<p>and change your code to not step through areas.</p>
<p>If you don't always have the same number of ranges, make one or more optional, and include code to check for their argument's existence.</p>

</p>
<p>I have checked all other folders including 'deleted' done a search making sure 'all folders' are searched, but the emails are not appearing anywhere. I attempted again to create the folder in the hope that they may magically appear inside, but although the

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>No, I had no errors or any kind of messages, my computer is not the issue as the issue is confined to my outlook.com account (emails are not local, nor replicated),&nbsp; but to answer the question, no changes were made to my computer.</p>
<p>I checked the link, but it does not apply to me (as in the emails do not appear at all), and it's outlook.COM.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Outlook and word 2010 not displaying hyperlinks properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rvsw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Outlook and word 2010 not  displaying hyperlinks properly</h2>
                    Then I cut and paste a hyperlink on Microsoft Word or Microsoft Outlook mail, the hyperlink is shown in plain text and I am unable to then click on the hyperlink.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>http://amzn.to/2iN51zh is shown as</p>
<p>
</p><p>{HYPERLINK "http://amzn.to/2iN51zh"}</p>
<p>
</p><p>This four is working properly earlier I'm assuming that maybe there is some kind of an option which has changed across all the Microsoft Office products. To me, this appears to be some kind of a meta description.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I did a lot of searches but could not find anything.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can anyone please help? At least if I know the name of this notation/way of describing a hyperlink, then perhaps I can search.<br />
</p>
</div>
Thank you for any inputs.

<p>Hello</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for responding to the question. However, I think I have not communicated the problem properly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is what happens:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Step 1: cut and paste a URL from a web browser in the compose message in Microsoft Outlook 2010</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2: the link is shown in blue which is what is expected</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 3: if I save the mail in drafts and then I reopen the mail, I will see something similar to this&nbsp;</p>
<p>{HYPERLINK "http://amzn.to/2iN51zh"}</p>
Step 4: not only the hyperlinks, if I receive any email and then I respond to that, the email IDs in the body of the email are also shown as {HYPERLINK "mailto:&lt;email id"&gt;<br />
<br />
Step 5: however, if I select the above text and then paste it in a notepad, I will actually see the email ID &lt;email id&gt; and not {HYPERLINK "mailto:&lt;email id"&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
This is not limited to one particular link. It happens all the time. This started happening a few weeks ago. Before that, for several years, I I had never seen this.<br />
<br />
I hope I have been able to communicate the problem.<br />
<br />
Just pressing enter as you have suggested does not solve. There has to be some of group configuration that I have accidentally set.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any inputs.<br />
<p><br />

</p><p>Thank you for your response. I did try the online repair but when I click on uninstalling Microsoft Office professional 2010 in Windows uninstall a program, then I do not get in option of repair. I just get an option of uninstallation.Screenshot
 is attached<br />
I have attached a screenshot of the Microsoft Office professional 2010 version information. I'm assuming that this is not private information so I am attaching it.<br />
<br />
I'm also attaching a screenshot of the hyperlink problem that I see in Microsoft Outlook as well as Microsoft Word.</p>

            Thank you for removing the private information. I'm sorry I overlooked that despite looking at the image multiple times.
<div>So as I understand, you want me to uninstall and reinstall office again. That is actually a difficult task because I am disabled and was using assistive technology software which I had to spend a lot of money to hire people to make it work with Microsoft
 office. I don't know if by reinstalling Microsoft Office, I would unintentionally set the clock back and will have to redo the work with AssistiveTechnology.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm just thinking aloud here - there's Microsoft Office have a log or does it locked to the Windows event log where I can go and probably look for any events around the date when this started happening? In essence, I'm trying to find a way where we can
 debug this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What if I reinstalled office only to find the problem happening again after a period of time?</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
Is there a term for representation of hyperlinks with the word "HYPERLINK..."? If there is, maybe I can search around various online forums and see if there is any resolution? I will then post the solution on this forum so that others can benefit also.

<h2>            My alias is been changed and account is temporarely blocked.</h2>
                    <p>I've had my hotmail account for the last 17 years,<br />
<br />
And my Phone it is been taken, I'm abroad, and I will be staying for few months,<br />
<br />
After they've got my phone, my account it as been hacked few times, but I have managed to change password continuously and decided to change my alias with OUTLOOK for the time because of this continuously hacking.<br />
<br />
Some how by mistake my hold&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOTMAIL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alias is been deleted, and ever since I'm not able to bring it back use it again.<br />
<br />
I use to login with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUTLOOK&nbsp;&nbsp; but was not a good use for me because every person I know included banks etc etc have my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOTMAIL address<br />
<br />
I asked Microsoft to help me out with this issue, but with no success, with the CHAT SUPPORT they are not able to do anything,<br />
<br />
On Microsoft Support I can not even login,<br />
<br />
Open new account and tried to contact them but the answer is to wait or reset and confirm my account.<br />
<br />
Tried to reset,<br />
<br />
I've been asked all the question in the world to confirm my Emails<br />
<br />
This are the answers, I have done it 3 times in the last weeks or so, </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Your account is verified and now you just need to reset your password </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Right on! The information you submitted for *** Email address is removed for privacy *** has been verified.
</strong><br />
<br />
I have reset my password AND??<br />
<br />
And my account is still temporarily blocked. Not able to login or not even see my mails.<br />
<br />
My *** Email address is removed for privacy *** does not even exist.<br />
<br />
What shall I do???? I desperately need my emails, I'm out of this world without it.
<br />
<br />
And because my phone is been taken I can not even confirm or been contact by PHONE from anyone that tries by email.<br />
<br />
I have all details of when I login last time and now I'm panicking for the last 2 weeks.
<br />
<br />
Please help I cannot wait any longer without emails.<br />

Thank you <br />

<h2>            Transpose Half of Large Data Set</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm using XP Pro with Excel 2007.</p>
<p>I need a macro that will perform 3 tasks (or maybe 3 separate macros, as this is a very large data set).</p>
<p>1st Task: Insert 11 rows inbetween every line of data, until&nbsp;there is a&nbsp;blank cell in&nbsp;Column A.</p>
<p>2nd Task: Take data from range E1:P1, copy, paste special, transpose, starting in E2&nbsp;(that is how I would brute force it) next to the 12 rows of data we&nbsp;copied in the 1st task. (The data from E1:P1 are the 12 months of the year)</p>
<p>3rd Task: Take data from rows 2, 14, 26, etc. and copy paste special, transpose next to the months.</p>
<p>Basically this...</p>
<p>Currently:</p>
<p>Cell&nbsp;E1=Jan-09, Cell F1=Feb-09</p>
<p>Cell E2=$ for Jan-09, Cell F2=$ for Feb-09</p>
<p>After the macro is run,&nbsp;I would like it to look like this...</p>
<p>Cell E1= Month, Cell E2= Jan-09, Cell E3= Feb-09</p>
<p>Cell F1= Unit, Cell F2= $ for Jan-09, Cell F3= $ for Feb-09</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

'<br />
i = 2<br />
'<br />
Do While Cells(i, 1) &lt;&gt; ""<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.Insert Shift:=xlDown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For j = 0 To 11<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cells(i + j, 5) = Cells(1, 5 + j)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cells(i + j, 6) = Cells(i + 12, 5 + j)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next j<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For j = 0 To 3<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cells(i, 1 + j) = Cells(i + 12, 1 + j)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next j<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rows(i + 12 &amp; ":" &amp; i + 12).Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.Delete Shift:=xlUp<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i = i + 12<br />
Loop<br />
'<br />
Cells(1, 5) = "Month"<br />
Cells(1, 6) = "Unit"<br />
'<br />
Range("G1:P1").Clear<br />
'<br />
Range(Cells(2, 6), Cells(2, 6).End(xlDown)).Select<br />
Selection.NumberFormat = "General"<br />
'<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>As before, replace the X with your sheet number,&nbsp;and trial it on a copy of your file.</p>
<p>Your Country, District, HTS Number, and Type are only copied to the new Jan-09 rows, but that can be changed easily enough if you need these repeating in the 11 rows below.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

                    <p>Before I signed up for the Insider Program again on this laptop with a 4k screen, I was able to adjust the properties on an important program which fixed its scaling problem so I could read the text. Now the Troubleshoot compatibility options seem to be
 gone. &nbsp; How can I fix the scaling again to see the font.&nbsp; Note that the program still runs but I can't read it and there is no support for the program but it is essential to work for at least another year. &nbsp; I have been looking for MAGEUI.exe but I can't find
 it anywhere.</p>

<p>The app I am still using doesn't respond to ctrl mouse zooming.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has a scrolling data window with rows and row titles that stay tiny text while some of the other areas of the application have a larger size which include the details of the highlighted
 row.&nbsp; The app appears to have been developed in Code Gear Rad Studio in 2005.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Corruption of the History folder is a good possibility. It's generally recommended to keep less than (about) 30 days of history.</p>
<p>Clear the History- get a fresh start. If unsuccessful with normal clearing of the history, try Free History Eraser from<a href="http://smartprotector.com/eraser/free-history-eraser.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://smartprotector.com/eraser/free-history-eraser.htm</a> This utility
 is safe for XP- not recommended for Vista or Windows 7.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br />
Don</p>

<p>For best results, edit the image using an image editor then insert it once its sized correctly.

    <title>Macro to change the transparency of markers in a chart. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Macro to change the transparency of markers in a chart.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I'm trying to write a macro which will set the transparency of markers in a line graph (Excel 2007.) I've tried both of the following:</p>
<p>ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(LB_Series.List(i)).Format.Fill.Transparency = (TransperancyInput.Value / 100)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(LB_Series.List(i)).Points(1).Format.Fill.Transparency = (TransperancyInput.Value / 100)</p>
<p>Each time all it does is reset the markers to having their fill colour automatically assigned.</p>
<p>LB_Series and TransperancyInput are form field inputs.</p>
<p>Help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Yes that works. The problem is incompetent programming, WMP &nbsp;CANNOT burn 32bit wave files, 16 bit files work.

            Cool, glad you at least got it to burn.&nbsp; Yes, WMP has had some issues; if you work with .wav files a lot, you might want to check out a player like foobar2000 or if you need editing capabilities, something like Audacity.&nbsp; They both handle higher bitrates
 pretty well.&nbsp; Cheers.

<h2>            Recovering a saved document from a broken laptop&#63;</h2>
                    As the title mentioned, is there any chance of getting my document back from my broken laptop? I spent a week doing my report and unfortunately my laptop wont even load windows so which means that my documents I saved in this laptop before are gone. I
 havent even saved a copy of it or upload it for back up. Also, i have another week from now to finish it before the deadline. Please help, your reply is highly appreciated!&nbsp;

            Thank you very much for the reply, and I've solved it already. Basically my laptop has that black screen with cursor on so I found the solution to it. And finally recovered my document 😊 Sorry for the inconvenience&nbsp;

<h2>            I think my hotmail was hacked and I need to know if there was a message sent after 6th spt from another IP</h2>
                    I need to find out if a message was sent from my hotmail on or after 6th sept. My account was hacked and I was hoping that the IP that the message originated from would be logged. Naturally, there was no 'sent' record.
