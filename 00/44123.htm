<h2>            Achievements&#58; Why I Love &#38;amp&#59; Hate Them</h2>
                    
<p>So I love achievements in games and I think they add a real incentive to replay games that you have beat, however I absolutely hate two things about them. Please keep in mind that this is my new account so don't judge me because I don't have many right now.
 It is my hope that by bringing this up, someone will actually read it that can make a difference in future games. These two points may have been brought up many times before, I don't know as I don't frequent xbox.com forums very often. I'm also aware this
 is going to sound stupid to some people, but it is a big deal to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1) I hate when games include online achievements: </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay so I don't play online (not because I don't want to, I just can't), and you might be asking yourself then why does it matter if a game includes online achievements. The reason it matters to me is because I like to try and complete every game I buy,
 and I can't do that when I game includes them. I also like to show them off to friends and that personal feeling of accomplishment you get by getting them all. It also makes me mad when I primarily single player franchise adds online play and now I can't get
 the achievements to complete it with the rest of the games I have completed in that franchise (I'm looking at you Assassins Creed Brotherhood).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no reason that developers cant add in-game online achievements or in-game online rewards for players who want that sort of thing. However I seen another thread posted about "boosting" and that comes from a direct result of online achievements and
 in-game online rewards. So by getting rid of online achievements you would help put a stop to boosting and allow the community to actually play the game the way it was intended. I know in the few times I did get to play on XBL, getting into online games were
 people where just playing to boost was incredibly annoying and made me not even want to play. In my opinion I don't think it right to include achievements that are basically unattainable to some people, whats the point of even calling it an achievement? Not
 to mention the online achievements that you cant get because the online portion of the game has died off, which I'm sure most gamers have dealt with in at-least one game since gaming started including online achievements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If developers are unwilling to not add online achievements, surely something like an enable/disable online achievements option could be added to games, that way it won't effect the 100% completion for gamers that don't or can't game online, but still like
 the achievement system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2) I hate when DLC achievements are included in a patch:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong this a solid business move, by including them in patch developers are making sure all those people out there who get all the achievements in a game buy the new DLC. But does that make it right? Some DLC is just not worth getting, and it
 frustrates me to no end when I download a patch that only adds new achievements for DLC. There is no possible reason that I can think of, where the new achievements couldn't be added in with DLC when you buy and download it. This just makes developers look
 bad, but the good thing is as far as I'm aware not every developer does this. </p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if your someone who likes getting all the achievements for games, what are your thoughts? If you think this is stupid, well your entitled to your opinion. Just something I wanted to kind of rant about because it makes me a little bit made. Sorry if this
 has been brought up countless time before.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-1.gif" /></p>

<p>I think the trap you and others fall into nowadays, is holding onto the preconceived idea that acheivements maketh the game. &nbsp;It says more about the modern gaming industry than anything i could possibly write, that people are more interested in discussing
 acheivements than the actual game play itself. &nbsp;It's no more evident when a quality game hits the store shelves and like i just said, all people are interested in are discussing the achievements, not the story or game play. &nbsp;Ask some of these guys/gals the
 story behind the game they've just 100%'d and some of them can't tell you. &nbsp;I've even had a few messages from people on my friends list asking why i still play games i've 100%'d. &nbsp;I mean wtf, I play games because i want to play them, because i enjoy them,
 not because i'm going after achievements or trophies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My advice, play the game, any game, for what it is and think of the achievement system as an added incentive for trying things you wouldn't have otherwise done. &nbsp;That's the reason i never look at achievements until I've exhausted the game through natural
 game progression. &nbsp;It's no different to how i used to see how fast i could fly through certain levels on Mario 3 (NES) once i had completed the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, you're the only person that cares what acheivements you have or don't have and come the next gen, they'll probably be reset or replaced with something else, so enjoy the game, not the acheivements.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I don't play a game just for achievements, and I will continue to play games long after I get all the achievements, however is is wrong to actually want to take full advantage of something being offered? Should I be penalized because
 I can't game online or because I don't want to purchase a certain DLC? Is is wrong to want all of it: the achievements, the story and the game play? Achievements will never replace that for me, but I can't help by being disappointed that I don't get to take
 full advantage of the achievement system because some developer thinks offline gamers are not important.</p>

<p>I like trying to earn achievments after ive beaten a game. Its fun to go back, and play the game on hard, Which classes so your getting the weapons achievments...etc...etc.. It def helps with the replay value of the game and i fell like im getting my moneys
 worth when i get all 1000. It is kind of an addiction though. </p>

<p>Sorry I should have specified, no I don't have a physical disability that prevents me from playing online or anything like that... I have an internet service that is too slow for online play because I live in the middle of nowhere. That and for some reason
 I have a NAT that I can't change to open, even with my router being set to open, because for some reason it comes directly from the modem (or ISP) as Strict. &nbsp;I have a gold account because I got a free trial as I just made this account.

<h2>            Windows 10  turned into grey colors</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 10 professional installed for almost 4 months now. I have not activated it yet.</p>
<p>Today while using it and all of the sudden, the screen turned into grey scale colors everywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, I thought it's a hardware or driver's issue. </p>
<p>But when I lock the screen or restart, the login page is in colors as usual.</p>
<p>The busy cursor (arrow with rotating circle) is in color.</p>
<p>So, I it's neither hardware nor driver's issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<h2>            Windows 7-Windows Anytime Upgrade</h2>
                    Hi I have OEM Windows 7 Pro and it does not have Windows Anytime Upgrade... I tried the Group Policy Method and it still does not appear in the search results. I clicked the windows help and support about anytime upgrade and it says to click here to open
 anytime upgrade, It didn't want to open because the computer did not have anytime upgrade installed. Please Help and I really want to upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate

<p>When I tried to sign in to Skype on my Xbox One, it shows this error message:</p>
<p><em>Ask your parent to change this setting for you</em></p>
<p><em>You can't Xbox Live Gold is required to use Skype for Xbox One because of how your account is set up.</em></p>
<p><em>Your parent can change this for you in your privacy settings.</em></p>
<p>(This is exactly how the error message appeared, with the weird grammar)</p>
<p>I have Xbox Live Gold and not using a child's account (is that a thing?), and I can sign in to Skype just fine on my PC and phone.</p>

    <title>recent files and folders, quick access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamwin10  say:</h3>
<h2>            recent files and folders, quick access</h2>
                    <p>hello all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>just wondering if this is a setting that i have missed.&nbsp;<br />
but i really like the recent files and folders feature, I.E; recent files opened are displayed when right clicking Adobe PDF, Word, Excel, ect ect on task-bar and also recent folders shown by right clicking file explorer also on task-bar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have enabled this setting in "windows explorer - folder options - recently used files in quick access and recently used folders" are both checked. have also tried scanning the integrity of system files using CMD all normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>but whenever the system restarts or shutdowns i loose all this resent data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a setting to keep the recent flies from that display in the task-bar disappearing after system restart or shutdown?</p>
<p>or does anyone know a registry tweak to achieve this?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>first time posting any help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;<br />
Will :)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            This option is the actual default in File Explorer. I'd advise reversing the changes you made in Windows Folder &gt; Folder  Options to see it revert to default settings.

<br />
<br />Run the following scans then retry File Explorer

<p>knowing that Microsoft provides no option for this is a little surprising as it saves so much time and sub clicking to get to my folder or file that i regularly use only for a short period (hence the recent's name), there are some folders and files that
 i dont want to pin onto the quick access pane, for example files that i am working on for only a short period of time. quick access i see as more of a permanent pin to something that i need for a longer amount of time eg 2 years and not 1 or 2 weeks like the
 recent's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>SOLUTION: for anyone reading in future or who is interested, after looking on google for almost 2-weeks, this was the only help i could find, provided by "<a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/author/joekeeley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Joe Keeley">Joe
 Keeley</a>" from www.makeuseof.com</p>
<p>navigate to in the registry. "<span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\explorer"</span></p>
<p><span>ensure the key "ClearRecentDocsOnExit" has a value of "0" (off)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>sorry if this has turned more into feedback.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Server not showing up in Network and sharing center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glenndee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Server not showing up in Network  and sharing center</h2>
                    OK...I am just about at my wits end. I have installed a couple of the Hp Mediasmart Servers in the last few years with little trouble.But I am stumped now. I am running windows 7 on the client computer. The server is connect via a Dlink router wired connection.
 I am able to access the server ( windows server 2003 ) via WHS connect software, and via remote desktop. The router has given an address and server is seen in the DHCP table. I am able to see the server folders from my apple tv. The problem is the server does
 not appear in the Network and&nbsp; sharing center. ( I.e...No access to shared folders ). I also noticed that the backup of the client fails and I assume this is because the server is not being recognized . Keep in mind I can remote in from the client computer
 and see the folders through Apple tv. I have uninstalled/reinstalled the WHS connect software. Made sure the antvirus is uninstalled completely , I believe it has something to do with this particular installation of windows 7, since installing this server
 on another network seems to work just fine. Any one have any suggestion of a setting I might check ?

            None of the help on here sorted out the problem.&nbsp; In the end I reinstalled Windows and the camera is now working.&nbsp; I am now in the process of adding apps to see if I can find what caused he problem in the first place.&nbsp; This passed 5 days has been a nightmare.

<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which method did you follow to create the recovery disc?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the following steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Boot the system by inserting Windows 7 installation disc.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When it gets to the main setup window, click on
<b>Repair </b>from the lower left corner. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select
<b>Command Prompt</b> from the main <b>Repair menu</b>.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>At the command prompt type in
<b>recdisc</b>, then <b>ENTER</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You'll get the popup to choose which
<b>drive letter</b> to create the <b>Recovery disc</b> to.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have a clean DVD in the DVD drive and select start.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This should get your System repair disc created.</span></p>

Here are a few options:<br />
<ul>
<li>Try creating it while in Safe Mode.</li><li>Ask a friend to burn one for you on his machine.</li><li>Buy one from here: http://systemdiscs.com/</li></ul>
<br />
In either case, remember to test it immediately!<br />

<h2>            Skype notifications, less intrusive</h2>
                    Is there anyway possible to make the Skype notifications on Windows 10 less intrusive and revealing all the contents every time? If I have notifications on, I get a number on the taskbar icon which I like, but then I also get a pop up alert with the content
 of the message every time. Ideally I just want the number on the taskbar icon or something on the system tray like Outlook does so I know when I have unread messages and can read them at my own liking. If I turn off notifications I get absolutely nothing and
 won't know when people message me.&nbsp;

            Hi Karen, I understand what you mean but Skype lacks this functionality. You can only turn notifications on or off and maximum that you can is to control which events you receive alerts for

            Thank you. That's what I thought and it's unfortunate. I really hope they can add better notification controls because I have to use Skype for work on my computer and it's very counter productive to have alerts like this all day or no alerts at all.

            I have found a way. On the desktop notifications icon, I hit "Turn on quiet hours". No more pop ups, which I never liked from any app at, and I still get a number on the Skype icon now. Works great so far.

</p><p>This is the problem you can have when you install updates. Microsoft like to change things because they believe it will be better for the end user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>So there would not be a need for Adobe PDF reader at all?</p>

            <p>When I right-click on a PDF file, the Reader app doesn't show up. Nor does it show up when I select "Choose another app". After installing Win10, my default PDF application is Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wait, "PDF reader windows 10" appears to be built into MS Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Win 8.1, I was able to open a PDF file in Reader and make notes using my stylus. I can't do that in the win 10 version of reader which seems to be built into MS Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions?</p>
<p>

No version of Windows has ever included Acrobat or any other Adobe product.&nbsp; <br />

<p>Hi WHLWSL,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior is commonly attributed to a driver issue. To resolve this, change
<strong>Choose what closing the lid does</strong> setting from <strong>Do nothing</strong> to
<strong>Sleep</strong> or vice versa in the <strong>Power Options</strong> on the
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, then change it back to the original setting. If the issue persists, follow the steps on this

    <title>what is the reason of slowing down of my computer when i open heavy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            what is the reason of slowing down of my computer when i open heavy software or plying HD movie&#63;&#40;read the detail of this problem&#41;</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; im using windows xp service pack 3.&nbsp; when ever i open some heavy software on xp, plying hd movie, play game like nfs most wanted, computer starts slowing down. whenever i view the video which is bigger than 2 min on youtube on 360 or more depth, it
 slows down my computer. <br />
i have to do one trick every time, i have to put on stand by mode every time and again i have to come on screen where was working. i seat on computer for 2hr. i have to on and off my pc every time when pc slows down.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there was no such problem i was facing when i purchase pc. but this problem starts from june 2012, im facing this problem every day.<br />
when i ask to local shop (computer expert) he said me to format the xp and install it again.
<br />
&nbsp; i know the formatting every time is not the solution of the problem. because i had formatted my pc many times but this problem dosent resolved. And there is no chance of virus in pc, because i have invested my money in bitdefender total security software
 which is updated every time. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; so, my question is what is the problem to my pc? is it software or hardware problem?&nbsp; what will be a solution on it?

            Do you have the problematic Windows Desktop Search installed?<br />
<br />
Your Firefox is way out of date so you should update Firefox (Help, About Firefox).<br />
<br />
My version is <b>16.0.1</b><br />
<br />
Your msinfo32 says this for your NVIDIA card:<br />
<br />
<b>Driver Version&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.14.11.8634</b><br />
<br />
To translate that to the NVIDIA speak, you have to shift the decimal point so that it becomes:<br />
<br />
<b>186.34</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; (your is out of date)<br />
<br />
NVIDIA says your driver version should be <b>308.61</b><br />
<br />
i would visit the NVIDIA GeForce Driver page and let their online driver scanner take a look at your system and if they offer you an update, take it, install it, reboot and check your video diver version again and it should look like this:<br />
<br />
<b>Driver Version&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.14.13.0861</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (that is what mine says too)<br />
<br />
Get to the NVIDIA site here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.geforce.com/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.geforce.com/drivers</a><br />
<br />
Reboot and double check the versions and see how things look.<br />

    <title>Will my computer be affected by a complete factory reset&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Will my computer be affected by a complete factory reset&#63;</h2>
                    I have been experiencing many Blue Screen errors lately and I am wondering whether a complete factory reset of the computer will fix it, or if it will make it easier to see what is causing it. My question is as follows. Will my computer's performance be
 affected by the factory reset at all? For example, will my FPS in video games drop? Will the speed of my web browsing slow down?

            <p><span>Compute performance will affect if you perform factory reset. When you perform complete factory reset computer will restore to its original system state by erasing all of the information stored on the device in an attempt to restore the device’s software
 to its original manufacturer settings. There are some good reasons to reset your PC to its factory settings, including poor performance, an inability to start your operating system or virus infection.

    <title>Windows Explorer Appearance - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> walter seaton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer Appearance</h2>
                    <p>I prefer the Windows Explorer "family tree" always to open in "Detail" form. When ever I am searching for a file the folder opens up in Icon form, even if I had previously gone to View&gt;Detail for the folder. In previous versions (Windows 7 and back) it was
 possible to bring up a menu which would set up all folders in the format currently used - e.g. if I opened up a specific folder, set it to "Detail" and then used the menu, every folder within Windows Explorer would in future open up in "Detail". I can not
 find that menu in Windows 10. Can you please tell me where it is or, if it does no longer exist, how else I can achieve my objective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I have created .img file as recovery from that partition but .img file has corrupt header. so no program opens it or fix it.. Its size is very large about 150 GB.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried this option already and with the help of this I have recovered Partition-II (C Drive, 75 GB).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got recovery.img (or I could get D or any other Drive as output as in following command ) as output file and then mounted that got my required files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But problem with the last partition is that it cannot be mounted. (Header of this file is corrupt, different programs say. Here I would like to mention that I created recovery.rar as outptut, or .zip files but these all have same error saying header is corrupted)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get D as output but that D Drive is not being opened. It shows the error "<strong>CHKDSK aborted</strong>" as mentioned earlier in my post...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>furthermore i would like to add this I had mentioned Rip Linux. I ran that again and that method produced D as output (in this case D is encrypted , in earlier cases it was not encrypted) So it decrypted &nbsp;and as result I got E as output but that E drive
 shows the same error (<strong>CHKDSK aborted</strong>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will wait for your response....</p>

<h2>            Age of Empires II&#58; The Age of Kings will not work on Windows 7, claims I am not compatible with DirectDraw.</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>
<p>I've played AoE II forever, but for the last six months have not been able to play it on my Toshiba laptop that runs Windows 7.&nbsp; Any other required information I can give you if you ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My system does meet the minimum requirements</p>
<p>Compatibility mode does not work for any earlier version of Windows selected.</p>
<p>I've updated DirectX in every way possible.</p>
<p>I've downloaded the aoe2 patch.</p>
<p>The game still doesnt work.</p>
<p>Now, I know very little about video cards, but I know my dad has the same laptop and the game runs just fine on his.</p>
<p>I've tried opening it with 256 colors and 800x600 resolution</p>
<p>I've tried disabling my graphics card and got the same message.</p>
<p>DirectX says DirectDraw is enabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that one time (I don't know how or why) I got the game to start up.&nbsp; about six months ago and i did nothing different from normal.&nbsp; It hasnt started again since. But this means i know it is capable of working on this machine.</p>
<p>Also, I never got this error until recently; before it would just go to a black screen until I ctl+alt+deleted my way out of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm begging you Microsoft people to figure this out for me, to find a way to get rid of this error message...</p>

    <title>No audio on For Honor - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No audio on For Honor</h2>
                    I currently am experiencing an error where I do not have audio while playing For Honor. I have tried reinstalling, turning off the xbox, hard reset, and still nothing will work to bring back audio for the game. Any suggestions would be helpful.&nbsp;
