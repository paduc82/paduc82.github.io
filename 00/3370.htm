<p>I also am having the same issue, but my Lenovo Webcam isn't getting access to Skype. Tried all kinds of tips like enabling the camera in Privacy, etc, and still no luck. I have also made sure I am running the latest updates for Skype, and latest drivers
 for my webcam via Device Manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this just a thing with Lenovo laptops? Or is it something I missed somewhere along the way?</p>

    <title>Is MS Outlook.com Dead, replaced by Google&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter69&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is MS Outlook.com Dead, replaced by Google&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been using an Android phone for sometime. It does appear to work on a basic level with outlook.com although I want outlook.com to be more like Outlook (2010 etc). My problem is sharing the calendar with other Android users and gmail members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have looked at gmail and its cloud based services which appear much more advanced then MS efforts. Categories and types of share are all accommodated where as MS its all a bit thin. Now there is no messenger, Outlook.com is stagnant and skydrive lacks
 versioning and other protection is it worth staying with MS?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no point in having cloud based services if they are not truly designed for mobile devices. Having a gmail account and dropbox offers so much more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IS IT TIME TO LEAVE?</p>

            <p>OK. I'll bullet my issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MAIL</p>
<ol>
<li>I appear not to be able to share my calendar with someone using a gmail account</li><li>I can not carry Outlook 2010 categories across to Outlook.com making it harder to see whats important etc on my device.</li><li>I can't see how to change detail on what I am sharing i.e. just busy status, appointment with detail, appointment with editing rights or co-hosted appointment.</li><li>I can't see how to make some appointments private so they are either not shared or just shared as busy etc.</li><li>I am using a Samsung Galaxy S3 (Android), do I need the outlook app as well as the SCalender to sync and share?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skydrive</p>
<ol>
<li>If I or, more likely, software deletes a file how can I get it back?</li><li>If software changes a file how do I get the original back?</li><li>How can I sync various folder with Skydrive?</li><li>Can the Skydrive app keep some, but not all files local (on mobile device)? i.e. view them without network coverage.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Messenger replacement</p>
<ol>
<li>How do I now work with other people remotely now you have dropped messenger (which was excellent)?</li><li>How do I take control of another PC now you have dropped messenger?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;Skype is good but it doesn't appear to be a replacement for messenger</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are all things that are easily carried out with a gmail account<br />
<br />
I hope you can help as I do not fancy transferring all my online storage and email accounts to gmail. I do not practically trust Google with my privacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Word mail merge record problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dickcrownover  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word mail merge record problem</h2>
                    <p>I use word 2013 to read to an access database. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The access database has, say, 600 records in it. The most recent record is number 600.</p>
<p>After merging a word document to record 600 - the very last record in the database- the word "Mailings -&gt; Preview Results" record counter box defaults back to record number 1 instead of remaining at record number 600.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same issue occurs if the word document is on the last record of the database - in this example record 600 - when the word document is saved and closed. That is when the same document is reloaded - the word "Mailings -&gt; Preview Results" record counter
 box is back at number 1 and not at the very last record where the document was saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither of these problems occur if the record merged is some record other than the very last record merged, or if some record other then the very last record is saved and the program put away then recalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need the word "Mailings -&gt; Preview Results" record counter box to default to the very last record saved in access rather than defaulting to the number 1 record saved in access, because the current behavior of the program is causing many mistakes in my
 business. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can tell me how to correct this behavior I would sincerely appreciate it. Thank You.</p>
<p>

            <p>It sounds to me like you are probably using mail merge for a purpose other than that for which it is really intended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you have an auto-open macro in the document that contains the following command, when the document is opened, the last record in the data source will be the active record:</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t Change Paragraph Spacing on Desktop Outlook 2016 for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oliviatan1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Change Paragraph Spacing on Desktop Outlook 2016 for Mac &#40;16.20&#41;</h2>
                    No matter what I do, the emails that I send out have a 2 line (or something of that sort) paragraph spacing. When editing text, I can only change the line spacing to 0 pt, but there is no option to format the paragraph spacing. The only that has worked
 thus far is using Shift+Enter to avoid the paragraph spacing. Are there any other ways I can fix this issue, it is really annoying to have to do this to all my emails.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post in forum. Based on my test. For spacing in paragraph / to avoid paragraph spacing following screenshot option is available in outlook mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the data in the new mail message and then right click and select paragraph option. You should get an option for paragraph.</p>

    <title>Wake Up Phone on Notifications - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wake Up Phone on Notifications</h2>
                    <p>Hi, all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows Phone 8, if a notification happened when the phone was locked, the screen would switch on and one could see the details (with it then fading out again after a period of time that could be changed from the Lock Screen settings)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 10 Mobile this doesn't appear to be the case.&nbsp; The sound plays fine, but the screen remains blank - the screen needs to be switched on (via the power button or double tapping the screen (and even that doesn't work if the device is charging)) to
 see the details (by which time the toast bar has often vanished!&nbsp; This is even more annoying for alarms because the sound is so quiet and it's easy to miss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing a setting somewhere that will solve my woes?</p>

            <p>Your file has become too complex regarding the cell formatting; you have managed to create more unique combinations of formatting (font, borders, fills) than Excel can handle.</p>
<p>The only way around this problem is to simplefy your workbook's formatting: use less different cell formatting. Note that any cell which as a different combination of font size, bold, italic, font color and or any of the other cell formatting options counts
 as a new unique cel format!</p>
<p>The fastest way is to try and format entire blocks in your sheets using as much of the same settings as you possibly can.</p>

    <title>Delegated access but cannot view their to do list - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glaney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delegated access but cannot view their to do list</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I have full delegated access for my Boss's outlook account but when I am working in the office I cannot view his to do list however when I am working from home just on outlook so not connected to the server I can see his to do list mixed in
 with mine.&nbsp; I used to be able to view them from the office when I had it as an additional account but due to some issues with the outbox the techies put it back to delegated access which resulted in his to do list no longer being visible.&nbsp; This is very annoying
 because I keep notes on my to do items and his so I know where we are with items even if they filed.&nbsp; &nbsp;I found the below question which describes exactly what I require but a solution was never posted even though 31 people have said they require an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>User B has full delegated access to User A's mailbox.&nbsp; User A flags emails "To Do" and creates tasks.&nbsp; The unified To Do List view User A has nicely shows all the tasks and flagged emails in one list.&nbsp; Brilliant.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>User B (who is User A's PA coincidentally) also wants to access this To Do List (or at least see a unified view of all follow up emails and tasks).</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>However the current functionality we have means User B can only see the tasks and not the follow up emails.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I know this is because Tasks and the flagging of follow up emails are very different.&nbsp; But the challenge here is can User B with her delegated permissions have the same to do list style view of User A's mailbox?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The creation of a task for every follow up email (the dragging the email to the task folder is not a viable workaround in this scenario.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said I know the above it possible because I had it when I was viewing as an additional account but I can no longer do it this way and I have it home which I am certain is a delegated access.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me the
 solution please?</p>
<p>

                    I just bought a Dell computer. The computer is pre-installed a trial version of Office 365. Now I want to buy Office 365 home personal. However, after clicking "Buy" button in Word, it brought me to a website telling "We are sorry, the page you requested
 cannot be found." This problem persists for a few days. This is very frustrating. Please tell me how I can buy Office 365 Home. Note: I'm a Hong Kong user.

            Hi Billy, I suppose you can cancel your current subscription, uninstall Office 365, then install Office 365 using your new Product Key
<br />
<br />Or wait until your current subscription runs out and then use your new product key!
<br />
<br />To cancel your current subscription:
<br />
<br />Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054</a>, or choose Billing - Subscriptions.
<br />
<br />On the Subscriptions page, choose a subscription
<br />
<br />From the More Actions menu, choose Cancel subscription

            The link tells me about how I USED to be able to convert WebPages to PDF using IE7. This capability is not visible in IE8, and I have searched multiple web sites to find out how to reinstate it. When I look in "Manage Add Ons", the Adobe PDF Converstion
 Toolbar shows up as enabled. But, there is no means to execute it. At least not that I have found.<br />

            After doing what jimmyireland said, you would have to manually enter the internet access point and mms access point into their correct places in the settings menu of the phone in order for picture messages and internet to work.

    <title>Core Parking&#47;Un-Parking Broken. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> napsterbater  say:</h3>
<h2>            Core Parking&#47;Un-Parking Broken.</h2>
                    <p>Using a default Balanced power profile, core parking and CPU Freq scaling is on and set to 5%.<br />
<br />
This works fine, All cores un-park and CPU Freq goes to max when needed, and drop back to 2 (of 8) cores and min freq when idle and varies in between depending on load.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The problem is whenever the High Performance Profile is active it, what ever cores are un-parked at that very split second stay un-parked and the rest stay parked no matter the load. only way to get everything un-parked is to switch back to Balanced and
 put a load that will un-park them all then switch to high Performance .<br />
</p>
<p><br />
BTW this is with a AMD 9590 CPU, 8 Cores split into 4 groups/modules, Min of 2 un-parked and each pair park/un-park together.</p>

</p><p>I noticed that whenever I save a chart template with Field Buttons shown on the chart, that particular template cannot be loaded. That template would cause Excel to crash as Excel attempts to load a mini preview of it in "My Templates" under "Change Chart
 Type". <em>(suspect that there is a bug in Field Buttons that corrupts the saved chart template)</em></p>
<p>So I worked around it by turning off Field Buttons before saving the chart as a template. The template works fine thereafter. After loading the saved template, there is no issue on activating Field Buttons to show on the chart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't done extensive testing yet, but it has worked for me so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn't work for you, pls kindly sound off so that we know it is not solution for all. Thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>Office 2016</p>

<h2>            How do I remove the license from the Computer&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>
<p>I have recently iupgraded my Windows Office package from 2007 to 2010.</p>
<p>Now I would like to give this software to my friend, but want to free the licences up from the disc.</p>
<p>It has three licences the Microsoft Office 2007. One licence I installed on a pc that I no longer have, one licence was installed on my pc and another on a laptop.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled Office 2007 from the systems but dont know whether this has freed the licences up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>

<p>Hi Kay_1721,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you check under <strong>File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Display</strong> and check the box for
<strong>Use subpixel positioning to smooth fonts on screen.</strong> </p>
<p>Please refer to this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-apps-appear-the-wrong-size-or-blurry-on-external-monitors-bc9f7279-4e42-4b15-a949-46ab8bcfe44f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> to see if this is your scenario.</p>
<p>Issue like this may also due to OS. If you still have this issue, please <strong>
provide us with the version of your OS</strong>. Also, what had you done before the issue occurred? Had you updated Office?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>- Is MSRT at the latest and current version (March 2016 - build 5.34.12400.0)?</p>
<p>- Have the tool ran and reported these 'preliminary' detections just once (when you updated the tool last week)? Or do detections persist if you run additional scans (either quick or full)?</p>
<p>

</p><p>If the <strong>mrt.log</strong> file shows clean (no infection found) then it's likely MSRT suspected a possible threat during the scan, displayed it as such (preliminary detection) but determined it was not an actual threat before completion. The initial

</p><p>1a. Approx Jan 2013</p>
<p>1b. Win 8</p>
<p>1c. probably October 2013</p>
<p>1d. Lenovo</p>
<p>1e. No, but GWX was on. I removed it from the kb3035583 from the installed upgrades.</p>
<p>2. Monday, Feb 1 2016. (its in the 64bit directory)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Suspicious behavior with internet connectivity. I had upgraded Virtualbox but hadn't rebooted before running a virtual machine. Suddenly lost internet connectivity and Avast GUI stopped working. Assumed malware could be involved and downloaded 30 day
 trial. The trial since ended and is the free version presently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- I should remember if something was detected so I think not</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. A <em>McAfee </em>30 day subscription with the machine. I did a system refresh sometime last year, so it has been on this machine relatively recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. <em>McAfee preinstalled.</em></p>
<p>6a. Yes to all</p>
<p>
</p><p>6b. Yes to all except KB3035583</p>
<p>
</p><p>7a. 11.0.29 (kb3139929)</p>
<p>
</p><p>7b Firefox 45 and Chrome <span>48.0.2564.116 m</span><em>. </em>Also firefox developer, thunderbird, steam, readcube</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. No<em>. </em>Double checked with installed programs. Active-X Flash is not installed<em>.</em></p>
<p><em>9. </em>CCleaner registry cleaner. Had AVG tuneup on at one point, but may have been before refresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: sorry for the thread mixup. Since I found this relatively in common in both systems, I assumed a similar cause so posted both.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have run MSRT a few times, not always to completion. Each time the 194 infected files pops up rather quickly. (for the windows 8.1 machine)</p>

 inquiries to the same email address that works for everything else but no emails have come in during first 6 months website has been up and I would really like to recover any inquiries and respond to any from within the last month. I have tried using my email

<h2>            Help with macro to change excel source file path</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>I recently ran a macro that was provided by Doug Robins that is very helpful (link below) to change the source file path for Excel links in Word.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me figure out a way to add a "Browse" button to the Update Link box that is provided when the macro is run or something to that effect? That way the user could click on the location of the new Excel file and that path could automatically
 be entered as the modified path without the user having to type anything. I think this could help reduce link errors from simple typos.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">

<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Any help you can give me on this would be greatly appreciated!</div>

<h2>            In Skype one of my contacts can&#39;t send me messages</h2>
                    Today, one of my friends told me that my chat window suddenly showed up as a grayed out box that she couldn't type in, and everything we've tried so far hasn't rectified the situation. I don't have her blocked (I actually tried blocking and unblocking
 her to see if that changed anything. It didn't.) and she's still on my contacts list, but for some reason, on her end the 'resend invitation' button is available. Though, actually clicking that and resending doesn't do anything. I don't get an invite at all,
 presumably, because she's already my contact and has been for years. We've tried signing in and out, but that doesn't fix it either. Everything looks perfectly good on my end, so I have no idea what's wrong.

</p><p>Do you happen to know what Skype version and device uses? Please have her ty the following.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Remove your account from her contact list. </li><li>Sign out from the application. </li><li>Update to the latest version of Skype available for her device. Ask her to uninstall the application first then re-install to make sure she uses the latest version.
</li><li>After successfully installing the application, ask her to send you a contact request.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know what happens after. If the issue persists, ask her to specify the Skype version she has, device she uses and the OS it runs so we can check on this further.&nbsp;</p>
