<h2>            What causes dwm.exe to crash&#63;</h2>
                    I'm wondering what are the possible causes of dwm.exe crashing?<br />
<br />
I've tried a mountain of troubleshooting including a clean install of windows and getting a new gpu but I still get dwm.exe crashing.&nbsp;

            Hi, Cass,
<br />
<br />It could be malware causing the issue.
<br />Download Windows Defender Offline and run a full scan.

<br />
<br />2. 2. In Device Manager, locate the Display adapter
<br />Right click on the driver &gt; Select Update Driver
<br />2. Go to the Computer Manufacturer's website and look for a Bios Update.
<br />Install the update.
<br />Verify if the crashes cease.

            Still crashing. I've done tons of drivers, and did a bios update. Tried a different PCI slot on my motherboard, took out motherboard battery and replaced it.<br />
<br />
Also I did a complete Wipe of my drives and reinstalled windows cleanly. Ran full scan way back at the beginning and got nothing.

            1. Do you have an Xbox Controller or USB dongle plugged into the system?
<br />Disable the driver in Device Manager to determine if the system continues to crash.
<br />
<br />2. Are you using Chrome browser when this occurs?
<br />Disable Extensions to determine if the system crashes.
<br />
<br />3. Try lowering Screen Resolution &amp; Monitor Refresh rate

<h2>            Annoying User folder keeps opening at startup</h2>
                    <div>*First time on here!*</div>
<div>I just got windows 8 this christmas, and aside from a single bluescreen error, all has been fine. However, recently file explorer has began to open on every log in with the current user's folder, and I can't get it to stop no matter which programs I disable
 at startup. I've looked through various File Explorer settings, and scanned my computer for any disruptive software that might be doing this, but so far nothing has shown up. Also, through messing with system configuration, I found that under startup selection,
 the choice always switches to "Selective startup" with all three options checked (including the one called "Load startup items" which im not sure about...?) no matter what I try to change it to (And I have tried running it as admin). Is there something i'm
 missing, or something that I can use to fix this? All help is appreciated.</div>

            <p>Because you are running Windows XP Professional, you would have to do a custom install, even if you were running corresponding languages. If you plan to use French as your main language, then you could simply do a custom install over Windows XP Professional
 using your Windows 7 [French disc). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or what you could do is download a corresponding copy of Windows 7 English that you bought a license for:</p>

<b><u>
<p>Upgrading from Windows XP?</p>
<p>Please read these instructions carefully and completely before you begin installing Windows 7: There are important steps that you need to follow to upgrade from your PC from Windows XP to Windows 7 in order to preserve your files and settings.</p>
<p>Before you begin, you'll need to back up all your data to an external storage device, and you'll need all of the installation discs for programs you want to keep. Please make sure you have an external hard drive (see details below).</p>
</u></b>
<p>More detailed instructions are available at windows.microsoft.com/upgrade-windows-xp. Here are the basic steps.</p>
<p>1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor (windows.microsoft.com/upgradeadvisor) to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you should install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.</p>
<p>2. Save your files and settings on an external hard drive using Windows Easy Transfer (windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer). If you don't have an external hard drive you won't be able to use Windows Easy Transfer. Alternatively, you can copy files
 you want to keep on a USB flash drive, CDs, or DVDs.</p>
<p>3. You'll need to manually reinstall your programs, such as Microsoft Office, after you install Windows 7. Gather the installation discs for your programs and any associated product/license keys. You might be able to download some programs from the Internet.
 For example, Windows Live Messenger can be installed from download.live.com/messenger.</p>
<p>4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC. When asked "Which type of installation do you want? click "Custom (advanced)."</p>
<p>5. After Windows 7 is installed, use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your files and settings.</p>
<p>If you're not comfortable installing Windows 7 yourself, check with a local retail store or PC services company to see if they offer upgrade services.
</p>

<p>---------------</p>
<p>How to install Windows 7 while preserving your personal files:</p>
<p><br />
Boot from the Windows 7 DVD<br />
Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers.</p>
<p>You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth&#43;wifi driver not installing, error &#39;activate bluetooth using wireless switch&#39;.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a dell inspiron 3521 laptop, which, when i bought it came with DOS. Then I installed windows 8, and later upgraded it to windows 8.1. Now everytime I try to install the driver from the dell website, it asks me to 'activate bluetooth using wireless
 switch'.</p>
<p>Any idea what I could do to resolve this issue? Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>To get a better understanding of your query, may I ask if you have tried installing Windows 8.1 Pro N to a different computer? Also, try to re-download your Windows 8.1 Pro N and try to reinstall it into your computer.

<h2>            WMP12 keeps asking for &#34;Network Password&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, here's the deal, my wmp keeps asking for my network pasword! Why is this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It pops up a windows named "enter Network Password"</p>
<p>the contents are,</p>
<p>Type your username and password.</p>
<p>Connecting to 85.246.***.***</p>
<p>Realm: dvag3170i_pt (this is my Router model)</p>
<p>Username:</p>
<p>Password:</p>
<p>*Save this password in your password list</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's very annoying!! This happens on my 2 computers, after I started using Media Sharing, for streaming media between the 2 computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>..I never asked for this user/pwd request. If I cancel, everything works fine... So it doesn't really need it! Anyways, canceling, OR NOT, is the same thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if I enter my user and password, a couple of minutes later it asks again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Sometimes it takes a little while for the website to actually catch up with the service issue.&nbsp; If you purchased something that you need to install then you will need to wait until the issue is resolved.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Installed it months ago, played it for weeks then it decides i dont own it anymore?, Same user, same account.&nbsp; Says on the network status that services techs are looking at issues of purchase and usage content since the second of February.&nbsp; If you check
 this on xbox.com/status it says its fine. So why is my xbox saying their is a reported error on xbox live if it says different on xbox.com/status?

<p>Hey there Digger thanks for keeping in touch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience this has caused but rest assured we are here to help, first things first we suggest clearing out the consoles caches since when they get full might cause this type of errors
<strong>after the server issues</strong>. </p>
<p>How to clear Game Cache on the Xbox One:<br />
Settings<br />
System<br />
Storage<br />
Clear Local Saved Games <br />
Yes and Restart <br />
To clear the Network Card Cache (alternate MAC address) <br />
Settings<br />
Network<br />
Network Settings<br />
Advanced settings<br />
Alternate MAC Address<br />
Clear and restart </p>
<p><strong>IF THE CONSOLE IS CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET</strong> no progress or purchase data will be lost, what we accomplish by doing these steps would be to resync the profile to the cloud getting rid of any corruption as a byproduct.
<br />
Give these steps a shot and let us know if we can further assist in this or any other issues or inquiries!!</p>

<p>Hello Digger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you currently have the inability to launch Dead Space, as it is giving you an error involving the repurchasing of the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is best to confirm that the purchase does appear within the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027310/microsoft-store-view-your-order-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft order history</a></strong> in order to further
 the current troubleshooting as we need to be sure there is not a purchase and account mix up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see the purchase is there, attempt to <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">remove and then add</a></strong> the account again. If the issue
 persists, attempt a&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>soft
 factory reset of the console</span></span></a><span><span>, reset and keep games and apps to help reset the operating system. Please note before doing
 this troubleshooting step, make sure to know your email and passwords for your Xbox profiles.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try these steps and let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

<h2>            My mouse is unable to drag cards when playing Microsfoft Soitaire Collection&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have recently encountered a problem that my mouse is unable to drag cards when playing Microsoft solitaire collection on my pc. I notice that Microsoft Casual Games made some small changes to the game at the end of last week and the problem seems to have
 occurred then.</p>
<p>Has anyone else encountered this and have a solution?</p>

<p>I am afraid this hasn't solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also noticed that when the ads run in Microsoft Solitaire they are flickering the whole time. The Solitaire Collection icon at the bottom of the screen also seems to permanently flicker when the App is open.</p>

            I would recommend that you restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine

    <title>High CPU Usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> airinwesley  say:</h3>
<h2>            High CPU Usage</h2>
                    Yes hello. &nbsp;I recently purchased a used Dell Latitude E6400 with an Intel Core 2 Duo which has a 2.66GHz processor speed and it is running a 64bit OS of Win 7 Enterprise on only 4GB of Ram on a 250GB HDD. &nbsp;My problem is way too high CPU Usage. &nbsp;I've tried
 many different things in order to lower the CPU Usage. &nbsp;From shutting down the Windows Media Player Services, to changing my theme to windows classic from windows areo, to even not running any applications at all. &nbsp;But my CPU Usage would still be from 50%
 to 100% in less then 1 minute!!! &nbsp;I don't know what's wrong!!! &nbsp;I even ran many different virus scans on many different virus scanners. &nbsp;First using Security Essentials, then using Housecall, then finally Avast. &nbsp;I even did a boot scan with Avast it found
 nothing. &nbsp;I just don't know what to do anymore. &nbsp;I'm considering selling the laptop on ebay. &nbsp;Maybe I can get a little more then what I paid for it. &nbsp;Anyways, my only o

            <p>Hello everyone!&nbsp; I just wanted to let everyone know I found the problem and the solution all in one day!&nbsp; It turns out that dell has a feature built into their computers that if an adapter is connected and either the BIOS can't read what type it is or there
 is something not working with the adapter, then the battery will not charge.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it will adjust performance to match the adapter's wattage.&nbsp; What this means is your computer will run a lot slower!!! MUCH SLOWER!!!&nbsp; Because it lowers the Processor's speed!&nbsp; And because it lowers the processor's speed, whenever you run any application,
 the CPU Usage goes through the roof!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that's why no matter what I did, nothing would fix the high CPU Usage problem.&nbsp; Because it was not a software or hardware problem at all!&nbsp; It was an adapter problem!&nbsp; And I only found this information out today by doing a Google search for: "Plugged
 in but not charging issues".&nbsp; Because I was trying to find out why the adapter was not charging my battery.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And by finding the answer to that, I took a look at my adapter and turns out there is a small spot where the end of the cord that plugs into the adapter hole connecters there is a piece either broken off or burned off.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the seller shipping me a new adapter and it arrived today!&nbsp; As soon as I plugged it in it started charging the battery.&nbsp; And as soon as I plugged it in and opened up IE, it ran so fast I don't think I've ever owned a laptop or PC or even an Apple computer
 that has ever run so fast before!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I was having issues watching Netflix movies but now I know it was because of the High CPU Usage.&nbsp; So I just wanted to update you all and thank you all once again for the great advice and answers.&nbsp; You have all been a great help and great friends.&nbsp; I
 really do appreciate it.&nbsp; Thank you once again!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cannot close game after crash - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot close game after crash</h2>
                    Skyrim crashed on me, and usually on Windows 7 you could bring the Task Manger up and force close it. However, the game covers the screen, giving no way to view the task manager. It opens, but is behind it. You can still access the Metro interface, but
 it isn't needed for this situation.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Even bringing up the run command and trying to force close doesn't work.</div>

            <p>Hi SonicHyuga,</p>
<p>In addition, if you go to task manager prior when running it but before any issues then click on Options, always on top.</p>
<p>This should help when trying to use task manager after an issue.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            I have an old Windows 8 disc. If I install it on my new hard drive will I get Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had the same hard disk for several years and I'm ready to upgrade it. The OS that was originally on it was Windows 8, which I installed off a DVD I bought when I first got the drive. When Windows 10 was released I received a free automatic upgrade (which
 was only being offered for a limited time). I have two questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If I try and install my Windows 8 DVD onto my new hard drive, will it still give me Windows 10, or will it only install Windows 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. How do I do a fresh install of my Windows DVD onto my new hard drive? Do I have to uninstall Windows off my old drive first??
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>- Josh.</p>

<p>If you install from the Windows 8 DVD that's all you get; 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If what you want to do is replace the hard drive and go to 10, read this.</p>
<p>If you are going to continue using the present hard drive for extra&nbsp;storage; format it.</p>
<p>One license is for one installation.</p>
