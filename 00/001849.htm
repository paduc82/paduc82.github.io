<h2>            Mouse events on corners don&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The help doc talk about mouse events such as open task view when the mouse is placed on the top-left corner or open the charms for the opposite corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't work on my computer, is there something to activate ?</p>

            That has been dropped at least for now. Keyboard shortcut for Charms is Windows key + C, but it is really unnecessary now that the Start Button has most settings with a left and a right click. Check it out.

            <p>Thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mouse events for multi-desktops was a good idea, I use it with Dexpot on windows 7 to see all the apps on all virtual desktops, it's really useful to switch between apps or to organize/move the apps only with mouse.</p>

<h2>            Word 2011 Drawing Tools - A Nightmare&#33;</h2>
                    Word 2008 drawing tools were easy to use; I could place as many elements as I liked on each diagram, and move them as I needed. &nbsp;With Word 2011, each time I add anything new to a drawing, at least some of the elements bounce around the diagram like pool
 balls. &nbsp;There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to any of the movements, and no indication of how to turn off this unbelievably counterproductive feature. &nbsp;What were they thinking of?????????
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Are there any options that can be turned on or off to restore the functionality of the Word 2008 drawing tools, or should I use Word 2008 for the rest of my life?</div>
                </div>

            I can't reproduce what you're experiencing. In fact, I see no difference between the behaviors in 2008 &amp; 2011 in this respect. Additional to what Daniel explored, the only times I see creating/moving a Shape to cause another to shift is if the Shapes are
 formatted as In Line with Text or if the text reflows as a result of the action. What you're describing suggests that something may not be as it should.<br />
<br />
What is your current update level of Office 2011? Have you restarted your Mac recently?<br />
<br />
Do you see the same behavior if you launch Word in a different User Account?<br />
<br />
What file format is the document saved in - .doc? .docx? Is it an older .doc document that contains a mixture of shapes created by the pre-2008 tools as well as some created by the newer tools?<br />
<br />
Does this shifting occur in all documents or just specific ones?<br />
<br />
Can you be more specific by "pushes...off"? - Up? Down? Left? Right? Could it be that you've got the default formatting for Shapes set to In Line with Text rather than using some form of Text Wrapping?<br />
<br />
Also, it isn't clear whether you're referring to Shapes created with the Shapes tools themselves, whether you're referring to SmartArt Diagrams, or to a combination of both. SmartArt is designed to provide a specific flow based on the respective type of diagram.
 They provide some degree of flexibility but really are not intended for freeform customization.<br />
<br />
Word &amp; PPT [as well as Excel] use the same tools. The main distinction is that in Word all objects are 'connected' to the text flow in one of two ways [<span style="font-style: italic">In Line</span> or&nbsp;
 a new drawing engine effective with Office 2008 &amp; further enhanced in 2011, though, the fundamental behaviors are the same.<br />
<br />

                    <p>Hello, I have created a work schedule for my group in the Teams&gt;Shift area. I want to repeat this schedule every week, but cannot find a way to copy and past it? Can anyone help? The only thing I have figured out how to do is to re-create this schedule every
 week, and that is not helping. I am sure there is an easy way to do it - but I cannot figure it out.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hello Sara,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I tested in Teams desktop client and Teams web site, copy and paste feature is available. Here are two ways to copy and paste shifts:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Simply right click the shift and select
<strong>Copy</strong>, then right click the day you want to paste. Here is a screenshot for your reference:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b61ca349-1024-4285-9d1f-a94c5285cd3a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b61ca349-1024-4285-9d1f-a94c5285cd3a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. You can also select multiple shifts and press
<strong>Ctrl + C</strong> to copy it and paste them via pressing <strong>Ctrl + V</strong> in the related days.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If this is not your scenario, would you mind providing some screenshots to help us understand your symptom more clearly?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Your cooperation is much appreciated.</span></p>

    <title>Text Keeps Jumping - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Text Keeps Jumping</h2>
                    <b>Hi. I have a problem when using outlook, even this is taking me age<i>s to ty</i>pe because of it. The cursor keeps randomly jumping to anywhere elsewhere in the text or even elsewhere on the pc screen (such as a search box for example) and it continues
 to write there or sometimes it just drops a section of what I've typed so things disappear, changes a setting or types a random series of letters in a random place.
<br />
It results in my emails becoming a jumbled mess which I have to un-jumble and retype (with it still doing it). Otherwise I have to type really slowly and keep a close eye on it so when it jumps I can delete what it's put and move the cursor back in place before
 it types too much out of place - but it does it every few seconds. It's a real pain!<br />
Does anyone know how I can sort this out? Is it outlook or my pc?<br />
Thanks.<br />
Kay<br />

            <p>Hi Kay,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are sorry for the delayed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand you are having issue&nbsp;when typing in Outlook. By the way, does the same issue occurs when typing to other applications like Microsoft Word, or Notepad? When you mentioned also "Outlook" are you referring to Microsoft Office Outlook or Outlook.com?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to check also when trying to type an email using other browsers. By this, we can isolate the issue if it has something to do on your browser or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span><font><font color="#000000">I would advise you also to try optimizing your browser. Sometimes the best solution is also the easiest. Clearing your browser cache and updating your browser will often does the trick. You can
 refer to this <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

            I can't either. Probably a cookie thing, but i haven't logged on before. Try to delete any live.com, hotmail.com and other microsoft-related cookies. I can't be bothered myself. Non-operation is what Microsoft is all about and is to be expected.

            I am not aware of 2 computer local install license of Office 2013 for retail sale.&nbsp; MS improved the license terms on 2013. All local install licenses I am aware of are now for 1 computer, PERIOD. When that computer dies, so does the license.<br />
<br />
Your other option is Office 365. It is a rental license, US$100 per year for a license good for up to 5 devices (PC and MAC) at the same time.<br />

If you saw hints, please provide links to those pages so we can interpret them for you.<br />

    <title>How can I make print outs of the text messages received on my Nokia - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgelysand  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I make print outs of the text messages received on my Nokia 1200 mobile phone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have a Nokia 1200 (purchased in 2008). &nbsp;It is a 2G phone.</p>
<p>Is there a way I can make a printout of the received text messages I have on this phone?</p>
<p>Between the charger button and the headset button there is another connector but it is not named in the Nokia manual. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Does some sort of cable go into this connector to transfer the text messages folder from which I can then printout?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What cable do I need and where can I purchase one?</p>
<p>I would be most appreciative if you can help solve this query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Many thanks</p>

    <title>empty text from nokia 1600 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> linesider49  say:</h3>
<h2>            empty text from nokia 1600</h2>
                    My elderly father purchased a nokia 1600 phone about a month ago. Since he bought the phone it has sent 19 empty text messages. My father never uses text messaging. We have attempted to find out if he is using the phone incorrectly but as far as we can
 tell he is doing what he has been taught to do and there is no reason for these texts to be sent. Has anyone had this problem? Does anyone know how to fix this problem? any info would be appreciated.

            Are they always sent to the first entry in his address book?<br />
<br />
One possibility is that your dad doesn't have the keylock on and the menu key gets pressed by accident.<br />
<br />
I don't know how the 1600 menu works but pressing the menu key repeatedly might take you on a path like this:<br />
<br />
menu -&gt; messages -&gt; create new message -&gt; options -&gt; send -&gt; address book's first entry -&gt; off she goes.<br />
<br />
If that's the case, just show him how to use the keylock - or better still, teach him how to text :)

            i think what he is suggesting is this:<br />
<br />
find one of the sms that has been sent and call the number for it.<br />
<br />
i am not sure why you would want to do that, the number could be anything..<br />
<br />
the other recourse would be to contact the network and ask them to stop sms being sent to that number - but if you are pay as you go they may not do this.

            There's no way 1600 could have any sort of virus and his network would not be sending empty messages for him.<br />
<br />
Rufao: my private eye instincts tell me that the empty messages were sent to someone he knows - otherwise they wouldn't have noticed they were being sent. Therefore they were sent by accident. I'll bet you a pint at Thomson's I'm right ;)

Since reset to factory defaults was done this problem seems to have disappeared, however I am still monitoring the situation. in order for an empty text to be sent using the left hand selection key it would have to be pressed 7 times, this would seem to be
 unlikley as all texts would go to one number not several numbers. This phone has a message counter which is how i know how many texts have been sent.

                    Hello! I have encountered a problem since I have installed Microsoft Document Imaging along with Office 2007. I typically use Mozilla Firefox to browse the web, and when I print from the various sites I visit I typically print using the Microsoft Document
 Imaging. When I got to view what I have saved, I get a message within MDI indicating the application has stopped working. I go and change my default printer to the MDI printer in Devices and Printers and then I can open what wouldn't open previously. But still
 there are some items that will not open. I have included the details of when I get the error in MDI below. Is there a hotfix for this? Is this in compatiblity with Windows 7? I would like to know how to resolve this issue, because more often than not this

    <title>unable to set vba referrence libraries, registry error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            unable to set vba referrence libraries, registry error</h2>
                    I am having a problem with one machine at a client site that runs an access database and several excel sheets with vba code. If I open any of the office programmes with my access database, an excel sheet or with just a blank document and go to the code
 window I am unable to access the reference libraries from the Tools menu. It just gives me a registry error. I have asked the IT people to take a look and suggested reloading Office but they just say it is fine with admin rights and have no other suggestions.
 there are at least 6 other machines on site that are fine. I suspect that it may have been a problem with loading access as this was loaded as a separate module on top of a base office suite. Any suggestions please
                </div>

<p>
</p><p>Why do you need the libraries in the first place?&nbsp; Perhaps you could look into switching your code slightly to use late binding.&nbsp; Then you wouldn't need the predefined libraries.&nbsp; It may, or may not help in this case since it does sound like an IT issue

            <p>Thanks for your help, it confirms what I thought that it is the machine build but my client's IT company are not being helpful. The message appears when I try to click on References in the Tools menu and this happens even in a blank excel document. The message
 if I remember rightly&nbsp;is&nbsp; Error accessing the system registry. I have asked them to first of all repair Office and then remove and reload but cant establish whether they have actually done this. I need the libraries as I have site HSE people doing external
 audits that run in excel sheets and they email them back to the office for checking&nbsp;and using a button in the excel sheet&nbsp; load back to the database. One of the audit people has a new tablet and it has office 2016 on it while the office have 2013 so they are
 having to reset some of the libraries back to 2013, in particular the Outlook object library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will ask IT to remove and reload.</p>

            <p>So the issue is with Excel, not Access. &nbsp;If urge you to post your question in the Excel forum. This may be a known problem that they can help you with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, whenever working with any tool over multiple versions of an application, you always develop using the oldest version of the application. &nbsp;So in your case if you have both 2013 &amp; 2016, then you should have it developed in 2013 and then distributed like
 that. &nbsp;Normally the newer version will automatically upgrade libraries, etc. &nbsp;The inverse is not true.</p>

            no the issue is in Access but it is present in Excel too and I suspect in word too if I looked. And yes I develop in 2010 and distribute that, but the problem is arising because some of the database input is from an excel sheet that is running in 2016
 and hence the need to reload the library in the excel sheet. Although you have made me think that maybe I should add the load to the access database&nbsp;and take it off the excel sheet.&nbsp;It was there because the office tend to just check that the sheet has been
 completed correctly and it is easy for them to hit a button there to load back to the database. and I do think that it is the Office load that is causing me grief so will pursue that too

<h2>            re-opening csv file causes columns to be merged</h2>
                    <p>Excel version is 2003 on Windows 7 machine. I had spent quite some time working on a csv spreadsheet and applying formulas to it. Upon re-opening it, however, it appears that the columns got merged into a single columns and other data split sporadically
 into different columns. Hoping there is a way to revert back to the original file! Here is a link to the file of discussion</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What applications that you are unable to open aside from the Oxford Mini Dictionary? By the way, is the Oxford Mini Dictionary a pre-installed application or downloaded from the Nokia Store? Are you getting this issue with the pre-installed applications
 only? How about the downloaded one? For the downloaded applications, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling it. Tap and hold the application, tap "x" button to uninstall it and the monitor your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Make sure you have downloaded the applications from the Nokia Store to ensure that it is compatible with your Asha 501.&nbsp;</p>

                    Ever since the OneNote Web Clipper was installed it opens an unwanted tab every time the Firefox browser is opened. Only success I have found in preventing this has been in getting rid of the web clipper. Has anyone else experienced this and found a solution?
 Thank you in advance.

https://www.onenote.com/clipper</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Add the OneNote Web Clipper in another browser to check if the issue occurs.<br />
<br />
Besides, could you please confirm the information below?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. The version of the Office: OneNote&gt; About OneNote.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. The version of the operating system for your Mac.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Detailed steps and related screenshots about how OneNote Web Clipper opens unwanted tab when the Firefox is opened.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

            <p>Hey there, Chad here from the OneNote team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reporting this issue to us. &nbsp;We were made aware of this last week and are working on a fix now (tracked by
<a href="https://github.com/OneNoteDev/WebClipper/issues/308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
issue #308</a>). &nbsp;I actually had a fix made but then realized that it depended on a change in Firefox that won't be available for a little while yet, so I'm looking at a different solution now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, this is happening when you have either a setting or an extension that clears your settings when you close Firefox. &nbsp;Doing this causes us to fall into some logic that thinks you have just installed the extension and we open the new tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll update this thread when we have released a fix. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

    <title>How do I go back to previous Insider Build before 17025&#63; I now - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrs buddie  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I go back to previous Insider Build before 17025&#63; I now have 2 PC&#39;s with this disasterous build on them..neither will run well enuff for me to do the rest of my shopping&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 PC's with a bad Insider build on each one of them.</p>
<p>I need one to run. How do I revert to previous build? There are no options for this. I went to settings and have done 3 resets, all to no avail. The only thing I can do is get out my original rescue disks that I created when this PC was new, and install
 Windows 7 on it and drop out of Insider Program - which I do not want to do.</p>
<p>So, how do I revert to earlier Insider Build?</p>
<p>Please help..I need to finish my Christmas Shopping - (I am disabled, ands a shut-in so I use my PC for everything)</p>
<p>Thank you./s</p>

<h2>            Xpress Music problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I own a Nokia Xpress Music 5800 and I had to do a restore. I typed the star hash 7370﻿ hash code and then my lock code. After the restart I selected my country and time. After getting to the start screen or background/desktop or what ever it's called it
 got stuck on this message: "Preparing Memory Card". Now it has been stuck in about an hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What should I do? I have the phone's memory card plugged in...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I removed the battery and restarted the phone. when it got back on it started again with the Preparing memory Card thing and this time it only took 10 seconds and it completed...</p>

<p>So the phone is working OK now or not ? Formating will erase all data from the Memory card. Go to the file Manager..select Memory card (Tap to open)--&gt; Options--&gt;Memory card options--&gt;Format.. Back-up first if you really need to do this.</p>

    <title>Deep linking of region-specific apps on marketplace sucks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james ross  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deep linking of region-specific apps on marketplace sucks</h2>
                    
<p>You can link directly to apps on the marketplace website, which&nbsp;is great. The marketplace website detects browser language and selects a region automatically, which is great. The handling of region-specific apps, however, is far from great. If you are unlucky
 (<strong>very</strong> easy when linking to UK-specific apps, since browsers have a real mixture of using en-GB, en-US and en for their language here)&nbsp;and don't get the region the app is available in, you get this abysmal error:</p>
<p>"Error loading application details</p>
<p>This application is not compatible with your device selection, or has been removed from publication."</p>
<p>Neither possibility is correct! The problem is the <strong>region</strong>. I suggest two possible ways to make this experience significantly better, in increasing order of user-friendlyness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display an error message which states that the application is not available in &lt;the region picked by the site&gt; and provide either a list of regions to switch to (that the app is in) or a "don't care, show me anyway" click-through.</li><li>Display the app but with a banner across the top clearly stating it isn't available in &lt;the region picked&gt;.</li></ul>
<p>Obviously, there are issues with the language choice, but that's not impossible to overcome - pick a region and use that language for the app. Perhaps provide a list of regions the app is in to quickly switch to another.</p>
<p>Basically, I want a link to an app to <strong>always</strong> show the application information or for it to be an easy click-through to get to it. For<strong>anyone</strong> on the entire Internet who clicks the link.</p>

            It may be better to post this in the developer's forum instead of the consumer forum. Some of the people that work on the Marketplace web interfaces can be found there. go to&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.windowsphone.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://developer.windowsphone.com</a>
 and then click on "Forums."

<h2>            Really liking it.</h2>
                    <p>Downloaded and created ISO with ease using windows disk image creator and my DVD burner. Installed on Asus vivo ultrabook with touch. I see some more &nbsp;new services of course :( and wow on the 4 partitions it creates....but she is stripped and rips and stable!
 Loaded good drivers as far as I can see so far. And at least the touchpad driver from asus &nbsp;win 8 driver selection worked.... I would think all would if I feel the need. Really just feels like a perfected 8. Love the taskbar start menu control -vs- msconfig.
 Loaded my old 03 Streets and trips perfectly......and plays my very old yet powerful 3D planets screensaver...so good to see old stuff work so easy. &nbsp;I will never get in to having a microsoft account to cover all my apps verses installing individual programs
 from vendors (i.e. Skype, etc.). &nbsp;It sure nudges you heavily in the direction. I prefer setting it up as a local account and doing everything manually but it is all there and smooth of you watch and read as you set up. Overall I will buy this on day one so
 far but I am need to do more research on all the partitions and lets see how she sits on RAM for a while.....right now at .....9 of 4GB...totally acceptable and loving it.....</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am attempting to create an Access report that shows the page footer only on the first page of the report.&nbsp; I also need to have the page numbering control that states&nbsp;="Page " &amp; [Page] &amp; " of " &amp; [Pages] on the page header.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using the logic to show the header if page = 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Me.Page = 1 Then</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; PageFooterSection.Visible = True</p>
<p>Else</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; PageFooterSection.Visible = False</p>
<p>End If</p>
<p>
</p><p>but the footer does not show up on the page.&nbsp; If I change the page numbering control to just show the [Page] and not include [Pages] it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it might be my report so I created a simple one with just a header, detail and footer (no grouping) and it still only works on [Page]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how to get around this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Hi Brent,
<br />You could add your [Page] but set its Visible property to No.       
        </p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Duane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure I follow your suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I am seeing the problem only occurs when I have the [Pages] variable causing Access to cycle through the report in the beginning to determine how many pages there are in total.</p>
        </p>

            I would try use this code in the On Format event of the Page Footer:
<br />
<br />Private Sub PageFooterSection_Format(Cancel As Integer, FormatCount As Integer)
<br />    Cancel = Me.Page = 1
<br />End Sub       
        </p>

<p><span>The Pages property forces two iterations through the report, so I suspect what is happening is that the value of the Page property is still that of the final page when the second iteration begins.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The way to do it is to cancel the footer in its Format event procedure by conditionally setting the return value of its Cancel argument as Duane describes, though, as you want it visible on the first page only, the code should be:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cancel = (Page&gt;1)</span></p>

<p>The good news is the <strong>Cancel - (Page &gt; 1)</strong> does indeed get the footer to show up on the first page and does not appear on the other pages.&nbsp; However, while it is not showing up it appears to still be rendering in the background adding to the
 length of the page and causing additional pages to be added to report.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Some background</span>: The "report" I am creating is a multi-page invoice with the first page footer being the client mailing address stub so is roughly 3 inches in length.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most invoices will have 3 pages - Page 1: Account Summary and stub; Page 2: Regulation notice; Page 3: detail items billed by location and summary historical usage for each location.&nbsp; If the client has more than one location then each location has it's own
 page (Page 3)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After adding the Cancel language the size has grown to 5 pages with the break coming first after the detail section of page 3 (charges) and then another after the group section of page three (Historical Usage).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shrunk the size of the footer to 2 inches for test purposes and the the number of pages dropped to 4 so I'm pretty sure it is putting it on the page, but not showing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas around this one?</p>

            Unlike the detail section and group footers/headers page footers do not have a CanShrink property.<br />
