<p>Hello,</p>
<p>The first step in the process would be to leave the Zune Device connected to the computer or to a USB wall charger for 4-16 hours - sometimes 24 hours. If the device has been sitting on the shelf for a LONG time then the battery could be real low. As such
 the initial chargine of the battery is "slow" (trickle). It will slowly charge the batter to between 40-60% before allowing a "full" load charge. This is normal activity for a litium-ion battery and helps ensure long life of the battery.</p>
<p>If the device still does not turn on after 24Hours then it is possible the device is DOA - at which point it would be recommended to return the device to the store you purchased it from for an exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other suggestions include - Using a different USB cable - Using a USB Wall Charger or different USB wall charger. But the initial suggestion is to let the device charge for at least 24Hours.</p>

            Please reply if you got it working, this is the same exact problem I have been having. Trying to install on my Surface Pro 3, it gets up to 78% on the installation (after running Setup.exe from extracting the ISO), sticks there for about 15 minutes, then
 restarts. Then it shows "Setting up PC..." or something like that with a percentage, and around 50% ish I think it restarts again, then says reverting to previous OS, and after rebooting backing into 8.1, it gives me exactly the error you posted. It's done
 this twice. I have no idea how to fix it. Trying to run the update through Windows Update doesn't work at all, doesn't even get to the stage where it reboots even once, just freezes up when the installation progress bar reaches full, then starts all over after
 an error that "Microsoft Update Host stopped working" or something like that. Uuuuugh I just want to install it!

            <p>I guess you're talking about Asphalt 7 Heat which is claimed as being 878Mbin the store but needs a whole lot more space to install (over I've read reports that have users needing to free over 3Gb).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what Gamespot say, it's temporary storage that's deleted after the game has installed but I know that doesn't really help you out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd highly suggest asking the question on Gamespot's forum in an effort to working out how much free space you need for installation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the update, I am sorry to hear that the issue still persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to open Internet Explorer in Compatibility View and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use Compatibility View in Internet Explorer:

            <p>Thanks for your reply. Before i took to the forums i did some research on this matter first and one of the suggestions was using compatability view. However this again did not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just find it very that my windows phone 7.5 can open this embedded MP4&nbsp;video no problem, yet my surface cannot.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know its not cause the surface wont play the file type as i have other MP4 videos saved to HDD which run no problem on my surface.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a similar problem and have now fixed it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I did was run the IE performance troubleshooter.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; press windows+W keys.</p>
<p>2. type troubleshooter in search box, enter.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;select trouble shooting. Click view all and select IE.</p>
<p>4. Click next and follows instr's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To take this one step further I also set IE to default settings after I did the above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps you, It did for me because I can now watch videos from different sites.</p>

            This issue has now been resolved. I dont think it was anything to do with the device. I think the problem was the website had not allowed the browser on the surface access to the html5 content which i could access on my windows phone 8 device.

    <title>Animation start point and direction - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Animation start point and direction</h2>
                    Is it possible to adjust where a wheel animation starts? Currently starting to wipe from 12 Noon wiping to the right around a circle shape. I'd like to have the wheel animation begin wiping at the 5 pm position on the circle. Is that possible? We've tried
 rotating the shape, but the animation still starts at the top (12 noon position).

            You can do this with a combination of animations<br />
<br />
Disappear<br />
Spin 150<br />
Wheel<br />
<br />
There's a <a href="http://www.pptalchemy.co.uk/Downloads/clock.pptx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">demo here</a> where you can look at the animation pane. Once set up you can use the animation painter to reproduce it.<br />

            <p>Thank you and this is close. What I have is a pie. There is one large wedge and one small wedge. It starts out all green, then we want the larger wedge to do what your animation does, but as it does it, the blue color turns to white leaving the smaller green
 wedge visible. Basically showing an entire market, that decreases down to the smaller wedge.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So your animation begins the wipe in the right place, but I need it to go from green to white as it spins around the pie.</p>

            The problem with this combination is that it spins the picture while revealing it. For a solid shape like the circle it is no problem but anything more detailed does not display right.

            That's why there is a "Disappear" animation. Done correctly you will not see the spin.&nbsp;

<h2>            Spell check disappeared. If I try to install by clicking on &#34;not installed&#34;, the option of UK English is not shown.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Spell check disappeared<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 8 and my spell check has disappeared overnight. After some investigation, I see that under&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File/Options/Language,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it shows:-</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>English (United Kingdom) &lt;default&gt;&nbsp; enabled&nbsp;&nbsp; not installed</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the same in all&nbsp;Office products</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to install by clicking on "not installed", the option of UK English is not shown.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to install English (US) it appears to install (i.e. It tells me that all I have to do is reload Word), but it has not, in fact installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that spell check is working in other apps., for example in writing this message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need UK English back in Office quickly&nbsp;- any help gratefully received.</p>

            <p>Hi John,&nbsp; I'm a Microsoft employee and work on the development team with Microsoft&nbsp;Office who manage the proofing experience.&nbsp; I received notification of your post just yesterday (apologies) and since then we've been trying to reproduce&nbsp;the issue you report
 without success, there seems to be 2-3 similar reports on this forum since August 2014 so we&nbsp;are concerned.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm the issue is still active ? can you confirm that you are using Office 2013 ? Are you using a retail or Office 365 install ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst we continue to figure out the root cause:</p>
<p>I'd suggest you go to: <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-ie/language-packs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://office.microsoft.com/en-ie/language-packs/</a>&nbsp; select English ... then select [Download] under the proofing tool heading... select download again ...&nbsp; then select either the 86 or 64 EXE package depending on your PC,&nbsp; download it and be sure to run
 the download EXE. It should take about 3 seconds to install. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note there is only one proofing package file for English &nbsp;, it does however support US English, UK English etc
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if this solves your issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks! Jerome</p>

    <title>How to run a Access Web database on my own LAN without internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trevmonster  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to run a Access Web database on my own LAN without internet connectivity.</h2>
                    <p>I have an access database that I use to collect data from users that are travelling in and out of Wifi range of my LAN.</p>
<p>My LAN does not have solid internet connection approx 50% over a day. The user do not have there own reliable internet connection ether.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to run Access services/sharepoint/IIS or equiv. on my PC so that users (Up to 10 of them) who use browsers to enter new records into the database can re-sync with my database when they are connected. They travel in and out of Wifi range about
 5 times per hour and enter a couple of records while they are out of range.</p>
<p>When they are in range of the LAN, the users should then get their view of the database updated with data from other users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer to use access as the development platform as hand coded HTML and PHP/ASP would take me quite a while to get the same friendly forms that you can get in an Access Web database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>

            <p>I'm not sure what you're asking could be done with an Access Web App (or with a standard web application, for that matter).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have disconnected users who must enter data while not connected, you typically would setup a "replication" scheme which would enable you to merge data from each user machine into a master database. Newer versions of the ACE database don't provide
 replication, so you'd have to switch over to something like SQL Server, which means you'd have to purchase SQL Server for your main replication machine (you could use SQL Server Express for the disconnected clients).</p>
<p>
</p><p>SQL Server has a robust replication manager, to handle conflicts and such, so it's a fairly complete solution. You cannot, however use that with a Web App (at least to my knowledge), so you'd have to &nbsp;convert to a standard Access Desktop app (which means
 a complete rewrite).</p>

            <p>Is it possible for me to host a Access Web database from my own PC. Then the users can use a browser to submit forms while they are within WiFi range. I would only need to create a simple input form as an Access Web page to implement this.
</p>
<p>Even better if there was a runtime for all operating systems, but we know that's not happening. If that were possible then I would put my whole business on Access.</p>

            <p>Access Web Apps use Sharepoint to host, so you'd have to install that on your machine. Sharepoint requires a Server OS (like Microsoft Server 2012), &nbsp;so unless you're running that you won't be able to install it. Your scenario would also require you to install
 IIS, which typically is hosted on a separate machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All in all, trying to setup, configure and maintain a secure Sharepoint/IIS installation is far beyond the capabilities of the average users, and generally requires someone with extensive experience in securing and hardening this sort of installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access provides a Runtime version, but of course it's Windows-based. Since 2007, the Access Runtime has been free. Are your users running operating systems other than Windows?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All in all, considering your concept of disconnected users, the "best" methods would be (in descending order):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. True web application wirtten in a web language like ASP.NET, PHP, Java, etc, and hosted on a secured server</p>
<p>2. .NET application connected to a hosted SQL Server database</p>
<p>3. Access application w/ SQL Server Replication</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMO, Access web apps aren't really ready for prime time, although they have become more robust in recent versions.</p>

            <p><span><span>It sounds like each user has a standard windows desktop database with tables linked to SharePoint.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can certainly setup a server that runs the required Web services, but that server will have to include SharePoint.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you “just” using a Access front end with linked tables to SharePoint, then even the most basic SharePoint server should work (in fact I think there even a free version). However,
 setting up SharePoint can be quite a bit of work.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>So you can run SharePoint on your local system, but you have to setup a Server with SharePoint.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I should also point out that if you actually using a desktop database and not the web interface, then Access web services are not required for SharePoint tables (only a server running
 SharePoint is required – the Access Web services part is not). </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So it really depends on your setup – you might not be using Access Web Services at all. You can use linked tables in an Access front end (even with the off-line sync mode), and
 this setup does not rely on Access web services. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>However, many a developers out of convenience likely just hit the publish button, but the possibility exists that you’re not using a published web application, but a classic front
 end with linked tables to SharePoint (which as noted does not rely on Access Web services nor publishing). Either way, you still have to setup SharePoint on a local server.</span></span></p>

            <p>Thank you for these responses, I am finding them very useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is interesting that SQL Server and SQL Server Express can have a replication method between them.<br />
Can an Access 2010 or later, table replicate with SQL Server?<br />
Even if it can not its OK to use Access as Front End to a local SQL Server Express.<br />
Then have these two replicated databases re sync when Wifi is connected.<br />
Is the re sync in the background or can it be initiated via VBA?<br />
Does the user have to close the Access FE while re syncing?</p>
<p>What happens if the WiFi breaks halfway through?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this re sync is possible, then it may be worth my while to use surface machines in the mobile equipment and use Access runtime instead of browsers.<br />
<br />
Then all my development is within Access. &nbsp; :)</p>
<p>and I leave re syncing up to the replicated SQL servers.<br />
<br />
If this works then it also solves the issue of re syncing the stationary Laptop database that is at the WiFi LAN, back to the main office (a third Database) via the 50% reliable internet connection.<br />

            <p><span><span>Yes, you can migrate your Access desktop application to use SQL as the database. This is a migration, and if you have experience with SQL server, it not too hard and usually very
 few changes are required to such applications. So you thus install + setup SQL server (express) on each laptop.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The re-sync is not in the background (but it can be). So you can&nbsp;execute a command to start the sync (and such commands could be executed from VBA via Shell()). And the user would
 not have to exit or leave Access while this sync occurs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>While the express editions of SQL server can be a client to replication, you need a standard edition or paid version of SQL server running some place to be the host database (and
 on-line SQL Azure can fit this bill).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the sync stops due a break, then if the agent is left running, then the sync should re-start. Or you can simply re-start the agent for a sync (it really depends on what how and
 when you want the sync to occur – and if you leave the<span>&nbsp; </span>sync agents running all the time or not).&nbsp;Additional questions can be asked in SQL forums.</span></span></p>

<p>Did you check if your service plan includes Data/Internet Access?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd suggest that you remove all the current operator settings for Internet and Web first, then ask your operator to send you fresh settings again.&nbsp; You should save these latest settings and try establishing connection afterwards and see if it makes a difference.</p>

<p>If not try restoring the phone back to factory settings, default security code is 12345.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this still does not work, then use the Nokia software updater. If your phone already has the latest firmware installed, the application will ask whether you wish to reinstall the firmware. Try yes.</p>

<h3> martenm  say:</h3>
<h2>            calendar list showing &#34;wrong&#34; dates</h2>
                    <p>I have created a custom list for leave requests in SPO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to visualise our vacations, I also&nbsp;have created a calendar view of the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users select their "First day off" and their "Last day off" in a Dates and time column. In the calendar view, the start date (=First day off) is shown correctly - but the end date is set to
<em>th</em><em>e day before</em> the "Last day off."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: user makes a request for May 1-5. In the list view, dates are shown as May 1-5, but in the calendar view, it is shows as May 1-4. If one opens the object in the calendar, the dates shown in plain text are May 1-5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Vacations where start and end date is the same are shown correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this, and what can I do about it?</p>

<p><span>Hi MartenM,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you only use the Date format, the initial issue you posted will happen. To request the whole days, you may still let users use the Date and Time format.
</span></p>
<p><span>For example, if a user request two days, he can type values as follows.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5de8bf38-d7ca-4f6c-b632-97a5bc978c58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5de8bf38-d7ca-4f6c-b632-97a5bc978c58" /></a></p>
<p><span>Then the outcome will be the following in each view.</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I feel as many other customers do that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The new format has so much junk and advertisements going on, that there is no way to smoothly utilize the scroll bar. It's like it's gone schizophrenic! NEW, isn't necessarily&nbsp;IMPROVED,
 and this is a darned good example. My friends who had used MSN as their homepage say it's whacked, and switched over to CNN. I believe I'm going to do likewise. Oh, and PS; There are way too many times lately (at least 50% of attempts)&nbsp;I try to log in to Internet
 Explorer, and cannot access anything, except for some encrypted letters and numbers on top of the page. What's up with that? If Mr. Gates wants everybody to leave Internet Explorer, and go over to Google Chrome or Firefox, he's doing a&nbsp;"fine" job. Way to go,
 Bill!</p>

<h3> d. gosin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Text attachments, &#40;.wps, .doc, etc.&#41; that I send cannot be opened by the receiver.  </h2>
                    I currently use Wide Open West as my ISP. I have always used their mail system with no problems. They recenty "enhanced" their system and I can no longer send text attachments with my email. I can however send .JPG, .MP3, etc. with no problem. They suggested
 that I try a free email site and I tried to send text attachments through my Yahoo address and text attachments will still not go through. I always get this error message when I try to open the attachment: File may be in use, the format may not be supported
 or the file may be corrupt. My ISP says it is a problem on my end though I don't recall changing any settings to the Vista Home Premium that I currently use. I have McAfee year round protection and I don't recall changing any setting there that would cause
 this problem. Is it my ISP or me?

    <title>N78 loudspeaker disabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> weaksauce---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N78 loudspeaker disabled</h2>
                    Disabled for calls that is; it still works fine for music/videos etc. But whenever I'm in a call and select the loudspeaker option all I get is a "Handset activated" message and the sound remains in the internal speaker. I'm not sure if this has been since
 the last firmware update or not because I've only tried it recently and noticed this.<br />
I read somewhere that it may be due to music player/fm transmitter but both of those are turned off. So I'm hoping the genii here can help :)

    <title>Stroke Eraser in Excel on iPad Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianwin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stroke Eraser in Excel on iPad Pro</h2>
                    I built a checklist in Excel that needs signatures. I fill-out the checklist, a crew-leader &amp; I sign it and I send it back to the office. I go to a new job-site and erase the crew-leader signature using the&nbsp;Draw tab and&nbsp;Stroke Eraser and start the process
 over. The Stroke Eraser stopped working (I can no longer erase anything.) What should I do??

            Dear Mr. Sommer,
<div>Thank you for your expedient reply. &nbsp;
<div>The error message from Safari (the image of which does not show up above) is that &nbsp;</div>
<div>SAFARI CAN'T VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF THE WEBSITE SKYPEWEBEXPERIENCE.LIVE.COM. &nbsp;THE CERTIFICATE FOR THIS WEBSITE IS INVALID.</div>
<div>This question does not pertain to your knowledge of Safari, but rather your knowledge of which websites are being linked to open when I open outlook.com, please? &nbsp;If there are other websites automatically linked, I would like to break any such automatic
 link and request information on how to do that, please?</div>
<div>Further, your company should know if somehow they are unknowingly linking people to potentially fraudulent websites which could be putting people's confidential information at risk so that they can correct the problem.</div>
<div>I greatly appreciate your assistance in this matter.</div>
<div>Thank you,</div>
<div>Angie</div>
        </p>

            <p>I am not a Microsoft employee.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Skype has replaced Messenger.</p>
<p>You can link your Skype contacts to People.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After logging in to your outlook.com account, click on your name in the top right corner.</p>
<p>Click Edit profile.</p>
<p>Skype profile and Messenger profile are listed.</p>
<p>Click Skype profile to setup logging into Skype.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
Skype is part of the Microsoft family
<p>You can sign into Skype with your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>A Microsoft account is an email and password that you use to sign into Microsoft services such as Windows, Outlook.com, Xbox Live and SkyDrive.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>SKYPEWEBEXPERIENCE.LIVE.COM takes you to a Skype Plugin installation.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You have to setup accessing Skype, Facebook, Google contacts, Twitter, Linked in, Flickr, Weibo.com .</p>
<p>Signing in to outlook.com does not sign you in anywhere else unless you set it up.</p>

<h2>            Office Files in OneDrive Files Not Opening</h2>
                    <p><strong><em>***The post was written in English by the original poster therefore it will be directed to the appropriate forum by the moderator***

<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The title pretty much explains it.</p>
<p>None of my Office files, including Word and PowerPoint, saved in OneDrive folders on my computer, would open.</p>
<p>All my <span>Office files in </span>non-OneDrive files open just fine, though.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried reinstalling OneDrive, but this doesn't seem to help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.<br />
</p>
