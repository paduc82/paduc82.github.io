                    <p>I have a couple of Asus&nbsp; Xeon servers I want to setup as a testbed for clustering disks / shares</p>
<p>

<h2>            How To Delete Temporary Internet Files And Temporary Files In Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Microsoft Edge in Windows 10 Version 1511. I am not being able to delete the Temporary Internet Files and Temporary Files using the 'Disk Clean-up' utility. I have checked all the boxes in 'Disk Clean-up' but the Temporary Internet Files and Temporary
 Files simply do not get deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though the size of Temporary Files have remained the same (9.72 MB) for some time, the size of Temporary Internet Files is increasing everyday (whenever I am browsing), and now it's close to 1 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's clear that the 'Disk Clean-up' utility&nbsp;in Windows 10 is not functioning properly and not&nbsp;being able to delete Temporary Internet Files and Temporary Files. I did not have this problem with Internet Explorer in Windows 8 and 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen in these pages that a lot many people are also having the same problem, but haven't noticed any solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would highly appreciate any kind of help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>As I said Disk Cleanup lists Temporary Internet Files only for Internet Explorer, not the one used by Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>IE&gt; Tools &gt; Options &gt; Delete. Enable the check box for "Temporary Internet Files and website files", and click Delete.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you saying that you completely cleared the Temporary Internet Files cache from Internet Explorer - Options, and still Disk Cleanup is showing up 1 GB for Temporary Internet Files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you post a screenshot?<br />

            <p>So here we go folks - I tried every trick in the book and it didn't work. Let's list what I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Internet Options -&gt; General -&gt; Delete Temporary Internet Files and Website Files. CHECK! didnt' work</p>
<p>2) go to &lt;your user dir&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files and remove the files. CHECK! didn't work</p>
<p>3) Right click on C: drive - Properties -&gt; General -&gt; Disk Cleanup -&gt; select Temporary Internet Files from the list -&gt; Delete. CHECK! didn't work, it even didn't show me the right folder size. I had more than 2 GB while this one showed me lousy 24MB</p>
<p>4) Try to right click on the folder and delete it. CHECK! it was locked by some other process, in my case the rapport software from Trusteer</p>
<p>5) Try to rename the folder and then delete the content. CHECK! it was locked so no that didn't work either.</p>
<p>6) go to&nbsp;&lt;your user dir&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5 and remove the contents of this hidden directory. CHECK! this was not the right one since there were only 400K of files there.</p>
<p>7) CCleaner install - didn't want to do it, I personally hate this software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here what did work but requires some patience:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Download the LockHunter and try to kill the processes that lock the Temporary Internet Files directory</p>
<p>2) if step one worked go to step 3 otherwise run msconfig utility or Services and try to disable the services that the LockHunter could not kill. In my case rapport is like antivirus and it is hard to kill. I disabled it on the msconfig console from starting
 up.</p>
<p>3) go to&nbsp;&lt;your user dir&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files and rename it to&nbsp;Temporary Internet Files1</p>
<p>4) You will see that magically all hidden directories are now showing up. You will see the following folders: AntiPhishing, Content.IE5, Content.MSO, Content.Word, Low, MSOfficeHelp14, Virtualized</p>
<p>5) check the size of each folder to identify the "offender" with the GB size go in, select all the files inside and delete them permanently.</p>
<p>6) Rename the&nbsp;&lt;your user dir&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files1 to Temporary Internet Files. It might not let you since the system processes locked it again, so run the LockHinter again to unlock the directory. It will take you approximately
 5 minutes to delete 2GB of files. So be patient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck, let me know how did that go.</p>

    <title>Miracast broken after Fall Creators Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jon_klimek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Miracast broken after Fall Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Spectre Elite laptop with Intel HD 520 graphics. Prior to the update I was able to cast to a Miracast device. After the update I did not cast for a month and just happened to wipe the prior OS version to save space on my SSD. The Intel Graphics
 driver is from June 2017, the WiFi is from October 2017. The Miracast shows with HDCP support and the rest of the hardware seems to function normally. With hidden devices selected in the device manager there are none marked as having problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need this laptop to function with my Screenbeam Mini2 which incidentally has been updated to the latest firmware.</p>
<p>I have heard the Miracast v2 driver might work instead of the V3 (which has a 2006 date on it). I did a search and the only places listing the V2 driver were pretty sketchy and seemed to only want to install a driver search tool AKA spyware. Is there anyway
 to troubleshoot the Miracast handshake? I haven't come up with anything. The Actiontec guys were not helpful beyond saying yep - that's not us it's Microsoft's fault. Our device is waiting to complete the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions?</p>

<p>Hi Jon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Miracast is a wireless technology that you can use to project your screen to TVs, projectors, and streaming media. Issues with Miracast likely occur due to a corrupted driver. Let's troubleshoot your issue by performing the following
 steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Run this <strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">troubleshooter for hardware and devices</a></strong><span>. The troubleshooter will try to identify and resolve issues automatically related to
 using your device.</span></li><li>Uninstall your display adapter. To do so, refer to this
<strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/using-device-manager-to-uninstall-devices-and-driver-packages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Afterwards, scan for hardware changes. Here's how: Go to
<strong>Device Manager</strong> &gt; <strong>Action </strong>&gt; <strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong>.</li><li>Update your display adapter. Check this <span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for the steps on how to update a driver.

<h2>            Blue Screen from playing Skyrim</h2>
                    <p>I've been getting a blue screen after playing Skyrim for a few minutes. It says something about a driver getting stuck in an infinite loop. I've googled the error code and think it has something to do with my gpu (amd r9 290). I updated the driver and took
 the card out to get some of the dust off and reseat it. Neither of those things helped. I don't think the crash is from overheating because it's running around 60c while playing Skyrim. I ran a memory check and my RAM passed. Here is the crash report and a
 dropbox link to some files I think may be needed for troubleshooting. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            I just got my first blue screen with the same error code while not playing a game yesterday. I'm going to try stirpping my gpu down, cleaning all the dust out and giving it new thermal paste. I didn't think overheating was the problem at first but noticed
 that the temp indicator led on the card actually showed it heating up right before crashing.

            <p>Looks like a file belonging to directx is crashing - dxgkrnl.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your AMD drivers may also be crashing - atikmdag.sys. Uninstall them then update them. From the AMD site</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you overclocking? hal.dll may also be crashing, this is usually CPU related</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would uninstall ASUS smart doctor / AI Suite, if it's installed. See if there's a USB filter hub update on the ASUS site.</p>

            <p>Update on my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the advice J.DD. I tried uninstalling my amd driver completely with the Display Driver Uninstaller free program and then getting the newest version. I was already using almost the newest version, but even after upgrading it didn't help. However,
 the problem may have solved itself. A few days ago Microsoft decided to force upgrade my pc to Windows 10. I walk away for a few minutes and when I come back it's almost done upgrading. I wasn't very happy about the force upgrade at first, but my pc hasn't
 crashed since. After I noticed no more crashing I remembered reading that you should wait until upgrading to Windows 10 before upgrading to the newest amd drivers a few months ago. I ignored the warning at first but I'm hoping that was what was causing the
 problem and now that I've upgraded it won't come back. If it goes a few more days without crashing I'll mark this issue solved.</p>

            No crashes in a while so I'm hopeful that my bsod woes are through. Solution: Latest AMD driver has issues with Windows 7. Upgrading to Windows 10 solved the crashes.

            <p><span>Hey ckm enquirer,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Code 39 indicates that Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There are several causes of Code 39 errors:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>A required device driver is missing. </span></li><li><span>A required binary file is corrupted. </span></li><li><span>There is a problem with the file I/O process. </span></li><li><span>A driver that is referencing an entry point in another binary file is unable to load.</span>
</li></ul>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: </span><span>To fix this issue, uninstall and reinstall the adapter driver.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>To Uninstall:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open device manager by typing
<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and pressing Enter in the <strong>Start </strong>Orb.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Expand <strong>Network Adapters</strong> and double click on your
<strong>adapter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Go to <strong>driver</strong> tab and click on
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. This removes the driver for the respective device selected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After completely removing the driver, go to the link below and install the driver listed for Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>&lt;Removed&gt;</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 2: Install Vista driver.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If the above suggestions don't work, download the one for Vista and run the driver in Vista compatibility mode.</span></p>

    <title>Canon Printer Driver error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertsteffens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canon Printer Driver error</h2>
                    When I originally installed my MG6120 printer on my new laptop (Windows 8) it appears Window had already found the printer.&nbsp; On install I got the error that the printer driver was in use maybe by another user.&nbsp; I wasn't able to install all the software
 and get the menu where you select to scan.&nbsp; It will print ok, but no scanning is possible.&nbsp; When reinstalling I get that error again and even when I un-install and do the install again.&nbsp; I looked in task manager and killed the only print driver task I could
 find that was running.&nbsp; Any help with this would be appreciated.<br />

<h2>            My computer keeps reporting &#34;Unknow Computer Found&#34; under Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>My PC keeps&nbsp;reporting "<strong>Unknown Computer Found</strong>" every few minutes. It actually tells with a female voice.&nbsp;It also displays is on lower right hand side of the monitor followed by&nbsp;&nbsp;"<em><strong>An unidentified computer found on your network</strong></em>"
 below that message. It displays it for a very short time and then&nbsp;clears the display. Then after&nbsp;&nbsp;10-15 minutes it repeats it again. I have to shut the speaker if I don't want to keep hearing it since I have no idea where and why&nbsp;it comes from or fix it. I
 have rebooted and also&nbsp;powered down both my Modem and the Router, both from my Charter company. I also don't have the user Id and Password for the router since it belongs to Charter (Spectrum service.) I haven't called Charter and ask to see if they will provide
 it to me, since I'm not sure&nbsp;it helps to have access to the Router.</p>
<p>So please if anyone out there knows about this problem and can explain and have a solution and a&nbsp;fix for it, I appreciate your help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Which Windows operating system are you using?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Where did you download the sticky note from?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you are using Windows 7 or Vista, you don’t have to download third party Sticky programs. It is already inbuilt&nbsp;in the operating systems.</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer to the following articles and check:</span></p>

<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you still want to run the third party program, then you may try running the program in compatibility mode and check if it helps.</span></p>

    <title>Way to fully properly disable Delivery Optimization&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cchris43993  say:</h3>
<h2>            Way to fully properly disable Delivery Optimization&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a very slow internet connection, 600Kb/s. Delivery Optimization loves to eat that up whether I'm trying to use it or not, which can be incredibly frustrating. A couple months ago, I could just go into Services.msc and disable/stop it. With one of
 the updates, Windows has taken that away from me. I'm now denied access to stopping or modifying DO via Services or cmd. I have DO turned off in the Windows Update settings, and I also have my connection set to metered (the only two fixes I could find anywhere

            Hi Chris
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />I would try disabling it through the registry.
<br />
<br />Click Start, type: regedit
<br />Right click regedit
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\DeliveryOptimization\Config
<br />
<br />Modify the REG_DWORD value DODownloadMode; here are the legal values:
<br />
<br />    0 = Disable WUDO
<br />    1 = Enable WUDO (local peers only)
<br />    2 = Enable WUDO (any peer, anywhere)
<br />

<br />
<br />See if that works.

<p>I read through that article thoroughly, and it does look legit. I checked my registry, and that value is already set to 0 for me. As far as I can tell, it shouldn't be using any data without me specifically calling for it to do so, yet it still does.</p>

            This might be a bug why the settings are not being respected.
<br />
<br />
<br />I would also recommend you file a bug report; send me the short link so I can vote on it and bring it to the attention of the Windows engineers.

<p>You will see them on right when in mp. Is not in browse as in bf3. Also on Battlelog site. Join from there and will launch you into their server... unless it doesn't. Which happens some.</p>

<p>Like Dejected said about the Battlelog way to play. I think the party chat works well once I figured out how to use it. Its not like the 360 where you join and chat right away. You have to join and then open the chat menu and select join the chat or some
 such thing. I got into a party and wondered why everyone was so quiet.</p>

<p>At first excuse me for my english.</p>
<p>It is very easy to understand: it is not possible! </p>
<p>Me and my friends for the first time tried to buy BF4 for XBOX ONE and not Ghosts. We have thought : new generations, new brand.</p>
<p>Fact is that agter 4 days we tried to play togheter (thoriugh battlelog, through the game, through everything...) we understood it was not possible!! You have only to be lucky, and hope thet the server will put you all togheter. When you will be very lucky
 and you and your friends will be in the same team, you can group all your friends in a group of 5 prople with the same color (it is maybe called "squad" in english ) thorough the game.... But you have to hope the game does not crash , else you have to restart
 it all again , and hope again that the server will let you play togheter.</p>
<p>I can not understand how could they do a game based on "teams" where you can not play with your friends! ... and it is only the first of an infinite list of bug!</p>
<p>After 4 days, we all decided to bring the game back, and we had to play again call of duty Ghosts. It is true that it is always the same game, but it runs, and i can play with my friends!</p>

<p>To anyone curious about your NAT status -&nbsp;</p>
<span>Open, moderate or strict NAT? How do I know my NAT status?</span>
<p>Just turn on your console, go up into the ribbon to the "Settings", then select the “System” tile in the upper left. If necessary, choose your appropriate connection type (wired or wireless), and then do a network test to Xbox Live.</p>
<p>If your console doesn't give you an error message about NAT, you already have an open NAT. Congratulations. You are finished here. Go play! If you experience problems with some friends, ask them to do the network test for themselves.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a few reasons why you would be getting an error message that errors such as a
<strong>Blue Screen Error Loop (BSOD)</strong> on your Windows like a faulty system file, driver, program, or something that has to do with your hardware being damaged. That being said, for us to have this isolated, we would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What task are you trying to perform when the error occurred?</li><li>Are you able to load your Windows to <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong>?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we would need get the <strong>System Information</strong> of your
<strong>Windows 10</strong> to be able to pinpoint what troubleshooting that we can best apply for your issue. You can do this by doing these steps:</p>
<br />
<ol>
<li>On your keyboard, press the <strong>Windows button + R</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Run</strong> box, type <strong><em>msinfo32</em></strong> and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Once it finishes loading, click on <strong>File</strong>, and on the drop down list click
<strong>Save</strong> next.</li><li>Once saved, we suggest that you have it uploaded using your <strong><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneDrive account</a></strong> and post the link on your thread.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer is able to load safe mode, we also suggest to perform a <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong>. This is for us to isolate the issue further and see if we are gonna be able to determine if the error
 is caused by a <strong>3rd party program</strong>. You can start each service after every computer restart and uninstall the program that would cause the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please don't hesitate to get back to us so we would be able to assist you further.</p>

    <title>Live Email - Complex Problem, NEED A REAL GURU TO SOLVE THIS ONE - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Live Email - Complex Problem, NEED A REAL GURU TO SOLVE THIS ONE Anyone Help&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Problems with Live Mail. First some background;</p>
<p>Windows 7 64 bit Pro</p>
<p>I have multiple email addresses, both from my Internet Provider as well as a third party site. I get the same error message from both sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran a "Clean Disc" program and now unfortunately when I try to access email I get the following message;</p>
<p>Your server has unexpectedly terminated the connection. Possible causes for this include server problems, network problems, or a long period of inactivity.<br />
<br />
Subject 'test'<br />
Server: 'mail.gmx.com'<br />
Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800CCC0F<br />
Protocol: SMTP<br />
Port: 25<br />
Secure(SSL): No</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know others have posted this problem as well, but I haven't seen an answer that will help me. The steps I have taken;</p>
<p>1. I did a complete registry clean</p>
<p>2. Ran a System Scan - resulting in a message that "not all errors could be repaired"</p>
<p>3. Opened up the CBS Log - about a mile long.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> I am enclosing a few "snips" below that mention errors couldn't be repaired.</span></p>
<p>4. An obvious Fix would be to "restore my computer to an earlier state". Unfortunately my Clean Disc also wiped out all my Restore Points as well!</p>
<p>5. I uninstalled Live Mail - again cleaning the Registry of any reference to the program.</p>
<p>6. Installed a fresh version of Live Mail, expecting to reenter all new Account Information. To my surprise, the program was fully intact including the Error Messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Live Mail Messages are on a different hard drive, but of course Mail is configured to access them. I could backup all the messages on still a different Hard Drive delete the messages that are currently being accessed then again reinstall Live Mail (it
 wouldn't be able to assess any old messages - they would have been moved to a different drive). Reenter my various Account(s) information, then import the saved messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone think that would work?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Any other suggestions, Ideas? Really need help on this.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A few random clips from the CBS Log - I have the complete log available.</p>

    <title>Mapped drives disappear after logoff or reboot. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wouterj_be  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mapped drives disappear after logoff or reboot.</h2>
                    <div>Today, suddenly a lot of our users started experiencing a problem with mapped network drives disappearing after reboot or log-off/on.</div>
<div>They where added using the commandline "/persistent:yes" flag.</div>
<div>I've also tried adding them through the GUI, selecting "Reconnect at logon".</div>
<div>The hosts are in the same domain as the server, and the users use the same Active Directory login credentials to log on to their PC's as they need to connect to the network drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried deleting any regestry key i could find</div>
<div><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MountPoints2</span></div>
<div><span>and retried. To no avail.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I've tried mapping the location to a different drive letter, and that works!</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Another user asked the same question in 2010</span></div>
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/mapped-drives-disappear-after-logoff-or-reboot/f0d804c4-0a9c-46ab-ae52-162293e7011b?page=1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/mapped-drives-disappear-after-logoff-or-reboot/f0d804c4-0a9c-46ab-ae52-162293e7011b?page=1</a></div>
<div>But the admins sent him off with a non-reply, and marked it as a correct answer themselves, as&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/9221a140-84bb-49f3-9ef0-b4b7efc6cc3a">Dan_MsW7-64</a>&nbsp;points out quite correctly.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, does anyone here know the internal mechanism about mapped network drives? In what registry location of config file could there be a lingering broken configuration that we need to clear?</div>
                </div>

            <div>The location in the registry of network maps is:</div>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Network\&lt;drive letter&gt;
<div><br />
<div>This gets created, but is gone after a reboot.</div>
<div>Also if i quickly open "My Computer" after reboot, i see my mapped drive appearing, and quickly disappearing as other drives get added.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, it's a safe bet that this is caused by the domain group policy.</div>
<div>If you're facing this too, check with your domain administrator.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<div><br />
Let start with a question.<br />
Is the issue confined to Adobe Photoshop?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
If it is only with adobe Photoshop then you have to change the settings in Photoshop and check.<br />
I suggest you post the same question in adobe community for better assistance.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 no longer activated after build 17134 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> henr1cc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 no longer activated after build 17134 update</h2>
                    <p>After a recent update I'm no longer able to activate windows. Windows 10 came pre-installed on the computer when I bought it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As other have suggested, I've tried using the&nbsp;<strong>wmic path ...</strong> command and used that key to activate, but that only gives me the error 0xc004c003, telling me my key isn't valid. I've also tried pressing the troubleshoot button, which only gave
 me another error 0x87e10bc6 telling me to wait a few minutes ad try again, which I've already done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just noticed something very weird though: the product key at the activation window ends with P9XQR, while the one obtained from the command prompt ends with JTYK4. Is this normal? Or is the one at the activation screen just a fake one?</p>
<p>This might be unimportant but here are some other unusual things I noticed after the update:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Microsoft Edge shortcut was made on my desktop</li><li>Notifications about some new features or something</li><li>A Task View button at the taskbar&nbsp;</li><li>"Documents" and "Pictures" buttons appeared on the start menu (to the left)</li></ul>
<p>Edit: I've also tried Andre Da Costa's advice from this thread:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-becomes-not-activated-after-latest-update/28e08634-35e9-4a7b-b16c-2d1766249836">link</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit: Windows got activated after waiting 5 days!</strong></p>

            Try following -
<br />
<br />1. You can also Use third party tools to retrieve keys

<br />
<br />2. If above doesn't work, I need to verify whether it is OEM or Retail or Volume, I need the screenshot of following output

<p>So, my windows just suddenly got activated. I'm assuming there just were some issues with the activation servers? I had to wait 5 days though.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help anyway!</p>

    <title>Transferring Microsoft Store purchases to a new account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daleastiles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transferring Microsoft Store purchases to a new account</h2>
                    <p>My outlook.com address has been compromised and I get loads of SPAM e-mail daily.&nbsp; Despite using best-laid practices to prevent such things and nearly daily blocks in settings, it just keeps coming in.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have chosen to abandon and permanently&nbsp;delete my current outlook.com account, but I have made several large purchases within&nbsp;the Microsoft Store that I'd like to keep, including, but not limited to Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to transfer purchases to a new account before permanently closing the existing account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<h3> miikkapeltonen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kernel-power error 41 &#40;63&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hey, i've been having a problem with occasional bsod's &amp; forced reboots with my new pc. The interval between crashes seems to be random(from about once in a few days to 3-4 times a day) and occurence of the crashes seem to be random aswell (sometimes while
 playing, sometimes while doing nothing and sometimes bsod, more often just forced boot).</p>
<p>
</p><p>During every crash the eventviewer logs the same error: Event 41, kernel-power task category:63.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem first surfaced after a windows update, though i'm not certain of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done memorytests to rule out RAM-failure, i've also done sfc a couple of times, checked all hardware connections and tried various other methods that i've found from other conversations connected to the same problem. I haven't overclocked my pc and
 heat levels are normal on all hardware devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is my problem and any help regarding this matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

            Still haven't been able to get the dmp file since my pc hasn't bsod'd after my message and there's only an old dmp file in the minidump folder(prior to the start of the crashing problems). So i've been waiting for a bsod to get the dump file(of course
 it would be awesome if it didn't bsod anymore :D ), i'll get back to this when i do :)<br />

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView -&nbsp;set VIEW to Hide<br />
Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names (and BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run DriverVerifier.<br />
(Remember to use the Windows 8/8.1 methods posted at the top&nbsp;of the original reply above.)<br />
<br />
Driver Verifier can help find some BSOD issues : <br />

<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If Driver Verifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can analyze it.<br />

Hope this helps. </p>

            <p>Ok, so tried all of the aforementioned gimmicks on my pc, none of them worked i'm afraid. Also refreshed windows, after which the pc worked fine for a week until crashing today with the same error message (Event ID:41, source:kernel-power, category:63).
 I've noticed that when i start my pc and start a game, the game fps is lower than usual , this problem is often fixed by rebooting the pc, might be related somehow. Also when i start my pc the windows startup screen comes only to my secondary panel instead
 of my main panel, which is kinda odd aswell(i get picture on my main panel when windows is done loading).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally i'm starting to think it's a gpu/motherboard hardware fault, but as i'm not sure i wouldn't like to send the pc back just on a hunch as i need it for studying etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So any other insight would be greatly appreciated :).</p>

            <p>Thanks, it was an interesting sequence of events. I added an e-mail account for work.&nbsp;When I added it, it told me that I had to enforce security policies on the machine. I did this with a domain account that was local administrator. The Surface was joined
 to a different domain than my work domain&nbsp;However, when I tried to reconnect my work e-mail it told me that it wasn't able to enforce security policies on my Surface and that I would need to contact my system administrator. I thought maybe the fact that my
 Surface was joined to my own domain could be the problem. So, I un-joined it from the domain and used my Microsoft Account to log into my Surface. This account apparently had no administrator privileges, however, and I was unable to log in as local Administrator
 (although the account still existed and I knew the password). In fact, even while I was logged in with my Microsoft Account, I had no option to run a program as administrator. It was just missing from the menu options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, I reset my Surface. I was able to get back in as administrator but am still not able to connect to my work e-mail (likely because of policies they have enforced on the exchange server).</p>

<h2>            Regarding Emojis</h2>
                    <p>I am using skype version&nbsp;8.25.0.5 and my friend using&nbsp; 12.1815.210.0</p>
<p>when I sent a Ant and wasp emoji from 8.25.0.5 version my friend can't able to see it and he can't able to find that emoji.</p>
<p>what I found is skype 8.25.0.5 is online download version where 12.1815.210.0 is Windows store version.</p>
<p>this is total useless, then why they having a Windows store version which is total useless which don't have any option and say download from stores.. wasting developers time in developing windows store app.</p>
