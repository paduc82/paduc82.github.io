<h2>            Publisher 2010 Download</h2>
                    I got a new windows 10 laptop a few months ago, without a dvd drive, and was wondering where I could get a publisher 2010 download. I have the product key, but can't find anywhere to enter the key, or anywhere to download publisher 2010.

            As usual, I post the question then work out a workaround... I've managed to set up the mail account using the Control Pail Mail Settings route, but jeez MS, your wizards should work when you change them...

</p><p><span><span>There is a way on how to the change ownload folder/received file folder location, but this is applicable if you are using the

    <title>track changes&#58; comments disappear while typing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            track changes&#58; comments disappear while typing</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm currently using Word 2008 for Mac. I use the track changes feature a lot for copyediting purposes. I often need to type relatively lengthy comments, i.e. a full sentence or two. I find that while I'm typing into the comment box (at the bottom, in the "main
 document changes and comments" rather than a bubble), I only have a short time before the comment I'm creating disappears in the middle of typing it! This is extremely frustrating for me because it happens with almost every comment I'm making, sometimes multiple
 times. I have to click on the comment within the text, then choose "edit comment" from the menu before I can complete what I was trying to type. How can I prevent this from happening?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Rebecca<br />

            In an admittedly brief test I can't reproduce this here. The comment I typed is...<br />
<br />
<p>This is a singular comment which will go on for more than one, fairly long sentence. I'm not sure how long to make it because - as you know - a sentence can run on for line after line after line after line after line. I'll try to
 get this one to wrap to a second line in the Comment window just to see what happens. The next step will be to make the window narrower to see if that causes any content to disappear.</p>
<br />
... which I entered without losing sight of anything. Combined with the fact that I've not seen any similar reports recently I'm inclined to believe it may well be a local issue. Try the normal procedures first:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Make sure Office is fully updated [12.3.3 is current]</li><li>Make sure OS X is fully updated</li><li>Run Disk Utility to repair disk permissions</li><li>Restart your Mac</li></ul>
<br />
If there's no improvement I'd suggest that you next follow the procedure described here for addressing any potential font issues:
<a href="http://word.mvps.org/Mac/fontweeding.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Font Weeding.</strong></a><br />
<br />
Check back for additional ideas if necessary if the problem persists. When you do, be sure to indicate whether this occurs in all documents or just specific ones. It would also be helpful to know what happens if you create a new User Account &amp; run Word there
 to see if you see the same behavior.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Bob J.<br />

<h2>            How to view Skype messages that were deleted</h2>
                    I had a ton of Skype messages and I can't view all of them from 2013. I had some messages from before the time and then after, but not in-between. The time I'm talking about is I had Skype messages from June and July 2013, some messages from some people
 from August and September 2013, and then missing messages leading up until December 2013. Someone must have edited my history. These originated from my Windows 8 laptop ASUS computer. I had no clue in to how to retrieve them. I have posted these questions
 in the Skype community but have gotten no help. Can anyone help me please? I think they're all stored in the main.db file but I'm not so sure anymore. It's just like those pms on the forum I can't read anymore because I'm banned from them.

<p>

<p>Sorry for the delay in responding to this message, but the problem isn't on my end - it is people trying to respond to my reply to their original message.&nbsp; &nbsp;They send me a message, I respond (via the Outlook App on my Android Device) and when they reply,
 the message "bounces" back to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The common denominator for both people who have told me about the problem is Outlook App is the vehicle used to respond to their message and that the long
<em><strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** </strong></em>-email address (which I do not recognize or understand).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OP and my incidents tell me this isn't an isolated incident.&nbsp; In other cases, people never let the person know of the issue; the person affected might do as my two known examples did -they sent me a new message and that worked.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am wondering how many
 messages I have missed due to the bouncing issue.</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
Based on the bounce back message that was forwarded to you, there is likely an issue with the recipients' account. Referring to
<strong>Lanie_P.</strong>'s answer from the thread that <strong>Amylove Loy</strong> provided, if they are getting the "mailbox unavailable" error, they may need to check if they have the correct email address. If they are using corporate email accounts, they
 may need to contact their email admin for further assistance.<br />
<br />
Feel free to reach out if you need further help.

<h2>            N73 problems</h2>
                    I have a nokia N73 had it for 5 weeks or should I say, it has been to the service centre for 3 weeks and i had it for 2. It has been software upgraded 3 times but if I check the firmware it has not changed so what software updates do they mean I still
 has the same problem when I answer a call the phone turns itself off and then re-sets itself. I have the phone backed up on a 2 gig card so I dont lose everything I have to restore the phone from the card It is at the service centre at the moment I wonder
 what software they are adding this time??? If it is not sorted this time I think I will just demand a nother phone d900 or k800i!!!!! Its getting to be a bit of a pain in the **bleep** as the phone is used for business!

                    <p>I am using Office 365 ProPlus on Windows 7 and cannot figure out why the contact photos are not displaying after I linked my Linkedin account. Only thing I can think of that would affect it is that when I connected my Linkedin to Outlook I was connected
 to a public network at the school I was at that blocked access to linkedin on the internet. I was still able to retrieve my contact list, but no photos were linked.

            In another thread it was found that disconnecting Surface Pro keyboard worked to upgrade (upgrade in tablet mode). Reconnecting keyboard while running causes GSOD bugcheck dump, even after upgrade completes. However, you may be able to use keyboard (after
 upgrade) if it is connected while powered off.

                    <p>First. Nowhere can you find a telephone number to contact microsoft direct. Second. When you do you have to pay for it. Unbelieveable. Third. I paid for Outlook 2010 because&nbsp;Outlook 2003 became unusable and the only answer Microsoft had was to go through
 a page of profile re-setting. Basic problem is the software doesn't work and Microsoft seem to be the&nbsp;only&nbsp;company on the planet that can get away with shipping faulty merchandise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Outlook 2010 my send / receive cycle involves 3 e-mail addresses, so 3 send and 3 receive making 6 actions. My send / receive interval is 10 minutes. However once a cycle
 is complete it then starts another, and once it has entered this repeat phase it seems to loop around quicker than I can complete the cycle for all 3 addresses. The result is that the send / receive cycles then stack up, waiting for the previous cycle to complete.
 When I aborted Outlook just now I had 1366 actions outstanding. With all these stacked actions Outlook is unusable because it is taking all the processing power. There is nothing on Outlook home page to resolve this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfit for purpose. Help.</p>

<h2>            Changing my MX Records from googlemail to live mail&#47;outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently set up a company website through WEEBLY and they offered me email hosted by googlemail (I log in through gmail.com) . I much prefer the outlook.com (<em>i only access my email online</em>) email interface and I have set up the exact same email
 address on outlook.com. Now I want all the email to be directed to the email address on outlook.com not gmail.com but by MX records are all directed to googlemail.</p>
<p>I believe that I have to change my MX records on my WEEBLY domain to point to outlook.com instead of googlemail but I have no idea what the MX settings should be.</p>
Can anyone help me do this please?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>A file with the HTM file extension is a Hypertext Markup Language file. The easiest way to open an HTM file is to double-click on it and let your computer decide which default application should open the file. If no program opens the HTM file then you probably
 don't have an application installed that can view and/or edit HTM files. You may also right click on the file and click open with. Then open the file with notepad.</p>

<h2>            Why Won&#39;t Outlook Display the Drafts I Saved Today&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Frustration is my middle name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suddenly my Drafts folder is only showing Drafts I have saved two weeks ago and older. I have tried changing the sort order to date, subject, to, from, everything I can think of. Nothing works. I need to revise the Email Draft that I spent hours working
 on yesterday and today, and I need to find it soon or start from scratch before the day is over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is a brand new one after 48 hours of everything functioning smoothly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the last two days I have repeatedly hit "Save" and the email-in-progress was saved to my Drafts folder. And each time I was able to re-open it when I came back to it. No problem. But this afternoon I saved the email draft while I checked something
 quickly. I was on the verge of sending the final draft out (I needed to add one single date). When I came back to my Drafts folder, it wasn't there. Sorting by date, Outlook showed only Drafts that were one week old or older. I signed out of Outlook, restarted
 my computer, went back to my Drafts folder, and now it is only showing Drafts that are two weeks old and older.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where are the four drafts of the email that I saved today?? (I really only need the latest draft.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it matters, I'm accessing my workplace Outlook account from home via my MacBook Pro. I doubt any of that is relevant because everything was working smoothly for 48 hours in the exact same conditions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any rapid help would be immensely appreciated. If not available, though, I'd still like to learn anytime why the problem exists and how to prevent it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Yes, from now on I will save all important emails on DropBox, my Google Drive, and as an off-line Word document, too.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>To get a better clarity about the issue, please provide the details below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Did you try accessing your account through different browser?</li><li>When you log into your account does it say <strong>Outlook.com </strong>or <strong>

<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I suggest you to try logging into <strong><a href="https://www.Outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.Outlook.com</a></strong> through different browser and check whether you are able to access your account.</p>
<p>

<p>I'll leave the Nokia Lumia 640XL phone until the login problem is fixed.</p>
<p>I tried using different computers and browsers to no avail.</p>
<p>Creating an alias (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) allowed me to log in to "View inbox" and also get to my calendars OK but when I tried to use my old login address it still came up with the problem.</p>
<p>Trying to reset the primary login back it came up with "We limit how frequently you can change your primary alias. Try again next week."</p>
<p>This of course makes me wait for another week - very frustrating. There's&nbsp;enough sending verification codes etc. that really make this unnecessary wait but there is nothing I can do about that.</p>
<p>I've included a couple of JPGs that show the page that opens when logging in to
<a href="https://login.live.com/login.srf?lc=3081" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.live.com/login.srf?lc=3081</a> (Name and address blanked out) and also the error page when trying the "View inbox" link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Howard.</p>

            Hi Amrita,<br />
Hope you received my reply with the info and attached zip file OK.<br />
Using your private message, I sent it over a week ago but I thought you may be having problems with it.<br />
Please let me know if there's any progress with the account.<br />
I fit's possible, I'd like to remove the Outlook&nbsp;address and go back to the iiNet address to access outlook.com.<br />
You can reply to this or send me an email to iiNet address when you're ready.<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Howard.

            <p>This is an update as per the "July 15 Checking in on your recent question: Can't access Outlook.com on computers or phone" email I received asking me to post an update. Here it is:</p>
<p>I have not been able to login to Outook.com since July 5.</p>
<p>Microsoft sent me an email on July 8 "Take a look at the upgraded Outlook.com".</p>
<p>Must have been a downgrade as after following directions sent to me in a private message, I still can't log in to Outlook.com and now can't log in to Live!.com either or sync my Windows phone.</p>
<p>Obviously I can log in to Microsoft Community (this page), otherwise you wouldn't see this post.</p>
<p>I have asked for updates both here and as a reply to the private message that was sent to me.</p>
<p>It's now July 26 and so far no update has been forthcoming. Still nothing is working so I don't know where to go from here.</p>
<p>I'd try to change my settings but as I now can't log in at all, this appears impossible.</p>
<p>Hope this may stir some action as I'd like to update my calendars and sync my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou,</p>
<p>Howmor.</p>

            <p>Success on my alternate login address finally.</p>
<p>I changed my primary to the new address. The page says you can change the primary at any time.</p>
<p>This is incorrect, you can only do it twice, then you have to wait another week to change it again.</p>
<p>It makes following problems much harder.</p>
<p>I do NOT want to reset my Windows phone losing all my data because my original primary address appears to be corrupt. Windows phones shouldn't be this awkward to update without resetting. OS rewrite needed?</p>
<p>If I remove the original address and the put it back into Outlook.com again, will this allow my phone to recognise it without having to do a reset?</p>

            <p>To the people who had the same problem.</p>
<p>I've given up on getting to the bottom of this as I can't get an answer to my correspondence after complying with the tasks and sending the files (as asked) to MS.</p>
<p>Removing the original account name and putting it back in still wouldn't allow my phone to sync.</p>
<p>Even resetting the phone wouldn't work.</p>
<p>I created a new account, reset the phone and now it works as it should.</p>
<p>As soon as I've submitted this reply, I'm going to delete this account sot won't be a problem to me anymore.</p>
<p>Good Luck to the rest of you, I hope you have better luck than I did waiting - waiting - waiting etc..</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Howmor.</p>
