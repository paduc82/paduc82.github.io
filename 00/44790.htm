<p>
</p><p>I have a VM with MS-DOS 6.22 running, and I would like to know if I can configure my USB mouse (Microsoft Sculpt Mobile Mouse) to work in programs&nbsp;that use a mouse (for example, Microsoft Word).&nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Updates not downloading and installing</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I use Secunia PSI to alert me when updates are available for my Windows 10 64-bit installation.&nbsp; According to PSI, my installation is missing these Microsoft updates:&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
</p><p>My understanding is that Windows 10 will automatically download and install updates as needed.&nbsp; However, after several days, there is no sign of the updates.&nbsp; How frequently does Windows 10 check for and download needed updates?&nbsp; Is there any way to force
 the update?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to disable the Secunia PSI temporarily and then click on check for updates from Update and security.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to run the in-built Windows update troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1) Type
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong> in the search box and open <strong>troubleshooter.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2) In the left pane, click on
<strong>View all.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3) Select
<strong>Windows update </strong>and follow the on screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>

</p><p>Not sure why turning off Secunia is important, since it is only monitoring status, but I have turned it off for now.&nbsp; I ran the troubleshooter, and no problems were found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a good example of why the new Windows Update model is not serving Microsoft's customers.&nbsp; In the past, it was a simple task to open Windows Update, check for updates, and receive positive confirmation that Windows was up to date.&nbsp; Now, we are completely
 in the dark, with essentially no control over our systems.&nbsp; I do not understand why this would be considered a step forward.</p>

            <p>This gets more interesting.&nbsp; Using the KB links to the missing patches in my Windows 10 installation, I was taken to a link to the Microsoft Update Catalog.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/381169b3-8ff6-48d4-9248-ffcb6438eb7c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I accessed this site, I was able to download and install a cumulative security update as of 9/5/2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d54c050-6224-42cf-8727-65da96b30ff4" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing these updates, Secunia reported a perfect score (meaning my system had no missing patches).</p>

</p><p>Given the experts on this site, I am curious why no one mentioned the Microsoft Update Catalog site?</p>

            <p>My situation similar to JerryMeeker. Long time user, now running Windows 7x64. Have experienced many windows 10 download attempts, and for couple of months just turned off windows update. Have tried a number of possible fixes, and you know the answer.</p>
<p>I agree 100% with post about Windows not serving its customers like in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think my problem is my system reserved partition not being big enough, but before I go further want to see how windows 10 experience is with others.</p>

</p><p>Here are a couple of tips that may be useful:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, regarding Windows Update constantly asking you to download the Windows 10 upgrade, you can simply right-click the update notification and select "Hide this update". &nbsp;This will prevent it from appearing again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, regarding Windows 10 and how to control/force updates, now that I am more familiar with Win10, I have found that under Settings there is a "Update &amp; Security" tab. &nbsp;If you click on this, you will see a message stating that either your system is up
 to date, or that updates are waiting. &nbsp;Note that updates normally are not downloaded while the computer is busy. &nbsp;There is also a "Check for Updates" button that you can click to see if any downloads are available. &nbsp;So, I am more comfortable with Win10's behavior,
 although I am still a little irritated when I shut down in the evening expecting to be able to immediately head to bed, but get the "Windows is working on updates--don't power the system off" message.</p>

<h2>            back up onto USB drive for windows 10</h2>
                    I can't seem to be able to make a back up file for windows 10.&nbsp; I have already lost everything once because hard drive died and I didn't have a back up. Do not want to make that mistake again. But for some reason I can't seem to be able to do this. I go
 into backup and it gives me a "more options" button but when I push it it just takes me out of that area and drops me back onto my start screen.&nbsp; Can anyone help me with this please?&nbsp;

            <p>With all due respect to Microsoft, if you're serious about backing up (and everyone should be) then get proper backup software. Most any third-party backup program has more features and is easier to figure out than what Microsoft built in to Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the web for reviews of backup software for Windows. Your big problem will be choosing one from all the good choices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until you get proper backup software, backing up can be as simple as copying folders from your hard drive to an external USB drive. (Backing up email is a little more complicated.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you get into the habit of backing up at regular intervals, you'll wonder how you lived without it. Before too long you'll want to know about backing up your entire hard disk (this is known as imaging a disk), and pretty soon you'll be backing up to
 'the cloud;' then you'll rise to become CEO of a big tech company and even become President of the United States. That's how it feels to know that whatever happens, everything that matters to you is backed up.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your requirement in this regard and regrets the inconvenience caused.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It's always good to have a backup. Keep copies of your files on another drive in case something happens to the originals.&nbsp;In Windows 10 you can
 manage Back up either through <strong>Settings app </strong>or through <strong>Control Panel</strong>. From the information you have provided herewith, I guess you're facing problem while doing it from the
<strong>Settings app</strong>. If that is the case, there might be chances where it fails due to temporary issues. Reboot your PC after complete shutdown and then check if the problem still happens.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Go to
<strong>Start Button/&gt;Settings/&gt;Update &amp; Security/&gt; Windows Update</strong> and click
<strong>Check Updates</strong>. If any pending updates available, then install them and see if it cures the problem. If incase problem still happen then try to manage the setting through Control Panel. Navigate to
<strong>Control Panel /&gt; System and Security /&gt; File History </strong>and try to manage setting from there to see if it works fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</span></p>

            <p>Backing up your entire hard drive is called <em>imaging</em> a disk, so you'll need disk imaging software. Imaging is not the same as copying because an image includes information about the disk that's not contained in any file. This information is called
 the <em>metadata</em> and it describes the structure of the disk. Your computer needs the metadata to know how to use the disk...where to find files and how to store information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently using Macrium Reflect, but there are other good choices too. They've all got free trials so you can try them and see which you like. (Macrium Reflect even has a version that's free.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing about disk imaging is that it's a little hard to understand. It will take some work to figure out, but the reward for your effort is fabulous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say I make some big mistakes and completely mess up my computer. (Of course, that
<em>never</em> happens.) When I'm ready to give up trying to put Humpty Dumpty back together again, I restore an image made before my experimenting began and in a matter of minutes I've gone back in time like nothing ever happened. That's the power of disk
 imaging and I am <em>not</em> exaggerating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think of the confidence you will have once you realize that you won't ever need to reinstall Windows or your software ever again. Just restore an image and you're back in business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Schedule your images to run daily, in the dead of the night, and you won't ever be more than 24 hours away from the most recent working version of your computer. Big companies have been doing this for years and we can too.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Store UK fraud me on &#163;404.99. Only way to get my money back is police and court. Read to know &#33;</h2>
                    <p>First I ordered Surface pro 128GB for ¬£404.99 (for students) on 7th January. I used :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msuk/en_GB/pdp/productID.282543700</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(price went up on 8th January).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I never got confirmation email on 7th (I checked account and money were gone), so I contacted Microsoft Store UK
<span><span>0800 026 0329</span></span> (isn't local team), they said that everything is fine I will get confirmation email after verification (no word about issue with payment) and if not I should contact again after few hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did around 5:45pm as I never
<span><span>0800 026 0329</span></span> (isn't local team), they said that everything is fine I will get confirmation email after verification (no word about issue with payment) and if not I should contact again after few hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did around 5:45pm as I never
 got confirmation email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I heard from them was a joke. They said that they couldn't authorise payment, tried again manually (on 8th) but they couldn't, I said that money were gone an account. They said not possible as they couldn't take it and they TRIED again. When I wanted
 to speak with supervisor/manager they said that I can send an letter.</p>
<p>I should try again to order Surface Pro (IN HIGHER PRICE !) but before I should advise my bank to authorise payment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So next thing was to take a phone and call my bank. And after that everything become clear, my bank confirmed that payment went through on 7th January when I ordered it ! and Microsoft never tried again to take my money, no issue with authorisation, Micorosft
 got all money just after I ordered Surface Pro on 7th (for ¬£404.99).</p>
<p>To get back money I will need to notify police and bank about fraud and fill out appropriate paperwork (as payment went through bank can't just take it back as I used debit card), so now Microsoft Store UK refused to send my item, refused that they have
 my money and only way to get my money back is to notify authorities about fraud committed by Microsoft Store UK..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is a huge joke and my first case of that kind of problem with big brand. Additionally I can't reach supervisor/manager as their customer service refuse to connect me further, so only way&nbsp; to get my money back is to notify authorities about crime committed
 by Microsoft in UK and most probably case in small claim court !!!! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course I won't now just re-order tablet (not only because it is more expensive but because of my lost time), and I will go with this further including all people might be interested with
<span><span>summons.</span></span></p>
<span><span>summons.</span></span></p>
<p>Why ? My bank advised me that we can do it quickly if Microsoft will send fax with information that they cancelled order and they
<span>&nbsp;</span>refund <span>&nbsp;</span>my money. Problem is that Microsoft doesn't admit to taking my money (while bank clearly indicated Microsoft as receiver).</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>refund <span>&nbsp;</span>my money. Problem is that Microsoft doesn't admit to taking my money (while bank clearly indicated Microsoft as receiver).</p>
<p>Huge surprise for me as this is one of biggest brands and very sad that I had such a experience
<span><span>L</span></span></p>
<span><span>L</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is warning for any other UK consumer which would be attract to buying from<span>&nbsp;
</span>their store as it could end it like my case where I will need to involve police, OFT and company house to get my money back and summons to court for lost money on calls and my time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
For me this is a huge joke, best part is that my business is a Microsoft partner ROTFL.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Very very sad. I have only one question, would it happened if their billing center would be located in UK and operated by people familiar with UK law and OFT regulations ?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is it because of price rise ? Hard for me to believe that Microsoft wanted to fraud me on stupid few quid, looks like some terrible error, but their unprofessional staff and bad attitude cost me a money and seems that it will cost Microsoft reputation in
 UK as I won't leave it like this without proper redemption as I'm working almost 12-14hours daily and soon I will release new product to mass market and simple I can't afford to spend 2-4hours on chat with their consumer support and someone has to pay for
 my time and costs. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This case will be an example for all unprofessional retailers in UK as I will make very medial curt case in small claim court.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Who knows how much time I will spend with lawyer to get my money back....<br />

    <title>How to re install the actual drivers for AHCI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> usbhubman  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to re install the actual drivers for AHCI </h2>
                    
<p>I installed a new SSD and then loaded my new version of Windows 7 Ultimate - which I have not activated yet just in case I messed up, which I have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed a program (Nero or PGP Desktop or something) that loaded it's own drivers. My two empty hotswap drives still have the correct atapi AHCI 1.0 Serial ATA&nbsp; drivers -atapi.sys and ataport.sys, msahci.sys and pciiddex.sys. However, now my Kinston
 drive and my WD1001 drive on ports 0 and 1 show drivers disk.sys, partmgr.sys pgpwded.sys snapman.sys and tdrpm251.sys. I need to force Windows 7 to re-install the drivers but any attempt to update driver results in a message indicating I already have the
 correct driver. Without AHCI support, TRIM will not work and my new SSD will slow over time. This is the ONLY problem in an otherwise fabulous install. I don't want to have to start over !&nbsp;&nbsp; Any idea on how to ACTUALLY FORCE windows to re-install the correct
 drivers ?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Uninstall all the drivers from the device manager and restart the computer, windows should automatically detect the drivers for your device.</p>

<h2>            Deleting an outgoing message</h2>
                    I tried sending out a message through Windows Mail with an overlarge attachment. I'm notified after at least 30 minutes of looking at the slide bar that the file is too large-but EVERY time I close out and start up Mail it tries to send out the same message!
 It won't retrieve incoming messages until it's finished trying to send out the overlarge message that I can't delete! How frustrating!! I'd appreciate any advice on how to delete the outgoing emails (2). They don't show in my draft or outgoing folders, they
 only show when I open up Mail-then Mail is out of service until it finishes trying to send out the message....Please Help!

<h2>            Help&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; Windows Recovery Tool Not Working on Desktop</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a Win 10 Home, 64-bit&nbsp;desktop.&nbsp; After setting it up, I tried to use the Windows Recovery Tool.&nbsp; I got the box that said something like "gathering some information and will take a few minutes."&nbsp; After a couple of hours, I tried to cancel it
 and got the "setup is cleaning up...." message.&nbsp; It's been going about an hour now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needing some help for this.&nbsp; I really want to use the Recovery Tool but I'm not sure what's going on.&nbsp; I'm wanting to use a USB thumb drive but I'll settle for DVDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>No, it's not the same PC.&nbsp; I've actually had 3 new ones in the last 10 days, all from Dell.&nbsp; The first one had corrupt system files (Win 7 Pro).&nbsp; Had it replaced.&nbsp; Same corrupt files.&nbsp; Tried to download recovery media from Dell.&nbsp; When I ran it, it said it
 had corrupt or missing files.&nbsp; So guess Dell has an issue with their Win 7 Pro imaging.&nbsp; The third time, I ordered a PC with Win 10 Home (this one).&nbsp; Not a big fan of it so far, but clearly I couldn't get a Win 7&nbsp;from Dell that was not corrupt since all they
 have available is the Win 7 Pro edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have my old Win 7 Home Premium PC.&nbsp; Hard drive is starting to fail (I have backed up my files and have a Win 7 disk so you haven't heard the last from me on that PC.&nbsp; In fact, now I can ask questions about both operating systems :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, everybody, for bearing with me.</p>

            <p>1. Have you <em>purchased </em>McAfee LiveSafe or is the Dell-preinstalled free-trial still installed? If the former, when (exact date) does your current subscription expire? If the latter, are you planning on purchasing McAfee LiveSafe or...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When &amp; why was MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware (MBAM) installed? Is it MBAM Premium or MBAM Free? Has MBAM ever detected &amp; quarantined anything since it's been installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. You feel the Edge is "more stable" than Internet Explorer, is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. When (exact dates) were KB3176493&nbsp;and KB3173428 each installed according to
<strong>Installed Updates </strong><em>(not <strong>Update History</strong></em>)?

            <p>1.&nbsp; McAfee LiveSafe came pre-installed from Dell.&nbsp; However, I did purchase a 3-year subscription to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Malwarebytes was installed on Sept. 4 but has never been run.&nbsp; It is MBAM Free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Yes, Edge does seem more stable than IE 11.&nbsp; With IE 11, I was getting a lot of "not responding" messages.&nbsp; The old Fixit would say it was because DEP wasn't enabled but I could not figure out where to enable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; KB3176493 and KB3173428 were both installed on Sept. 4.&nbsp; KB3172729 did install last night on Sept. 5.</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I upgraded the Dell-preinstalled McAfee LiveSafe&nbsp;free-trial version&nbsp;to the paid version.<br />
<br />
</li><li>I (a) uninstalled the McAfee free-trial, (b) downloaded/ran the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool - followed by a reboot - (c) and then did a clean install of the paid version of&nbsp;McAfee LiveSave.&nbsp;[If you cannot answer YES to parts&nbsp;a, b &amp; c, you

<p>
</p><p>Fact: McAfee (and Norton) applications are <em>notorious </em>for not upgrading (or&nbsp;uninstalling) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be playing a role in the "not responding" errors when using IE11 - and may explain why Windows 10 Anniversary Update (AKA Win10
 1607) hasn't been offered to your computer via Windows Update yet.</p>

                    Hey. The problem with the wheel Thrustmaster TMX FFB EU PRO, does not work in the game NFS Payback. Only the buttons on the steering wheel work, the steering wheel and pedals do not want to work in the game. Supports this game control by steering wheel
 and pedals?

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe NFS Payback has steering wheel or pedal support for all brands unfortunately. I did find an article where&nbsp;EA updated the game to support 2 steering wheels made by Logitech:
<a href="https://help.ea.com/en-us/help/need-for-speed/need-for-speed-payback/steering-wheel-support-in-need-for-speed-payback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://help.ea.com/en-us/help/need-for-speed/need-for-speed-payback/steering-wheel-support-in-need-for-speed-payback/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>They don't support Thrustmaster though unfortunately.</p>

            Thanks for using Little Registry Cleaner. These problems are unable to be removed because they are created by the system and LRC doesn't have the right permission to remove them. Please take a look at the bug report I created at

<h3> anthonychiappette  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Print to PDF - Bloated file sizes</h2>
                    <p>Why are the file sizes 10X bigger when printing with Microsoft Print To PDF as opposed to Adobe Acrobat?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use Adobe Acrobat to print a web page from My bank, the file sizes are roughly 36K in size.&nbsp; However, printing the same web page using Microsoft Print To&nbsp;PDF, the file size soars to over 350K.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is there such a HUGE difference in the size of the file when it contains the same data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an issue for me because Adobe Acrobat STILL does not work with Edge.&nbsp; When is this going to be fixed so I can use Adobe Acrobat instead of the awful Microsoft Print To PDF?</p>

            <p>This is the only reason why I am still using Internet Explorer. Edge does not work with Adobe PDF as a printer and the Microsoft Print to PDF creates files that are at least double the size that Adobe creates.</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
Open an elevated command prompt, type in sfc /scannow&nbsp; and press Enter.<br />
<br />
It should scan the system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
More Information about SFC scan can be found in this document: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833<br />
<br />
***Note, if this process shows too much mistakes and cannot correct them, you will have to reinstall Windows 7.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft makes changes on my computer without my consent or knowledge.</h2>
                    <p>Why does Microsoft think they have the right to change settings on my computer without my permission or even knowledge? When I set up a Microsoft account for gaming it changed the name of my windows logon on my computer without asking or even notifying me.
 What is up with that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also is anyone else bothered by the constant ineptitude of Microsoft with regards to changes from one version of Windows to the next? There are many. But just to mention the first that was immediately apparent after switching to windows 10. Scrollbars, especially
 the arrows, can barely be seen and the scrollbar itself disappears during a few seconds pause in use; to get it back you must move the mouse pointer in&nbsp;the scrollbar area. This is especially annoying when using the down/up arrows; you can't just click the
 left mouse button to continue scrolling; you have to move the mouse off the arrow and back on before continuing to scroll after pausing scrolling briefly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I admit this scrollbar issue is a minor one&nbsp;relative to the overall high complexity of an operating system. But it goes to show the utter ineptitude of Microsoft to create a problem out of something of low complexity&nbsp;that has not been an issue for many previous
 OS versions - and&nbsp;just for the sake of creating a interface with a new&nbsp;LOOK? I won't bother with&nbsp;getting into the plethora other isssues. Thinking about them all at once may cause someone to want to harm themselves just&nbsp;to end the misery! LOL</p>

<h2>            Volume Control&#47;Playback Problems.</h2>
                    <p>Hello. Last week, external volume/playback controls stopped working on my Windows 10 desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. My headphones have a volume dial and play/pause buttons. These aren't working.</p>
<p>2. The keyboard has volume buttons and play/pause/stop buttons. These aren't working. The other optional keys (like SLEEP, MY COMPUTER, etc. are working just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can change the volume via the taskbar just fine. It just seems to be the external volume/playback controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can give!</p>

<h2>            Video TDR failure &#40;atikmpag&#41; with a twist</h2>
                    <p>So my computer screen got all glitchy all of a sudden, worked for 5 minutes getting progressively slower until it crashes. After that i couldn't even boot up Windows. At most i can spam f12 on restart until the boot setting appear. Tried installing windows
 10 anew from a USB, didn't work. </p>
<p>If i let it just boot up normally it shows me the blue restrt screen of death and video failure, however every solution i've seen is done on a working computer. How do i fix it if i can't boot up Windows?
</p>
<p>PS. screen is always glitchy, and there's a constant "Input not supported" message floating around (it's not my monitor, i checked it on a laptop)</p>

            What is the make and model of your computer? The error is associated the your video driver for AMD ATI graphics. 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is installed?
<br />
<br />If you can't boot, you can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />If the computer is using a discrete dedicated card, remove it, then connect to an onboard graphics adapter.
<br />
<br />Try booting again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work.
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Startup settings
<br />Click Restart
<br />
<br />Press (4) to Enable Safe Mode
<br />Wait while Windows 10 starts in safe mode.
<br />Log in
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Display Adapter
<br />Right click your Display adapter and click Uninstall
<br />Exit Device Manager
<br />
<br />Restart
<br />
<br />You might need to go to a working computer, download the latest Video Driver for your computer, save it to a thumbdrive. Copy it to the affected computer and install it. If there is no native Windows 10 driver, download the latest Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 video driver and install in compatibility mode.

<br />That is almost always a video device or video driver issue. Be sure to also check the video cable and its connections.
<br />
<br />Can you boot into Safe Mode to try to update the driver?

<br />How to Start Windows 10 in Safe Mode
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2304-boot-into-safe-mode-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2304-boot-i...</a>
<br />
<br />Here is another way to try to get to Safe Mode.
<br />
<br />Boot to the Command Prompt of your boot disk. Enter these BOLD commands and press ENTER after each.
<br />(Note the colon after C with no space; then the spaces which are important - one after T before /  &amp; T before {  &amp; } before B &amp; Y before L)
<br />
<br />C:
<br />
<br />BCDEDIT /SET {DEFAULT} BOOTMENUPOLICY LEGACY
<br />
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />You are back to the boot screen -&gt; Shutdown the computer.
<br />
<br />Boot back up and "immediately" start tapping F8 (That means power button - then F8).
<br />
<br />Hopefully that should get you into Safe Mode. 
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />To reverse that you can use the same steps and type these (again note spaces)
<br />
<br />C:
<br />
<br />BCDEDIT /SET {DEFAULT} BOOTMENUPOLICY STANDARD
<br />
<br />Restart but F8 will not work now.
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />Sounds like an issue with the video device. If it is a separate card, not on the motherboard, remove ALL power the remove and reseat the card - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. If that does not work then if the motherboard also has on-device video you can remove the card and try that. If the system already is using on the motherboard video that can be disabled and an add-in video card used.
<br />
<br />Were you able to get the USB device to boot on the computer? If not check with the System Maker's Support, documentation, and ask in their forums. Usually you would set the boot order in the BIOS (often F2, DEL, or ESC) or by using F12 on some systems.

            Check with the System Maker to enter the BIOS and set boot order there for the USB or DVD you are using to install on. And I would make a new one. It sounds like either your present USB drive is corrupt or the video device has an issue.

<h2>            Black screen</h2>
                    I connected my laptop to my tv using an HDMI cord but I can only see it on the tv. I have a black screen on my laptop but the keyboard and mouse is working. I have tried unplugging my laptop and restarting it but that didn't work. I also tried changing
 the screen settings using the windows button+P but it says PC only but that isn't the case. This is really getting on my nerves and I've already cried over it because I just want to use my laptop without needing to connect it to my tv. I would really appreciate
 it if someone could help me. Thanks!

            Hi EmmaBeck 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

            Hi Emma..
<br />Press Ctrl+Alt+Del and see if it brings up the Task Manager. If it does, great. Click on File &gt; Run new task. Type explorer.exe and hit Enter. Once you've completed the steps, you should be able to use your device normally.This worked for me once when I faced this issue. 
<br />If This Methods Did't Work 
<br />
<br />Try Boot in to Safe Mode 
<br />
<br />You will need to boot into Safe Mode to undo that update, or perform a System Restore. Safe Mode would be best, because your video card device driver does not load in Safe Mode 
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />Do this twice 
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . etc. 
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />
<br /> to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />You should restore/reset your computer using Media Creation Tool. You will have to cut Media creation tool on another computer if you can't do this on your existing computer. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Refer to the section"Use installation media to restore or reset your PC " 
<br />
<br />Recovery options in Windows 10 -
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />Note - You will get the option to keep your files during reset. But it will remove third party apps including Microsoft Office which will need to be reinstalled. Default Windows 10 apps will be automatically installed. But non-defaults Windows 10 apps will need to be reinstalled. 
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work - I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

            Hi Emma
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />First of all, if you have any non-essential hardware attached to your computer apart from mouse and keyboard, disconnect them.
<br />
<br />See if the system boots successfully, if it does not, carry out the following steps
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />
<br />How do you do that?
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, it will then your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />
<br />You might be asked to sign in with your Microsoft Account or Local Account password. 
<br />
<br />**********************************************
<br />
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click System Restore, see if you can go back to an earlier time.
<br />
<br />If not, boot into the recovery environment again, then try performing a startup repair.
<br />
<br />Perform the startup repair a couple more times then restart again to see if you are able to boot to the desktop successfully. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, boot into the recovery environment, then click 'Go back to previous version of Windows' - choose this option if you recently upgraded to a new Windows 10 Feature Update. If this option is not available, you can skip this step. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work.
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Reset this PC
<br />Click Keep my files
<br />Choose your account
<br />Enter your password
<br />Click Continue
<br />Click Reset
<br />
<br />If that does not work.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

            Hi Emma.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you unplug the HDMI cable can you see the image on the laptop screen?  
<br />
<br />If not plug it back into the TV so you can go into Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode accessed by one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>.
<br />
<br />Now unplug HDMI again to see if you see anything on screen. 
<br />
<br />Next Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else works from Safe Mode or using TV screen, System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>

                    I have a WD My Passport which comes up as 'F' drive. I use this for backing up music &amp; photos etc.&nbsp; It appears to be no longer working and it asks me to format it, which I have tried and windows is unable to do this.&nbsp; Problem is I now have lots of music
 in Itunes that is no longer available as original file cannot be found. Does anyone have any ideas how I can get this music back?
