    <title>Activesync and WMDC - do they go together&#63; HELP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Activesync and WMDC - do they go together&#63;  HELP</h2>
                    Hi all.<br />
<br />
I recently decided to use my Dell Axim x5 again.&nbsp; It has Window's Pocket PC 2003 on it, and I already had Activesync 4.5 loaded on it.<br />
<br />
When I tried to attach it to my new laptop, I found out that I&nbsp;needed to get WMDC for the Vista system software on&nbsp;my laptop.&nbsp; But I didn't see anywhere that I needed, or there was, a version for my Dell Axim.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sorry - to get to my question -&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have Activesync on my Dell Axim and WMDC on my Vista laptop.&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In Window's XP I had the same software (activesync) on both to ensure they would sync properly.&nbsp; Now I have two different synchronizing programs - is that correct?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note: With Activesync running and "connected", I can use Windows explorer to find files on the Axim.&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;when I stop running the Activesync program, the device&nbsp;disconnects.<br />
<br />
Also, when I do an install on a program, it seems to interface with activesync and not WMDC.&nbsp; Is this right?<br />
<br />
<br />
And - if anyone knows this answer - on my old PC I had&nbsp;Outlook 2000 (it came with the Dell Axiim software package).&nbsp; On my new laptop, I did buy Office 07 - but the home version - the one without Outlook.&nbsp; Does anyone know if I can install&nbsp;Outlook 2000 on my
 Vista Laptop?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks - and I appreciate any answers I can get - I've been driving myself starry-eyed looking at this today.<br />
<br />
Ken - astra-zenon.&nbsp;
<hr />
had Dell Axim since 2003 - was gone, now back - ?activesync and WMDC? what the???

<br />
<br />
That is correct, when you attached your device to your Vista PC, it (your PC)&nbsp;needs a different version of syncing software than what you used on your XP PC.&nbsp; WMDC does the same thing that Activesync does ... it connects your PC to your device so you can sync
 files (and transfer files manually via File Explorer.<br />
<br />
<div><span>astra-zenon said:</span>
<p>&nbsp;But I didn't see anywhere that I needed, or there was, a version for my Dell Axim.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<br />
Your Axim has its own syncing software built in.<br />
<br />
<div><span>astra-zenon said:</span>
<p><br />

</p>
<br />
<br />
As long as you downloaded and installed&nbsp;WMDC on&nbsp;your Vista laptop, tgen the answer is yes.&nbsp; Remember, your Dell has its syncing software preinstalled and you don't need to think about it.&nbsp; It uses the same name as the "activesync" software that is on your XP
 computer but it is a completely different program.&nbsp;&nbsp;The activesync software on your Dell &nbsp;is only for a mobile device.<br />

<p><br />

</p>
<br />
Remember that activesync on your PC uses the same name as activesync on your device but the PC software is different.&nbsp; Just think of it as using three different pieces of software to sync your device.&nbsp; One is loaded on your device that you cannot change.&nbsp; One
 is on your XP computer that can be upgraded.&nbsp; Current version is activesync 4.5 and one for your Vista machine called WMDC that can also be upgraded ... current version is 6.1.<br />
<br />
<div><span>astra-zenon said:</span>
<p><br />
Note: With Activesync running and "connected", I can use Windows explorer to find files on the Axim.&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;when I stop running the Activesync program, the device&nbsp;disconnects.
</p>
<br />
That is correct.&nbsp; Activesync on your device "talks to" either activesync on your PC or WMDC so the Device and PC can communicate to each other.<br />
<br />
<div><span>astra-zenon said:</span>
<p><br />
Also, when I do an install on a program, it seems to interface with activesync and not WMDC.&nbsp; Is this right?
</p>
<br />
It "interfaces with "activesync" on your device AND with either the PC's activesync (if using the XP machine) or WMDC (if using Vista).&nbsp; There are two programs that need to "talk to each other.&nbsp; One on the device and one on the PC.
<div><span>astra-zenon said:</span>
<p><br />
And - if anyone knows this answer - on my old PC I had&nbsp;Outlook 2000 (it came with the Dell Axiim software package).&nbsp; On my new laptop, I did buy Office 07 - but the home version - the one without Outlook.&nbsp; Does anyone know if I can install&nbsp;Outlook 2000 on my
 Vista Laptop?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<br />
In theory yes, but I highly reccomend you getting Outlook 2007.&nbsp; Even thogh it is supposedly compatible, I think there are folks that have issues.&nbsp; It is not worth the potential issue besides Outlook 2007 is SO MUCH better.<br />

When the Acer is attached to your computer, does Media Player see the device?&nbsp; It should and you should be able to move tunes to your device.

<p>Windows Media player for PDAs is not available for download. You should check your device manufacturer's website&nbsp;for any updates. Remember That WMP is built into the OS, therefore a simple upgrade won't do. On the
 contrary, if such an update exists, it will require re-flashing your device to install it.</p>

    <title>Guest User access to SharePoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pgadzinski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Guest User access to SharePoint</h2>
                    <p>I have had issues with colleagues being able to login to my SharePoint site as guest users. I share the page with them and they receive a message from Microsoft, but they are not able to login. There are two types of users here, one is a corporate user who
 works for Delta Airlines. The other type is a private user. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My first question is under what type of account should the user login with. They are usually given a choice of something like a work or school account or their own personal account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My second question is, has anyone ever had a major corporate client that has had difficulty sharing a site, even though their work e-mail is linked to an Office 365 account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, any help would be appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand your situation and provide help for you, please help confirm some information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How did you share the page with external users? Could you please share the steps and some related screenshots with me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What are the external sharing settings in your organization? You can check settings of two levels refer to this article:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/turn-external-sharing-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Turn external sharing on or off for SharePoint Online</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. For the users cannot be able to login, are there any error messages? </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. For the second question, could you please share the situation with me? For example, what is "their work e-mail is linked to an Office 365 account"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>

<h2>            Isn&#39;t it time for 5800 to get it&#39;s official widgets from Nokia &#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all 5800 owners ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the phone is out and all owners want the widgets like other Symbian 5th Editions phones but Nokia didn't enclode this update to it's official firmware for 5800 one of the best phones from Nokia ever...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All 5800 owners know that 5800 got it's unofficial widgets from group of devolpers by modifing Nokia C6 firmware to be able to work with 5800 and it's amazing job from them because they add the most wantet feature from 5800 owners and also for free and with
 a tiny bugs which already Nokia bugs from the original firmware of C6 and i am using it and also added it to 4 of my friends and working like it's the original firmware for 5800</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Nokia , Isn't it time for 5800 to get it's official widgets from you with a new firmware ?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope i get reply from any one and till Nokia listen to 5800 owners i will use this modified firmware which is amazing and made the phone alive again .....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every day i know one of my friends get it's new 5800 so the phone is still selling so i think that nokia should improve the phone a little bit and it will be sold more</p>

            Hi Apepril 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Check both the fields on following and see whether result is same
<br />=ISNUMBER(A2)
<br />=LEN(A2)
<br />
<br />If both are same, then you will get the right results. If not, you would need to take appropriate action.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.
        </p>

<p>Can't see your spreadsheet or values but as you can see from the image below the formula in cell D4 is a VLOOKUP without the double minus which gives the error, but the formula in D5 works OK with the double minus. B2 and G2 look the same but they are not.</p>

    <title>W10 System and compressed memory feature is killing my RAM - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            W10 System and compressed memory feature is killing my RAM</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my HP Pavilion m9077c computer from W8.1 64-bit to the W10 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, I had been running 32-bit versions, but I wanted to take advantage of the 6 Gb of RAM in my computer.&nbsp; Running the W8.1 version 64-bit allowed me to run my 3D autocad programs and only use 50% of RAM with Firefox running in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when I look at my RAM usage via Task Master,&nbsp; System and compressed memory is taking up over 1000 Mb and my RAM usage is running at 75%
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">without doing any 3D rendering</span>! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless this feature can be controlled, I am considering rolling back to W8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions?</p>

            <p>I run Task Manager all the time and monitor my RAM.&nbsp; The point is, the System and compressed memory is taking up more RAM that when I run a 3D rendering program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it does change over time.&nbsp; This morning when I wrote this question my RAM was at 75% &amp; 1000 MB, now my RAM is 72% with 895 MB used by this program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This program is a memory hog and although my 64-bit system can access more RAM than before, I am using more RAM than my 32-bit system (4 GB limit) uses when I am running an autocad program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I stated in my original posting, I probably have more RAM access in W8.1 since this program is not included in the OS system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still looking for suggestions or is rollback to W8.1 my only solution?</p>

            <p>Part of the idea is to compress items in ram and hold it there so it doesn't need to be peeled off the hard drive when and if&nbsp;needed again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If some other process needs ram it releases the storage to make room for the new&nbsp;as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel wasteful right now I have been reading online so long and have way too much unused ram.</p>
<p>Almost wish it was holding frequently visited&nbsp;web pages in that&nbsp;unused ram&nbsp;space.&nbsp; Not getting my moneys worth out of the ram...&nbsp; if I'm not using it.</p>

<h2>            excel sum formula trouble</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I apologise if there is an obvious solution that I'm missing, but I have struggled with a particular calculation that I am attempting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish to multiply an athlete's average heat score (AHS) across seasons/years by the number of heats in which they have competed for that year, then find the average by dividing this amount by the total number of heats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See below:</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>I clumsily tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUM((B3*C3),(D3*E3),(F3*G3),(H3*I3),(J3*K3),(L3*M3))/SUM(C3,E3,G3,I3,K3,M3) for cell N3 (#VALUE) to find the career average for Athlete 1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously a simple formula would calculate that the career average for Athlete 1 = 2*9.7 (19.4) + 2*7.14 (14.28) / 4 (total heats), i.e. 8.42
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But things get more complicated when there are athletes with more events across more seasons. I also want to build the formula so that it updates the average as 2018 data is entered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is with noting that all of the cells from B3 to M4 draw their data from a primary spreadsheet using an index/match formula, i.e. they are not just cells with a value entered. I'm not sure if this is having an impact on my success?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance...</p>

            Your data layout doesn't help you much - it would be much simpler if it were arranged in three columns with each row containing player, year, heats.
<br />
<br />Here is an ARRAY formula that works for your layout. As an array formula, you have to enter it with CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER, not just ENTER. IF you do it right it will appear in the formula bar surrounded by braces { and }.
<br />
<br />=SUMPRODUCT(IF(MOD(COLUMN(B2:L2)-COLUMN(B2),2)=0,IF(B2:L2,B2:L2)),IF(MOD(COLUMN(C2:M2)-COLUMN(C2),2)=0,IF(C2:M2,C2:M2)))/SUM(IF(MOD(COLUMN(C2:M2)-COLUMN(C2),2)=0,IF(C2:M2,C2:M2)))

<p>Encode your 3GP video with the H.263 video codec and audio codec to AAC or AMR (AMR sounds terrible but will play. AAC is supported on majority of Nokia phones.). Looks awful but it will definitely play on your Asha 201. I use H.263 video codecs on both
 mp4 and 3gp if ever MPEG-4 or H.264 fails to play on my device.&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi, sorry for reviving such an old thread but I bought a Asha 201 this last christmas and when I run into the same problem discussed on this thread I googled for detailed specs about what this model was capable of play and basically it brought me nowhere
 but here wich&nbsp;didn't solve my problem&nbsp;so I spent about a week messing around till get it to&nbsp;work&nbsp;so I think it could&nbsp;be&nbsp;helpfull to share my findings here because I believe there can be more people interested and this also could apply to other similar models
 not just the Asha 201.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ok, so this phone is able to play several types of files, there are lots of combinations&nbsp;but basically to keep it simple this phone&nbsp;is most notably&nbsp;capable of&nbsp;playing this&nbsp;three types of files:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3gp files with h263 video and amr-wb audio</p>
<p>avi files with mpeg4 video and mp3 audio</p>
<p>mp4 files with h264 video and aac audio</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not interested in the first two, the first one is totally obsolete nowdays, it only has suport for a limited number of resolutions (for this phone 176x144 or 128x96) and even at lossless settings it doesn't look very good, yes it does work but just as
 the other user said is something to use only as last resort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the second one has the mayor advantage&nbsp;over the other two that it does actually support the native resolution of the device (320x240) however in the other hand just to clarify the mpeg4 video here is mpeg4 part 2, this is the old fashion divx for example,
 wich still in use have been actually clearly superseded by h264 so I haven't put many time in this however if you want to give this&nbsp;option a try you can try targeting your&nbsp;videos&nbsp;at a bitrate of around 384 kbps at a resolution of 320x240 and for the audio
 try using 24 KHz stereo mp3 at 80 kbps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the third one even if on this device is very restricted (as I'll tell bellow) to me is the most interesting&nbsp;here and the one I'll mainly talk about on this post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so basically after some days messing around with this&nbsp;the requisites I found for the phone to just attempt to play h264 video are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>baseline profile and a maximiun of&nbsp;99 macroblocks (don't worry about the tech stuff, to make it simple that just result in a maximiun resolution of 176x132 in aspect 4:3 or 192x108 in aspect 16:9)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>anything outside that the device refuse just&nbsp;to attemp to play&nbsp;it (just doesn't support it), it's very disapointing to find that the device can't play h264 video&nbsp;at its native resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but well anyways, like I'm saying that's what a h264 video must be for the phone to attemp to play, however one thing is what&nbsp;a device attemps to play and another what&nbsp;a device can actually really play, so after some more tests what I basically found this
 phone to be is a h264 baseline level 1b player it can play at other levels (it's not capped on that sense as it's on the profile and the macroblocks) however it seems that for it to work properlly it has to stay around that level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so for you guys to make it simple that result on the following conditions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>maximiun rate: 1485 macroblock/s (this is, a maximun of 15 fps at the maximun 4:3 resolution 176x132 or a maximiun of around 17.678 fps at the maximun 16:9 resolution 192x108)</p>
<p>maximiun bitrate: this is not really clear, by specs for a device like this, 1b baseline, this should be 128 kbps however the device benefits from a higher bitrate and it seems to play it properlly, the best option here is to experiment for yourself however
 it seems safe to asume that the device is able to play at bitrates between 128 and 384 kbps like I said try till you get a desired quality and if you you find problems simply decrease the bitrate till it works smooth</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>well that's all for the video again what's about the audio part in videos? yeah, the device is capable of playing almost any audio song, but does it when in a video? the answer is no, audio alone the phone plays almost anything but when in a video very high
 audio settings can also mess the video, again unfortunately virtually no info has been released about so after tests what the requisites I found for audio in mp4 file with the above described h264 are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>maximun rate: 24 KHz</p>
<p>maximun bitrate: 80 kbps</p>
<p>maximun channels: 2 (stereo)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so that's all with that you should be able to create videos for your Nokia Asha 201 with any conversor of your choice, after all I must say the result is not bad at all, I tested this very same thing I'm talking about with about a dozen of clips and I would
 at least say the Nokia Asha 201 is&nbsp;it's a decent mp4 player to me, don't expect diamond sharp bibrant video with bright audio but in general after all it looks good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>now just for your convenience I'll provide a practical example of how to do this (wich is also how I do it). I use a command line tool called ffmpeg, you can get it here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win32/static/ffmpeg-latest-win32-static.7z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win32/static/ffmpeg-latest-win32-static.7z</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>once uncompressed that with that on your command line you can run these to get the videos for 4:3 and 16:9 resolution respectively:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>for %p in (1 2) do @ffmpeg -i&nbsp;input.avi -r 30000/2002&nbsp;-vf "scale=176x132,pad=176:144:0:6" -aspect 11:9 -c:v h264 -profile:v baseline -level:v 1b -b:v 384k -pass %p -c:a libvo_aacenc -profile:a aac_low -ar 24k -b:a 80k -y output.mp4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>for %p in (1 2) do @ffmpeg -i&nbsp;input.avi -r 48000/3003 -vf "scale=192x108,pad=192:112:0:2" -aspect 12:7 -c:v h264 -profile:v baseline -level:v 1b -b:v 384k -pass %p -c:a libvo_aacenc -profile:a aac_low -ar 24k -b:a 80k -y output.mp4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ok, hope that helps</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 crashes on startup</h2>
                    So this is different from the other crash on startup scenarios. When I start the program I get a dialog box that says "Microsoft outlook has stopped working". The program does not even attempt to load up and I cannot get past the startup screen. When I
 boot in safe mode the exact same thing happens. I updated office today and the same exact thing happens. Should I uninstall and reinstall? Help!

    <title>Certificate Problems when accessing Google related sites in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> duality  say:</h3>
<h2>            Certificate Problems when accessing Google related sites in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>I recently moved from Windows XP to Windows 7 using a dual boot method while I make my migration, and it seems that accessing any Google related site with any browser in Windows 7 results in very long connection issues. &nbsp;When trying to connect via Chrome,
 I get an error message that says "Unable to check whether the server's certificate has been revoked." &nbsp;The error message and slow connection happen only in Windows 7. &nbsp;If I reboot to Windows XP then there are no problems. &nbsp;And again, the slow connection happens
 with all browsers.</p>
<p>I've ruled out my internet connection b/c everything is fine in Windows XP (I'm on a Fiber connection), and also my Date &amp; Time are correct. &nbsp;I am also not using a proxy.</p>
<p>Has anything changed between XP and 7 regarding the use/management of Certificates that may be causing this problem? &nbsp;Widows 7 is up-to-date with the exception of un-needed Office updates.</p>

            turns out it was an issue with IPv6. &nbsp;Figured that out while running Ubuntu in Virtualbox and comparing ethernet settings. &nbsp;After I disabled TCP/IPv6 access to google became normal. &nbsp;I'm not sure what the problem is though b/c I know for sure my broadband
 provider supports IPv6 and the router states it does as well.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>In the end I figured out that the issue lays with my broadband router/modem. &nbsp;Although technically IPv6 should work with it. &nbsp;I need to call my provider and ask them what the settings are for my particular network type. &nbsp;Although super fast, Japan's internet
 system is too darn complicated.</p>
<p>To sum up, if you are having slow access to Google or other HTTPS sites, check if your modem/router supports IPv6 and if not, then either turn off IPv6 for your network device (Network Settings in Control Panel) or get a modem/router that supports IPv6.</p>
<p>If you turn off IPv6 in network settings, you'll lose the ability to make HomeGroups, but if you don't require that functionality then no problems.</p>

    <title>How to change the font color for appointments - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to change the font color for appointments</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used installed some themes from Total Access and now when I look at a day in my calendar only the selected appointment shows. It appears the problem is the font color. When the appointment is not selected the text blends with the white background. Once
 the appointment is in the past, the font turns grey and I can see it just fine. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I fix it?</p>

            <span>Whilst looking for a solution to change the font color, if you elect to use back the original themes, can you then see the appointments? If so, then it is the font color as you said, and it would be easier
 to select another theme, because there do not appear to be any such font changes selection for the wm6 calendar...<br />
<br />
Anyway, we have to be aware that different themes / backgrounds focus on the appearance only and may not be compatible on functionality with other programs, as you have pointed out....<br />
<br />
Unless you are willing to go for registry hacks...<br />

<p>Yes, when I put the original theme back the appointments show up as I would expect them to show. I have realized that the home page font is white on the new themes and black on the Windows Default scheme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a hack that will allow me to change the font color or even the background color of the daily&nbsp;appointment list? How do I find specific instructions on applying hacks?</p>

            <span>I would not advise registry hacks for this situation, as it involves coordination issues with the other running programs.<br />
<br />
Even with themes taken from Total Access ( a microsoft site ?), especially not part of the standard installation package gives rise to such a problem. I have also experienced a similar problem with my PC when using a different theme.&nbsp; The white characters were
 certainly invisible on a white background. Highlighting with the cursor also failed to work. The problem simply went away when I selected other themes...
<br />
<br />
Why not try another theme with a similar background color ?<br />
But if you must, then any expert reading this thread care to assist ?<br />

Well, with the removed addresses, the question flow is off,&nbsp;&nbsp; but, I use outlook.com as my primary setup.&nbsp; It works fine.&nbsp; You're probably asking a variant question...

            <p>it is actually my personal wish to have the other 2nd address to be converted as set as my permanent ms account/passport as the ms account/passport name i chose was not a common meaningful one for me. i wish to use the 2nd address as a catch all address
 for different usernames that were used before under the same domain. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have no idea how to do that. first, if i choose close account on my ms account/passport address, would it render all my mail on the 2nd address destroyed/inaccessible? then also would i be able to apply to convert the 2nd address as another unique passport/ms
 account, and just ditch the first one, as im having problems getting the windows phone 8 to directly access the 2nd address, which i always have to switch the interface via menu to access after i login to outlook.com using passport/ms account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i was also strangely suggested by some techie to manually set the server address using advanced setup so the phone can connect to my other 2nd outlook.com address (under my domain). i have yet to experiement to confirm if this is a solution. however, i felt
 quite annoyed that in windows phone 8, under email account setup, i seem to only get it talk to my outlook.com account (the ms account account) by setting a HOTMAIL type mail account instead of the so called OUTLOOK (with description being outlook.com/office365)
 etc. that seems a tad misleading?!</p>

            <p>I have to admit that the above description is as confusing to me as the first post of yours :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's see if I got it right. You have two Microsoft accounts. just to be on the same page, 'Microsoft account' is the new official catch all term for all the accounts that may be live.com, Hotmail.com, outlook.com, office 365 or any other MS related service
 account. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have two accounts. Lets call them MS1 and MS2. As of now, MS1 is the main account on your phone and MS2 is what you are unable to setup on your phone as a secondary email account. You want to get rid of MS1 and start using MS2 as the primary on the phone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming that I have paraphrased your issue properly, here is the solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Reset your phone. settings &gt; about &gt; reset. </p>
<p>2. When the phone comes back, it will be just like it is out of box. This time setup the phone using your MS2 account. There you go, MS2 became your primary account and whatever it has, like contacts, email, calendar will start working automatically :)</p>
<p>3. About your MS1 account. You can either stop using it. Or you could simply setup AUTO -FORWARD all your emails from the MS1 account to the MS2 account. This way, you will be access all your MS1 stuff on the phone through your MS2, without actually having
 to setup MS1 on the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Drop-Down Content Control</h2>
                    <p>I have inserted a drop-down content control into my document in MS Word 2016 (pretty much same as 2013). I have two options for a user to select from the drop-down list. I want to copy and link whatever has been selected by user from the drop-down content
 control to another location in a document&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: So, if from two options from the drop-down list, one being: "James" and other being "Roger", a user chooses "James", I want to have such result (e.g. "James") to show up in another location in the document under a sentence:
<em>James likes to eat apples</em> (or if chosen Roger, then the sentence would be like:
<em>Roger likes to eat apples</em>.</p>
<p>

    <title>MS Access Database as Default Email Application&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MS Access Database as Default Email Application&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On an Azure RDS server, I have an application that generates PDF files (reports) to be distributed via email. I've built an Access database which applies business rules and delivers the files, but the workflow would work better if the Access database could
 be made to respond to an OLEDB request from the application, and pop up in response to it, instead of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to put it another way, I've used Access to create a custom email application on a server, and I would like it to somehow be the default email application and replace Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this doable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't understand this part. What does OLEDB have to do with emails?<br />
Making Access "respond" to incoming emails is not possible, unless you go to extremes. Access also is not a word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation software. We have separate applications for a reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access can be used to control Outlook via Automation, and can thus respond to Outlook events such as incoming emails.</p>

            <p>Err, I meant OLE, not OLEDB. When Outlook is set to be the default email program, an OLE command can be used to send an email, but if Thunderbird was the default, the same commands would work against it. Any number of other email programs would be the same
 deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that msaccess.exe could be shimmed in there with parameters for the database name, and then code within the database to decode the incoming parameters from the calling application which gives to, from, attachments, subject, message, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, finally, if not that, maybe I could write a c# stub that would act as the OLE target, and then pass off the incoming data to the database, if not handle it right within c#, but then, the question becomes, how do I create my own app, and set it as the
 default email application?</p>

    <title>Scan to Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charleswright1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scan to Outlook</h2>
                    I installed a hp officejet pro 6978 printer. I run windows 10 and use office 2010. Everything works except when I attempt to scan to outlook. 2 hp techs attempted to help, even attempting to make outlook my default recipient for scans without success.
 When they consulted their community pages, other have had the some problem. The result: problem not with the printer, but with outlook. An attempt to repair outlook did not work. I had no problem with my previous hp j6400 series in this regard. It worked perfectly.
 Any suggestions?

<p>Hello Charles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It could be the email setting's configuration needs to be corrected. We would like to ask for additional information. Please provide the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which Outlook version are you using, is it Outlook Web Application or Outlook on desktop?</li><li>Are you using an <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-are-IMAP-and-POP-ca2c5799-49f9-4079-aefe-ddca85d5b1c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you run Outlook in safe mode on the computer if you're using the Outlook application. You may check this

<p>Hello friend and thanks for you reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using outlook that in part of Home and Office 2010 on my laptop. Using a POP exchange. My wife's lab top is connected and when I tried to scan it would not give the dialogue box of options to send the scan. I disabled an add-in that was not Microsoft
 related. Still no change. An online tech from hp said he believed the problem is with Microsoft because the printer isn't recognizing that Outlook is available. The only way I can send a scanned document is to first save it into a file, then open Outlook and
 attach to the email. Is that the only way to send a scanned document on the 6970 series? That is an extra step that I did not have with hp J6400 series. Any additional thoughts?<br />

<h2>            Microsoft 359 on tablet transfered on computer&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Asus tablet that came with an activation code for Microsoft office mobile/359. My question is can I use the same product on my computer without paying for a new license.

    <title>6233 Battery Time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bangsjaman  say:</h3>
<h2>            6233 Battery Time</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
Can it be true that I can only make the battery last for less than 2 days?<br />
That happens even if I only send a few messages, and not using camera, bluetooth, GPRS...<br />
<br />
And another thing, has anyone experienced that the phone is loosing time?<br />
After a week it is almost 5 minutes behind. Then I adjusted the time, and then it was behind again a few days later.<br />
<br />

            Yeah I know, but that is almost never correct, so I wanted to hear the experience IRL.<br />
<br />
I think there is a big difference between 340 hours and 48 hours.

            3G as default..but my 48 hours is without any talk time..(or very little).<br />
As I understand 3G will only use more battery than 2G when you talk?<br />
<br />
But there must be something wrong, if nobody else have low batterytime and the problem with time running to slow..

            No, 3G will use more even when not making calls. All digital system are constantly communicating even if you dont see it and 3G is more power hungry than 2G. Have you done your first three full charges properly?

            The Power consumption can not be that much higher. Then they should have written if 3G only has a standby time for for instance 300 hours...<br />
<br />
Yes the battery has been fully charged and discharged several times. And that is almost the only thing I do..

            You're right, in theory the standby times in optimum conditions are not that much less for 3G than 2 G, but as no one yet has a fully optimized and functioning 3G network yet and coverage is nowhere near as good as we expect for a 2G system the phone will
 always be working much harder in 3G than 2G. You are far more likely to be in the margins of a cellsite on 3G than 2G and signal strenghts tend to be lower almost everywhere because of the patchy coverage. The other issue is the work the phone has to do handing
 over between 2 and 3G that a lot of people don't notice when in dual mode. Having said all that your battery life, assuming all is equal and you are in a good service area, is lower than I have seen for that model, but only a bit!. Having used 1 myself I get
 7 days on 2G and 3 on 3G!

 think I updated AVG to 2012. I bought a repair system today prior to seeing your mail and it has as you predicted not shifted it. It has modified it but it pops up every time I go into an e mail and click on a link. &nbsp;Not being an expert is reinstalling window
 something I will find in the computer or will I need some new discs. &nbsp;Once again thanks for your time. &nbsp;Nick

            <p>Please answer all of the following diagnostic questions by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. What anti-virus application was installed <em>before you <u>first</u> install AVG Free</em>, was your subscription still current, and did you uninstall it before you installed AVG Free?</p>
<p>2. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on this computer?</p>
<p>3. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>4. Open Add/Remove Programs &amp; make sure the Show Updates box at the top is checked (and leave it checked); then select the Name option in the Sort by box on the right. Now scroll down &amp; tell me if ALL of the following updates are listed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • KB2586448, KB2567053; KB2570947, <em>KB2607712 and/or KB2616676</em>; KB2567680, KB2544521, KB2393802 &amp; KB971029</p>
<p>Most will be displayed as "Security Update for Windows XP" followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>If IE7 is installed, two will be displayed as "Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 7" followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>

            If your university email is an Exchange account - you'll need to contact your Exchange Admin (IT dept) to get the required information.
