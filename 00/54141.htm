 commands from cmd but it doesn't detect my phone .. what happens is when i attach my phone in fastboot mode i get a connection sound but as soon as i try to perform a cmd command i get the disconnect sound and then my phone is not recognized .. then i have
 to reboot my fastboot mode and then i try it again and same happens.. i have installed adb drivers&nbsp; multiple time but no luck,.. i also tried the exact adb drivers from my phone specific forum and it still doesn't works.. i have tried to clean install windows

I use Skype video messages for leaving replay for my clients, I need at least 3 minutes to send them some value! What can I do now?</p>

            I wouldn't be able to tell you to be honest. The new Skype has introduced so many changes and removed so many familiar ones without any notice of whether they will be added back.
<br />
<br />Right now, its best you send in Feedback to the engineers to let them know about your desire to have this feature.

    <title>Confirmation dialogs open behind Explorer window - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tastentier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Confirmation dialogs open behind Explorer window</h2>
                    <p>Since the anniversary update, Explorer confirmation dialogs like asking for admin permission often open behind the parent window. This is especially annoying since some dialogs,&nbsp;such as the UAC confirmation window after double-clicking a *.reg file, don't
 show up in the task bar, so there is no visual feedback as to why the Explorer window is suddenly unresponsive. There is also no obvious way of activating the dialog window in this case. I eventually figured out that Alt+Tab brings the dialog to the foreground,
 but it's still bothersome. Is there any fix for this?</p>

            <p>Aha - right! I verify moving that slider down&nbsp;one notch&nbsp;will set PromptOnSecureDesktop to 0, &amp; the UAC will no longer open on an empty desktop (or "secure desktop", as the article I posted puts it). Then, it is as you said. Clicking a .reg in Explorer did
 sound a tone - but the UAC was nowhere to be seen until Alt+TAB was pressed! I saw no icon for it on the Taskbar, either. You really shouldn't be doing that, anyway, as it lessens the level of security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, that should solve the UAC problem - don't do that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>At "R-Clk START, Control Panel, User Accounts, Change User Account Control Settings"...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5b2fa37-6f70-435a-b54a-ce8839fde418" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5b2fa37-6f70-435a-b54a-ce8839fde418" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that's the worst of it. The other instances of hidden requestors put an icon in the Taskbar, don't they? I think I have seen such behavior infrequently. It likely is only curable by some future MSFT fix. The older the software, the more likely the
 ill behavior.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>The security level of the two middle settings is the same except for the desktop dimming effect, but you're right that this solves the UAC dialog issues. Now the problem comes down to Explorer confirmation dialogs regarding file deletion, file replacement,
 administrator permission and so on. Plus settings windows like Sound that open child windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To confirm that this bug still exists under the default UAC setting, I placed a file and a folder on the desktop and copied the file into the folder. Then I rebooted the PC, because this bug reliably occurs in the first Explorer window that I open after
 a boot. I opened the folder, dragged the file from the desktop into the folder to trigger the "Replace or skip files" dialog, and it opened behind the Explorer window.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I noted that this only occurs when the Explorer window is so large that it covers the center of the screen, where the confirmation dialog pops up. So one workaround for me is to make the window smaller and drag it to one side of the screen. Since the
 OS saves the position, the next Explorer instance opens in the same spot. I can live with this for now and reinstall Windows 10 at some point when I have nothing better to do. I originally installed it over Win 8.1, so maybe a fresh installation wouldn't be
 bad idea anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happily, I reproduced the described procedure (large window,&nbsp;reboot) &amp; did not suffer your outcome...</p>

<p>
</p><p>But I note you say it doesn't always occur. I can get it to be behind the File Explorer window by clicking an empty space in the window. Then it can be retrieved by pointing to Explorer's icon on the Taskbar...</p>
<p>

<h2>            When installing Git I get error 183 for every folder it tries to create</h2>
                    <p>When attempting to install Git after previously using its supplied uninstaller it
<a href="https://puu.sh/jkAq6.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Image of the error">
throws out an Error 183</a> for <a href="https://puu.sh/jkBBH.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
every folder it tries to create</a>, but if I manually make the directory the installer is able to continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I was fine with just running mkdir for every single folder, but I quickly realized that it has an enormous amount of folders and that would take an eternity. I undid my changes by simply deleting the Git folder in explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little bit later though, I tried running the installer again; I got the same error, manually made the Git folder in Program Files (x86), but for a little bit it worked like the installer should (imagine that), until it got to where I gave up with making
 the directories where it began giving the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After giving up again, this time I deleted the Git folder with del instead of through explorer. I again tried the installer later but this time found error 183 once again being thrown for every folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am here looking for help in&nbsp;<em>completely</em> deleting the Git folder, which the uninstaller and del seem not to do, so I can reinstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I already ran Error Checking on my hard drive, it said there were no errors found.</p>

<h2>            Shared account, possible terms infringement</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I saw the latest update on Xbox's terms. There, I found out that sharing your account with someone else may&nbsp;infringe the community rules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, immediately, deleted my profile from one friend's Xbox One S as I didn't feel comfortable sharing it longer. Then, he asked me to give it him back, I said no and showed him the multiple consequences of sharing a profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, he still wants me to give my account details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you kindly help me in order to show him how dangerous it can be to share it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking forward to your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yours faithfully, Miguel Marmolejo.</p>

            If you haven't already, you may want to change your password as well. It's actually not a new policy. It's always been a violation of rules to share account information. You should have him read the Code of Conduct and warn him that he could have his account
 and/or his console banned for violating those rules.&nbsp;

<p>Hey Miguel Marmolejo</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to post this on the Xbox Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it has been stated above: because information personal to your Xbox Live subscription will thereafter be available to you via the Xbox Live, you are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Microsoft Account password and account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account on the Xbox Live. Microsoft will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your account, either with or without your
 knowledge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you could be held liable for losses incurred by Microsoft or another party due to someone else using your account. You may not use anyone else’s account at any time, without the permission of the account holder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is all explicitly mentioned in the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/legal/xboxComTOU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Terms of Use</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember, access to your account means that they have access the email that was originally created with your account [Outlook, Hotmail, MSN, etc].
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once someone is in your account they can have control to use your account for making purchases. It is worth noting that unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes it a very touchy subject when sharing accounts and therefore I would recommend that you be very careful when attempting any sort of sharing of accounts</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you violate these terms, we may stop providing Services to you or we may close your Microsoft account.</p>
        </p>

<p>100% bad idea to share accounts.&nbsp; If they have your account on their system, or know your credentials, they can just start charging items to your account.&nbsp; That's not cool, and you don't ever want to give someone the chance to do that, even if they're your
 friend, y'all ain't married. Don't have a shared bank account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, think about this, if he signs in as your account, or, just that your account is active on the system, and he does something to get banned, your account might be affected as well.&nbsp; There are tons of other implications that can negatively impact
 you that far outweigh any benefit you might get from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, don't just not share your account details, add <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12408/microsoft-account-how-to-use-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
two-factor authentication to your account.</a>&nbsp; Change your account password, to boot.&nbsp; LOCK IT DOWN.&nbsp; Security is no joke, and it can cause so many headaches if your account is compromised, even if it's just with a friend.&nbsp; You don't know who else might play
 on his console.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had to stop myself from rambling on and on about so many different reasons you shouldn't share your account, and why you should add additional security.&nbsp; I can't stress it enough.</p>

=================================================<br />
Are you saying the filename is&nbsp;&nbsp; NDVD.bmp?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If_Yes_you can open the file in any image editor and...save as / .jpg.<br />
<br />
Have you tried opening the file in Paint?<br />

            Hi, PK33IC
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to repair your internet connection
<br />
<br />Restore all network adapters to repair your connection.
<br />
<br />Open the network and Internet settings in the Configuration application.
<br />
<br />The quickest way to do this is to right-click or long press the network icon in the notification tray and choose "Open network and Internet settings". The network icon looks different if you have an active cable connection or a wireless connection. The menu that opens is the same. Choose open network settings and the Internet.
<br />
<br />On the left side of the Network and Internet settings window, make sure you are in the Status category. Then, to the right, scroll to the end of the configuration list. There, you should see a link called "Restart the network." Click or tap on it.
<br />
<br />The Configuration application opens a view called Network Restart, which tells you that "This will remove and then reinstall all your network adapters, and will set other network components to their original settings. You may need to reinstall other software of networks, such as VPN, client software or virtual switches.
<br />
<br />If you agree with all that and want to continue restarting your network adapters, click or touch Reset now.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 asks you to confirm that you want to reset your network adapters. If you do so, click or touch Yes.
<br />
<br />If you went ahead and chose to reset your network adapters, Windows 10 informs you that your computer or device shuts down in 5 minutes. Close the notification and save whatever you are working on before this timer expires.
<br />

<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

<p>
</p><p>I killed GWX in task manager</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still when i go to install the 80 or so updates it still starts off downloading win 10 upgrade, so i cannot update all the 80 windows updates i need to</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I did'nt see anything in hidden updates,hidden folders are set to show.</p>
<p>I also killed tasks in task scheduler&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the updates to download i saw KB3035583 i unchecked it but it still says downloading win 10 update.</p>
<p>I looked at the size of it and it doesn't appear very large.</p>
Update for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems (KB3035583)Download size: 685 KB - 784 KB<br />
<br />
<p>Checking information it say it is an update for windows 8.1<br />
In checking further it seems its not actually downloading win 10 but this<br />
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3035583.<br />
Should i just let it download and then all the other 80 downloads can proceed?<br />
Thanks<br />
</p>
<p>I went back again to updates , unchecked KB3035583 &nbsp;the 80 updates dropped to 79, i went to install updates and it said downloading windows 10, so i don't know if what i said above applies or if it is actually downloading windows 10.</p>
<p>This is so annoying , i am no computer whiz and i am getting confused going around in circles.</p>

<h2>            Ideapad Z570 does not shutdown after installing Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hey, I have a Lenovo Z570 laptop and recently installed Windows 8. However, even during installation and after installation the computer does not manage to shut down properly. Though the screen turns bank, the LEDs continue to illuminate and the hard disk
 continues to run. I am not sure what the problem is and I have already installed Windows with a clean boot twice. Unchecking the 'Load Windows faster' option does not seem to work. I would appreciate some answers.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details: The laptop has normal factory settings. (It has been reset and yet the problem persists)</p>

            HI, nave the same Lenovo Z570 and with win 7 it used to work fine, after installing win8 and all the dirvers...&nbsp; the same issues...
<br />
<br />
1) it wont&nbsp; go to sleep mode<br />
2) it wont hibernate,<br />
3) it wont shout down,<br />
4) it wont reboot.<br />
<br />
had installed a fresh new 1TB hdd suspecting the supplied 500GB must have some issues,
<br />
<br />
only win 8 and all drivers installed on new HDD, no other software... still the same issues.<br />
<br />
anybody there who can provide any resolution to this...<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<p>
</p><p>Speaking of the death of WLM, anyone have a good alternative?&nbsp; I tried T'bird and didn't like it.&nbsp; Probably means knuckling-under and 'graduating' to Outlook (bloat-bloat).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further to this thread, however, my one Microsoft POP mail account only quite recently quit working on WLM 2011 running under Vista.&nbsp; After confirming the settings and trying some things suggested on 'third party' forums, I was about to give up.&nbsp; But then
 had an idea.&nbsp; I changed my WLM setting From: <em>Log on using clear text authentication
</em>To: <em>Log on using secure password authentication</em>.&nbsp; I hit Save and gave it a try.&nbsp; No go; in fact, the error screen came up immediately, not after the usual delay from checking with the server.&nbsp; So I changed it back again and, voila, now it works.&nbsp;
 Go figure. </p>

            <p>All well and good, geekdom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like WLM, and have no doubt that it will run under Win10 (most everything does... so far), but according to the download site, support ends this coming January.&nbsp; That begs the question of the TLS compliance and perhaps further security issues down the
 road.&nbsp; I can't foresee effort on the part of MS to come up with patches and fixes after the formal end of support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then many of us were disappointed that WLM never did have any real support during its normal lifetime.&nbsp; There were bugs in the program that had users going nuts, with endless threads on MS and other forums, yet never a 'fix'.&nbsp; (My own lengthy complaint
 was the well-known issue of WLM stripping certain inline images and making them individual attachments.)&nbsp; If you go over to the OEM arm of MS, where Windows Essentials is still shown as active and available, the instructions say that WLM is for Win7 only,
 although the other applications in the suite are suggested for Win8 and Win8.1.&nbsp; No mention of Win10, even though the OEM Webpage shows a 2016 copyright.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when this old Luddite is finally forced, kicking and screaming, to "upgrade" to Win10, it seems pure folly to pollute a strong and stable operating system with a mail program that was considered by its creators as second-rate, at best.</p>

</p><p>We can see here that you are getting an error message when starting your Windows. There are several factors why you are experiencing this issue. To isolate this concern, did you perform a system restore as per the advised of
<strong>Eugene deV</strong> on this thread? You also mentioned that you performed a clean boot, did you experience the same problem?</p>

 it says there's a problem. I tried restoring a few hours ago only to have it stuck on "finalizing" for 3 hours. Now, when I try to restore, it says I can't because I need to turn on system protection. I can't continue to Windows 10 from the menu as well because
 it goes into a "Preparing Automatic Repair" loop. It's stuck on the startup menu and I've basically tried everything on it.</span>

            <p>hey,</p>
<p>Normally your personal data of a user account would be in the following folder:</p>
<p><strong>C:/Windows.old/users/&lt;your username&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Then you can there find your folders of</p>
<p>downloads</p>
<p>Pictures</p>
<p>music folders etc.</p>
<p>See if it helps.</p>
<p>If you cannot find still, better revert to earlier version of windows and you will get all your files.</p>
<p>Remember, whenever an upgrade arrives you must make a backup of important data.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            I did create a back up thumb nail and do a back up every week, but am out of town in a motel so vulnerable and never have I done a windows update where they don't just a build upon your old files..so I have thumbnails with me just shocked that basically
 windows 10 promotes having "your world" with you no matter what devices YET your "life" begins the moment you upgrade and does not include your past life. &nbsp;I did go to old folders under user and there is nothing there not even a picture folder so I believe
 I had a glitch with the upgrade. &nbsp;Every time I attempt a system restore to yesterday it still does not remove windows 10. &nbsp;I lost the cursor and touchpad use and my thinking is that I followed their set up steps and linked my new tablet so it is using my tablets
 history as it is no cursor and no photos on it as it is brand new...so I'm thinking when I linked the new empty tablet to it...it seems to have copied the tablets set up not the laptops. &nbsp;Will tolerate until back ho

<h2>            Broken Xbox one, Strait out of the box&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So tonight i got a new Xbox one for Destiny, Super keen after work i get home and set this bad boy up. shortly after doing the update and signing in and all that setup stuff i insert my first disc to start the install but wait... whats this.. the xbox does
 not read it, It still says insert disc and no error ever popped up, so i tryed another game, and then a dvd, then a power reset, then the games again and on and on and on. So next i contact Microsoft support and theres nothing i can do they say but return
 my games and get the digital downloads or send my xbox back for repair cause no matter what one i get from the store chances are the update will ruin the disc drive. WHAT THE HELL. No help. No compensation and to say all the consoles that are old will be ***.
 well thats awesome. What a great night. i wait this long to get my hands on my fave brand of consoles and no its broken and you gonna have to wait WEEKS for it to be sent and repaired. This is so ***! what other options does this leave me but maybe change
 to a working console brand!! and god knows i dont wana do that!</p>

<p>As I've been reading through the Ps4 forums it seems as though they are having some of the same problems as xbox gamers. DOA consoles, malfunctioning disc drives, etc. It also seems that they are having the same shipping nightmares as we are and to an extent
 they are in a worst state because their customer service reps hangs up on callers.

<h2>            Msconfig - Program doesn&#39;t run at startup even if correctly listed</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
I run Windows 7 on an Asus Laptop and I can't get the ETDCtrl.exe driver of the touch-pad running at start-up.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is correctly listed and checked in the Msconfig startup list but it doesn't start automatically.<br />
<br />
<br />
It works just if I manually run it (as admin).<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.

<p>So far we only&nbsp;<strong>assume</strong> that the program does not run. We do not know for sure. To find out you need to dig a little deeper. This requires a degree of patience. For starters, please report this:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the full path &amp; name of the program?</li><li>What exactly launches it? Msconfig.exe tells you in the "Location" column.</li></ul>

<p>Cases like these leave respondents puzzled. You received detailed suggestions within minutes of posting the problem details. You then did not take the time to consider them but went straight ahead with a complete re-installation. Why did you post here in
 the first place if you felt all along that the problem was too big?</p>
