    <title>Recent Issue with older version of Broderbund Print Shop after - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Recent Issue with older version of Broderbund Print Shop after December 2016 Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello- I'm writing for a friend who isn't very tech-savvy but neither am I. &nbsp;However, in the past this forum has helped me resolve other Windows 10-related issues when I've had trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My friend has an older version of Broderbund Print Shop used for mailing labels. &nbsp;After the December 24, 2016 Windows 10 update his Print Shop quit working. &nbsp;Now when he clicks on an existing label file all he gets is a "boing" type of noise. &nbsp;When I checked
 existing programs, files and folders I couldn't find anything labeled Broderbund Print Shop but when I checked the update history I did locate "ProPublisher Professional Business Labels (Broderbund LLC)" and the date December 24, 2016. &nbsp;Regardless, nothing
 seems to work and it DID work before this most recent update. &nbsp;As such I suspect there is a glitch somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I called a local computer shop I was told to UNINSTALL and then Reinstall the program using the original CD. &nbsp;Well.....we tried to do that but when I try to uninstall I'm told that the program is in use (IT"S NOT) and we can't get it uninstalled to
 do the reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we're stuck and I'm hoping that someone out there can give me some suggestions so that I can help my friend who recently lost his dad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much!</p>

            <p>Hi Cath,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that <strong>Print</strong> <strong>Shop</strong> application is too old to be more compatible with
<strong>Windows</strong> <strong>10</strong>. However, there's a way we can do by following the steps provided on the article on how to&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15078/windows-make-older-programs-compatible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Make
 older programs compatible with this version of Windows</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the steps provided on the article won't work, I highly suggest that you use the latest version of Print Shop (if there is) that will be compatible with Windows 10. For more detailed assistance, it is better to contact the support team of the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this clarifies your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            What does&#58; &#34;Installation Install this app on up to ten Windows 10 devices&#34; means on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I'm thinking of buying some apps from Store, But I'm struggled by this</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Installation Install this app on up to ten Windows 10 devices."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what does it mean?</p>
<p>Does it mean if I installed 10 times on different devices, I'll have to buy it again?</p>
<p>Or Can only installed on 10 devices at a time (If I want to install on more devices, I'll need to uninstall from one of 10 existing devices)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know about this as I never bought any apps from Store.</p>
<p>Do anyone have clear answer for this?</p>

<h2>            Parental permission for an adult&#63;</h2>
                    Yesterday, I got my first Windows 8 phone. Today, while trying to download apps, I found that I have to have 'parental permission', even though I'm an adult. My mom has a Microsoft account too, and we've both had them from before I was an adult, but how
 can I change this? Why do I still need her permission to download something?

            Thanks, but it doesn't solve the issue. &nbsp;Just tried your recommendation. &nbsp;The LAYOUT box is now expanded (it used to be a half inch wide and now it's two inches wide on my screen), but it's completely empty. &nbsp;The place where I could formerly select large/small
 icons or thumbnails or show-file-details is blank.

            <p>I attempted a re-install of Windows 10, which failed. &nbsp;The machine, a desktop, could not restart successfully after the first stage of the install completed; I pulled the plug and turned it back on, and it gave me a message that it was reverting to my previous
 version of Windows. &nbsp;The problem with greyed-out options in Windows Explorer was fixed after that, though. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, the machine then would not wake up after it entered hibernation after a period of disuse. &nbsp;I would have to pull the plug and put it through a hard reboot to get it back up and working again. &nbsp;I had done a malware scan with AVG, what I usually
 use, and it found nothing. &nbsp;I then did a scan with MalwareBytes, and that program found a program called SpyHunter, which I had never (knowingly) installed. &nbsp;MalwareBytes deleted SpyHunter and told me to reboot, and after that, everything was happily back
 to normal.</p>

<h3> mateialexandru  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana&#47; search problems in Windows 10 RTM</h2>
                    <p>Hello there guys!&nbsp;One of&nbsp;my Windows&nbsp;10.0.10240.16463 (Win10 RTM) situations is that I cannot use search/Cortana. It did work until an update was installed two weeks ago. Problem is, I don't know which.</p>
<p>1. If I try to use the shortcut (WinKey+S or WinKey+C) nothing is happening anymore.</p>
<p>2. If I press the search/Cortana icon on my taskbar, nothing happens anymore.</p>
<p>3. If I write while I am in the start menu, the search works. (even though the search is not always&nbsp;on topic&nbsp;or it shows "Getting search ready").</p>
<p>4. The butons in the now open search&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>5. Locale is now set to Romania, but this also happened when it was set to UK, since I did have Cortana for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No antivirus or firewall except the Microsoft supplied ones.</p>
<p>Any ideas? Reinstalling the OS is out of the question, since I&nbsp;have about 200 GB of photo&nbsp;&amp; A/V plugins and software that I use on a daily basis.</p>

</p><p>If&nbsp; windows key + s is not working might be this issue is due to the windows key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try with&nbsp;different external&nbsp;keyboard to check the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't work then try to perform Clean Boot and check.</p>
<p>
</p><div><strong>Clean Boot.</strong><br />
Booting the computer in a clean boot state can reduce software conflicts and help identify the root cause of the issue. You can refer to this article for more information:<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, we appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We are really sorry for the delay in response.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As it seems to be a corruption in combase.dll from the event viewer log that you provided.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try the steps below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the steps below and check if that helps.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open an <strong>Administrator CMD</strong> window (Type
<strong>CMD</strong> in the Search bar or Press <strong>Windows Logo Key + X</strong>. Click on
<strong>Command Prompt admin</strong>).</span></li><li><span>If you can’t find a way, use these steps:
</span>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>CTRL + Shift + ESC</strong> to open Task Manager.
</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>File &gt; Run New Task.</strong></span></li><li><span>Make sure you have a check mark beside
<strong>"Create this task with administrative privileges".</strong></span></li><li><span>Type CMD. </span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>Type the following commands at the CMD prompt:
</span>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</span></strong></li><li><strong><span>sfc /scannnow </span></strong></li></ol>
</li><li><span>If both<span>&nbsp; </span>the above commands are completed and show no remaining issues, run the PowerShell command and copy and paste the following:</span></li><li><strong><span>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
</span></strong></li><li><span>Check to be sure this command ran, showed a blue progress indicator and then returns to the prompt. If you see a red error, please try again. The command may have been typed or pasted incorrectly, or there
 may be a larger problem with Windows 10.</span></li></ol>

            <p>Hello there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Followed your help. At first, I had to force close the seach.exe, since it was giving me a red&nbsp;error on it, for the PowerShell command.
<br />
<br />
Everything went ok, but it didn't solve anything. I guess a Windows reinstall is what I need to do, in the end.</p>

            Normally, I would agree, but I have the same problem, I have to much to lose on a reinstall. I know it's an inconvenience, or at least for me it is. Microsoft is going to have to fix this and it should be in one of the upcoming updates. I would suggest<br />
waiting until the next update goes through and see if they have it fixed. They know about the problem and are working on it. If you reinstall and update, you're probably going to end up with the same problem all over again. Grin and bare it for a bit and they'll
 fix it for you, and you've lost nothing but the use of Cortana for a bit, and you get a refresher on using the stock search...lol, but I too tried the powershell reinstall and it did nothing which shows me that it's still in Microsofts hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only connect to the internet using a Broabandconnection in the Dial-Up Section of the Network &amp; Internet Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to get access on Ethernet thought cause i got an external HDD thats in the network. Pls help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already upgraded the latest Drivers, used all the knowing ipconfig /release /renew stuff. Nothing works.</p>

</p>

<p>
</p><p>Give you a run down on how&nbsp;I start my Network config &amp; setup / TROUBLESHOOTING sessions. Usually takes 5-10 mins however is a tremendous time-saver in the long run.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st - plug-in all devices&nbsp;</p>
<p>2nd - Through performing a <em>RESET on all computers or devices </em>and&nbsp;<em>POWER-CYCLE (unplug power cord) to routers,&nbsp;gateways,&nbsp;&amp; switches,
</em>the devices should update drivers or prompt for specific driver configuration changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3rd - Go to your main terminal(computer/laptop/server) that is plugged into your router/gateway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4th - At this main terminal, run your command prompt (Powershell). Then perform in order ipconfig /all, ipconfig /release, ipconfig /release6 (very important-all ethernet connections), ipconfig /flushdns,....</p>
<p>5th - Now, perform a HARD RESET on your particular router/gateway. Usually the red button located on the back your device. PRESS a few times then proceed to HOLD IT DOWN for 15-30 sec count.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6th - Lastly, type your default router (such as on my Netgear it is routerlogin.com). Or if on a gateway look for your specific device's tag for the URL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7th - OPEN your command prompt again, type <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
ipconfig /registerdns</span>. Then run the following commands inorder, ipconfig /renew, ipconfig /renew6</p>
<p>8th - Now visit your URL found on the back of your router/gateway. </p>
<p>
</p><p>All should be good. Not sure if it will help. Let me know how it all comes together.
</p>

<h2>            Microsoft news polls</h2>
                    Hello, I just wonder why they want to poll my opinion every time I open the news??? I think these polls must be very inaccurate, as I've answered some of them myself several times. Also I wonder if my answers can be traced, the safety factor? Can you answer
 these questions please?

<h2>            face recognition camera only works sometimes</h2>
                    <p>I've used face recognition on my HP spectre since I purchased it 3 months ago, it's worked absolutely fine until windows updated to fall creators. Now it only work intermittently which is frustrating. I see others have similar problems with surface devices,
 I've checked the device drivers and hardware all seem to be working fine. One tip was to roll back the driver but that button is greyed out on my machine, not sure why.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Maybe this can Help.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility the utility is Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</p>
<p>If everything above is OK and it is not connecting to the Wireless router. Log from any computer that is, or can be connected to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, make sure that the Wireless broadcast is On, and try to connect with
 No Wireless security.</p>
<p><strong>When working turn On the Wireless security.</strong></p>
<p>Note* People sometimes make mistakes in writing and retyping the security passphrase.</p>
<p>Alternative way is to copy it from the Router's menu, and then paste when asked by the Wireless card.</p>

                    I was searching around for good deals on Windows 7 and stumbled upon getyourkey.net, which offers Windows product keys at very low prices($64.98), and suspiciously 100% of their reviews are five star, which makes me wonder if this website is legit/genuine.
 Has anyone else had an experience with getyourkey.net?

<h2>            I can&#39;t get Movie Maker installed for Windows 7&#33;</h2>
                    I have uninstalled and re-installed Windows Essentials 2012 about half a dozen times already this morning. According to the installation, Photo Gallery and Movie Maker have been successfully installed.&nbsp; However, when I click the start button and type in
 movie maker, it says no items match your search.&nbsp; When I click Start &gt;&gt; Run, and type in moviemk, I get the&nbsp;message windows cannot find 'moviemk.'&nbsp;I have already checked to make sure that I have the most recent version of windows media player, and I can't
 think of what else I can do to get this to work!&nbsp; What have I overlooked?&nbsp; I will be upgrading to windows 8, but I need it to work now!&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;

<p>==============================================</p>
<p>You can download the full install files for Windows</p>
<p>Essentials 2011 or 2012 from the following links and </p>
<p>then install from your computer.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Full Version 2011 Installer<br />
<a href="http://g.live.com/1rewlive4-all/en/wlsetup-all.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://g.live.com/1rewlive4-all/en/wlsetup-all.exe</a><br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />

<br />
Full Version 2012 Installer<br />

<br />
Create a System Restore Point and then download <br />
the file to your desktop. When the download has <br />
completed...double left click the file to install it.<br />
<br />
Once you have the program installed...you can delete<br />
the downloaded file or save it in case you need it for<br />
later use.</p>

            I wonder if Blackout matches are by region, but I would still think there should be enough players to fill out the roster.&nbsp; What time of day are you trying to play Blackout matches?&nbsp; That could potentially do it too if its regional and there arent enough
 players.

 to the social tab in blackops 4 i can see that other players are playing blackout with full lobbies.. why cant i get one?? I get lobbies instantly on both Fortnite and PUBG..&nbsp;

            I think it's just where you're located. It's trying to find matches with people in your region and there may not be many available. I've seen this happen on PUBG too depending what region you try to play in.&nbsp;

<h3> witwald  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP Mode error&#58; &#34;The video device failed to initialize for fullscreen mode.&#34;</h2>
                    When I try to run an old MS-DOS application in Windows XP Mode, I get the following error from the 16 bit MS-DOS sub system: "The video device failed to initialize for fullscreen mode." I am using Windows 7 Ultimate x64 edition.<br />
<br />
The program starts up in text mode just fine, but when it attempts to go into graphics mode, the error message described above results.<br />
<br />
It would seem that the video driver emulation in Windows XP Mode is not quite complete as far as emulation goes. The application is an old one that was written in Borland Pascal 7.0, and utilised the BGI graphics programming interface. It has no equivalent
 Windows version, and I would like to be able to run it under Windows 7. It ran under a native Windows XP Pro installation, switching to full-screen graphics mode as and when required without any&nbsp;problem.<br />
<br />
Is there something that can be done to get it working under Windows XP Mode in Windows 7? Can the virtual machines graphics card emulator be adjusted/changed in some way to get fullscreen graphics mode working?

            I had the same problem too so instead of using windows mode I downloaded dosbox and the programmaX frontend. It is great for running dos mode applications under windows (all versions as far as I know.)<br />
<br />
www.dosbox.com<br />
<br />
its pretty easy to install just chose a directory to install to. Then to install the frontend you just point it to the directory where you installed dosbox. When you start the frontend (programmaX) there will be a button up the top called wizard. Just click
 the wizard button and follow the pages. If you want to create an icon for it in windows just goto tools .. create shortcut then click ok when the box comes up. ;)<br />
<br />
Best of all, its absolutely free except for paying for you're internet usage.<br />

<p>Hi witwald,</p>
<p>As per the changes done in the design by Microsoft you will not be able to use DOS in full screen mode for some programs. 16-bit DOS programs are not supported on Windows 7.</p>
<p>However you may follow the steps below and see if it can resolve the issue:</p>
<p>1. Open the properties of the shortcut to the MS-DOS-based program.</p>
<p>2. On the <strong>General</strong> tab, click to clear the<strong> Read-only</strong> check box if it is selected.</p>
<p>3. Click the <strong>Screen</strong> tab, click <strong>Window</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong></p>
<p>If that does no difference you can follow the path below and try the step as well.</p>
<p>From tools menu --&gt; Disable integration features and try again. This should allow DOS application to run in full screen mode.</p>
<p>Regards<br />

<p>E materialmente la cosa come funziona?</p>
<p>Bisogna avere 2 profili gold, ovviamente, mi collego con il mio e faccio collegare l'ospite/amico che gioca con me?</p>
<p>C'è un link con la procedura.</p>

<p>Devi avere un solo profilo GOLD, l'altro non è un profilo collegato ad una gamertag, è un profilo "fittizio" chiamato Ospite che ti permette di giocare a schermo condiviso le partite multiplayer</p>

<h2>            Password works on one machine but not on the other</h2>
                    I have 2 machines one running windows 10 the other windows 8. The one running windows 10 ran fine until I started updating the other from 8 to windows 10. Now the other machine keeps saying the password is incorrect even though i can use the same password
 to login to the same Microsoft account on all my other devices. What can i do to fix this?
