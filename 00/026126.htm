            <p>Hi Avinandan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you receive Windows Update error 80070103 while installing updates, you might be trying to install a driver that's already installed or a driver that might be less compatible than one you already have installed on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try to stop the driver software installing from Windows update. Please follow the steps below to&nbsp;do so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows + X and select System</li><li>Click on Advance system settings</li><li>Click the "Hardware" Tab and click on "Device installation settings"</li><li>Click on "No, Let me choose what to do".</li><li>Select "Never install drivers software from Windows update".</li></ol>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.</span></p>
        </p>

            Same problem here (on Acer Aspire v3-772g). Tried uninstall Elan, reinstall, uninstall without installing and every time i get 0x<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">80070103 error. Can't install other updates because of that. I used also
 DriverPackSolution to update all drivers, on Acer website only elan driver is from 2013.<br />
<br />
@problem solved after uninstalling ELAN drivers (no reboot), clean files with CCleaner and then restart.</span>
<br />
<br />
@edit: nope, after reboot still same problem

            <p>I too have the same problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked in the Drivers folder and the ELAN module does not exist. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My ACER laptop is working fine [although under W10 rlse 10041 it was extremely slow (better since updating to rlse 10049)] but I still get the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what the compatible driver (that is working) really is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would hate for many W10 users (like this group) to keep getting a message about this driver when there is no problem (due to another driver doing the work of ELAN).</p>

            <p>It looks like the wellknown problem with the Realtek-update, where we have to mess around in the GPedit to change the timeout in Device Installation from 300 seconds to 1800 or higher.</p>
<p>

Your GPedit
 CAN look diferent from the shown in the link, so you may have to mess around to find the Device Installation...</p>

            <p>ISSUE SOLVED!!! </p>
<p>
</p><p>First I did what was instructed below in the comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows + X and select System</li><li>Click on Advance system settings</li><li>Click the "Hardware" Tab and click on "Device installation settings"</li><li>Click on "No, Let me choose what to do".</li><li>Select "Never install drivers software from Windows update". </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Restarted Computer and retried the update, FAILED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried the following information in the Link below, FOLLOWED EVERY STEP TO A "T" INCLUDING DOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING THE REGISTRY FILE!!</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>http://kb.stonegroup.co.uk/index.php?View=entry&amp;EntryID=289</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>And that too FAILED!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried EDITING THE REGISTRY** so I could try and hide the update:</p>
<ol>
<li>Windows+R</li><li>Type "regedit" and hit enter.</li><li>Navigate To: "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/WindowsUpdate/UX</li><li>Modify each Key and change the "value" to 0 for each.</li><li>Restart and retry driver installation.</li></ol>
<p>SUCH A FAILURE!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>**DON'T EDIT REGISTRY UNLESS YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THE REGISTRY!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND HERE'S WHAT FINALLY WORKED AFTER ALL THOSE STEPS ABOVE!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;/rage&gt;For me it was the "Elan Device Input Driver Installation Failed Error - 0x80070103", it may or may not be different for you. But I believe it's a pointing device issue, you know, because "Microshaft" thinks they know what drivers are best for my computer,
 instead of just keeping their hands off my **** and letting me do it myself! They do this **** all the freaking time, update my wireless with MicroUpdate, it's broken, update graphics driver with MicroUpdate, it too broke! Seriously? I thought it was called
 a "Personal Computer", you know, cause you could "Personalize" it, now it's a "Microsoft Computer", and Microsoft says what's okay! I know there are a lot of idiots out there who have no clue what they're doing with computers because they won't sacrifice that
 5 minutes of OMG precious time to search for the answers they need! Too busy with their noses in everybody else's business on Facebook to help themselves! LAZINESS is not an excuse to automate everything, especially in the case of PC's where each one is specifically
 different, YOU CAN'T KEEP PUSHING GENERIC DRIVERS ON EVERYONE!!&lt;\rage&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I turned off Avast! Antivirus (may be different for you), find the program in your control panel, if it's an "ELAN" error, search the "Publisher" column for anything related to "ELAN", if it's an "ALPS" issue, search column for "ALPS" &nbsp;and uninstall
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DO NOT LET THE COMPUTER RESTART!! Even if it wants to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then open Windows Update and retry the installation, it was instant success!! I don't know if turning off the antivirus during this process helped, but I did it just in case. I also don't know if all of the previous steps actually accomplished diddly squat,
 but I also did them anyways just in case they would "magically" help. I know this is a long read, and a lot of things to follow, but if you take the 20 minutes of time it took me to complete everything, it just might work for you too.</p>

<h2>            Cannot access only one website on one computer only</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I have a very strange issue that I cannot seem to figure out. Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is that I cannot access my school's student portal website, but only from one computer. The website in question is
<a href="http://ernie.erau.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ernie.erau.edu</a>. The login page will come up, and I can enter my credentials, but then it just says "waiting for erau.edu..." at the bottom for about 30 minutes, then says it cannot display the page. This did work up
 until a few months ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Windows 7 Professional 64-bit, with Internet Explorer 9. The problem is definately an issue with this computer and not the website. I've determined this by ruling everything else out as follows:</p>
<p>The website loads properly on other computers in the household, including another computer with Windows 7 64-bit and IE9. I've taken the computer to my parents house and hooked it up to their internet. Their computer can access it fine, but mine still cannot.</p>
<p>The problem does not seem to be browser dependant, because I have tried IE9 (32 and 64-bit versions), Firefox, and Opera. Same issue with all 3.</p>
<p>The problem is definately in the OS somewhere because I booted to a Fedora 16 Live CD and was able to access the website fine.</p>
<p>I have tried disabling the Windows Firewall, flushing the DNS, resetting the TCP stack, and cleared the hosts file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer is fully up to date with Windows Update, and I ran a virus scan, which found nothing.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I should have mentioned that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've completely cleared my temp files, cookies, saved everything in IE. I've also reset all security zones to default, and reset IE to its default settings. I've deleted all temp files on the computer and run a disc cleanup.</p>
<p>I also ran SFC hoping that it would find something - and it said it found a problem and repaired it, but there was no change to the problem.</p>
<p>Also I tried to create a new user account on the computer, and it has the same issue with the same website.</p>

            <p>Still cannot access in IE8 or IE7 mode. I also tried IE in no add-on mode, still doesn't load. Tried it as administrator - no change. Tried it in Safe Mode with Networking, still doesn't load.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It still gives "Waiting for response from erau.edu..."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly enough though... if I enter bogus credentials, it DOES tell me incorrect username and password and takes me back to the logon screen. But giving it good credentials (I had my roommate try logging in also) it seems to accept them but never go
 anywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just for the sake of trying I installed XP Mode and tried it in IE6 inside the XP virtual machine... Contrary to how I thought it would act, it does the same thing. Every website works BUT this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've never seen anything like this before.</p>

<p>The only things that would stop a successful log in,</p>
<p>Cookies are not being able to be installed,</p>
<p>Active x filtering is blocking the active x components in the sign in page,</p>
<p>Internet options, security section,</p>
<p>Custom level button,</p>
<p>Scroll to the bottom of the page,</p>
<p>Disable active X filters, apply and okay, for ie9 only.</p>
<p>Boot your machine.</p>

            <p>Thats the strange part. It DOES sign in sucessfully. It saves the cookie (which I can see get created in the cookies folder). It tries to go to the next page, but just never gets there. It just "waits" for a response from erau.edu... which it thinks it never
 gets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything in IE is defaults, and I verified every individual setting exactly against a working computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said in the first post though, I don't think this is an IE problem, as no browser works, not even one in a virtual machine.
</p>
<p>Is there anything beyond IE settings, or outside IE entirely, that could cause this?</p>

 the hundreds or people use the Samsung SSD, so, I'm still waiting for support from Microsoft&nbsp;

<p>Interesting!</p>
<p>I have same problem and am running OS on Samsung SSD 840EVO 1TB.</p>
<p>Said SSD is no longer recognised after installation of 16215, reporting that Boot device is missing - at which point OS rolls back to earlier version (16199), and off it goes again, downloadsing 16215, installing (again) and failing to recognise Samsung
 SSD boot device (again).</p>

<p>Add one more. Same issue. After downloading and installing this build, I give the OK to reboot. The first process completes quickly at 100%, closes, reboots and then immediately after the 29% completion screen, computer suddenly reboots with the green screen
 and STOP CODE: INACCESSIBLE BOOT DEVICE. Then the last good build is restored, and the download, install process begins again.</p>

<p>I managed to work around the problem and got 16215 to install by this method:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Run services and disable "Windows Update"</p>
<p>2. Reboot</p>
<p>3. Go into c:\Windows and rename the softwaredistribution folder</p>
<p>4. Run disk cleanup</p>
<p>5. Select to clean up system files</p>
<p>6. Select all options and click Ok to delete all the files</p>
<p>7. Run services again and put "Windows Update" back to manual startup</p>
<p>8. Reboot again</p>
<p>9. Run Windows updates and it will download but fail to install</p>
<p>10. Run Windows updates again and it will skip downloading and initialize, will fail again</p>
<p>11. Run Windows updates again and restart</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;I have down this on 3 computers and they all finally upgraded to 16215.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a bit of a pain but it works.</p>

            Thanks for sharing your experience. That's a real PITA, I have considered just rolling back to the slow ring and wait for a refined version to come out, but it's a challenge that I have trouble letting get the best of me.!!

<h3> tungstenthecat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Document Map Problem</h2>
                    Using Mac Word 2011.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My "Heading 1" levels aren't showing in the Document Map. But there's a twist: The line where the heading should display is blank. If I click on one of the blank lines, I'm taken to the correct place in the document. But I can't see the heading text in
 the Map.&nbsp;</div>

</div>
<div>Have tried closing the Nav pane, exiting Word, and re-entering, but problem persists. I've confirmed that the heading styles have been applied properly, as have the associated Outline levels.&nbsp;

<div>Thanks in advance for any help.</div>

<p>Try #2 first, making sure to not include the final ¶.</p>

 it now</em>" ( image&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/urnjykzno8g6cry/defender%20stopped%2001.jpg?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/urnjykzno8g6cry/defender%20stopped%2001.jpg?dl=0</a> ). I click the "Start now" button, and then another statement appears "<em>Real-time
 protection is turned off. You should turn it on</em>" ( image&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zpn7n8igk5qneld/defender%20stopped%2002.jpg?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/zpn7n8igk5qneld/defender%20stopped%2002.jpg?dl=0</a> ). After I click the "Turn on"
 button and wait a short while, Windows Defender turns green and says that everything is OK. Later, when I check this application, quite often I find it disabled again and I have to do again the operations described above. This is very annoying because I am
 not sure anymore that my computer is really protected, and so I am forced to periodically check the status of Windows Defender in order to re-enable it when I find it disabled. This application should stay ON and let me do my work without any disturbances,
 being confident that my computer is really protected.</p>
<p>My only security applications are Windows Defender and the free version of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware. These two applications never interfered, so there should be no trouble about their simultaneous presence on my computer. Both security applications do not
 report any infections after full scanning.&nbsp;I checked for other antivirus software on my computer, but I did not find any.</p>
<p>What could be wrong and how can it be solved?</p>

<p>
</p><p>You said that you use(d) the <strong>free</strong> version of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware MBAM.</p>
<p>That is perfectly fine and will <strong>NOT</strong> interfere with Windows Defender. It must have been some kind of strange coincidence that your WD suddenly started working after you uninstalled free MBAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you already suspected, neither WD nor any other Anti-Virus product will catch each and every kind of malware. Therefore I recommend and suggest to install the
<strong>free</strong> version of MBAM again, and to run once in a while a scan with it.</p>

    <title>Word Deleted equations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jo&#227;o marques silva  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Deleted equations</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had to recently write a lab report in Microsoft Word involving a lot of equations, to which I used the "insert an equation" function. I finished the document and uploaded it to a website called ManageBac (where we have to upload reports, essays, etc.)
 and all of the equations were there. However, in the next day, I checked the document again and all of the written content was present but all of the equations were missing, this happened as well to the document saved in my computer. There were a lot of equations
 that were very important for the content of this lab report. Is there a way to retrieve these equations or to at least prevent this from happening again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help</p>

<p>Thanks Pauli,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I have tried all of those.&nbsp; Been through the link that you provided.&nbsp; I still cannot right click and Mount A Public Share.</p>
<p>This is a NAS attached to my router direct with a Ethernet cable.&nbsp; It has its' own address and I can see it and access it through a web browser, etc.&nbsp; What I cannot do is direct mount it as I was saying nor can I map it through File Explorer at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Been through ALL the steps in that link and I still cannot map this old NAS drive.&nbsp; I seemed to have lost the ability when the skip builds hit in the 17000s or so.&nbsp; 18204 doesn't seem to have it either.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I have never used Homegroup.&nbsp; Only network setup as the generic Workgroup.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take care,</p>

<p>Hi Pauli,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you happen to know if it's actually safe now to enable SMB1.0? I have my (SMB1.0) NAS drive disabled because the last time I heard it was a rather serious security risk to enable SMB1.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA and regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT] This was quite some time ago and I haven't followed this bug, as I don't really need that drive.</p>

<p>Thanks again Pauli.&nbsp; Tried SMB with no results.&nbsp; Tried net use in a command prompt and that didn't work.</p>
<p>I am thinking about pulling the drive off the direct router connection and putting it on one of the network computers and map it from there.</p>
<p>Again, thanks for the attempts.&nbsp; I just wish that it would show in Network and then go back to the quick and easy...</p>
<p>Mount Share when you right click.&nbsp; Another working item that they have broken with "updates".&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Keeps us on our toes and spending hours and hours chasing a solution.&nbsp; ;)</p>

            Yes, that is disabled by default because it's not safe, but I don't see big risk of enable that on home network which is behind your own router.

<p>hi stanvincent,</p>
<p>when you mentioned "not allow me to add students who have office 365 school account", could you let us know the detailed situation? for example, can you go to the “add or remove students” section and see the following page? is there any error message when
 you add students?<br />
note: you can upload the screenshots by clicking use rich formatting in the forum and then clicking the icon of insert image.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>To look into the issue, I’d like to collect the following information:<br />
1.&nbsp;As you said the issue still occurs with a new account, is the same .pst file imported to this new account?<br />
2.&nbsp;As you said you have deleted related events, have you checked in <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OWA</a>(Outlook Web App) and see if the events have been deleted?<br />
3.&nbsp;Please also create a <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-profiles-in-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-fed2a955-74df-4a24-bef6-78a426958c4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
new Outlook profile</a> and see if the issue persists.&nbsp;Make sure you set the new profile as default and restart Outlook for Mac.
<br />
4.&nbsp;Set up your account in another Mac machine and see if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Chris</p>

<p>1. I didn't create a new 365 account, I created a new account on Outlook and linked it to the existing 365 account</p>
<p>2. Yes. There are no calendar events in OWA with the names that are cited in the errors</p>
<p>3. This is what I did for number 1</p>
<p>4. I don't have another Mac</p>
<p>* Re-importing the pst file at this stage isn't a viable solution, as my emails would be weeks out of date.
</p>
<p>Is there no way to understand what is causing these errors when the events appear not to exist?</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>I understand you create a new profile with the same account&nbsp;but the issue persists. I’d like to know, except the sync error,&nbsp;whether all the other features work properly.<br />
1.&nbsp;Do other calendar events sync properly?<br />
2.&nbsp;Can you send and receive emails in Outlook for Mac? <br />
3.&nbsp;Does the error message appear&nbsp;periodically or when you launch Outlook for Mac?</p>
<p>In addition, to look into the issue, we need&nbsp;to collect the log file. Please refer to the article to enable logging:<br />

<p>Then try to reproduce the issue and turn off logging after that.</p>

<p>We have checked the logs you uploaded, as far as I can find, these logs don’t contain the actual reason which may have caused the synchronization issue you encounter. Therefore, we may need to involve our escalation team to dig it deeper.</p>
<p>I have sent you another private message to collect some required information, so our escalation team can contact you to further investigate this issue. Please see it and reply at your convenience.</p>

<h2>            How to increase the space between footnotes and page number&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to increase the space between footnotes and page numbers in my Microsoft Word 2010 document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is how the footnotes and page number look like at the moment:</p>

<p>The Footer style (automatically applied to the footer, where the page number is) defaults to zero Space Before, and the Footnote Text style defaults to zero Space After. That's why they're so close together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You probably don't want to increase the Space After for the footnotes, as that would also add space between the multiple footnotes.* Instead, increase the Space Before of the Footer style:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the page number to open the footer pane.</li><li>Press Ctrl+Shift+S to open the Apply Styles box, which will show that the current style is Footer.</li><li>Click the Modify button to open the Modify Style dialog.</li><li>If you intend this change to apply to all new documents that you base on the same template as this document, click the "New documents based on this template" option button.</li><li>Click the Format button in the bottom left of the dialog, and click Paragraph in the menu to open the Paragraph dialog.</li><li>In the Spacing section of the dialog, change the Before measurement to the amount of space you want. The up/down arrows change it in increments of 6 points (or half a line), or you can type the measurement you want.</li><li>Click OK in the Paragraph and Modify Style dialogs, and click the X button to close the Apply Styles box if you don't need it.</li></ul>
<p>______</p>
<p>*If you do change the Space After setting of the Footnote Text style, you can check the box in the Paragraph dialog for "Don't add space between paragraphs of the same style" to avoid this side effect.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Contacts&#34; names have gotten reversed somehow</h2>
                    I have 800 contacts. I am using a custom form for the contacts. In the "file as"&nbsp;space, the&nbsp;first and last names&nbsp;somehow got reversed on most of them. I checked in tools &gt;options&gt; contacts. The setting is correct.&nbsp;"last name, first". This may have happened&nbsp;when
 syncing with my android cell phone.&nbsp;I'm using a third party sync program called "CompanionLink". I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else and is there a way to get these contacts filed "last name first" without changing each of the 800 individually
 one by one? thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bob&nbsp;&nbsp; 805-443-4017

            <p>I've seen complaints about it - some are using androids, some imported contacts and had outlook options set wrong. I can't say for sure that it's something with the droid, it's possible the default name format was wrong and outlook didn't know.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Double check the default format in File, Options, Contacts. It should be First Last.

            Do you have Version 1709?  Check at Settings &gt; System &gt; About.  
<br />
<br />After choosing Virus &amp; Threat Protection categorys, did you then choose Virus &amp; Threat Protection Settings?  It should be there.  It's the only extra control Defender has to do something like that, in the latest version.  But  default setting is Off so it might have been toggled on by a bloatware antivirus.  Which do you have?

<h2>            Chinese language input not working</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I'd be amazed if anyone can help with this. A while ago I had a problem where using the Chinese language input stopped working properly in Word 2004 (it inserted characters every time a key was pressed instead of waiting for the word to be completed). I
 finally found that there was some sort of conflict with the Logitech mouse/keyboard I was using and solved it by downloading the Logitech Control Center. Mysteriously the problem started again. I was using a new (Lexma) mouse and (Dell) keyboard, so thought
 it must be that. I caved in and have just upgraded to Office 2011 but I am STILL having the same problem. If it a driver conflict, how do I 'delete' the relevant driver or sort out the conflict?</p>
<p>Specs: OS10.6.8/Office 2011/iMac4.1</p>

            Problem solved.<br />
Finally identified it in the ~/Library/Preferences folder as loginwindow.plist, which determines the apps that open on startup. Turns out it was one of these apps causing conflict, PopChar. Have dropped the developers a note to this effect and hope they will
 provide a fix. When PopChar is not open, Word works as normal with Chinese input. Yay!

 values from within it's parent subform, but displays "0" when trying to display a value on another subform.

            The both are subforms on a main form. They are not related to each other. Both text boxes are unbound calculated controls. Textbox 1 sums values from subform1. I need to show the contents of subform1 in textbox2 located on subform2. Textbox 2 just shows

            <p>Mr. Larson:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your example is of parent/child relationship between a main form and a sub form. My scenario is a dashboard style form where several subforms are on the main form. I am trying to retrieve information from a control on one subform and have it also appear
 on an unrelated second subform.</p>

<p>Mr. Larson:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your example is of parent/child relationship between a main form and a sub form. My scenario is a dashboard style form where several subforms are on the main form. I am trying to retrieve information from a control on one subform and have it also appear
 on an unrelated second subform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<br />
That is irrelevant.&nbsp; The referencing of the control is EXACTLY THE SAME regardless.

            <p>I followed the method of addressing controls using the Forms("frmName").Controls("CtrlName") shown in your example. The target text box continue to display "0" though the source text box has a value in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Access modified the equation after entry, but here is the Source for the target text box:</p>
<p>=Forms("frmMain").[Controls]("sfrmHoldsYTD").[Form].[controls]("tbxTotalCasesYTD")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>I can use a text box that is in the detail section of the source subform as the source for my text box and it displays properly. If I use any calculated text boxes (from the subform footer)&nbsp;as the source, I get a value of "0" displayed in the target text
 box.</p>

<h2>            Echo on other end when using skype on iPad Pro 12.9&#34;</h2>
                    <p>There is a strong echo on the other end when using skype on my ipad pro 12"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have spoken to Apple a number of times and they say its a Skype issue - hoping now that Skype take this on board and sort this out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont understand why all of a sudden skype does not work properly on the new ipads - when it did on the old ones --- oohhhh hang on - its Apples way of driving me to use Facetime instead......&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless this is fixed by programmers at Skype/Microsoft - I will be driven to use more and more of Apples products....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help get this fixed.</p>
<p>(and a subtle hint - I want someone to say they are looking into the coding - not reboot / try different login points etc as mentioned on the other (closed) questions)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

            This seems to be an issue that is affecting the iPad Pro model. Possibly related to the surround sound speakers. 
<br />
<br />What you can do is, delete the Skype app, power on and off your iPad Pro, then go to the App Store then try downloading an older build of Skype.

<h2>            Protect All worksheet from a workbook at once</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>Is it possible to protect all the worksheets from a workbook with same permissions at once? I mean in order to go to each worksheet and choose same permissions and set the same password to protect data of a bunch of worksheets that my Excel workbook has.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Maria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We understand that you would want to protect all your Excel worksheets. To prevent other users from viewing hidden worksheets, adding, moving, deleting, or hiding worksheets, and renaming worksheets, you can protect the structure of your Excel workbook with
 a password. For detailed process, please check this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Protect-a-workbook-7E365A4D-3E89-4616-84CA-1931257C1517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link.</a></strong></p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually I have protected my Workbook but additionally I would like to protect all the workskeets from my workbook from columns deletion and other features additionally, mostly only enable people to add and delete rows. Is there any way to select all the
 worksheets (tabs) to use the Worksheet protection to set these permission at once? or I need to do this&nbsp;worksheet by worksheet (tab by tab)?</p>

<p>You can do that with a macro. I suggest that you copy the code below into a regular module into your PERSONAL.XLSB file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But before you try: Make a backup copy of your file!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within your file, protect a sheet as you like, then press ALT-F8 and execute ProtectAll</p>

    <title>Office 365 - saving Excel spreadsheets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redvalentine68  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 - saving Excel spreadsheets</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have recently moved to Office 365 after using Office for many years on my desktop PC as I wanted access from my PC, Mac, iPad and iPhone. &nbsp;I seem to be having problems working out how the "save" function works.</p>
<p>I have become used to saving my spreadsheets on a regular basis but when I do this in 365 and then try to re-open the spreadsheet, I get an error message that "another user may have made changes" and asking which version I want to keep - no other users have
 access to my spreadsheets and they aren't shared. &nbsp;I have no idea how this works - does Excel save as you go, like the Google app; do I need to save as I go? &nbsp;Why am I getting error messages?</p>
<p>When I try to open the spreadsheet on my Mac (my main reason for getting 365 was that I could access my work from different machines) I get an error message about "another user accessing the workbook" - don't know what a workbook is.</p>
<p>Please help as I am about to ditch 365 in favour of the Google App.</p>
<p>Thanks for any suggestions</p>

            <p>Many thanks for your response.</p>
<p>In answer to your queries:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file is .xslx format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To open the file I go into Excel, the "recent" list, choose "other workbooks" and then choose OneDrive and then into the files listed there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest, I have only used Excel of the Office 365 suite so I'm not sure whether it applies to e.g. Word documents but it certainly happens with any Excel file that I open. &nbsp;I should say that all of the Excel files are files created before I started
 using Office &nbsp;365 and were created in Office 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wondered whether it was something to do with my habit of saving "as I go" so that there appears to be more than one version of the spreadsheet I'm working on. &nbsp;Since sending my question, I do not save the spreadsheet until I finish and the programme asks
 whether I want to save. &nbsp;I clearly do not understand how saving and OneDrive and several machines (PC and Mac) and an iPad all fit together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will do as you suggest and create a brand new spreadsheet in Office 365 and see what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            User with rogue second email address</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of our network managers had some issues with the O365 cloud account that resulted in them creating a second email address to their account. Since then, the email address was removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when a different user searched for him in Mail and Calendar, the default address for his is the one we want removing. See below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6eba6a6-ccfc-421e-8d84-5c877af3586a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6eba6a6-ccfc-421e-8d84-5c877af3586a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I go about removing the 'pdavis2@...' address from this account, or even just making the 'pdavis@...' address the primary? Below is a screenshot of his Exchange properties from the Admin Centre, showing the 'pdavis@...' SMTP account in bold:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/09383daa-8a8c-4436-a925-01c1989e8a4a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/09383daa-8a8c-4436-a925-01c1989e8a4a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this all makes sense. Thank you in advance for your wisdom.</p>

            <p><span>Hi MOBrien,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, this seems like a contacts cache issue. So I’d like to confirm if you have tried to clear the contacts cache in the following steps?</span></p>
<p><span>1. Create a new email message, and then type the prefix of the email address like ‘pdav’ in the
<strong>To</strong>/<strong>Cc</strong> field.</span></p>
<p><span>2. If the un-wanted email address (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) appears in the contacts list automatically, click the&nbsp;
 (<strong>X</strong>) icon to delete it from the list.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If no, please try it and check whether there is any improvement. If you have tried it but the scenario persists, we need to collect the information below to further investigate
 it:</span></p>
<p><span>Please run the command below in Exchange Online PowerShell and then provide the output to us for analysis:<br />
<strong>Get-Mailbox -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy *** | FL</strong></span></p>
<p><span>To connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell:<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: You need to be an administrator in the Office 365 organization to run
 the command and replace *** Email address is removed for privacy ***' with the problematic email address.</span></p>
<p><span>You just need to provide us with the
<strong>EmailAddresses</strong> and <strong>PrimarySmtpAddress</strong> part in the output. The picture below is for your reference:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ffea0b6a-5bfd-4456-8cf1-c50dbd33198e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ffea0b6a-5bfd-4456-8cf1-c50dbd33198e" /></a></p>
<p><span>To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the output of the command.
 You can click the URL below to read and reply to it:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is to check whether the ‘pdavis2’ email address has been removed from the
<strong>EMAIL ADDRESS</strong> list successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Larry</span></p>
