<h2>            HELP&#33; Newbie</h2>
                    
<p>Lots of interesting threads here and am in need of help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just had my old N97 exchanged for a N900 and am in the process of putting all the old apps (or substitutes, lack of voice guidance on Ovi Maps is for another day!) onto the new device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to install Sygic Mobile Maps on the handset but when I try to run the set up application nothing happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From other threads it appears that to activate the '.deb' file I need to do a firmware update which again is not showing on the handset update facility and I am having no luck with Flasher 3.5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions or anyone living in Oxfordshire&nbsp;that could&nbsp;do it for me would be greatlfully appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has Nokia given any reason why the current firmware release has not been advised using the inbuilt facility??</p>

            The latest firmware is available via "FOTA" for UK users<br />
<br />
FOTA means firmware over the air which is another way of saying it can be installed without using a computer..<br />
<br />
If, however, you have a vodafone branded handset, you're out of luck because vodafone aren't approving their firmware and therefore Nokia aren't releasing it.<br />
<br />
You can tell this by opening the settings application, scroll down to "about product". If you version has 205 in it, its a Vodafone handset.. if it has 203 its a british generic handset.. and you will be able to upgrade using the app manager tool (though I
 seriously advice using wifi to do this)<br />
<br />
<br />
There are many many walk through on this forum that can help you flash your phone.. but you shouldn't need to<br />

<p>Typical, it is a Vodafone handset!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried a number of the walk through guides for carrying out a manual flash update and when I go to run Flash 3.5 the window pops up and then disappears with no further actions seeming to take place!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other suggestions you could make?</p>

<p>Aahhhhh, Had a feeling you were a Vodafone victim when I read your first post&nbsp;:smileyindifferent:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're trying to start the flasher from the icon within the flasher folder, it won't work. Try starting it from the start menu. Works like that for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you're up and running copy and paste this line:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>flasher-3.5.exe -F RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.19-1.203.1_PR_COMBINED_203_ARM.bin -f -R</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to the end of</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\maemo\flasher-3.5&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and hit return. All being well you should start flashing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Assuming that is the .bin file you downloaded.</strong></p>

<p>And you need to flash the eMMC after too.</p>
<p>I find it best to rename the download files, to simply 'os' and 'emmc', this minimises the typo risk.</p>

<h2>            Logo image in email signature disappears every day</h2>
                    
<p>hello,</p>
<p>i have read lots of discussions and instructionals about how to insert an image into my email signature. i've found they all say the same thing, and it's pretty basic, and i've managed to do it....over and over. the problem is, i have to do it every day
 at the beginning of my workday. i go through the prescribed steps and have no problem for the rest of the day, but on the following day, whether or not i've logged out the previous day, the image in my signature line has disappeared and is replaced with this:
 &nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2foutlook.office365.com%2fowa%2f%3frealm%3dunomaha.edu" /></p>
<p>the image is posted publicly, so i don't understand why it won't load correctly, and what the magic cause of the unlinking is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Suzanne,</p>
<p>I would like to know where the issue occurs, in Outlook or Outlook Web App (OWA).</p>
<p>As for OWA, please understand that OWA doesn’t support inserting images in signatures and we don’t have any official supported workaround. If you are trying to achieve this goal using some method such as disclaimer, it may not work properly and we cannot
 help you troubleshoot any related issues.</p>
<p>If it’s in Outlook, please let me know the detailed version of your Outlook client and share with me a screenshot of the issue. You can click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> when replying and then click<strong> Insert/Edit Media</strong> button to upload pictures.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<h3> pat_dc  say:</h3>
<h2>            My windows phone contact list is full of spam contacts I can&#39;t delete. I think its from someone hacking my Live account. Please help.</h2>
                    <p>I don't know whats going on. Two days ago I went to call someone on my windows phone and their number was gone. On top of that there were around 100+ random email addresses in my contact list that I've never seen before. I created a windows live account
 because my phone made me. I have not logged onto the account since I created it. Although I must mention that there is a chance I created this account ten years ago when i got a new computer but the only time i would have used in over the last ten years would
 have been when I activated my phone. </p>
<p>Anyway, I've had an account hacked before. In this case I have been able to secure my password but I haven't been unable to remove any contacts that were added by the hacker. Every time i try to remove one it pops back up. I have people instant messaging
 me inappropriate messages. I do not know these people and do not want to have anything to do with them. I tried to delete the account but it told me i have to close or stop some activities that I've never heard of and could not find on the site.
</p>
<p>Please help me secure this account or delete it. I am really not comfortable having this stuff connected to my name and want to be able to use my phone again.<br />

                    <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Last year, my first skype phone number was cancelled because I didn’t renew it (actually I forgot). Unfortunately this number wasn’t available anymore and I couldn’t renew it. However, I continue receiving call on it, but I can’t call
 anyone from it, and I am not able to manage it.</span></p>
<p><span>So I was in the obligation to buy a new number, which I am using till now and should renew it in December 2017.</span></p>
<p><span>Now I am receiving emails for skype to renew the first number or it will not be any more available. When I am accessing to my account, I can’t find the first number to manage it.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone can clarify this case? </span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>actually, you have 2 accounts: skype account (the same as Microsoft account, but without "live:" and with dot in it) and microsoft account (starting with "live:").</p>
<p>On the Skype account, you had the number ending with <span>818 valid until today (20/9/2017).</span></p>
<p><span>On Microsoft account, you have still valid number </span><span>880 and it will be valid until this December, if you won't renew it.</span></p>
<p>That's why you can't see the number, but it is still yours and therefore you get e-mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this clarifies the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michal</p>

<h2>            Sharepoint item cannot be deleted even with admin access</h2>
                    <p>I have a simple Word document in a folder on SharePoint in Office 365. I wanted to update that document but on checkout I get
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The file ... is locked for shared use by user@domain". The user in the mail switches to whoever is logged in. I tried a regular account and SharePoint admin account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On trying to Edit Properties -&gt; Delete Item I get</p>
<p>"Sorry, something went wrong <br />
The specified file is read only. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80071779)"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On trying to right click and delete I get</p>
<p>"Error <br />
The file is currently checked out or locked for editing by another user.&nbsp;"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked compliance - its Not on Hold or subject to retention. Nobody else has it checked out. What beats me is why can't an account with admin permissions delete the file. It can't even delete the folder in which this file is. On trying to Delete the folder
 it gives</p>

<br />
Thanks for the private message.<br />
<br />
I have checked with our related team and found that the credit card for your Office 365 Business Premium (Month to Month) subscription is **** **** **** 8914. From your private message, I understood you want to use **** **** **** 4788 for the payment. Given
 the situation, please refer to the following article to update the credit card for your Office 365 Business Premium (Month to Month) subscription(<strong>Note</strong>: You need an administrator account for the steps).<br />
<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-update-or-remove-a-credit-card-in-Office-365-for-business-30ba9c83-50d8-4020-90ed-830a5b8c8724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add, update, or remove a credit card in Office 365 for business</a>.<br />

As a tip, please choose the accurate subscription <em>Office 365 Business Premium (Month to Month)</em> and then update the credit card information.<br />
<br />
However, if the issue persists, please share a full screenshot about the payment method for your Office 365 Business Premium (Month to Month) via the

            <p>Hi NetworkM,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the updates.<br />
<br />
We have checked your tenant information and found you have two active subscriptions under your tenant currently, One is Office 365 Business Essentials and the other is Office 365 Business Premium (Month to Month). As what mentioned above, the credit card for
 your Office 365 Business Premium (Month to Month) is **** **** **** 8914. The credit card for your Office 365 Business Essentials is **** **** **** 4788.<br />
<br />
According to the screenshot you shared, we can see the credit card for your Office 365 Business Essentials is **** **** **** 4788. As a result, please refer to the steps below to check if the credit card for your Office 365 Business Premium (Month to Month)
 is **** **** **** 4788(Note: You need an administrator account for the steps).<br />
<br />
1. Log into <a href="https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/Home?switchtomoderndefault=true#/homepage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Admin Center</a>.<br />
2. Navigate to <strong>Billing</strong> &gt; <strong>Subscriptions</strong>, on the left panel, select the Office 365 Business Premium (Month to Month) subscription. Here is an screenshot from my side for your reference:<br />

<p>
</p><p>As what you can see, I have two active subscriptions, Office 365 Business Premium Trial and Office 365 Enterprise E5 Trial. I choose Office 365 Business Premium Trial from my side.<br />
<br />
If the credit card for your Office 365 Business Premium (Month to Month) is **** **** **** 8914, please update it by referring to the article I mentioned above. However, if it is also **** **** **** 4788 and you keep receiving the declined payment notification,

<h2>            Microsoft Office 2013 Change&#47;repair fails - shows splashscreen and terminates</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 and need to perform a repair/change to add a feature that was emitted in the initial install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I click "change" in the Programs and Features-Window I briefly get to se the Office splash screen but then it just terminates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to perform a complete uninstall of the Office-suite and then reinstall it Again to get it to Work but this is not really a viable solution since I have got around 700 Pc's to administer right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            My Office 365 and Explorer do not work after resetting my Lenovo 13" computer/tablet...Nothing but problems, and Microsoft Tech Support did not resolve the problem. &nbsp;Told to rest computer, which I did; reloaded Office--an unsuccessful install TWICE--and
 Internet Explorer does not work in my e-mail program, while Google Chrome Firefox and other browsers do work. &nbsp;Windows 8.1 is glitchy and does not allow Office apps to load on the touch screen in 8.1....I am so darn frustrated after three weeks of this nonsense,
 lost productivity, maddening consumption of no less than 40 hours of software problems over the past two weeks--re-setting, re-loading software--MS software and applications--that do not work, or load properly!! &nbsp; Have been a devoted MS customer for severeal,
 several years, but not considering switching to a MAC.

<h2>            E75&#58; Windows Live Messenger downloaded - Why the Hotmail box</h2>
                    
<p>Ok I downloaded Windows Live Messenger onto my phone for free and it works a treat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only problem is I now have a hotmail box under 'messaging'. I don't use hotmail. My messenger login is not an @hotmail or @windowslive domain (its @xtra.co.nz)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I get rid of this hotmail box?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its not under the @mail icon either. Frankly I've tried everything to delete it.</p>

<p>It's not nokia that wants the mail box there, it is the developer of that application. It can only be removed by removing the entire application sadly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For using windows live messenger nimbuzz is a better alternative than fring as it supports more features such as smilies and is easier to manage multiple conversations.</p>

            a small suggestion: if you are using the phone memory as the messaging memory,swich it to memory card,install the application then switch the messaging memory aggain to phone memory,so the hotmail box will be hidden

            go to messaging then options then settings then other then memory in use: If it is phone memory, change it to memory card and if it is memory card change it to phone memory,its supposed to ask you copy all messages to new memory press yes Wait a moment
 (it may take a long time if you have a lot of messages) Now,the hotmail box should be hidden

<p>Hello, i have a problem. I have nokia e75 and i downloaded windos live messenger to my phone. When i am in my home wifi network, then everything is fine, it connects perfectly to windows live messenger, but when i am in school and using school wifi, then
 for some reasons it won't connect to windws live messenger service. It says windwosw live messenger sign-in failure. I don't think that is because of wifi signal strength, because signal strenght is almost full. Although when using my phone, then there is
 no problem surfing web, watching youtube videos etc..<br />
Weird thing is that, my laptop connects to windows live messenger service without a problem using school wifi network..<br />
I have latest software for e75<br />
Please could anybody help..<br />
Thank you..</p>

<h2>            Compressing pictures to reduce the size of a file in Word&#47;Mac doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    I’m saving/creating all my Mac word documents in the .docx format via my new “Office Home &amp; Business 2016 for MAC”. But the feature for compressing pictures to reduce the size of files is not working….it only saves the file in the High Fidelity (Maximum
 ppi) even though I request the E-mail (96 ppi) to apply to all pictures in the file command. It accepts my request but will never change/compress the file size....it's always back at the Max size. As you probably already know the max size for attaching a word
 doc file to an e-mail is tapped out at 30MB.

<p>You've misunderstood the process... it doesn't involve emailing the <em>document</em> itself. You save the document file on a cloud [such as OneDrive]. You are then able to have a
<em><strong>link</strong></em> created to the document which you forward to the intended recipients. When they receive the notification they click the link to view/download a copy of the file.</p>

    <title>save report design changes while working in shared .accdb file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gordon prince  say:</h3>
<h2>            save report design changes while working in shared .accdb file</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>I've got 10 users all working with Access 2010 in an .accdb file that resides on a server. The data is in SQL-Server, the tables are linked to the .accdb file. The users run queries that are saved in the .accdb file. They all need to be able to see the queries
 that they've all created, so that's why they're all using the same .accdb file. So far, so good. Multiple people can work running &amp; editing queries without problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the users also creates and edits REPORTS, and that's the part that's causing trouble. If this user is the first one to open the .accdb file, he can edit reports. Other people can edit and run queries, everything works the way they need it to. But
 if this user ISN'T the first one to open the .accdb file, he can't edit reports. He gets the error message "can't save design changes or save to a new database object because another user has the file open." So he has to figure out who else has the .accdb
 file open, have them close it, he opens it first, then they can open it and everyone can work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought if I set this user's "default open mode = exclusive", and as long as everyone else's default open mode = shared, that might allow my report editing user to gain control of the .accdb file when he opens it (if everyone else opened it in shared mode),
 but that didn't seem to have any effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas from anyone about how to enable this one specified user to always be able to edit reports in this .accdb file?</p>

            Good that you have a split database BUT EACH USER should have their OWN copy of the frontend.&nbsp; And users should NOT be making changes inside that database file.&nbsp; They should have their own separate file, linked to the backend or their frontend, with which
 they can make changes.&nbsp;

            I typically provide an ad-hoc query applet that allows users to create their own queries with the "definition" of the query stored in back-end tables. This applet has a button to send the results to Excel where they typically want the data anyhow.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>If a user has a report they would like included in the application, the developer can import it into the master front-end file and then distribute copies of the new master to each user.</div>

            The only way I see doing this, is to have a production version of the FE on a server somewhere. Then when a user finishes modifying or creating a query or report, they copy that object to the production version. When a user signs on, you can use update
 code that refreshes the local copy with the production version.

            <p>Having a procedure is what I'm trying to avoid. Only one person edits the reports, so one solution is for that person to always open the database first, then never close it, then they always have control of it. Other users can open it, create and edit queries,
 no problems. As long as the "report editor" user doesn't close the database, everything works the way we need it to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just thought there might be a way for the "report editor" user to seize control of the database based on permissions, opening arguments, etc. Maybe someone knows of VBA code I could put in the database that would promote the user who clicks on it to have
 control of the database. Which would be easier than calling everyone in the department and asking them to close the database for 60 seconds until the "report editor" user can be the first one to open it, after which everyone else can open it and work as they
 want.</p>

<br />
Why does this "report editor" need to edit the reports constantly?&nbsp; That doesn't make sense to me.&nbsp; When we deploy a frontend, the reports are available to run but no design changes are taking place.&nbsp; If you need dynamic stuff, you can accomplish that and not
 need someone to be modifiying structure.&nbsp; In fact, that SHOULD be your goal.

            <p>What are all these queries that the users are creating? Do they differ in their basic structure - e.g. different tables, different sets of fields? Or do they differ only in the criteria and sorting?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the latter, you probably don't need the users creating new queries; you could instead have some suitably flexible Parameter Queries, so that one stored query could serve all the users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do have "superusers" comfortable with SQL and/or with sophisticated use of the query design window, more power to you, but IME that's a rather exceptional situation!</p>

            <p>The workflow is along the lines of:</p>
<p>User1 creates or modifies a query, saves it with a new name, then has someone else in the work group carry out tasks for every item in the query. User1 might spend 30 minutes developing the query and reviewing the results, then User2 might spend 6 hours
 doing the work while User1 works on another query. User1 then gives User3 a different task based on the second query, etc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The queries have some commonality, i.e., the data is all real estate parcels, the work is all property tax appeals. So one query is "what are all the properties that had tax appeal hearings yesterday that were in Davidson Co, TN that had their tax assessment
 reduced". Another query would be same as previous but instead of "reduced" the criteria is "increased". Another would be "stayed the same". Every day there can be hundreds of properties that have tax hearings on them and there are multiple outcomes for each
 hearing, and based on that + the size of the property + the client's preferences + the law firm handling the tax appeals' opinion, different things are supposed to be done on each property. Creating queries seemed like the easiest way to pass around references
 to sets of the properties that wouldn't change once they were created. The queries are all similar, but often there are one time conditions, so while we use parameters in some of the queries, and people know how to edit queries, they keep creating new ones
 when there are never before used criteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said, this all works fine having multiple people using the same .accdb file that's on the server. They can run queries, create &amp; edit them -- no problems. It's only when someone wants to edit a report or macro that they need exclusive access, etc.,
 and the difficulties begin. Which is what I'm trying to come up with a solution for.</p>

            First, I think you are better off using Filters rather than queries. You can use Datasheet filtering to do your adhoc queries, then save the filter as a named file, and have other users apply that filter if they need to work with a specific set of records.
<div><br />
<div>As to reports, Again the question is what is being modified in the reports? If this is a standard set of data, use a standard report and apply a filter rather than modifying the report. So what if you sometimes get more data than needed.</div>

            <p>98% of the data use is with a VBA filled application I wrote -- everyone has their own copy of this application on their workstation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.9% of the data use is with queries, which users pass around as I described, which is implemented via a shared .accdb file that resides on the server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.05% of the data is worked with by exporting the set to Excel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.05% of the data is worked with via custom reports. This seemed like the easiest way to make formatted documents on an ad hoc basis. Everything that's been done before is saved and can be reused. It's only this process of twice a week trying to create a
 new report -- in a new format -- that is causing the inconvenience of requiring everyone close the .accdb file so the user who wants to create the report can do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I was wondering if there isn't some way to gain control of the (possibly) shared .accdb file. Everything else about Access 2010 is working fine. Just this one small, annoying thing that I was wondering if anyone had a workaround for.</p>

<h2>            Record sources that the wizard can&#39;t connect for a report</h2>
                    We record all employee time clocked each day in two buckets. The time is either billable or non-billable. I need to make a report that displays the totals for each bucket for either a specific person or the group based on a time frame. I started by making
 a query for each bucket and then tried to use the report wizard to pull in fields from each of the two queries but I got the following error message "You have chosen fields from record sources which the wizard can't connect. You may have chosen fields from
 a table and from a query based on that table. If so, try chossing fields from only the table or only the query." I had only selected fields from the queries that I had made. I did not include fields from the tables at all. What does this message mean and is
 there a way that I can make this work?

            <p>The fields in the queries <strong>are</strong> the fields in the Table. A query is nothing but a way to select and arrange fields from one or more tables; the data still resides in the table, and noplace else.</p>
<p>If the two queries are completely independent and unrelated, then you may want to consider an unbound Report with two Subreports, one based on the billable query, the other based on the non-billable. Alternatively, you may want to create a single query incorporating
 both groups, and use the report's Sorting and Grouping to present them separately. The details would depend on the structure of the table and the nature of your queries - post back with more info if you need more help.</p>

<p>As near as I can tell, Publisher does not have an option for printing booklets backwards. If you have the patience you can move each page using the page tabs (right-click)&nbsp;in 2007 or the Page Navigation in 2010. This works, but you will have to create page
 numbers manually. It might help to rename the pages so you can keep track of the order you want.</p>
<p>Hopefully your health booklets are not lengthy.</p>

            Similar issue for me too. Right to left page numbering worked fine in Publisher 2003 and not in Publisher 2010. I installed the Arabic (Egypt) and Hebrew language support.
<br />
Then, in Publisher 2010, I go to File / Options / Advanced and I see 2 sets of radio buttons for right-to-left and left-to-right but as far as page numbering is concerned, they have no effect regardless of which way they are set.<br />

            Yes, a very SERIOUS problem and Microsoft does not seem to care!
<div><br />
<div>And now Office 2013 - a lot of my right to left FONTS do not work any more!!! &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I now have 3 versions of Office installed on my system - 2003, 2010, 2013 so that I still have a way to print my right to left publications. &nbsp;</div>

            Does Publisher 2013 work properly with respect to page numbering from right-to-left?<br />
<br />
Is there any problem with having Pub 2003 installed alongside Pub 2010 on the same machine (under Windows 7?<br />
<br />
I don't see very much written about this problem; are we the only two people who use right-to-left?<br />

I cannot offer a solution to your printing issue, but yes you can have multiple versions of Publisher installed on the same machine. I currently have 4 versions on this particular machine. The main thing to remember is to do a custom install and opt out of
 overwriting the other versions. Usually you install the oldest first, followed by the newer versions. I install into custom named folders rather than the default locations. You cannot run more than one version of Outlook per machine. Reference this article

    <title>3-dimensional worksheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> randyschmidtuwm  say:</h3>
<h2>            3-dimensional worksheet</h2>
                    <p>I thought at one time Excel had 3-dimensional worksheet capability.&nbsp; I don't know it actually did or, if so, whether I understood its functionality correctly.&nbsp; But here's what I hope to achieve:&nbsp; I would like to create a worksheet with the first tab containing
 summary data from subsequent tabs.&nbsp; Each subsequent tab would itself a summary of information that is "drilled down to" by worksheets (or whatever they'd be called) BEHIND them in the third dimension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, Sheet1 is a summary of results on Sheet2.&nbsp; Sheet2 is a summary of results from several other sources, theoretically "going backwards" from that sheet.&nbsp; Does this capability exist?&nbsp; If so, how are the sheets in the third dimension created?</p>

            <p>The first tab summarizes the financial information for numerous projects.&nbsp; A project can be thought of as a financial entity with a budget, revenue and&nbsp;expenses.&nbsp; Each project's financial details are further detailed on other sheets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am working with data that is exported from a financial system into Excel.&nbsp; In the financial system, "revenue" is a number on the project.&nbsp; In this system, the number acts like a hyperlink.&nbsp; Clicking on the number reveals all the entries that comprise the
 summary number that appears on the project's revenue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The greatest level of detail is on the "third dimension" if the numbers on each project could be "behind" each project.&nbsp; This is hard to describe so I'll give an example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheet1 is a summary of the financial data from Projects 1, 2 and 3.&nbsp; Project 1 is on Sheet2.&nbsp; It contains a variety of numbers that are derived from additional sources.&nbsp; Let's call the first number "salaries".&nbsp; This number is a summary of all the salaries
 paid to people on the project.&nbsp; Clicking on "salaries" takes me to another page of information that contains these details.&nbsp; I can export this to Excel.&nbsp; If all I had is ONE project, I could have the summary on the first tab and the details on subsequent ones.&nbsp;
 But I have multiple projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To continue the example, Project 2 is on Sheet 3.&nbsp; It, too, contains numbers derived from additional sources.&nbsp; Let's call one of the numbers "supplies".&nbsp; This number is a summary of all the supplies incurred on the project.&nbsp; Clicking on "supplies"&nbsp;takes
 me to another page of information that contains these details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the information on all "pages" from my financial system can be exported to Excel.&nbsp; But I cannot figure out a way for this vast amount of information to be captured in one workbook without the third level of detail existing in what I'm calling the third
 dimension.&nbsp; I do not know if it's even possible in Excel.&nbsp; But if Excel has capabilities like Microsoft Access, where data bases can be constructed from multiple tables, that would serve my purposes.</p>

<h2>            Navigating in numeric bullets in Microsoft Word</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
I have a list of questions numbered by numeric bullets like</p>
<ol>
<li>s</li><li>s</li><li>s</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
Each bullet point is of variable length (from few lines to few pages). This makes me to scroll a lot to go to next bullet. I felt I can reformat to bullet to "Q.X." from "X." and search (Ctrl+F) for "Q." ans this will take me to next bullet point each time
 I hit next search result. However this trick didnt work as Word does not search in list's bullet text. That is it gives no searches for "Q.X." in list bullets but gives searches for "Q." whenever it appears in actual text/paragraphs.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
So what option I am left with?</p>

            <p>I wanted to navigate through the bullet points. Regardless the format of &nbsp;bullet points, below did the trick, though a bit weird and inconvinient approach. Yes but their no predefined way / solution to this as noted by others:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">Do a Find&gt;Advanced Find&gt;Format (down at the bottom) &gt;Style&gt;List Paragraph you should then be able to move to each of the next bullets.

            <p>This has been true but does not resolve this issue. I'd previously uninstalled the Hypervisor from Windows components and running this command again on Windows 10 Build 10525 does not resolve the issue of VirtualBox failing to launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe Oracle or the VirtualBox community has yet responded to this issue (other than pointing out that this is the early ring pre-release build of Windows).</p>

            <p>As someone else with the issue, I can answer some of Mike's questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; VBox works fine with 10525.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indications are otherwise. Do you have any confirmation of this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; What version of Vbox are you running ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>VirtualBox no longer launches any kind of UI or window on execution, so it's hard for me to check this. The last installer I ran was&nbsp;VirtualBox-5.0.0-101573-Win.exe, if that helps. The "Product Version" properties field for VirtualBox.exe is blank.
 I believe it's the latest version that was available as of early August. The manual just says version 5.0.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; Are you running the expansion pack ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not familiar with this, so possibly not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; Did you have the latest guest extensions on the 10240 guest os before updating ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I had the latest guest extensions, but since the VirtualBox client no longer launches on the host I don't see how this is relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; What is your base OS ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If by base you mean guest, then there are several. Again, I don't see how this is relevant since the VirtualBox manager no longer launches on the host.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; What error messages do you get. ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>None -- there is no indication of a UI on executing VirutalBox.exe and it doesn't list as a running process in Windows afterwards. Please let me know if there is some log file or similar that I can share with any possible errors or other information (I don't
 see one on glancing through the VirtualBox folders in Program Files, but I'm not sure where one might be kept).</p>

            Just to add a little more information, the current test build of VirtualBox (<span>102224) also does not launch on Windows 10 build 10525.</span>&nbsp;I wonder if this is related to the new memory manager in Windows.

            <p>Hi Kris,</p>
<p>I thought the OP was referring to Vbox RUNNING 10525 - not the other way around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tested Vbox on 10525 as the host (BASE) OS and yes, there is an issue. 10525 runs fine as a CLIENT in Vbox though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the OP, I cannot see that this is an issue of any importance at all, simply use 10240 rtm, IF you are relying on IP builds to run anything of importance then you are being foolish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cleanly reinstall 10240 you need to reinstall a qualifying OS - win 7 SP1 or win 8.1, THEN update to 10240 rtm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems as if MS has typically cocked up more things with this no event backward build. Trying to make it a phone OS for pointless little 'apps'&nbsp; is going to break a hell of a lot of REAL programs. However, MS feels that you should feel privileged to be
 testing this for them.</p>
<p>Well, the truth is - the testing is all done automatically - the IP builds act as a self reporting botnet. In reality, MS does not want or need actual user intervention. It actually gets in the way of them turning a perfectly good desktop into a perfectly
 dumb pointless phone.</p>

<h2>            Security Challenge in &#34;Recent activity&#34; log</h2>
                    <p>I keep seeing following in the "Recent activity". &nbsp;Most of these from the same IP Address (52.11.0.22) which can be traced back to Amazon Technologies. &nbsp;I have two step verification log in. &nbsp;I change my password frequently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does following activity indicates that someone is successfully logging &nbsp;into my Hotmail Account but may not be able to do the two-step verification? Is this because of some other App on my phone trying to get access to my Hotmail email account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!!</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The security challenge means on your recent activity does not mean someone was able to access your account. It only means that someone is trying to get into your account. If changing your email address is an option for you, you can try that. If you have
 any questions. Please let me know..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's&nbsp;a possibility that someone might be trying to access your account that's why you're getting that security challenge. But no worries, as long as you are seeing that "security challenge" it means that they have no access on your account.

            I have been having the same problem that you are having the past two or three weeks with a Security Challenge every single hour from an Amazon IP. I have changed my password several times and yet it still continues. Sometimes after changing my password
 it'll stop for a few hours but it always starts up again.

<h2>            Inserts fails on Subform based on view. Access bug&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All</p>
<p>I have a access project (adp) with a master/detail form.</p>
<p>The detail form have this recordsource "select * from ProjectPricesHours_v order by OrderGroups, OrderItems" and it's linked to the master form with the projectCode field.</p>
<p>I have stablished the UniqueTable property so, the subform is editable. I can edit and delete properly.</p>
<p>When I make a SQL Trace, Access send the following select command:</p>
<p>exec sp_prepare @P1 output, N'@P1 varchar(10)', N'SELECT&nbsp; *&nbsp; FROM (SELECT * FROM ProjectPricesHours_v<br />
) AS DRVD_TBL WHERE ((@P1 = "LinkField")) ORDER BY OrderGroups, OrderItems', 1</p>
<p>which it's correct.</p>
<p>When I try to insert a new record, Access generate the insert command correctly, by then, it try to retrieve the new record with:</p>
<p>exec sp_executesql N'SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM ProjectPricesHours_v<br />
ORDER BY OrderGroups, OrderItems) AS DRVD_TBL WHERE "PriceId" = @P1', N'@P1 int', 19115</p>
<p>which, <span>obviously, </span>throws sql exception:</p>
<p>"ORDER BY is invalid in views, inline functions, derived tables or subqueries, unless TOP is also specified"</p>
<p>Is there a workarround for this?<br />
Some one has the same problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards<br />
Miguel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>The solution is easy, after finding it:</p>
<p>I use to type a new line character between sql clasuses, ie:</p>
<p>select field1, field2<br />
from TableName<br />
order by field2</p>
<p>If the recordsource text have a new line character before the order by clause, the inserts fails. When rewrite the sql without new lines, Access throws the sql correct command:</p>
<p>exec sp_executesql N'SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM dbo.ProjectPricesHours_v) AS DRVD_TBL WHERE "PriceId" = @P1 ORDER BY [OrderGroups], [OrderItems]', N'@P1 int', 19126</p>
