<p>You have to ask Glarysoft.com, the maker of Malware Hunter, why they detect what etc etc.</p>
<p>AFAIK that is a commercial product and won't "resolve" anything before you fork out hard money....</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to upload the detected file to <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
VirusTotal</a> and see what they say..</p>
<p>And you might want to run some further scans with other tools, see this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/protect_other-protect_scanning/list-of-malware-removal-tools/d824b9af-ebd8-4c47-94e2-8ee6c544c100">

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Sorry about the delayed response - just got my internet connection fixed.</p>
<p>I tried to use the VirusTotal, however the file cannot be located on my computer.&nbsp; Tried the professional version of Malwarebytes - that cannot detect it.&nbsp; Malware Hunter still shows that it is a risk so I will try asking Glarysoft.com and let you know how
 they respond.</p>
<p>Thank you for the suggestions!</p>

<p>Glarysoft had me email a copy of the file.&nbsp; Only a portion of the file would send because my computer said it was a risk item.&nbsp; I have no heard back from Glarysoft.&nbsp; The upgraded version of Malwarebytes does not detect this, just the Malware Hunter.</p>
<p>My own research on the web finds that this is an add-on from Microsoft (something to o with running smoothly between 32 and 62 bytes - I didn't take notes and I am not a computer tech), others say it is a virus.&nbsp; I was finally able to run it on VirusTotal
 and it appears to be OK.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I now have McAfee Live Safe.&nbsp; McAffee does not flag this as a risk item.</p>
<p>So I am going to hope that it is a add-on from Microsoft and not worry.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone!</p>

<p>Are you indeed using Windows 7?</p>
<p>What is your Anti-Virus program? It is McAfee Live Safe, right? That's a full blown "security suite" which IMO is a bit much of everything but... that's your decision.</p>
<p>Why do you use Glarysoft's Malware Hunter? Are you paying for that? I'm not familiar with that product but I certainly wouldn't see any reason to use it and I think that you haven't heard back from Glarysoft is not such a great sign...</p>
<p>You are also using Malwarebytes Premium? </p>
<p>That's all quite an overkill in my opinion....</p>
<p>You're talking about an add-on. Are you using Firefox as a browser? What is the name of that add-on?</p>
<p>Could you post the link for that VirusTotal analysis which you made, please.</p>

<h3> ebindc  say:</h3>
<h2>            important emails stuck in outbox, need to get them sent and prevent this issue</h2>
                    <p>I access my msn email (paid annual subscription) via Google Chrome. &nbsp;There are crucially important emails that are stuck in my outbox. &nbsp;I can't send them, move them to drafts or even copy their content. &nbsp;If I open the email, only the first line is displayed.
 &nbsp;I've tried several ways to select and move them to drafts, tried clicking and dragging etc. &nbsp;There is no "send" button. &nbsp;I can't even delete them! &nbsp;They are well and truly stuck, and for days - they do not get sent when I take my laptop from home to office,
 etc. &nbsp;When I log into my account via Safari, there is no outbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help! &nbsp;How can I send, or at least copy? &nbsp;What is the problem and how can I prevent it? &nbsp;At this point, I feel like I have to switch to gmail but I would like to keep my msn.com email address which has worked for 20 years! &nbsp;I just spent over an hour talking
 to 5 people one after the other, the "virtual agent" joined my computer but wasn't able to help.</p>

            I need to send and/or retrieve the emails that are stuck in Outbox. There is usually no Outbox, only when something goes haywire and instead of getting sent, emails go to Outbox and I'm not able to move them to drafts, get them to send or even view and
 copy them.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why messages are being stuck in the Outbox or simply not sending immediately. The most common cause of this issue is that the message is too large to send because it has a huge attachment to it. To isolate your concern, we'd like
 to ask the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes prior to the issue?</li><li>Were you able to replicate the same issue using a different browser like Edge or Internet Explorer?</li><li>Are you getting any specific error messages?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far to resolve the issue?</li></ul>
<p>We look forward to your response. </p>

<p>Thank you Eileen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes prior to the issue? &nbsp;NO<br />
</li><li>Were you able to replicate the same issue using a different browser like Edge or Internet Explorer? &nbsp; When I access my email via Safari, there is no Outbox and the emails stranded in it are simply missing.<br />
</li><li>Are you getting any specific error messages? &nbsp; NO, in fact there is no indication that emails are not being sent. &nbsp;I only find out after several days, when it becomes clear people have not received email from me<br />
</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far to resolve the issue? &nbsp;No idea what to do which is why I am posting here. &nbsp;There is one message in particular that is very important for me to retrieve and NOT lose. &nbsp;It is meeting minutes from a
 2 hour meeting that I emailed to myself and did not save elsewhere. &nbsp;I have googled for troubleshooting but I can't even find the "tools" on my screen<br />
<br />
Thanks for whatever help you can offer!</li></ul>

    <title>Workbooks with UserForms will not open &#39;Class not recognised&#39; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mgtsta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Workbooks with UserForms will not open &#39;Class not recognised&#39; after recent update from MS</h2>
                    In the last few weeks, I have been unable to open Excel workbooks created by me that contain UserForms. After the warning about macros, the error message 'Visual Basic' 'Class not recognised' comes up. You can then proceed to open the workbook, but only
 if it repairs it. The result of the repairs is no VBA - not what I am needing.<br />
<br />
I have other workbooks with VBA, and I have had no problems with them; it is only those with UserForms that display this behaviour.<br />
<br />
I have Excel 2011 for Mac, for which I accept the standard updates.<br />
These workbooks operated successfully in 2011 until a few weeks ago. They also work fine in 2004.<br />
<br />
In despair, thinking that my Excel 2011 had become corrupted, I obtained a duplicate clean version of 2011 from my original supplier, and installed it on Tuesday. Hey presto - the workbooks worked again.
<br />
<br />
But then on Wednesday, I accepted the updates, which would have been aggregated, since my clean version was about 18 months old. Now my workbooks have the same problem again.<br />
<br />
It looks as though it is the recent update(s) that have caused the problem.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had the same problem?<br />
<br />
These workbooks are designed to be used by a large number of users with various versions of Excel, both Mac and PC. The compliant Mac users will have 2011, and will have accepted the latest updates. So these workbooks just won't work for them. The UserForms
 are integral to their functionality.<br />
<br />
Any solutions that will solve this problem both for me and my users?<br />

It been repeated several times that Macros and VBA are not 100% compatible except for one type<br />
<br />
One type I know of that will not work is Active-X .&nbsp; Active-X is banned on Apple has been, almost since Apple has existed.
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://word.mvps.org/mac/differences.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/mac/differences.html</a> this is an old article from MS that explains some.<br />
<br />
Despite doing a google search I can not find a line by line difference in VBA and Macros in PC and Mac. PC's use two versions That MS has addressed. The Active-X never will.

<p>If it were me, I would use File &gt; Export in the VB Editor. This saves your userform as a file. Then use File &gt; Import to bring the userform back in. It's a way to get rid of corruption.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Two problems.<br />
1. This affects *every* workbook I have with a UserForm, but no workbook without a UserForm. The problem went away when I installed a 'clean' version i.e. not updated, of Excel 2011. It came back when I accepted the updates. It's a bit hard to believe that
 every workbook with a UserForm contains something that is corrupt, but works with clean 2011 and 2004.<br />
<br />
2. Not sure how I could do what you suggest, since the only way I can open these workbooks in 2011 is to get rid of the VBA on opening, So I can't export the UserForms. And the export facility you describe doesn't exist in 2004.<br />
<br />

<p>If you select the range in Excel and then use Copy and then move Word and then use Paste, you will get a table in Word with the cells containing the data that was in Excel.</p>

<p>I think the following is probably the best you can do</p>
<p>Insert your empty matrix into the document, then paste the data from Excel into an adjacent location in the document, then use the convert table to text facility, then you can select the data from what was each of the cells in turn and drag it into the required
 place in the matrix.</p>

<br />	Follow these steps to verify your status or your Skype accounts:
<br />
<br />1. Go to www.skype.com and log in to your account.
<br />
<br />2. Where it says Account Details&gt; Settings and Preferences&gt; Click on Edit Profile.
<br />
<br />3. So that you do not appear anymore in Skype searches go down that page where it says "profile configuration" and uncheck where it says Detectability.
<br />
<br />	If your Skype account is already merged with a Microsoft email, deleting the account will unavoidably delete the email account unless it is from a different domain than @ outlook.com, @ hotmail.com, @ live.com or @msn. com.

<p>Thanks for the reply; however it's not the case in my Outlook 2010. &nbsp;I set the default email account in general setting; but the default email account in the calendar section next to the "From" tab is different from the default email account. &nbsp;I did change
 it manually to the default account I set; but next time it would default to that different account again.</p>

            Are you talking about the built-in onenote or the onenote metro. To set the pen click to onenote 2016 you need to se onenote 2016 application has default. Since you do have the metro version you can uninstall it. Doing so will make onenote 2016 has default.

            <p>The reason that you cannot set OneNote 2016 as the Surface pen default is that in Windows 10 the&nbsp;Surface pen button was changed to generate a ONENOTE-CMD event. Neither OneNote 2013 nor OneNote 2016 supports this protocol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 8.1 there was an update to Office 2013 that let the pen start OneNote 2013, but this didn't happen with Windows 10. It is a
<strong>bitter disappointment</strong> that a brand new version of Office has come out that doesn't work as well in this regard as Office 2013 under Windows 8.1.</p>

            <p>So this sounds like an easy fix -- update OneNote 2016 to be compatible with ONENOTE-CMD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They either need to update the desktop client or update the built-in app to give it the same features that the desktop one has because this is ridiculous.</p>

            <p>This works with my Surface Pro 4. &nbsp;I'm not sure if it will work with your SP3:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Open the Surface App. &nbsp;(If you don't have the app, install it from the Windows Store.)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Select the Pen set-up, at the left.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;For the Single-click, select "Launch a desktop app" from the pull down.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Browse for the OneNote 2016 app. &nbsp;It should be in c:\ProgramDataMicrosoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</p>
<p>
</p><p>That worked for me!!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Phone Build 10581 Installation Instructions for Lumina 810 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> z3rin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Phone Build 10581 Installation Instructions for Lumina 810 - Soup to Nuts 8.0 &#61;&#62; 10 &#91;Microsoft Device Restore Tool&#93;</h2>
                    <p>I had purchased a Lumnia 810 second hand which apparently came with 8.1 since I had no issues installing the Windows Insider application from the store. &nbsp;Things went fine with &lt;10581 but it just couldn't pull the latest update with the previous build. &nbsp;I
 even reset the phone but the updates still would not pull (I'm on the fast ring)
<br />
I finally attempted to downgrade but it could not, again getting another error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to use the Microsoft device recovery tool to get back to pre-Windows 10 and the tool worked, but it left me with 8.0 which has no direct upgrade method to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to include my steps with relevant links in case anyone else ran into the same issue. &nbsp;I've also found myself with many more stock apps left in place. &nbsp;This could be a burgeon or a bain depending on your feels about "extra apps".</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) Use the Microsoft Device Recovery Tool to restore your firmware</p>
<p>[link here]</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;I was left with Lumina Amber after this step, as expected... but 8.0 was not expected</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;If you attempt to load the Windows Insider app on 8.0 you will receive a message that the software is not &nbsp;available on your operating system, maybe your device isn't compatible... yadda yadda, lots of wrong.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;I would advise not turning on your backup to OneDrive for apps, or even signing in with your microsoft ID to the phone itself. You'll still need to sign in on the browser for access to the next download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) If you log into insider.microsoft.com from your phone, Developer Preview 8.1 is suggested as an alternate method for updating your phone with the latest and greatest if you are not quite up to doing the whole beta testing thing and really just want a
 working phone. &nbsp;In this case the Developer Preview 8.1 is a necessary step to get to 10.</p>
<p>[link here]</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">You will then be pointed to the Developer Preview app. &nbsp;This app loads without an issue on 8.0</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">You'll need to do one of 3 things here to get access.</p>
<ol>
<li>Register your device for $19 as a developer device</li><li>Start a new project with online AppDev</li><li>Find a Delorean and stop the sale of nuclear material to terrorists, though this has many steps on its own and you'll need to refer to another FAQ for the meat of this scenario.</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">(I went with #2 -- though I had previously paid $45 for a dev account with my ID -- it didn't seem to be enough to pass the test when I loaded up the app) Once you're registered as a "developer", the process is similar to Windows
 Isider, you opt in, agree with the legal stuff, and you're directed to your phone update screen where a series of updates will be downloaded. &nbsp;I think it took about 5 different updates and restarts before 8.1 actually downloaded and installed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.) Updates will ensue, and ensue, and ensue. &nbsp;When all is done, you'll see 8.1 in the System =&gt; About =&gt; More Details section. &nbsp;You may now download the insider app from the main page. &nbsp;You should be able to find it in the store but there are also many
 misleading apps which appear to have the same name / icon so it's best to use thelink from the site if you're not sure.</p>
<p>[link goes here]</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Your path to Windows 10 is now open. &nbsp;Proceed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>note: 11/13/2015 10:22 I'll be updating this with the links once I get full internet access (not blocked) &nbsp;I'll also be posting this on my site to hopefully be of use by anyone else stuck in the same mess after using the restore tool, or never got 8.1 before
 support for the 810 was discontinued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're going through this, please take some screenshots and send them along and I can add it to the post.</p>
<p>

            I know it's a little after the fact, but im also having this issue. I'm band 1 Lumia 950xl. No notifications whatsoever. Get texts and check on the band only to see "nothing new, check back later" or something to that effect.

<h2>            Adding page breaks into OneNote 2013 or something similar&#63;</h2>
                    Hey everyone,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I have been having issues with actually printing out onenote notes.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
For instance,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When i attempt to printout notes that I have created, the printout comes out very weird. When I select fit to page feature, all the text/images in my notes become way to small to actually read.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I deselect fit to page feature, The text becomes very large and all my notes are printing on different pages and image are cut off etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
Is there a way to have page outlines/page-breaks similar to the one in Excel where it shows you the limits of a standard letter page? I can't seem to find the function...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i have tried to use "Page size" function under the View tab, but this only produces 1 page, and I would not like to continue to making new pages for all my notes....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>
<div>Allan</div>

            <p>Hi Allan,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Unfortunately OneNote does not have a feature that allows you to preview the page outlines like Excel does. Thank you for the feedback, though!
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I print my notes from OneNote, I make heavy use of Print Preview. This helps me make sure that I know what my notes will look like before I send them to the printer. Personally, I like to check the "scale content to paper width" box in Print Preview.
 If my content looks too small with this option checked, I usually go back into my notes and decrease the width of my note container until my notes become readable. Although this is a manual process, it tends to work well for me. Let me know if you have any
 other questions!</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            <p>What a wonderful answer! I am wondering why the MS employee doesn't answer to this one? Perhaps MS will implement the page break function in Onenote 2020. Or even better: MS will cancel the service and development for Onenote without informing their customers,
 leaving all of them behind with an unusable piece of software beeing destroyed by the last security updates, making it impossible to open old files created with the application.</p>
<p>If you think thats not true, have a look at the windows journal. All people using the journal print function to write in documents with graphs can't open their old files. I thought I solved the problem for myself, by copying the old files from my old notebook
 (Win 7), but the last MS update totally destroyed my installtion of windows journal.</p>

<p>After the last update for Windows Journal i cant open all my old *jnt files with images and I have to use Onenote</p>
<p>A Page Break Option would be really helpful for me!!!</p>
<p>NOT HELPFUL IS YOUR PROPOSAL. I am using this software to work and time is often critical. Your proposal might be nice for one usage, but not for hours of work EACH DAY!!!</p>
<p>

I am a business owner of a high tech company, an am also leading the engineering dept among my other responsibility as a manager.&nbsp; I started to use Onenote in a way to structure all my meeting and other idea for new products. This is the most wonderful tool
 for this kind of application. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">
I am now using about 10 notebooks to manage 3 businesses and a large amount of meeting, accounting information, marketing, software and electronic products design, and so on.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">
This software could become a flash ship solution for Microsoft. As a matter of fact, I am not using Word any more to write report. Everything is done with Onenote 2013. In meeting I am using a Surface Pro3 I7 512gb as a replacement of all my paper log book.
 And I am now completely digital. For large report I am using my desktop computer and I use the surface as a digitiser almost in real time since the cloud allow me to do this.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">
According to me, Microsoft should invest massively to finish this product and make it THE TOOL for any one that takes notes on paper. As of now, I am the only one that uses it since I will not invest time and money to implement it through all my businesses.
 This until the software becomes a real tool, instead of some kind of free accessory to show the potential of going digital for note taking. I spend more than 15hours a week’s working with it, and I scan the web to find anything about Onenote that could make
 me more productive.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">
As of now, the deal breaker with OneNote are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Lack of page break on long note.&nbsp; When I use it in combination with the audio recording to take notes in meeting, I can’t swap pages. So I needed
 to take notes on the same pages. This is counterproductive to offer Audio recording and asking the user to change page to format is notes!</span></li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 1.125in">
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Group of graphical notes. With my surface pro 3 as with my surface pro 1 I am taking lots of hand written notes and draw lots of idea all time
 on big screen in meeting. It makes no sense that if I add information in the text above my hand writing, everything get misalign after it. A simple Group function would resolve this. Please add this basic functionality asap.</span></li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.125in">
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Page header text formatting . When using OneNote like I do, I end up with lots of pages under each Section. When I reach 25-50 pages under section
 it become critical to use long note instead of splitting pages to overcome the lack of Page Break. Even then, it’s hard to find your note back in the list. I use the Make subpages function all the time and close the group to make things more clear. I am using
 Mark as unread to highlight the most important pages that I am working on. This become annoying, since every time I work on it, I needed to redo it Mark as unread...&nbsp;
</span></li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 1.125in">
Could you find a way to allow text formatting to make these pages header in bold, color and all the other standard text formatting, so we can structure the information’s&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.125in">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">
Microsoft could make a hit against the Ipad that all my employees are presently using if they realise the true power if this tool with and without the Surface pro.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>it's nice to see that there are more people having the same problem with the page break function in Onenote.</p>
<p>I am a highschool teacher in physics and I also use the surface pro 3 as a replacement for the chalk board.</p>
<p>Since our students have their final exam each year and the time is very rare I often prepare worksheets for the students and fill them out in onenote via the "print to onenote" function in the lessons.</p>
<p>The problem ist that I take a lot of time in creating that students material and I fill out the worksheets myself and print them before the lessons so that I don't miss anything. That's why I have to print a lot with Onenote and the missing page break really
 annoys me. So i spend even&nbsp; more hours with Onenote a week. Before Onenote I used to write the notes in Windows Journal, but this software has been corrupted by the last security update.</p>
<p>I also see the Surface Pro 3 as a superior working tool compared to an Ipad that's more a toy than a productive tool for me.</p>
<p>I really hope that Microsoft is going on to further develop the Surface Pro 3 series. The Surface Pro 3 is nearly perfect. There are still some points to improve but for me, as a teacher, it is the best product on the market.</p>
<p>And I hope that some developers from Onenote take care of our suggestions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            <p>Dear SB_001,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can't decide for Microsoft what they should work on, and how they want to lead the industry. Nevertheless, us users, are part of a process and our responsibility is to give constructive feedback with good accuracy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on how serious Microsoft is in this competitive quest to lead a market, they will care or not about our comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This OneNote tool is truly the way to go if they want to make the difference against the other players. I just hope someone near the marketing department will read our lines and understand our needs. &nbsp;It is sad to notice that the average Microsoft Word user
 are using less then 10% of the software capability, and the growing customer base of OneNote needed basic functionality like the Page Break and it will take 10 years to implement it if we are lucky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's stay positive, and hope they will hear us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>

            <p>I teach math at a college and also use a Surface Pro 3 as a replacement for a chalkboard, white board or smartboard. &nbsp;Last year I used a Surface Pro 2 and before that I used a Lenovo tablet computer. &nbsp; The software I used was Windows Journal, but I had to
 stop using Journal when I switched to the Surface Pro 3 because apparently Journal doesn't work with Windows 8.1. &nbsp; I have "blank" lecture notes for my courses in MS Word files. &nbsp;These "blank" lecture notes contain lots of mathematical expressions, illustrations
 and graphs as well as blank space to "fill in" while explaining and working out the problems during lectures. &nbsp;The MS Word files are 100 - 120 pages long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This Sept. I switched to OneNote 2013 and I "print" my MS Word lecture notes into OneNote. &nbsp;Each MS Word page ends up on a separate page in a OneNote section. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Advantages to OneNote over Windows Journal:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>good for organizing the various documents associated with a course (I have worksheets, quizzes and exams as well as lecture notes)</li><li>tool for drawing straight lines and arrows is very useful in math</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Disadvantage of OneNote 2013:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I keep the &nbsp;"draw" tab selected and pinned while lecturing. &nbsp;Unfortunately the menu bar is unnecessarily deep and takes up quite a bit more area of the screen than necessary. &nbsp;I have tried transferring commands to the narrow "quick access" bar at the top
 of the page but some of the commands lose functionality. &nbsp;For example arrows, lines, circles, and axes from the "shape" command always come out in black ink instead of the colour of ink that has been selected (when using the draw command from the quick access
 bar)</li><li>The main disadvantage of OneNote comes when printing either on paper or into a pdf file. &nbsp;It puts an extra page between every page and sometimes prints one page over two pages. &nbsp;I print my filled in lecture notes, and solutions to worksheets and quizzes,
 into pdf files so I can post them on the Internet for the students. &nbsp;The results of printing from OneNote are confusing and unprofessional. &nbsp;Very disappointing</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface Pro 3 and OneNote have an enormous amount of potential and appeal for both students and faculty. &nbsp;Already several other faculty have seen my Surface Pro and ordered one too. &nbsp;Several students in each of my classes are also using their own Surface
 Pro 3 together with OneNote to take notes in class and do homework. &nbsp;(I provide the students with the MS Word files of my blank lectures notes and worksheets). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a huge market out there for the Surface Pro 3 and OneNote in academia (especially in math, physics, etc) because of the pen and inking ability. &nbsp;I sure hope MS fixes the problems with printing from OneNote soon. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>MS - I'd also really like to see an option to manipulate page breaks for printing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allan - In the meantime it's not a solution for existing notes, but for new notes you could set the default page size to letter or another printable size instead of auto. That way what you see in one note is what you print and you don't have to go into the
 page size setting for every page. It does detract from the open canvas experience though, and wouldn't be great for grouping multi-page printouts on a single page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are also addins that could help. Gem for OneNote 2013 has some mention of page breaks. It's not free though, and I'm still looking into these.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Making flashcards on Word 2016</h2>
                    So I'm trying to study for a test and would like to make some flash cards but I don't feel like writing them by hand. I have some paper that is 8.5" by 4.5" and I wanted to get 3 flashcards, with the term on one side and the definition on the other, on
 one sheet and I was just going to cut them into the three separate flashcards once they were done printing. I have a printer that can print both sides. Does anyone know how I can go about doing this with setting it up and everything?

            1, Create your 6 pages in Word
<br />2. Save as PDF.
<br />3. Now print from PDF. PDF Reader offers a lot of printing options which are not offered by word. Like you can print 3 pages on one side and 3 on the other side in PDF..Word will not offer 3 pages print.
<br />You will have to experiment to place your content in Word so that PDF prints appropriately.

<h2>            Windows defender virus and spyware updates couldn&#39;t be updated.  Error code 0x80070002</h2>
                    <p>Ok, I'm all for testing various updates to Windows 10, but there are certain things that Microsoft NEEDS to make sure is functional in ANY pre-release version.&nbsp; Every hacker in the world is looking for vulnerabilities in EVERY windows operating system.&nbsp;
 When you release a version that cannot update a/v or spyware signatures, why don't you just put on facebook "hey, guess what, we screwed up our latest test release and a/v and malware scanning isn't updating.&nbsp; Here's what you need to do to infect us!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, screw with features. Screw with the useless apps that advertise the latest version of Candy Crush that you can download from the store.&nbsp; For as much as I am concerned, screw with all the backdoors in Edge.&nbsp; When you open an operating system to
 malware and viruses, companies testing your software against things that are prerequisites for our government to use your software, you aren't any better than than the Office of Personnel Management release millions of extremely sensitive records relating
 to cleared employees with confidential, classified, and top secret ratings because you cannot secure your software.&nbsp; Stop wasting our time on you silly suggested games and work on the vulnerabilities to make this operating system something our government and
 our businesses and our consumers can feel secure using.&nbsp;This isn't a joke anymore.&nbsp; This is the world as we know it.&nbsp; Take some pride in your business.&nbsp; I'll be damned if your OS releases any more of my personal information to the Chinese, Russians, and Koreans.&nbsp;
 TAKE SOME PRIDE IN YOUR DEVELOPMENT! When the Chinese get yet another set of specs for atomic powered warships emailed through holes in your azure encryption protected Officee 365 environment, it's only Microsoft left to blame at how the US is now threatened
 against the sensitive information they expected that Microsoft's high levels of encryption sending to engineers with advanced weapons and power designs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and thank you for getting my finger prints sitting in a database over in China because you thought you had a handle on secret encrypted files.&nbsp; By the way, I'm thinking of change all my passwords to abc123 because that password has yet been hacked.</p>

 people would actually read the titles and information provided when someone posts a question, I'd bet that half of the pointless responses would be eliminated. &nbsp;But for your benefit, is this why I am thinking my updates are failing. &nbsp;Is that clear enough for

<h2>            Nokia 8880 Sirocco</h2>
                    I have bought a 8800 sirocco and I was wondering if it fake or original<br />
<br />
At the back it says model: 8800d and type:RM-13<br />
<br />
When I hit *#0000* it says<br />
<br />
8800 Sirocco Edition<br />
V 03.93<br />
18-10-06<br />
RM-165<br />
<br />
<br />
And the worst battery lasts for only a day

            Sounds about right. I don't any screen savers and have the sleep mode on so the screen is blank if the phone is not in use (though comes up with a symbols for missed calls/messages and stays on until you view the messages).<br />
<br />
I'm a low user, and get around 3 or 4 days out of my battery, though the phones is switched off at night.

<h2>            Word 2007&#58; Slow typing when picture in header &#40;DOCX but NOT in DOC&#41;. Also Slow typing in Print view but not draft view. Solution&#63;</h2>
                    When inserting a picture logo into the Word 2007 header, typing in Word becomes extremely slow. If the document is saved as a .doc then typing is once again normal. If saved as a .docx then typing is very slow. Also, typing is very slow when in Print View
 but not in draft view.

    <title>Authentication issue with exchange online and outlook 2010 under - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marc-agg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Authentication issue with exchange online and outlook 2010 under windows 8.1 32bit</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We recently migrated our company over to Exchange Online.&nbsp; The transition went smoothly and all 21 users can access their e-mails fine whether through their mobile phone, IMAP software or Outlook 2010/2013 except for one user which we're unable to connect
 through their outlook 2010.&nbsp; The account can be accessed through other computers from outlook&nbsp;and can be access normally through IMAP, Mail or mobile phones.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On the user's machine, Outlook will establish an internet connection, find the exchange online settings for the account&nbsp;but will fail when it comes to logging in to the account by constantly rejecting the password.&nbsp; We have obviously verified&nbsp;multiple times
 the spelling of the password and that the keyboard and locale settings&nbsp;are functioning correctly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here are the&nbsp;relevant details :</p>
<p>- Exchange Online (latest server version)</p>
<p>- Windows 8.1 32-bit (Acer Iconia tablet)</p>
<p>- Office 2010 Home &amp; Business Edition</p>
<p>- Latest&nbsp;version of Microsoft Online Services Sign-In assistant (MOSSIa) is installed</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried all options to solve this I can think of :</p>
<p>- deleting outlook profile and starting from a&nbsp;blank one</p>
<p>- use different sources for the MOSSIa (from the outlook.office365.com webpage and the microsoft download center)</p>
<p>-&nbsp;uninstalled all non-microsoft Desktop software not related to drivers from the computer to&nbsp;rule out program&nbsp;interference</p>
<p>- Windows 8 reset (return to factory default)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My guess is that there is an issue between Windows 8 and MOSSIa because when we attempt to do a repair of MOSSIa from the copy downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center, it throws us a network error saying it is unable to read the install file&nbsp;(and we
 saved the&nbsp;installer locally to the desktop so a network error&nbsp;should not be&nbsp;possible in this case).&nbsp; From the same installer, we can however uninstall and install the software without errors.&nbsp; We obviously tried to re-download the file in case it was corrupted
 during download and also retried through the outlook.office365.com website's setup wizard&nbsp;and it didn't resolve our issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any suggestion for troubleshooting this issue would be most welcome.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>PS : This is our only user with windows 8 and office 2010, all of our other windows 8 users use office 2013 and all of our other office 2010 users use windows 7 with no issues.&nbsp; As far as I can tell, this is a windows 8.1, office 2010 and exchange online
 issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea how it got fixed because we didn't change any settings but I tried logging in with my account on her outlook as the first step of the troubleshooting process and it worked. I then started to assume it was an issue with her account but, as
 a test, I deleted the outlook profile with my account in it and tried again with the user's account and it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know neither me nor the user changed anything so I'm stumped but it worked so no complaints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi.<br /><br />Unfortunately you can’t change your Skype name/id or username because it’s permanent. But you can change your display name clicking on your profile picture and then scroll down to see your display name and change it.

    <title>Error message when accepting Family &#40;Adult&#41; invitation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jdilloncd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error message when accepting Family &#40;Adult&#41; invitation</h2>
                    I'm trying to add my husband and my son to my Microsoft account. My son has NEVER received his invitation (sent and resent more times than I can count to both his school and gmail accounts), and my husband's invitation "worked" only partially. He got his
 email invite but when clicking on the 'accept' button, Microsoft gives an error message that "something's wrong on our end, please wait." Wait for what? How do we proceed? Anyway, when I restarted the laptop, both my account and his account appear on the log
 in screen. Big problem, though. He's got an account but it was never truly created so there is no password or way to reset the password. This is more frustrating than it should be.
