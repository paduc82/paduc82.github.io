    <title>Internal Wireless Adapter Disappeared from Device Manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zenyatta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internal Wireless Adapter Disappeared from Device Manager</h2>
                    
<p>I have an HP Pavilion dv9428nr.&nbsp; The internal wireless network adapter is a Broadcom 802.11b/g.&nbsp; For some reason, it disappeared from my system so I could not connect wirelessly to my network.&nbsp; It no longer appeared in Device Manager.&nbsp; I tried everything
 to restore it, but nothing worked.&nbsp; So I eventually bought an external USB network adapter.&nbsp; I could connect to my home network but could not get an internet connection.&nbsp; I took it in to a service center and they determined something was preventing the internet
 connection.&nbsp; They removed all outdated networking utilities and anti-virus/firewall software, but still could not get&nbsp;an internet connection.&nbsp; They suggested that I do a system recovery.&nbsp; Before doing that, I decided to bring&nbsp;my laptop home&nbsp;and to my surprise,
 my Broadcom was back and appearing in Device Manager.&nbsp; I thought I was back in business.&nbsp; I connected to my home network but still could not get an internet connection :(&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried&nbsp;assigning a static IP address, the DNS server, etc.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;kept getting&nbsp;a message
 regarding the SymNetDrv Firewall Filter.&nbsp; I downloaded the Norton Removal Tool and ran it to remove Norton completely.&nbsp; It worked perfectly, but now my internal Broadcom wireless adaptor has been disabled again and does not appear in device manager.</p>
<p>Why would running the Norton Removal Tool cause the internal wireless adapter to disappear?&nbsp; Will it be necessary to do a system recovery?&nbsp; I'd like to avoid that if possible.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Log tp HP's supprt page of the computer. Download the latest drivers for you card and try to install them.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Wireless in general.</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wireless card entry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wireless card's Drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wireless Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility the utility is Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</p>
<p><strong>Working TCP/IP stack should look this way.</strong></p>
<p>Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg</a></p>
<p>Description is the card manufacturing data.</p>
<p>Physical address is the card's MAC number.</p>
<p>The xx should be a number from 0 to 255 (all xx same number).</p>
<p>yy should be from 0 to 255</p>
<p>zz should be from 0 to 255 (all zz the same number.</p>
<p>The lease date should be valid to the current time.</p>
<p>*Note 1. IP that starts with 169.xxx.xxx.xxx is not valid functional IP.</p>
*Note 2. There might be an IPv6 entries too. However, they are not functional for Internet traffic or LAN. They are needed for Win 7 special HomeGroup configuration.
<p>---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If everything above is OK you have to be able to connect to the Router.&nbsp; A Window that says Connected does not means that your are really connected. Connecting to the Router means that you can enter the Router's core IP into an address bar of a browse,&nbsp;
 be able to connect, see, and configure the Router's menus. If it does not connecting to the Router log from any computer that can connect to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, (make sure that the Wireless broadcast SSID) is On,&nbsp; and
 try to connect with No Wireless security.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>I really checked and configured every thing and it does Not work.</strong></p>
<p>Software Firewall application that is Not configured to allow local traffic (between the computer and the Router is a possible issue too.<br />
some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd party software is
 uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is <strong>On </strong>

<p><span>Hey bobbar3,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do you get the same error code while copying pictures to other location on the drive?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This error might indicate that some Windows files are missing, altered, damaged, or unreadable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here are two things you can try.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Run <span>
System File Checker (SFC) scan.</span> </strong></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>

    <title>Xbox 360 HD VGA Cable. No Sound - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richey656  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 HD VGA Cable. No Sound</h2>
                    
<p>Warning. I am not very techy. Sorry if I don't understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently bought a HD VGA cable for my xbox to hook up to my TV. The video is perfect, however I am unable to get any sound. Someone told me that the VGA cable does not transmit sound, but then I don't understand why there is a white and red wire.&nbsp;Before
 anyone suggests I buy a HDMI cable, I can't because I have a rather old xbox with no HDMI output. I tried doing what Xbox Support says here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/audio-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/audio-video</a></p>
<p>This, however, did not work. If someone could help me with this problem, it would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No, this did not seem to change anything. I also tested with my old component AV cable and the sound works fine on that, so it is not a problem with the TV.

<p>It could be you need to change a setting on the TV itself. When using VGA some TV's require you to set the VGA port as PC or something else. Could you check the TV manual to see if this is the case.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If you could post the make and model of your TV I would be more than happy to locate the TV manual online and check this out.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>It's also worth checking to see if the TV has more than one set of audio inputs.</p>

<p>Hi, looking at the manual on the link you provided I see the TV has two sets of audio connectors, one is marked Y L R ( audio input ) the other just L R ( audio output ), you're using the Y L R but not connecting an audio cable to the Y is that correct ?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Could you also check in the TV audio settings that TV speakers is set to on when you're using the VGA cable please.</p>

<p>It may also be worth going into the console audio settings and trying various output modes.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>There is also of course the possibility that the audio leads on the VGA cable are faulty.</p>

<p>Hi, Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. Hope you can help me further as I'm not familiar with Notepad. I followed the steps you indicated in this order:</p>
<p>1. Copied the steps</p>
<p>2. Opened Notepad</p>
<p>3. Pasted the steps</p>
<p>4. Right clicked and "Saved as" (update.bat)</p>
<p>5. Sent it to Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I ran into trouble...</p>
<p>6. I right clicked on it but I didn't see&nbsp;<strong>Run as Administrator </strong>
(and that's as far I could go)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you tell me what I missed or did wrong so I can complete the process and fix this issue?</p>
<p>Your help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Efax</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Another person wrote in reference to your post:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"You neglected to mention that following those instructions will wipe out the Windows Update history."</strong> Is that true?</p>

<p>Thanks for the update, Efax. Windows Update history is only log which shows records of update installations. Like when an update fails or gets successfully updated, it would show there. If you want to see installed updates, go to
<strong>View Installed Updates</strong> in <strong>Programs and Features </strong>
on <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's further troubleshoot. Are you on an Admin account on your device? Does the Run as Admin option also run on different files like .exe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll be waiting for your reply.</p>

<p>Hi again, Ian...and thank you for staying with me on this issue. Well, I have good news. By fumbling around (trial and error) with&nbsp;<strong>Programs and Features
</strong>I clicked again on <strong>Windows Updates</strong> and found out that a total of 347 updates were already installed - out of which 218 were for Windows Updates and Windows Security.</p>
<p>Subsequent to that I clicked again on <strong>Check for Windows Updates</strong> and, to my surprise, 54 new updates were installed without a glitch. Also, under&nbsp;<strong>Features</strong> there was a choice to
<strong>Run as Administrator </strong>but since the issue had been resolved I didn't use it. My computer name is Home-PC.</p>
<p>I should also tell you that I had purchased a Computer Repair Program online that is called ReImage that was supposed to fix all Windows related issues (replace corrupt files, remove malware, etc.) I don't know if you are familiar with this program or what
 you think of it. But I tend to believe that since my issue was resolved the program is legit and may have helped.</p>
<p>At any rate, it looks that the issue has been taken care of. Please, let me know what you think. Your opinion is very importante to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to thank you one more time for trying to help me so diligently. Also, I'd like to know if I can contact you in some way if, in the future, I should run into another situation with my computer. It would be extremely valuable to me.</p>
<p>All my best to you.</p>

<h2>            Power issues with microsoft and ipod shuffle 2nd gen</h2>
                    So I've been dealing with this issue since windows 8. I can sync ipod, it's recognized by itunes but it will not charge. &nbsp;All the fixes I have tried from this site do NOT work, ie: power management, usb ports etc. &nbsp;Device manager says there is an error
 and windows is uninstalling this device, Code 21. This problem has followed me to Windows 10, with all the same info as above, so have been using my Linux comp to charge, because for some reason, there is absolutely no issue with it, all works as it should.
 &nbsp;It's really a **** situation, I would like to be able to charge on my windows 10 comp, rather than having to start up the linux comp every time I need to charge my ipod. &nbsp;I see lots of posts here about the same problem, so I can't be alone here. Has anyone
 found a real, working solution for this???

<h2>            BAD SYSTEM CONFIG INFO and buzzing</h2>
                    <div>Hello!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>THE PROBLEM:</div>
<div>I am using Windows 10, Acer laptop Aspire F5-573T. The stop code on the BSOD read "BAD SYSTEM CONFIG INFO." It's in a loop of unsuccessful Automatic Repairs.</div>
<div>https://image.ibb.co/bPWhSA/image.jpg</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>CIRCUMSTANCES:</div>
<div>Rarely my laptop would make a loud noise coming from the left fan vent (?), specifically when I moved around my house with it. I would put it on sleep mode for half a minute to stop it. However this time the noise would start again quickly after turned
 off sleep mode so instead opted to turn it off completely. Noise wasn't there when turned back on but got the BSOD. It was working fine minutes prior.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Here's where the noise was coming from</div>

<div>https://image.ibb.co/bvhHuq/image.jpg</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>While running the chkdsk prompt, which took maybe four hours, the noise started twice and lasted a minute or so. Recorded the noise</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS:&nbsp;</div>
<div>Can't go into Safe Mode, System Restore wouldn't work, go back to the previous version wouldn't work, both Reset this PC options wouldn't work. "There was a problem resetting your PC. No changes were made."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Command prompts</div>
<div>bootrec.exe /rebuildbcd</div>
<div>bootrec.exe /fixmbr</div>
<div>HOWEVER got an access denied from</div>
<div>bootrec.exe /fixboot</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>MD backup etc</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Ran a chkdsk, here's what it said</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>CONCLUSION:</div>
<div>Right now what I think I need to do is clean my laptop, the vent aka where noise was is particularly dirty when examined, and perhaps a Windows 10 reinstall with a disc or a USB. I'll need to go to a computer repair shop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would GREATLY appreciate any thoughts on this. I really want to pinpoint exactly what is wrong and what I need to do. Can a hardware issue lead to this BAD SYSTEM CONFIG INFO? I'm just confused how it's correlated, I'm almost certain it's a direct result
 of the noise considering what it was doing just before all this started.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be amazing. It's relatively new, got it maybe a year ago, but surprisingly warranty ran out. I'm pretty clueless here and never gone to a computer repair place.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

<br />If nothing works, Clean Install is the last option. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

            Thank you Vijay! Sorry if this is a stupid question, but is booting up with a USB or a clean Windows reinstall something a typical laptop repair place can provide? I'm thinking yes? I'm getting pretty tired with monkeying around with it myself and if I
 could just pass it off to someone more intelligent than me than I'd be over the moon haha thank you again though, I appreciate the response.

 the manufacturer has no website).
<div>My problem is that windows recognizes the gear shifting paddles as being the same as the pedals. It should be 14 buttons, not 12.</div>
<div>So if anyone can help, anything at all, please do.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 broke the sound on my laptop. Windows 10 broke the OS on my TW800 Winbook.</h2>
                    <p>I tried three times &nbsp;to install Windows 10 from the Win 10 links and it broke&nbsp;my Winbook TW800&nbsp;tablet. The tablet would only hang and become non-functional. With the three strikes rule I'm not interested Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my HP laptop Windows 10 broke the sound on my headphone jack. It took much time and effort to find a suitable driver. The newer drivers won't work. I had to find an older audio driver in order to have sound on my HP laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far my experience with Windows 10 is one star or perhaps half of a star.</p>

<p>Hi Harvey,<br />
　<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. <br />
We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to boot the system to desktop mode? If so, then follow these methods below and check, if it works:</p>
<p><br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to run the System Maintenance troubleshooter and&nbsp;the steps are mentioned below:<br />
　<br />
1. Type ‘Troubleshooting’ in the search bar and press Enter. <br />
2. Click on ‘View all’ on the left panel of the ‘Troubleshooting’ window.<br />
3. Click on ‘System Maintenance' and follow on the screen instruction.　 </p>
<p><br />
If the issue still persists, follow method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, let’s try to perform a clean boot and check, if it works. Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.<br />
　<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows: </strong></span><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />

</span></span></span><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>applies to Windows 10.</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.
</p>
<p>　<br />
You can also refer to the following link, to learn how to optimize the hard disk to improve performance of your system.</p>
</span>
<p><span><br />
One of the best ways you can improve your PC's performance is by optimizing the drive.<br />

<p>
<span>
</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 3:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, I suggest you to use windows 10 DVD and perform Startup repair process, reset your PC, or get to advanced troubleshooting options from installation media:</p>
<ol>
<span>
<p>
</p></span></ol>

<li><span>On a working PC, go to the </span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=616447/t_blank" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>Microsoft software download website
</span></span></a><span><span>and create Windows　10 installation media. </span></span></li><li>Insert the installation media you created, and then restart your PC. </li><li>On the <strong>Install Windows</strong> screen, select <strong>Repair your computer.</strong> (If you’re not seeing this screen, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's website for info on how to change your PC's boot
 order, and then try again.) </li><li>On the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen, select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>. From there, you can:
<ul>
<li>Restore from a system restore point by selecting <strong>Advanced options</strong> &gt;
<strong>Startup repair</strong>. 　</li></ul>

            i had installed windows 10 and even though 3 techs tried to help they stopped the flashing screen but could not do anything about the glitch in apps and store so they restored my desktop to 8.1 I wanted to know if this glitch has been fixed so I can go
 to windows 10 on my desktop as it works great on my laptop

            <p>That's an impossible question to answer, because there are millions of Windows 10 Users with no problems at all following the upgrade; and then there are those that do have problems that need resolving, as can be seen in the message threads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was obviously something in your setup/system that didn't work 'nicely' with the upgrade, so you would need to ask someone with precisely the same setup hardware and software setup to get an answer to the question and even that couldn't be a guarantee
 that you wouldn't experience any problems. &nbsp;A lot issues are down to driver and software updates required from the hardware and software suppliers, so all I can recommend is that you check with your PC/Laptop Manufacturer's Support Site for confirmation that
 your PC/Laptop model has been checked for compatibility with Windows 10 and that you install any BIOS and Driver Updates that are available direct from them. The same goes for any other external hardware you attach to your computer because they all need to
 be compatible.</p>

<p><span>Hi Sagegrp,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you remember making any software/hardware change after which the issue started?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you get the same error if you try to create shortcut in any other location apart from desktop?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you logged in to an Administrator account?</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure that you have enough disk space to save or cerate shortcuts on the desktop. Right click on the drive that has Windows Installed and then
 select properties to check the free disk space remaining.</span></p>
<p><span>Try the steps as below and check if it helps.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue doesn’t persists in safe mode then, place the computer in a clean boot state and troubleshoot the issue. You can start Windows Vista
 or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<h2>            VMCPropertyHandler.dll Not found error</h2>
                    
<p>Start &gt; Windows Virtual PC &gt; Windows XP Mode shortcut link is broken. <br />
[The Error message read]<br />
<strong><em>There was a problem starting <br />
c:\Windows\system32\VMPropertyHandler.dll <br />
The specified module could not be found.</em> </strong><br />
<br />
I tried all the <strong>fixes</strong> I could find on the net, then - I tried uninstalling, then re-installing<strong>XPM</strong> &amp;
<strong>VPC</strong> . I've gone through so many steps, so many times, I can not remember exactly what I did, nor in what order, but... It appears, I am unable to make a<strong>complete uninstall</strong> , because running
<strong><em>WindowsXPMode_en-us.exe</em></strong>(the install file for XP Mode</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To Uninstall/Remove XP Mode &amp; Virtual PC I followed the instructions posted at<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee431673%28WS.10%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em>Remove Windows XP Mode, virtual machines, or Windows Virtual
 PC</em> </strong></a><br />
<br />
<strong><em>Windows XP Mode</em> </strong>was listed in "<em>Uninstall or change a program</em> " - I Uninstalled it. I then expanded "View installed updates", but "<strong><em>Windows Virtual PC (KB958559)</em></strong>" was
<strong>Not</strong> listed. (I also followed the directions -<em>To delete a virtual machine</em> ).<br />
<br />
So now I'm stuck... I was hoping to re-install, then un-install to clear everything, then re-install, but something stays behind, either in the Registry and/or the Direcotries that I've not been able to find. Can someone tell me what I need to do to have a
 successfull install of VPC &amp; WXP? <br />
<br />
I do not think <strong><em>Hardware-Assisted Virtualization</em> </strong>is an issue with this, I have the BIOS setup<br />
correctly, and my Hardware is fine</p>

<h2>            Create Desktop Shortcut to open Start Menu &#40;Metro&#41; Screen&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to make a desktop shortcut to open metro (Start Menu). I know there are ways to make desktop shortcuts for metro apps, but I wan to make a shortcut I can place on my desktop that actually opens metro as if I had moved the mouse over to the bottom
 left corner of the screen and opened it from there? There has to be a way?</p>

            <p>1. Create a text file and name it <strong>start.vbs<br />
</strong>2. Edit the file and paste in the following code<br />
<strong>Set objShell = CreateObject ("WScript.Shell")<br />
objShell.SendKeys "^{ESC}"</strong></p>
<p>3. Save the file to your C drive and create a shortcut to it and put the shortcut on your desktop.<br />
4. Right click on the shortcut and change the icon to something from you want, or you can create a custom icon, I did this by finding a windows 8 logo on the web and taking a snip of it.</p>
<p>5.Put the newly create shortcut on the lower left of your desktop, and now you have a icon to get you to the start screen, bypassing the lower left corner hover.<br />
