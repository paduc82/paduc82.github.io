<h2>            Printing problems in Internet Explorere 8 - will not &#39;Shrink to Fit&#39;</h2>
                    I am having recent printing problems - using Internet Explorer 8, I have the printer settings set to scale to fit the page, but it will not do that anymore - I have to manually open Print Preview and reduce the percentage to get text, etc to fit the page
 (if I try to check 'Shrink to Fit' it does nothing - I must select a percentage).&nbsp;This just started happening in the last month or so.&nbsp; Also, in my Outlook Express 6.0, if I try to print emails, the first page is 'chopped off' on the right side, making the
 first page useless.&nbsp; I have not been able to find a fix for either of these situations, which started occurring at the same time.

            Hi <strong>carolcaslow</strong>,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<p><strong><span>Thank you for posting on &nbsp;Microsoft Windows 7 Answers Forum</span></strong></p>
Try these steps and veirfy if it resolves the issues:<br />
<strong>Webpage Printing:</strong><br />
Some webpages specify exactly where text should print on the page. If the webpage you're printing specifies exactly where the text should print, Shrink To Fit will not work. You work around this problem by setting a custom scale factor in print preview. For
 more information about print preview, see <br />

&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Printing Outlook Mails:</strong><br />
I would suggest you to check the borders scaling setings while printing from the Outlook.<br />
You can refer to the articles under the link below for troubleshooting prinitng problems in Outlook.<br />

<h3> tony welle  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP C5180 Printer Will not print using spooler after Windows 7 &#40;64-bit&#41; upgrade</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my Dell from Vista Home Premium 64 to Windows 7 Home Premium 64. Originally, the printer partially&nbsp;worked after the upgrade, but would not scan. (Original 32 bit HP Solution Center SW). Reviewed HP's site and downloaded the Windows
 7&nbsp; 64 version of the software &amp; drivers (AIO_CDA_Net_Full_Win_WW_130_140). ALso installed the Dot 4 reboot patch. It appeared to install without any errors, not the scanning works and printing a test page from their application works. Attempting to print using
 the spooler yeilds the following error in the Administrative Events log:<br />
<br />
<span>
<span>
<p>The document http://www.msnbc.msn.com/, owned by Walter, failed to print on printer HP Photosmart C5100 series. Try to print the document again, or restart the print spooler.</p>
<p>Data type: NT EMF 1.008. Size of the spool file in bytes: 1115756. Number of bytes printed: 0. Total number of pages in the document: 1. Number of pages printed: 0. Client computer: \\KITCHEN-PC. Win32 error code returned by the print processor: 2147500037.
 Unspecified error<br />
<br />
<br />
I validated that printer sharing is enabled. I alsoi tried printing directly to thew printer and get the error 0x7e. HP print Diagnostics says everything is fine, so does the printer troubleshooteer.</p>

            Disconnect the printer from the PC.&nbsp; Uninstall, if possible also using an Uninstall utility from HP's website.&nbsp; From Devices &amp; Printers, highlight any printer, then click on Print Spooler Properties (top right), click on the Drivers tab and ensure that
 the driver for the C5180 is indeed gone.<br />
<br />
Download the software from HP's website and try it again.&nbsp; Do not reconnect the printer until the software tells you to do so.

<br />
Check the running state of Remote Access Manager Service

    <title>Repeated keystrokes problem, not hardware. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacksonfelty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repeated keystrokes problem, not hardware.</h2>
                    Okay so I'm not quite sure what the problem is, but I have encountered a problem where various keys will repeat&nbsp;indefinably&nbsp;and in rapid succession. I&nbsp;believe&nbsp;I have ruled out hardware as the issue though. I am using a Razer Anansi keyboard, so when the
 issue began I opened up the software it came with and&nbsp;disabled&nbsp;the problem key, however it continued to repeat. The issue has always began whilst playing the online MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic, but remains after the game has been closed and the only way
 to stop the repeating is to fully shutdown the computer, even after a restart the issue still&nbsp;persists. I think the issue might somehow be related to alt tabing in and out of the game, but I am not certain and the game may have nothing to do with it at all
 and I have been unable to find any other people having the same issue through the CS forums on their site. I have &nbsp;also updated the drivers for the keyboard, hoping that would fix the issue, but it happened again with a different key. I also did a full sweep
 for viruses, malware, etc. and came up clean. Also not sure if this helps at all or not, but when I had the issue with the restart, I restarted again and&nbsp;unplugged&nbsp;the keyboard while it was off to see if it would get better just using the on screen keyboard,
 but no change. I'd&nbsp;appreciate&nbsp;any help or insight that can be offered, thank you for taking the time to read all that.&nbsp;

Please check the settings to make sure they match these.<br />
<br />
<div><strong>If you’d like to manage your Outlook account using an email app, you’ll need to set up your POP3 or SMTP server and port settings in your email app. You’ll need the following info:</strong><br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; POP3 server: pop3.live.com (port 995)</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SMTP server: smtp.live.com (port 25)</span><br />
<br />
<span>If port 25 has been blocked in your network or by your ISP, you can set the SMTP port to 587 with TLS or SSL Encryption (depending on which email app you're using).</span><br />
<br />
<em>Choose the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) option for both POP3 and SMTP connections.<br />
Choose the SMTP authentication for SMTP connections.<br />
&nbsp;Choose the outgoing server requires authentication option. (In most email apps, this option isn't checked by default.)</em><br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User name: Enter your full email address.</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Password: Enter your Microsoft account password.</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><b><u>If you don’t want email messages to be permanently deleted from your inbox after you download them to your mail program, select the Leave a copy of messages on the server option.</u></b></em><br />
<br />
<strong>Prevent losing email in Outlook.com when you've set up POP3</strong><br />
<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Outlook.com has a feature that prevents losing email messages if you accidentally set up POP3 to delete
 them after reading them on the server. Here’s how it works:</span></em><br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time that Outlook.com receives a POP3 instruction to delete email messages after reading from an email app, Outlook.com won't delete the messages. Instead, Outlook.com moves the email messages that were successfully downloaded by
 the email app into a POP folder and out of the inbox. The POP folder is available in the Folders list.</span><br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outlook.com keeps the email messages in the POP folder until you sign in to your Outlook.com account and verify whether Outlook.com should respect or ignore the POP3 delete command.</span><br />
<b><br />
To verify your POP3 settings:</b><br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the upper-right of the Outlook.com window, click Options, and then click More options.</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Managing Your Account, click Pop and deleting downloaded messages, and then select one of the following:</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><b>Don’t let another program delete messages from&nbsp;Outlook.com. (If your other program is set to delete messages from the server, we’ll simply move them to a special POP folder. They won’t be deleted.)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do what my other program says—if it says to delete messages, then delete them.</b><br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Save.</span></div>

            <p>Just clarify, you need to a retail full version Windows 7 license to install on your Mac. You can't use a OEM license (the one from your HP) or a Upgrade license.
</p>
<p>Installing 32 vs 64 bit depends on your needs. Also, your programs will need to be reinstalled from their original installation discs.</p>

<p>Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?</p>

<p>Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers</p>

</p>
<p>Running Windows on your Mac, is like running it on any other PC, it needs security software:<br />
www.microsoft.com/windows/antivirus-partners/windows-7.aspx<br />
<br />
You can download the free Microsoft Security Essentials if you cannot afford one:<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials<br />
<br />
Malware designed for Windows won't affect Mac OS X since they are signed differently, but both operating systems should have Antivirus software installed, both McAfee and Symantec develop AV programs that work on both platforms (you will have purchase it separately
 though, I remember in the past Symantec has sold 2 for ones, so you can purchase a license that includes a copy of Norton for both Mac OS X and Windows). There is a small rise in malicious code targeting OS X, so I strongly recommend you get security software
 for it too.<br />

<p>Hello everyone&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>I just picked up a used copy of Alien Isolation for the Xbox 360 and it looks like the previous owner didn't play this game at all, everything is in PERFECT condition&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>The sleeve with the code for the Crew Expendable DLC is still in the case, but I really doubt that it hasn't been used yet LOL&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>At the posting of this thread, the installation of the game is at&nbsp;60% and I should be playing it soon&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>Have a nice day or afternoon or night everyone&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>..........</p>

<p>It is by far one of the best games I have ever played. The atmosphere and the tension is second to none. Play on hard if you can. The Alien and the androids are just as crazy, but in their own way. The Alien doesn't have set patterns either.</p>
<p>Learn to make "noise makers" because you'll need them. When you're walking or in my case crawling around and you hear that Alien drop from a vent behind you and you hear the hissing sound, there's nothing like it. It gave me genuine panic. lol</p>
<p>It's an amazing game.</p>

<p>Hello everyone &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have to do the entire installation process all over again because the game keeps on crashing in the beginning after things go " according to plan " on the loading screen.</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>My guess is, something got messed up during the game update because my Xbox 360 mysteriously decided to disconnect itself from the internet in the middle of the update.
</p>
<p>............</p>
<p>By doing this, I am going to eliminate all possible problems that could have gone wrong during the installation process LOL &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>Big mistake Lei Fang and honestly, kind of a strange one to make.</p>
<p>You own the XBox ONE.</p>
<p>"Alien: Isolation" can be bought brand new for really cheap.</p>
<p>Yet you bought it 2nd hand for the 360.</p>
<p>You're missing out on the full experience of one of the best games on the XBox ONE.</p>

<p>Scary game played on a quality surround system with a powered sub wolffer doing the sounds of your heart beat, while the wireless speakers behind you JUST OFF TO THE RIGHT? is doing the hissing of a Zenomorph. Then it happens...
</p>
<p>Theirs a knock at the door because, when they heard you screaming, when the Alien got you earlier, your neighbor called the Cops. Now you open the door and the Officer notices your stress levels and instantely his/hers testrone levels makes for higher ground.
 'What in the wide, wide world of shorts is a going on here?' They ask with their hands now clinching the handles of their 9mm.
</p>
<p>'Nothing Officer, I was just playing a game.' Yeh, right! ;) </p>

<p>........</p>
<p>Hello "Azrael008uk" &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>........</p>
<p>I have the Xbox One.</p>
<p>It has a 500 GB Hardrive.</p>
<p>It only has 375 GBs of actually usable space.</p>
<p>I un-installed ALL of my games except for Destiny and Zombi.</p>
<p>The 375 GBs dropped down to 307 GBs with only TWO games in it.</p>
<p>I don't have an External HDD.</p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;the Xbox 360.</p>
<p>I have four empty 32 GB Flash Drives.</p>
<p>I installed the game into one of the 32 GB Flash Drives.</p>
<p>There is now only 19.8 GBs of free space in this Flash Drive and the only game that is on it is Alien Isolation.</p>
<p>32 GB Flash Drives are dirt cheap now.</p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>The Xbox 360 version wins because of the following</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;I can play my own music anytime that I want to, especially when waiting for the Xenomorph to leave while hiding.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;I have tons of free space by using my Flash Drives.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;Aliens vs Predator and Aliens Colonial Marines are on my Xbox 360.</p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>Have a nice day or afternoon or night "Azrael008uk" &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>...........</p>

<h2>            GTA 5</h2>
                    
<p>I recently just bought GTA 5 in the game store and when I installed it and oplened it, there was an error and some moving pictures with a text saying Download I. The bottom left corner. Also, I realized install packs 1 and 2 won't download at all and I can't
 download them because when I do, the download bar dissapears. And in the game files of the gta 5 game in my hard drive, 2 files called gtav-part0 and gtav-part1 have a yellow ! mark and both say they are incomplete when I open them. I've been re installing
 GTA 5 but this problem keeps happening. WHAT DO I DO?</p>

            <p>Hi Juned Saiyad,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Did you try connecting the USB joystick on a different USB port or different computer and check?</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> I would suggest you to run the hardware and device troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2: </b>Disable and re-enable the USB controller and check if that does the trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s use Device Manager to disable and re-enable all the USB controllers. This lets the controllers recover the USB port from its unresponsive condition. The USB controllers represent the USB ports in Device Manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To disable and re-enable the USB controllers, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, type <b>device manager</b> in the Start search box and hit
<b>Enter</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Expand <b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> You might have to scroll down the list to find this item.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Right-click the first USB controller under Universal<b> Serial Bus controllers</b>, and then click
<b>Uninstall</b> to remove it.</p>
<p><b><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></b>Repeat the above step for each USB controller that is listed under
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers.</b></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Restart the computer. After the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan for hardware changes and reinstall all the USB controllers that you uninstalled.</p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Check the USB device to see whether it is working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this helps.</p>
        </p>

    <title>Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Controller For Windows. Windows 10 не - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3>    say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Controller For Windows. Windows 10 не видит установленные драйвера.</h2>
                    
<p>Прошу прощения за беспокойство, но у меня возникла проблема с беспроводным контроллером Xbox 360 на Windows 10. (в Windows 7 все работало прекрасно)</p>
<p>Дело в том, что даже когда я установил драйвера вот отсюда</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/hardware/ru-ru/d/xbox-360-wireless-controller-for-windows</p>
<p>то драйвер "Беспроводной контроллер Xbox 360" в меню выбора драйверов просто не появляется. :(((</p>
<p>Там есть только 4 варианта: Xbox Controller, Xbox Controller DFU,&nbsp;Xbox Elite Controller,&nbsp;Xbox Gaming Device. Они были до установки драйверов, указанных выше по ссылке, и только они находятся в списке даже после установки драйверов. Остальных просто нет.
 В тоже время на Youtube имеются несколько видео, в которых люди показывают процесс установки драйверов (которые, к слову, официально не поддерживаются &nbsp;Win10 ) на Windows 10, аналогичный установке на Windows 7 и у них все прекрасно работает.</p>
<p>Что я делаю не так? :(((</p>

<p>Это не драйвер контроллера, а программа, которая показывает состояние геймпада(-ов) при нажатии на кнопку Guide. Она не нужна для работы геймпада и является опциональной (да и вообще, является устаревшей и иногда конфликтует с другими приложениями, которые
 пытаются использовать эту же кнопку)</p>
<p>Сами драйвера Windows скачивает автоматически при первом подключении геймпада. Нигде в интернете в свободном доступе вы их не найдете. Не нужно пытатся ничего сделать это вручную. Если вы вручную присвоили геймпаду драйвер, удалите его. В диспетчере задач,
 можно просмотреть не подключенные устройства в меню "Вид"</p>
<p>Контроллер Xbox 360 официально поддерживается на Windows 10. Подключаете беспроводной адаптер по USB и все, он должен сам найти драйвера. Затем, синхронизируете геймпад с этим адаптером (с помощью кнопки синхронизации или попросту подключив его кабелем USB)</p>
<p>p.s. Адаптер отображается в диспетчере как "Xbox 360 Wireless Reciever for Windows". Геймпад там появляется только если он подключен через кабель, как "Xbox 360 Wireless Controller via Play &amp; Charge KIt", в ином случае он там не отображается, потому что
 сам ресивер технически считается геймпадом...</p>

<p>Можно попробовать. Драйвер называется xusb22.sys, должен лежать в папке windows\system32\drivers или Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\xusb22.inf_amd64_c55a080698e50cb5</p>
<p>Если его там нет, и Windows действительно отказывается его скачивать, то в принципе могу скинуть (у меня 64-битная Windows 10, билд 10586, последний стабильный билд, не бета, собственно версия драйвера 10/29/2015,10.0.10586.0), но лично такой проблемы не
 встречал...</p>

<p>Есть термоядерная программа - USB Oblivion. Позволяет в автоматическом или ручном режиме удалить из реестра ОС любые упоминание обо всех или избранных устройствах. Плюсы: удаляет всю инфу, привязку USB к драйверам и т.д. После использования программы девайс
 для Винды становится будто новым устройством и позволяет его установить с чистого, так сказать, листа.</p>
<p>Но есть и минусы: если не читать мануал, можно стереть вообще все USB-девайсы в системе. То есть, перестанут определяться USB-принтер, USB-сканер, USB-модем и вообще все, что в этот порт втыкается (они для системы становятся новыми, неизвестными устройствами
 и надо перекачивать/переустанавливать драйвера).</p>
<p>Поэтому использовать программу предлагаю аккуратно и на свой страх и риск. Наливаем чай, открываем печеньки и читаем мануал до тех пор, пока не станет ясно понятно как работать с программой. :) Возможно один из драйверов не смотря на корректное удаление
 драйвера все ещё остается в системе. Иначе, Винда давно полезла бы на сервера MS и установила дрова.</p>

"It's not a true crash, in the sense that the Blue Screen was initiated only because the combination of video driver and video hardware was being unresponsive, and not because of any synchronous processing exception".</b><br />
<br />
<i>Since Vista, the "Timeout Detection and Recovery" (TDR) components of the OS video subsystem have been capable of doing some truly impressive things to try to recover from issues which would have caused earlier OS's like XP to crash.</i><br />
<br />
<i>As a last resort, the TDR subsystem sends the video driver a "please restart yourself now!" command and waits a few seconds.<br />
If there's no response, the OS concludes that the video driver/hardware combo has truly collapsed in a heap, and it fires off that stop 0x116 BSOD.</i><br />
<br />
<i>If playing with video driver versions hasn't helped, make sure the box is not overheating.<br />
&nbsp;Try removing a side panel and aiming a big mains fan straight at the motherboard and GPU.<br />
&nbsp;Run it like that for a few hours or days - long enough to ascertain whether cooler temperatures make a difference.</i><br />
<br />
<span>If so, it might be as simple as dust build up and subsequently inadequate cooling.</span><br />
<br />
<span>I would download cpu-z and gpu-z (both free) and keep an eye on the video temps</span>

<h2>            Acer 5733 will not boot into 8.1 after automatic update as of 18&#47;07&#47;2015</h2>
                    <p>Today I went to use my Acer 5733 after it had rebooted due to an auto update and now it is stuck trying to boot into Windows 8.1 proper with an inaccessible boot device error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recreated the BCD using this procedure:&nbsp;http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ht/rebuild-bcd-store-windows.htm</p>
<p>I have switched to IDE in the as per the MS knowledge base:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2795397</p>
<p>I have run a complete chkdsk fix and repair via advanced options troubleshoot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst everything looks fine via the command prompt in repair mode with the BIOS set to AHCI or IDE anything that seems to progress beyond this such as safe mode fails so I suspect a driver issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest a way forward?</p>

            <p>Hello Hans,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the complete model number of your Acer 5733 computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to corrupt Windows startup files. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have already done lot of troubleshooting, I would suggest you to <strong>
run system restore from Windows recovery environment</strong> and check if it helps. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have installation media for Windows 8.1, start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>",
 do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>"
 to start the <strong>Windows recovery environment.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>System Restore</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Important Notes: <br />
Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you use system restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may <strong>create Windows 8.1 installation media using the following article:</strong><br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Create installation media for Windows 8.1</strong><br />

<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the prompt response on a weekend, appreciated, also with a link to the media if required later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now selected the restore point labelled&nbsp;Windows critical update 15/07/2015 depending on what happens I'll be able to see and list what would be applied if the restore works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The model is an Acer Aspire 5733 #PEW71</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll update with further information by replying to my original post so you'll receive a notification.</p>

<h2>            Suddenly my speakers are &#34;not plugged in,&#34; no sound</h2>
                    <p>Recently, I suddenly lost all sound. My sound was fine during the day. I went back a couple of hours later and my sound was gone. To my knowledge, there was no update. My computer never shut down or restarted that I noticed. I now have the little red X on
 my sound icon in the task bar. When I click on it, it runs the audio troubleshooter and determines that no speakers are plugged in. They are in indeed plugged in. I checked. I unplugged and re-plugged them in. They were working a couple of hours prior. I plugged
 in headphones also, same result. I have updated the driver. It says I have the latest driver. I have uninstalled the device and let Windows re-install. I do NOT have a yellow warning sign on audio device in my device manager. Don't know what else to try. Please
 help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!</p>

            Hi  nlabran 
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing.

            I noticed this computer only has Windows 8 and earlier drivers. This suggest this system is not certified compatible with Windows 10 and is likely why you are experiencing this conflict. 
<br />
<br />Your best option might be to downgrade back to Windows 8.1, which will be supported until January 2023.

<p>Seriously? I've been running Windows 10 on this machine for well over 2 years with no problems. Maybe longer, but I can't remember. Why is it suddenly not compatible? This literally happened yesterday in the middle of the day. Suddenly I had no sound.&nbsp;</p>

            Another option you can try....
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart into Normal mode then check if stability/functionality is restored. If it is, proceed with the next steps.
<br />
<br />The update will try to install again, so use the following to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes. 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: rstrui.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />This will start the system restore wizard. Choose a restore point more before the problem started.

<p>None of this worked. My system restore failed. I tried it twice and got this error both times. This is the error I got.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>My sound issue is still not resolved. Are there any other options at this point beyond a new sound card? I'm still confused how my sound worked one minute and then stopped the next. My Device manager still does not show an exclamation point on my sound device.</p>

            You could try a repair upgrade to see if that works.

<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC.

            I was going to ask you about this as a "nuclear option." I've done this once before. The instructions page you linked to says I have the option to keep apps and programs also. I thought I could only keep data. I can keep my applications in place so I don't
 have to reinstall them?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have a Windows 10 ISO that I made last summer. Can I still use that and then block the latest updates? If I use a current one from the downloads page, won't that install all of the updates that theoretically caused this problem to begin with?

    <title>&#34;Ghost applications&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beniskickbutt  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Ghost applications&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have been getting this problem ever since installing windows 8. I've <strong>
easily</strong> wasted hours because of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When launching an application sometimes the application will never become visible. When this happens, I can see the application in the details tab under task manager. Sometimes these applications even show CPU usage but I can't even use them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried terminating these applications under task manger it says I do not have permission to do so. I've also tried running an elevated command prompt ( I am on the one and only admin account) and tried to kill the process by its PID and name but always
 end up with the same permissions error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to resolve this I have to continually reboot and/or shutdown my PC until it closes it self. Yes, Even when I shutdown my PC completely there's a 90% chance this app is still running when I power it back on. Its not an app scheduled at start up.
 This makes absolutely no sense to me how or why it would even do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone run into this issue and is there a solution? I'm super tired of all the time I've wasted and im on the verge of downgrading back to windows xp.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t download or update apps in Microsoft Store.</h2>
                    hi! when I download or update a certain app in the Microsoft Store, it always comes down to an error showing<strong>&nbsp;'turn on windows update.'</strong> I qualify for all the system requirements and I also made sure that I had my Windows Update turned on.
 I tried countless of tips and helps I found in the web but nothing's working. Please help me fix this as soon as you can.

            Hello
<br />A pleasure to help you
<br />
<br />I must share the following procedure to solve the error.
<br />
<br />1- open services (on run, type 'services.msc')
<br />2- Make sure WINDOWS UPDATE has started
<br />3- Try to download an app.
<br />

            1.	Try Wsreset: First see if Windows Store Reset works. This should Reset Windows 10 Store cache and if there is a problem with cache, this would clear it.
<br />           a.	Open Run dialog box(Win+R)
<br />           b.	Type in wsreset and Press Enter
<br />
<br />2.	The next step if Wsreset doesn't help is to Reset the Store app. To do this, follow the steps:
<br />                           a.	Open Run Dialog box( Windows+R key)
<br />                           b.	Type in ms-settings:appsfeatures  and Press Enter(Alternatively, Start&gt;Settings&gt;Apps and features)
<br />                            c.	Locate Microsoft Store
<br />                            d.	Click Advanced Options
<br />                            e.	Locate and click Reset Button
<br />3.	Reset Windows Update components: Resetting Windows update components might also help. Here is an article on how to do that.
<br />                    a.	<a href="https://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/reset-windows-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/reset-...</a>
<br />4.	Check for necessary services: Windows Store is dependent on some Services. Please check if the services are running and Automatic as given below.
<br />                 a.	Right-click Start&gt;Run and Type in Services.msc to open Services.
<br />                 b.	Make sure the status of the following services is Automatic and running
<br />                                        i.	Windows License Manager
<br />                                        ii.	Background Intelligence Transfer service
<br />                                        iii.	Cryptographic Services
<br />                                         iv.	Windows Update
<br />                                          v.	Windows Store
<br />c.	If something is not as intended, you can try Restoring default services

<br />5.	Repair install: The last Restort is a reinstallation of Windows. You can do a repair install, which keeps everything including your apps and files.

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Store app. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Store app, it should work fine now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<p><span><span>2. Go to the Desktop and double click the downloaded file.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. S<span><span>elect the C:\Windows\System32 folder as the Destination Folder during the installation. Later we
 will use this tool to reset the permission settings on the current machine.</span></span>

<h2>            DMP Watchdog Violation error message on Windows 8.</h2>
                    <p>*-Original Title - What's wrong with my laptop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased my laptop very recently from newegg.com and it came with Windows 8 pre-installed and set up. I have had no real issues with it until recently whenever I power it up, at any given&nbsp;moment, I am given a&nbsp;prompt&nbsp;saying that windows has encountered
 an error and needs to shut down, followed by a DMP Watchdog Violation error message. What is this? Why is this happening? How do I fix this? I have looked&nbsp;online&nbsp;and found answers on this website telling me to post a zipped file of the minidump so that&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;customer&nbsp;support&nbsp;can
 take it from here. I am not a very computer savvy person and had to ask a friend to help me get to this point. Any help at all at this&nbsp;point&nbsp;to help me fix the problem would be greatly appreciated, however it would be better if it was either in&nbsp;layman's&nbsp;terms
 or in a step by step fashion so the problem can be solved. Here is the link to the minidump file on my skydrive account, it will be in the "first minidump" folder inside the "new folder" folder.

<h2>            Acer Aspire One 1-143 Windows 10 Update no space</h2>
                    &nbsp;I purchased an Acer Aspire one 14 inch cloud book Model # Aspire One 1-431. &nbsp;The machine has windows 10 home, 2gb of Ram (Non upgradeable), and a 30 gb hard drive (Non upgradable.) &nbsp;This is my question The Machine has nearly 0 apps on it other than what
 the computer came with. &nbsp;Since I have had it it seems like every time I turn it on it is always updating something. and now it is telling me &nbsp;that it can't install updates because there is not enough space on the C drive so what am I supposed to do now with
 this there isn't even enough hard drive space to operate the operating system that was Pre installed on the machine.&nbsp;I have been an Microsoft loyal user from day one. This has got me thinking....

            Yes, that is becoming a very common problem on the forum. 
<br />
<br />"Officially" MS says that 32bit Win 10 requires only 16GB to install, while 64bit requires 20GB.  On that basis a 32 GB drive sounds reasonable. But it ignores a couple of years of monthly minor updates and 6 month major updates.  Plus at least a few applications. The end result is that 12 to 16GB of "free" space quickly shrinks until it is too small  for updates.
<br />
<br />At this point you can do some extreme hard disk cleaning, eliminating everything that is not absolutely necessary: stuff like "free" Candy Crush etc. Plus moving some remaining applications off to SD drives Plus using a USB/SD drive to help with the update.
<br />
<br />But eventually, all of the exteme measures will not be enough.
<br />
<br />Bottom line, although MS claims a 32GB drive is adequate for Windows 10, in the real world it is only enough for a device with a very short planned obsolescence date. 2 or 3 years.   Sorry.
<br />

            I had this problem also show up after running Windows XP Mode successfully for over a year.
<div><br />
<div>Instead of automatically logging into the domain, I got the log on dialog box. My normal&nbsp;credentials&nbsp;didn't work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the Setting, I tried changing the Networking setting to Shared Networking (NAT) and tried again. (I had found it set to the&nbsp;adapter&nbsp;name - bridged mode)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>After changing it, I could once again log in.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't&nbsp;remember&nbsp;what this was set to previously, so I don't know if the setting changed or not. I only run one program in XP Mode, so performance isn't a big deal. Apparently the shared setting is slower.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I kind of wondered if some recent Windows update had a hand in this failing.</div>

            Update.
<div><br />
<div>Computer woke up this morning with Windows XP mode logged out again. Typing in my domain credentials was failing again - couldn't find the domain. This is after my computer slept/hibernated overnight. I leave the XP mode running all the time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I switched the&nbsp;<span>Networking&nbsp;</span><span>to the&nbsp;adapter&nbsp;name - bridged mode (didn't work) and then back</span><span>&nbsp;
 to Shared Networking (NAT) and it allowed me to log in again.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Something has changed, but I'm not sure what, or how to fix it.</span></div>

            Changing to NAT did solve my issue in the Networking settings of Virtual pc...<br />
You saved my day<br />

Thanks Thomaus<br />
