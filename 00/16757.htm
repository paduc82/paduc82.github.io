    <title>Outlook converting Word and Excel attachments in &#34;All files&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bogdansucila  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook converting Word and Excel attachments in &#34;All files&#34; and changing their name</h2>
                    <p>User reported that emails from certain contacts have their word and excel attachments converted from their default format to an "all files" one, and their name is changed to one single capital letter (I, S, J), just as they were the link to the C: drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2675ab0-3a3f-41a2-9668-66016392392c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the attachments can be opened if Word / Excel is selected from the Open With.. menu. The issue was experienced with 2 external senders (both from the same company). I noticed that all messages were in Plain Text format, while others that successfully
 displayed the attachments were in HTML. Still, after asking the end user to send some test emails in HTML format, the problem still occurred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other steps I undertook were running Outlook with the "/safe" switch, clearing up the Content.Outlook files in the Temporary Internet Files folder, and changing the contacts' Outlook Properties to "always use Rich Text format".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also considering checking the file associations in Control Panel, although an improper setting there shouldn't also rename files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any suggestions of what might cause this problem, or any possible solutions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Deepu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my experience, it is that Outlook need to load a large number of data so that makes it hanging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, upgrade your mailbox to 100GB in server wouldn't make the Outlook 2010 client works more smoothly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may repair the Outlook data as I mentioned before to give it a shot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no improvement, may I know when Outlook 2010 becomes hang, composing emails? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check the account usage, please log into <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/?path=/options/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            First make sure that your router is broadcasting its ESSID. Without that, the phone won't be able to detect it.<br />
<br />
If your router is using WEP encryption or WPA/WPA2 you'll also need the WEP key or the WPA pre-shared key.<br />
<br />
Next,<br />
<br />
Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Connectivity &gt; Wireless LAN<br />
<br />
The phone should pick up your home router and display its ESSID. Select your router and then Options &gt; Connect.<br />
<br />
The phone will ask for your credentials and, once you've entered them, attempt to connect to the router. If all went well then you'll see the word "Connected" under the router's ESSID. Do Options &gt; Disconnect WLAN. The phone will disconnect and show you that
 your home router is now "Known".<br />
<br />
Press "Back", then go into Destinations &gt; Internet.<br />
<br />
Your WLAN should be in there at a higher priority than your operator's packet data access.<br />
<br />
Bress "Back" to go back to the destinations. Go Options &gt; Default connection and select "Internet".<br />
<br />
Finally, go into each of the network-aware applications that you use and tell them to use the "default connection" as their route to the internet. From this point on, the applications will use your home router whenever possible, or fall back on the packet data
 connection if your WLAN isn't available.

<p>Network , Bluetooth, USB, destinations, Connection manager, data transfer and admin settings</p>

            Aha - you didn't say you were in China!<br />
<br />
The Chinese government doesn't allow the use of WiFi (or 3G for that matter) so a phone bought in China will have the hardware and software related to WiFi (and 3G) removed from it.

            On the list of things that suck there's also the fact that people in Egypt weren't allowed to use GPS until a few weeks ago...<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about the readoning behind there being no 3G in China, but WiFi is explained by the fact that the encryption algorithms used are in direct competition with home-grown cryptography. China doesn't want to import from the West (and pay for) anything
 for which there's already a Chinese alternative.<br />
<br />
Now, if only they'd build that Chinese alternative into a working system so that you could use Chinese WiFi...

            We'll I'm getting confused my Nokia someitmes will use the home wifi for data but sometimes it will use contract internet, as I'm on Voadfone UK, but I want to save money and speed things up by getting it to default to using wifi automatically, as it's
 got an 8mb adsl connection for it to use but it defaults to contract data especially when using the Mail for exchange app, which sometimes will use wifi but sometimes won't any suggestion to force it almost onto wifi, when at home and only use the data outside
 of the house?

            That's easy.<br />
<br />
Set the priorities in your "Internet" destination so that youe WiFi access point is top of the list.<br />
<br />
Go back up to the destinations, then Options &gt; Set default - select "Internet".<br />
<br />
Finally, for each net-aware application, set its access point to "Default" where possible, your wifi access point elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Applications that use the "default" access point, which now happens to be the "internet" destination, will first try the topmost access point in the list. If that doesn't work they'll try the next one down etc. etc.

<p>Bug in SP1 of Microsoft Outlook 2011 for Mac - Service Pack 1?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running MS Outlook 2011 for Mac (version 14.2.2 (120421)) on a MacBook Pro with OS X 10.6.8. I only use Outlook for my email.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After installing SP1 for Outlook, all my calendars disappeared from iCal and from my iPhone! I still had them on my iPad which was not yet synchronized, so I added them manually back to iCal, including all my future appointments. Then I synchronized my MacBook
 with iPad and my iPhone. This deleted my calendar history on the iPad but at least the future appointments were back again. I ensured that a good backup was present on my Time Machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few days later I noticed that all calendars had disappeared again from iCal and from my iPhone! Then I discovered that Outlook had imported the new calendars from iCal and apparently deleted them in Cal, along with the old appointments. I turned on Sync
 Services to bring them back to iCal. That worked: the calendars were copied back to iCal.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried to synchronize my data with my iPhone, I got the following error message: "iTunes could not sync information to the iPhone (...) because another sync client is already running" .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then turned off Sync Services in MS Outlook 2011 for Mac and restarted my MacBook. I could synchronize my data with my iPhone again, but... Outlook had again deleted my calendars from iCal!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restoring my backup did not solve the problem. I can either synchronize while Outlook deletes my calendars or keep my calendars and not synchronize.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I stop Outlook from deleting my iCal calendars?</p>

            Hi Lou,
<div><br />
<div><span>Sorry to hear you're having such a difficult time syncing with Outlook to iCal. The following Microsoft KB article troubleshoots Sync Service issues like the one you're describing:</span>
<div>
<br />
<div>
<div><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-US;2511360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Calendar
 Items or Contacts appear duplicated or not synced when sync services is used in Outlook for Mac 2011</a></b></div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
I'd highly recommend trying all of the solutions there and see if you're able to resolve the issue.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Hope this helps!</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
P.S.: 14.2.2 would mean you're currently running Service Pack 2 (SP2). Just FYI. =)</div>

            <p>Hello Cody,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your support. And yes you are right,&nbsp;this is a bug in Service Pack 2, not in Service Pack 1.</p>
<p>I carried out steps 1 to 5 of your solution but they did not solve the problem.
</p>
<p>I cannot carry out step 6 because that would delete all my iCal and Apple AddressBook data.&nbsp;Due to the bug&nbsp;(Outlook deletes Calenders from iCal) I manually had to enter my iCal appointments three times and I do not want to do this again. (Since I forgot
 one appointment, somebody drove four hours for nothing....) </p>
<p>Outlook also copied some addresses from my Apple AddressBook, but not all. Here&nbsp;I discovered another&nbsp;bug:&nbsp;Outlook links&nbsp;the addresses in Outlook to a calendar! The more calenders I activate in Outlook, the more addresses become visible. However,&nbsp;even if
 all&nbsp; calendars in Outlook are actived, still not all addresses that I have in Address Book are visible in Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you understand I cannot delete my iCal and Apple AddressBook entries.</p>
<p>Please provide me with another solution, if you can.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Lou.</p>

            Camera brightness settings are normally managed from within the camera settings itself.
<br />
<br />Also, your room lighting can greatly affect brightness. Turning on the lights or moving to a part your house with natural lighting can make a significant improvement, see example:<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1e67cd1-5e09-4b32-855a-5e7f411f1463?upload=true" />

            Hi Kasandra, my name is Max and I'm an independent advisor.
<br />
<br />You cannot adjust brightness in Skype, but your camera resolution should adopt the native settings of your camera. So, I recommend resetting your Skype app.
<br />To do it, follow these steps:
<br />Click on the Start button, then settings (it is a gear icon)
<br />Move to System &gt; Apps &amp; features and find Skype application
<br />Once done, and press Advanced options
<br />Click the Reset button

            Hello and thank you for reaching out to Microsoft support. I am AndresR a community OneDrive Advisor here to help.
<br />
<br />Please follow this:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/download-and-install-or-reinstall-office-365-or-office-2019-on-a-pc-or-mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Tip: The 64-bit version is installed by default unless Office detects you already have a 32-bit version of Office (or a stand-alone Office app such as Project or Visio) installed. In this case, the 32-bit version of Office will be installed instead.
<br />
<br />To change from a 32-bit version to a 64-bit version or vice versa, you need to uninstall Office first (including any stand-alone Office apps you have such as Project of Visio). Once the uninstall is complete, sign in again to www.office.com and select Other install options, choose the language and version you want (64 or 32-bit), and then select Install. (See Install Visio or Install Project if you need to reinstall those stand-alone apps.)

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community and we are glad to assist you with your concern related to Excel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dragging and dropping the pictures/images into Excel is not a feature of Excel 2007 or Excel 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The images has to be inserted or embedded into the file to view them in Excel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a work around you may try the following:</p>
<p>Insert or copy/past the images into a Word document and then open a Excel window (ensure the Word and the Excel window is placed side by side) and then try to drag and drop the
 images into Excel file from Word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above information helps. If you need further assistance on this particular issue or any other Office related issues let us know and we will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            - Try clearing the temp files. Start-&gt;Run, enter "%temp%" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Disable all Add-Ins. If that works, then re-enable one at a time until you determine which is causing the performance problem.<br />
<br />
- Disable all Add-Ins, close Excel, and delete the Excel settings file. It's found here:<br />
<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\[Your Name]\Application Data\Microsoft\Excel<br />

and has the extension .xlb.<br />

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I use Excel 2003 and I have this situation in my document just created. I created a table in Sheet1 and I used Check Box from
<strong><span>Forms</span></strong> toolbar to have Yes or No answers in a certain column. From Properties of this Check Box I linked it with a cell (in my case with K6 cell), and I used this formula in
<strong><span>I6</span></strong> cell:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>=IF(K6=TRUE,"Yes","")</span></li></ul>
<p><span>It works perfectly given me the results that I want. But instead&nbsp;I have this problem. The same tables I have created in Sheet2 exist in the Sheet 2 too. This table is not updated when I work with table in Sheet1.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>With other words, I want, when I check the Check Box in Sheet1 and I have Yes response, the same think to happen and to the Sheet2. The Check Box in the Sheet2 to be automatically checked, and the response to by Yes, to the cells that I have curtains,
 and vise versa, when I uncheck Check Box in Sheet1 to be unchecked and respectively Check Box in Sheet2.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Is that possible, without VBA? If not, do someone how to resolve this problem with VBA?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Regards.</span></p>

    <title>Sent emails end up in duplicate in Sent items folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heathside boy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sent emails end up in duplicate in Sent items folder</h2>
                    
<p>I have 3 accounts in Microsoft Outlook. I'm pretty sure this only happens with my default account because that is only where I have seen it at the moment.</p>
<p>I believe this happens when I reply to another e-mail from somebody else (as opposed to starting a new one and then sending that). I also believe that this doesn't happen all the time, only sometimes which makes it all the more strange.</p>
<p>When I have replied to an e-mail and then checked in my sent items folder in the same account, it is showing that message in duplicate (as sent twice). I have looked up many answers to this problem (and there are many) but I am asking what would be the most
 likely cause of this?</p>
<p>I have a Windows live mail account with the same address in Outlook i.e. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. I don't know if this gives you any extra added help for the question but it may.</p>
<p>it does not necessarily do this where I have attachments to the e-mails and it also does not do it with every single one.</p>
<p>Any ideas will be most appreciated</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>HB</p>

<p>Does the recipient get 2 copies? Are you using After sending rules? What type of account is configured?</p>
<p>Security essentials doesn't scan email as you send it, so we can't blame the antivirus - a rule could be copying it or, if using a server-based account, syncing the sent item to the server could be creating a copy.</p>

            Exactly the same problem, and it's recent.&nbsp; Outlook 2010, Win 7, 64 bit OS.&nbsp; Some emails duplicate in the Sent folder, others do not.&nbsp; Happens more frequently now, and the mail (usually) doesn't duplicate until Outlook is closed and reopened.&nbsp; Symantec
 AV, but I have (sequentially) turned off all email scanning and tried that, and uninstalled Norton to try without&nbsp; - same issue (have not yet tried uninstalling and reinstalling Outlook - reasonably should work, since this did not occur a couple of weeks back).&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing
 substantial has changed in my systems, and it occurs on two laptops and two desktops, again recently, with same OS but slightly different configurations and very different hardware, from 3 different manufacturers.&nbsp; Computers are wirelessly networked, WHS for
 backup.&nbsp; MAPI accounts w/Hotmail.&nbsp; My strong suspicion is some recent Office update but I'm baffled.&nbsp; Whatever the issue, it also seems to be duplicating historical sent e

<p>Hi Diane and Doc.</p>
<p>Diane, I will answer your questions one by one.</p>
<p>No, the recipient does not get 2 copies but 2 copies show up in my sent items folder as explained in my previous post.</p>
<p>When you ask am I using "After sending rules", what do you mean by this? I have no idea what this is. Where should I navigate to check and find the answer to this question?</p>
<p>The account is a MAPI (send from this account by default) Windows Live Mail (I believe is the same as Hotmail).</p>
<p>You say that a rule could be copying it or, if using a server-based account, syncing the sent items to the server could be creating a copy. If this is the case, can you tell me how I go about changing the rule that could be copying it? The same again with
 your second suggestion, if using a server-based account and syncing sent items to the server could be creating a copy, what actions would I need to do to stop this happening?</p>
<p>The way Doc has described the problem is probably more accurate than the way I have described it. As you also say, it cannot be a scanning problem so it must be something to do with the rules or the server is creating a copy. I have not the faintest idea
 on what to change in the 'rules' category within Outlook. So perhaps you can let me know what I should do there and/or with the server problem also?</p>
<p>Thanking you sincerely</p>
<p>HB</p>

<p>Diane &amp; Heathside boy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fixed it, and I am embarrased to say I have no idea how.&nbsp; I tested it and it worked, but I got called away and can't get back to the place I started (which is buried in a nest of Outlook menu options somewhere), but I changed a setting in Outlook.&nbsp; Maybe
 Diane can help - I recall it was an option to have sent emails arrive in the default folder (which wasn't specified), or to a specific folder, and I selected "Sent Items."&nbsp; That seemed to do the trick, but I can find no such option now in the maze of menu
 items.&nbsp; It seems to have fixed it on all my systems, so it is a global setting of some sort.&nbsp; I'll keep looking....</p>

            Did you ever try reproducing the issue in Safe mode? That would have been the next troubleshooting step.&nbsp;Did this occur only with hotmail accounts or other account types as well?

            Found it, or at least part of it&nbsp;- the setting is on the menu bar composing a "New Email" under "Options/Save Sent Item To."&nbsp; It alows you to select a specific folder (which I set to Sent Items); somewhere in Outlook you can set this as a global setting,
 presumably to set the default folder, but I haven't located that rascal yet.&nbsp; This seems to have solved the dupe problem - no more duplicates when I restart Outlook.&nbsp; I have no idea why this should work.&nbsp; To answer Russ, I didn't try it in Safe mode because
 this worked first; it just seemed like it had to be a setting in Outlook.&nbsp; Why this changed from the previous couple of weeks I have no clue, because I hadn't changed any Outlook settings prior to this happening.

<p>Doc,</p>
<p>I followed your instructions but the specific folder to choose in my case was *already* set to "sent items" so that is definitely not the cure because I am still getting duplicate e-mails in the sent items folder of my default account.</p>
<span>
<p>Russ,</p>
<p>No, I have not tried reproducing this issue in safe mode. How would I go about doing that? And, what what would that achieve or prove? How would that cure the overriding problem of duplicate e-mails?</p>
<p>Regarding the accounts. I have a Windows live account and Doc has a Hotmail account and I believe they are both "MAPI" accounts. The other 2 accounts that I have are both POP3 accounts and I do not seem to get this problem with them. So it well may have
 something to do with the MAPI accounts that cause this problem.</p>
<p>Diane, still maybe think that you may be onto something regarding the "rules and alerts" menu or the "server-based" problem regarding this issue. Would still like answers to the questions, the ones I asked you in an earlier post when replying to the ones
 you posed on this subject.</p>
<p>That goes for anybody else who may know the answer to this puzzle. Still left scratching my head and getting duplicate e-mails. Surely somebody must have encountered this problem before and found a fix?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>If this is only happening with hotmail accounts and no others, I would suspect a problem with the Outlook Connector. Ensure you are running the latest version.</p>
<p>Running in safe mode would tell us whether an add-in is causing the problem. Just start Outlook from the Run command using the /safe swtich.</p>

<p>Hi Russ,</p>
<p>I clicked on the Outlook Connector button &gt; About Outlook Hotmail Connector - which told me it was version 2010. So there is no problem there and it is up to date.</p>
<p>&gt; Just start Outlook from the Run command using the /safe switch.</p>
<p>Sorry for being a bit thick. Could you break this down in layman terms please? Where would I find the "Run command" and when would I find the "safe switch"? And... After implementing this, would it tell us and become completely apparent what add-in is causing
 the problem if any?</p>
<p>If I do happen to come across an add-in, will it become completely apparent how to disable it?</p>
<p>On a different note, do you not think it may be something to do with the rules and alerts in Outlook?</p>
<p>I appreciate all your responses</p>
<p>HB</p>

<p>Rules are always suspect when you end up with unwanted duplicates of messages. It is easy to check if you have a rule that could be doing this. I doubt you'll find one.</p>

<h2>            The Speak feature of Live Search Mobile does not work on my Mobile 6 phone.</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the PPC 6800 by HTC sine Oct 2007 and the Live Search for Mobile looks very useful if the "SPEAK" feature would work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tap the SPEAK and it shows the "listening symbol" (moving sinewave) and I speak "Starbucks" or "Alltel" or anything short or longer and it quickly comes back with "Sorry, we were unable to complete Your Request. Please try again".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first got a Smartphone in Oct 2007 it was a Moto Q fro Alltel and used Live search with the SPEAK feature it woked 90% of the time. I switched to the PPC 6800 by HTC for the better PDA and now can't use the Live search SPEAk well at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas would be helpful,</p>

            I did a little more research, and although this is not definitive as I have read conflicting accounts, my HTC Touch does not have voice recognition built in.&nbsp; It offers voice tags to be saved for opening programs or calling contacts, but true voice recognition
 is not there apparently.&nbsp; Oh well....<br />

            I'm having the same problem but it is not constant. I will work sometimes but not other times. I haven't quite figured out the keys to failure or success. It seemed to work much better before I installed the latest version about 30 days ago.

<p>I have the Sprint Mogul. The "Speak" feature had been working fine until I upgraded to the latest version of Live Search.
</p>
<ul>
<li>My previous version of Live Search&nbsp;was 2.5.2840.19676 (Speak feature worked fine).
</li><li>
<div>My current version of Live Search is 2.5.2908.31943 (Speak feature works sometimes, not others.)</div>
</li></ul>
<p>(By doesn't work I mean within a second or so it comes back and says that it couldn't understand my request. Most of the time I don't even have time to start saying anything before it responds with this error.)</p>

            <p>The issue is not completely resolved. First, it does the trick most of the time, but occasionally, it does not, i.e. occasionally&nbsp;the PowerPoint file does not start on startup. There is an inconsistency issue here, at least in Windows 10 Technical Preview.
 (There was no inconsistency issue in Windows 7, it always did the trick reliably).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, Microsoft may want to consider <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
much</span> easier access to the startup folder,&nbsp;e.g. making&nbsp;the startup folder&nbsp;visible in File Explorer. There may be sufficient users who want to startup with Internet Explorer, or Outlook, or some other program. This is thus an 'ease of startup personalization'
 issue.</p>

<h2>            Nokia IM&#58; Is there any way to use social sites with default IM app</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>We have seen s default pre-installed option of IM in many of our S40 phones under messaging menu; like:
<strong>Menu&gt;Messaging&gt;IMs</strong>. But, the problem is, that it does not work. I have tried, to use Facebook Chat, Google Talk, Jabber, but none of this working this option. So, here are two queries because of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What protocols does this option works with? Dows it support XMPP or Jabber?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. We have seen Windows Live Messenger on many S40 phones. In that, we can sign in with our login credentials, it can be minimised, I mean, we can get out from this app, but, it remains signed in, and our friends, can see us online. Just like this, is there
 any other app? whish can be minimised like this..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. On Windows Live Messenger, on our Windows PC, we can chat with our Facebook buddys, as now, Windows Live Messenger can be integrated with Facebook. So, can we also chat with our Facebook friends on Windows Live Messenger on Nokia phones?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. We have seen IM for Nokia or other CHAT app from Nokia on S40 6th edition phones, will they be available for other S40 serieses too? Can we use them on all S40 phones?</p>

                    How can I sign out of the new MSN outlook directly on the screen? I knew how to sign out of Hotmail but cannot find how to sign out of the new MSN Outlook service, creating a conflict because I have another Outlook-based email provider--when I try to switch
 email providers it says that I am logged into another account and I have to make an extra step to sign out.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
well shortly must say that there is no "undo" feature in S60.. However if you have syncronized your contacts or taken a backup then you might be able to get the lost contact back. Also any chance if you have the contact on your SIM..

    <title>Can i create an Access App on OneDrive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can i create an Access App on OneDrive&#63;</h2>
                    I have Win-10, Office 2016 Pro, and onedrive. I've been able to read that I need Office 365 and SharePoint to create an app. However, I'm under the impression that office 2016 is a stand alone version of office 360 and that OneDrive is really a SharePoint
 space. So my question is can I use Access 2016 to create an App on my OneDrive space?

            <p>No. As it stands now One Drive is simply a storage area. You can't link an Access front end to a back end on One Drive. Nor can you execute an Access app from One Drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this is one of the most requested enhancements for Access. Basically be able to link an Access front end, stored locally with a back end in the Cloud. Whether its on Azure or some other form of cloud storage.&nbsp;</p>

            The pictures are in Outlook. Re-sync also brings back the pictures to the device. If want to get rid of then m, you will need to delete the pictures manually on the computer and sync again.

<h2>            Problem with Nokia 5250</h2>
                    
<p>Welcome everybody!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just bought Nokia 5250. It is a good phone, but I have got two problems:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I cannot connect it to the computer, using Nokia PC Suite (ever. 7.1.60.0). When I plug in the USB cable, nothing happen... Even if I set "PC Suite" in my phone... When I try to connect by the Suite, the program is "doing" something (Windows' hourglass),
 but after few minutes it says, that the phone is in incompatible mode...&nbsp;Oh, last information: I have got Windows Vista with last updates. Does anybody know what to do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Second problem is with the phone's battery - I have already charged&nbsp;it 3 times. Always&nbsp;from full discharge to full chargement. But every time after two days, the phone shuts off, as it would be discharged. But it doesn't show any information about low
 battery - I just look and... surprise.! :smileymad:&nbsp;Does anybody know what is it? Is it normal process of formatting? Or should I give the phone back to the shop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p>I'm sorry for any mistakes - I'm from Poland, and English isn't my first language... :smileywink:</p>

<p>I've managed with this problem... In fact... Not at all... But I know what is the cause.</p>
<p>Nokia Ovi Suite (PC Suite also) doesn't work very good with Windows Vista.</p>
<p>Whan I plug my phone into computer with Windows 7, everything is good.</p>
<p>On Vista I can use the phone only as a pendrive.</p>

            <p>thanks Karina</p>
<p>I use&nbsp; a Mac&nbsp; and iphone.</p>
<p>No errors messsage shows up at any stage .The yahoo mail i wish to forward to my outlook account goes instead into my icloud one.</p>
<p>T have looked into self-fix answers and other people problems that would be similar but none addresses my specific issue and the setting in outkook deals with forwarding sistematically all yahoo email into outlook which doesn;t apply to miy situation:</p>
<p>I receive an email in Yahoo </p>
<p>I want to forward this one&nbsp; email to my outlook account .</p>
<p>The&nbsp; email is sent but doesn't go to outlook but icloud&nbsp; without any warning .</p>
<p>This happened recently as up to then i never had any problem doing so </p>
<p>.Kind regards</p>
        </p>
