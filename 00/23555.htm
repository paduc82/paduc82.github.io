            <p>Hi Lizzy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It is a SCAM!!! Microsoft does not do that nor do they have partners who do that nor do they hire sub-contractors or people or even get volunteers to do that. There are probably thousands of such companies out there doing this every day - we get two
 or three messages like this (or more) every day asking about it. You are the lucky ones who recognized the scam enough not to be sucked into it and end up with identify theft, infections, hacking of your computer, convincing you to buy software or services
 you either don't need or that don't really exist at all, and all sorts of nefarious tricks. You'd be surprised by how many contact us AFTER they realized they'd been suckered asking what to do. Do not waste time talking to these people, do not give them any
 personal information whatsoever, do not be tricked by what they may get you to see on the computer - in fact, don't do anything they suggest on your computer or even visit websites they recommend, and for heaven's sake don't give them access to your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Microsoft knows this goes on but with these companies springing up like dandelions, or closing and changing names when discovered, and mostly operating in foreign countries, it would take an army of lawyers to pursue every one of them. They do the
 best they can, but there simply are too many and more get added every day. People have to be careful of these things. They not only occur by phone, but also by e-mail, instant messaging, regular mail and every way imaginable. Just remember that Microsoft does
 not do this and hang up or delete emails or messages or mail from anyone claiming they are doing this because they know information about your computer or want information from you to confirm your account so it won't be closed and ask you for your username
 and password and all sorts of other personal information. Microsoft DOES NOT DO THIS!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See the following for additional information about this and what to do and how Microsoft operates:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope you didn't get caught by these scammers and saved yourself a big headache. Continue to use the same caution and you should do fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you got caught by these scammers (did any of the things they suggested and especially if you gave them access), I would also proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It was not a good idea to give them access to your computer or any personal information, but if they had access to your computer or you visited a website they suggested or downloaded anything intentionally or unintentionally from a website or email,
 they could have infected you or made changes (or installed a way to gain access at their convenience in a background download occurring while they were showing you things and installing who knows what). Plus if they installed fee-based products (as is often
 the case since they negotiate deals with such vendors to split the profits on such ‚Äúsales‚Äù ‚Äì in effect, a kickback), they may have removed other products and when the service is cancelled what they installed may also be cancelled. In some cases, this may be
 good. In others, it may leave you without security protection depending on what they did. So you need to make sure that you eventually have proper firewall and real-time AV protection installed (and remove any they installed unless you did a clean install
 or System Restore as will be suggested shortly ‚Äì then just confirm things are back to normal and the security is enabled or re-installed).
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See this article: </span><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10</span></a><span>.
 The article also includes links for things to do if you think you've been a victim of this type of scam and information about what Microsoft does and doesn't do so you won't be tricked again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Still, it doesn't hurt to be cautious. <b>I believe the safest thing to do at this point is to backup your data and do a clean install or a restore to factory conditions (however you are setup to start from scratch after doing a full format of the
 hard drive).</b> If you aren‚Äôt prepared for such a radical solution (even if it is the safest), please at least proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do a System Restore to before the call and giving them access. That will hopefully remove anything they may have installed and undo any changes they might have made. Also change your password and security questions with your email provider, network,
 ISP and perhaps others listed below (which a System Restore won‚Äôt do ‚Äì they‚Äôll still be the same until you revise them). There‚Äôs no telling what they could have done while they had access to your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then to make sure you weren't infected, please do the following;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a> and SuperAntiSpyware:</span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: </span><a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Are you running Microsoft Security Essentials? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>If so</span></b><span>: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start here - </span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></a><span>and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary
 by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (</span><a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.answerdesk.com/</span></a><span>)<b> in the US at this time.</b> After an initial free consultation, a fee will be
 charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>If not</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>P.S. In the meantime, I'd contact the bank or credit card company and dispute the charge to try and get my money back (if you actually paid anything - otherwise skip ahead to the P.P.S). Canceling the card is not enough to remove prior transactions
 that were charged to it without disputing them ‚Äì and there may be more than just this one company if they installed products that cost money that will separately charge you (or already have). That may be simpler than asking the company or companies for a refund
 - but if the banks can't help you at this point, then of course try to get the refund from the company or companies (and keep asking to talk to the person's manager until you get as high as you can) and tell them if they refuse you'll notify the authorities
 and the company that hosts their website and take legal action (even if we know you won't because it's too much of a hassle, they won't be certain).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>How far you want to go in terms of changing all your other passwords, pins, logon information, account information (including all your financial data if on the computer) and such is a decision you need to make for yourself. They are not all related
 to resolving the computer issues and your best bet outside of anything computer-related is to contact those companies or the local authorities and see what they advise (or seek out an attorney for advice).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</span><a href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx</span></a><span> This one is the "big gun" and while the best (like getting the BAU to take your case at the FBI), they really only focus on the major cases.
 I imagine enough complaints from enough people (or the right person or perhaps someone actually victimized or the company being misrepresented) about a particular company would make it a major case, but frankly don't know how they work or prioritize what they
 do. Still, since if they do get involved they can probably do the most to resolve the matter, I'd include them if I were harmed.</span></p>

            Hello IbrahimKeshk. I'm a fellow Community member here to help when I can. Unfortunately, you are not alone. The new version of Skype is a work in progress and many users are reporting issues across the board for this version of Skype on all platforms. While I cannot speak to any estimated time frames, I can tell you that updates and Bug fixes are expected to begin rolling out in the very near future as the old versions of Skype will all be discontinued as of September 1st.
<br />
<br />I hope this info was helpful to you. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance. I do hope that you have a great evening.

            <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hi,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community. Let me assist you in solving your issue with receiving emails.
<br />
<br />
It is possible that your incoming emails are triggered by Junk mail filters. I suggest that you check and modify your Junk mail filters for us to make sure that it is not contributing to this issue:<br />
<br />
Check your Junk folder<br />
1. Sign in to Outlook.com.<br />
2. Click the "Junk" folder on the left pane. <br />
3. Check to see if the wanted emails are in this folder.<br />
4. If you see any messages that should have been delivered to the Inbox folder, click the box on the left of each message to put a check mark and then click the "Not Junk" button.
<br />
<br />
Check your Blocked sender list <br />
1. In your Outlook.com Inbox, click the cog icon beside your Profile name.<br />
2. Click "More mail settings".<br />
3. Under Preventing junk email, click "Safe and blocked senders".<br />
4. Click "Blocked senders".<br />
5. In the Blocked senders list, select the name or domain (the part of an e-mail address that follows the @ sign, such as hotmail.com) that you now want to receive mail from, and then click "&lt;&lt; Remove from list".<br />
<br />
Add the email address to your Safe senders list<br />
1. In your Outlook.com Inbox, click the cog icon beside your Profile name.<br />
2. Click "More mail settings".<br />
3. Under Preventing junk email, click "Safe and blocked senders".<br />
4. Click "Safe Senders". <br />
5. In the text box, type in the email address or domain you‚Äôd like to always receive email from, and then click "Add to list &gt;&gt;".<br />
<br />
Check your Email Rules<br />
1. In your Outlook.com Inbox, click the cog icon beside your Profile name.<br />
2. Click "More mail settings".<br />
3. Under Customizing Outlook, click "Rules for sorting new messages". <br />
4. Perform one of the actions as per your requirement: <br />
Click "Edit" next to the rule that you want to edit. <br />
Or <br />
Choose the rule that you want to delete by ticking the check box and click "Delete".
<br />
<br />
Note: Not all international characters are supported as filters.<br />
<br />
Check your Junk Mail Settings<br />
1. In your Outlook.com Inbox, click the cog icon beside your Profile name.<br />
2. Click "More mail settings".<br />
3. Under Preventing junk email, click "Filters and reporting". <br />
4. Under Choose a junk e-mail filter, choose the level of protection that you want, and then click "Save". If the Exclusive level was set, messages from senders not on your Contacts or Safe senders lists will have been sent to the Junk e-mail folder.<br />
<br />
Check your Reply-to address <br />
1. In your Outlook.com Inbox, click the cog icon beside your Profile name.<br />
2. Click "More mail settings".<br />
3. Under Writing email, click "Reply-to address".<br />
2. Select "Current e-mail address" radio button. <br />
3. Click "Save".<br />
<br />
Check Email Forwarding<br />
1. In your Outlook.com Inbox, click the cog icon beside your Profile name.<br />
2. Click "More mail settings".<br />
3. Under Managing your account, click "Email Forwarding".<br />
4. Choose Don't forward, if you have enabled email forwarding for you to receive incoming emails to your Inbox Folder.<br />
5. Click "Save".<br />
<br />
Once done, kindly check if you can already receive incoming emails.<br />
<br />
Get back to us with the results.<br />
<br />
Regards,</span></p>

<p>I tried everything that you suggested but am still not receiving any emails. I can send emails and read emails in my inbox. I even tried sending a&nbsp; 'test' email to myself but I did not receive that one either. Is Hotmail having a problem today?</p>

            I am having exactly this problem right now. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Have not received any emails to my hotmail account for nearly 6 hours, people have told me (by other means) they have sent me messages, I have successfully sent test message OUT of my hotmail account but none of the replies to those messages have come
 back in.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So it's NOT junk mail problems, they DON'T need to be added to safe senders etc. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's just not working!!!!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, I've refreshed, shut down browser and re-started, everything.</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>

            I am also having this problem. I sent myself a test email using a different email address but it has not come through. I sent a test email out of my hotmail to my other address and that came through fine. It is not a junk mail issue as I often send mail
 between the two. I have also restarted the browser/computer/signed out &amp; back in etc. Hope somebody can help.

            Hey Rhyan,
<div>I just wanted to thank you for your advice. &nbsp;My problem was that after opening an email from a friend, that looked genuine but was obviously not, I found a similar email had been sent to my friends and that I could no longer receive any email on my hotmail
 account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I went to the email rules to find a rule had been set up to delete all emails with my email address in either the 'to' or 'cc' field. &nbsp;Why someone would want to do this, is beyond me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway I can now send test emails to both email accounts, so it looks like it's fixed. &nbsp;Thanks for your help.</div>

<p><strong>Graphs in I think all versions of microsoft word including my school's and my edition of it do not display graph's correctly.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you were to enter in the data for a new chart like this:</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one &nbsp; &nbsp;two</strong></p>
<p><strong>0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.5</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you were to enter in that data and make a Line graph of any kind it would display what i put as "one" in a line but "two" would only have two points on the graph and no line connection. I have a very important graph that needs to have the connections

<p>My hotmail account will not open on my phone or tablet. I keep getting a message saying 'sign-in failed' - even though I have not tried to sign in, I was asked to set up two-step verification last night and nothing has worked since.&nbsp; I have disabled this
 on my laptop and I have changed my password&nbsp; and the laptop is working OK now but will not work on my phone or tablet. I have gone into setting on both devices and tried to change to the new password but it just keeps saying 'incorrect'. The sync is set to

            <p>Hi Bronwyn Johnston,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and I am happy to assist you in setting up your Hotmail account from your devices. To begin with, this happens when the account went out of sync with the device,&nbsp;the mail server settings were not configured properly or the
 two-step verification is enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since changing the password didn't work, I advise that you:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Remove and re-add your account from the phone. Check out this link for the steps:

 manufacturer</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Ensure that the mail server settings are properly configured. Refer to this link for the values:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/send-receive-from-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Send and receive Outlook.com email from an app</span></a></li></ul>

<p>We will also need the affected email address for further investigation. <span>

<p>getting the Single Image installer is a problem. It is only given to computer builders. It contains all of the applications that are in Home and Student, Home and Business and Professional AND it allows you to use product keys for any one of those three
 to only activate the appropriate applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have the 25 character Product Key?&nbsp; If not, you can extract it from the computer using one of these tools:</p>

may be able to extract product key information from a file saved externally</span>. This is useful if you‚Äôre trying to get the key details from the backup of a now defunct machine. Try the /Regfile option.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>After installing on my system, I ran the program <span>
<span>√†</span></span> AS ADMINISTRATOR <span>
<span>√ü</span></span> and then <span>clicked on File
</span><span><span>√†</span></span><span> Select Source.</span> Once in this menu it may appear a little overwhelming, don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs not that complicated and your not going
 to break anything else. Select the circle next to ‚ÄúLoad the product keys from external Software Registry hive‚Äù. Now from here you may have to browse to a slightly different location depending on where your windows.old folder is located, but you want to basically
 browse to the following and open this file:</p>
<p><span>C:\Windows.old\Windows\System32\config\RegBack\SOFTWARE</span></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>After opening this file select ok; you may have to wait a few minutes for it to load the hive and give you your keys, but if they‚Äôre there you should see them and be able to fresh install your MS Office.</p>
<p>Please note that this did work for my Office 2007, it also gave me my Vista Home &amp; Personal Key, and Internet Explorer... lol! I hope this helps someone else too! And remember backup before you do any upgrading/downgrading/or destruction
 to you PC.</p>

<p>Thanks Rohn007, Good advice. Obtained my 25 character key. Tried to enter the key but it was rejected.</p>
<p>Contacted M/S support and chatted with support technician. He identified the problem and provided a new installation and downloaded all good know. Cannot speak highly enough about M/S support. I was pleasantly surprised. Thanks too to the community for the
 great responses.</p>

<p>Apparently there was an incomplete registration attemp. The technian removed the offending entry at the M/S end. I am guessing a bit as to the cause but I had purchased a new laptop and copied (transferred?) to it. Again from memory I recall an issue with
 multiple installation on different computers. I think i was allowed one install on a desktop and one on a laptop. I copied from laptop to laptop.&nbsp; Cannot specifically remember how i caused my ptoblem but think i deleted some files.My new laptop does not have
 office installed, still need to do this? Should I uninstall from the old laptop then use the desktop to provide the install on the new laptop? Or should i use the downloaded installation file provided by M/S today?</p>

<p>Fair enough, they often don't explain what they do to make a fix. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2010 retail licenses allowed you to install on 1, 2 or 3 computers depending on the specific license you had. The 2 and 3 counts were for 'Retail' licenses that typically came when you bought it from a retail store. 2 count for "Home and Business" or "Professional",
 the 3 count for "Home and Student".&nbsp; The 1 count was for when you bought all three factory installed AND activated or used a Product key card.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately there is no way for us to tell what type of key you used.&nbsp; Assuming it is a retail license you can have it installed on at least 2 machines at the same time, so go ahead and use the installation file they provided.&nbsp; But first check to see if
 there is a free trial of Office 365 on the new computer. If there is, uninstall it BEFORE installing Office 2010.</p>

            Hi again. The key was for a Home and Business installation so i guess max of 2 installations.

<p>Yes, if it was a "retail" license you have the right to install on up to 2 machines at the same time AND to transfer those installations to other computers as required.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have the original card or sticker with the product key? Look for a small 3 letter code, probably in the bottom right corner.&nbsp; If the code is FPP you have a retail license. If it is something else, let me know and I'll try to translate it.<br />

<p>Hi Rohn007, thank you for your interest. As mentioned before my desktop computer is a refurbished unit. It does have stickers on it for windows 7, and Office H&amp;B 2010. It does not show the 25 character key.</p>
<p>The Office label has near thetop has "S4Y-00005".</p>
<p>Lower down on the label and alongside a barcode is "00022-900-194-362".</p>
<p>Along the right hand edge is X19-10934.</p>
<p>The label clearly mentions no commercial value- for authentication only.</p>

            Does it matter? The phone will use the best audio codec it has, and which matches the best one the network, which the phone is connected to at the moment, supports.

<p>Several Nokia phones have WB-AMR codec support for voice calls over internet (see Forum Nokia). &nbsp; Not sure this is very useful, as the most common wideband codec for VoIP seems to be G722 (e.g.: Siemens Gigaset telephone models and others)</p>

<p>On this page is written that Nokia E72 is used for AMR-WB in Orange France. I try more firmware types of E72 but no AMR-WB is possible. Does somebody know what I have to do with E72 for using AMR-WB?</p>
<p>I personally tested that Nokia N96-1 S60 and Sony Ericsson W995 have AMR-WB and it is possible to make a AMR-WB call in our lab, see attachments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly, please visit the blog to view the requirement of Focused Inbox:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I notice that the Focused Inbox option has been appeared in the ribbon. Could you remove it from the Ribbon and add it again to check the issue? Please refer to the article:

<h2>            Not getting email from subscription service in outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have subscribed for a service and they had sent an email for verifying the account. However I couldn't find any mail in my Inbox or Junk mail folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I again contacted the service provider and informed them about this. I was told that verification email is sent by an automated process and I am required to log in again to resend the verification mail. I had done the process twice and I am getting message
 that mail has been sent. I still couldn't see the email either in my Inbox or Junk folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The service provider says that their system is sending out emails but it is the Microsoft servers that might be blocking the mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I&nbsp;receive these mails? Can any one help me with the procedure to be done to receive these mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Amit</p>

            <p>I have had a *** Email address is removed for privacy *** email account using Outlook.com (now Outlook Mail) for many years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting 06/21/16,</p>
<p>1. I am no longer receiving emails sent to my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** email account even when I send them to myself from another email service. I can send emails okay - just not receive any. I haven't changed any of my server settings.</p>
<p>2. I am getting email delivery errors sent back to me when I send emails to friends who have "MSN", "HOTMAIL" and "LIVE" accounts, all of which process through Outlook.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe something is not processing properly through the Outlook.com servers. I hope that one of the moderators would check with MS and let us know if there is a known problem so we can sit back and wait for it to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 06/22/16: I am now receiving emails sent to my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** email account when the sent email only had my address in the address field. However, I am not receiving emails to my&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** email&nbsp;account when the sent email had a group list
 in the Bcc email field.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Laurel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As your account is upgraded to the new version of the <strong>Outlook.com </strong>
which is <strong>Outlook Mail, </strong>I suggest you to wait for couple for days &amp; check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting step I suggest you to access through different browser &amp; check if he issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information follow the below article.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 UPgrade... how will we know changes have been made and we can try again&#63;</h2>
                    I tried 12 times this past weekend to download and install Windows 10 on a fairly new (1 month old) HP Stream 11.6 and every time it would complete download, say it was installing, then restart the computer..... back to 8.1 as it was.&nbsp; Looking at the download
 record, it shows other downloads successfully installed, and every attempt to do Windows 10 as "failed".&nbsp; I had an almost&nbsp;completely empty SDHC card in D: drive and had selected that drive at the point requested in the download, but nothing ever got written
 on that drive.&nbsp; I wasted a whole weekend monitoring all these attempts, and now there's still a pop-up recommending upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; How will I know something has changed, and it's worth my time to try again?

<h2>            WordArt in 2010 does not have the 2007 styles available</h2>
                    I am using Word 2010.&nbsp; I want to insert the 2007-version of Wordart, specitidally WordArt style 14.&nbsp; Word 2010 does not provide that option.&nbsp; 2010 allows me to insert Wordart and then use the Drawing Tools/Format to modify it, but nowhere does it seem
 I can easily use the 2007-version of teh Wordart styles.&nbsp; Am I missing something?

            Select the WordArt object, then in Drawing Tools - Format, try Text Effects - Transform (or 3D Rotation). It's likely that you'll find what you need. (When I first saw the new WordArt feature in Word 2010, I was convinced that they'd done away with the
 good stuff... but I ultimately found most of it hiding under Text Effects.)

<p>
</p><p>I have two (2) machines running outlook 365 on a microsoft exchange account.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have deleted the profiles and even the data and created to try to get this resolved.&nbsp;&nbsp; It works for a few days maybe even a few weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it comes back.&nbsp;&nbsp; One machine more
 often than the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've searched and searched and I see no solution but the recreate the profile.&nbsp;&nbsp; Surely someone with MS can help me with this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; I pay monthly for a project and I feel there is no way of getting any true support.&nbsp;&nbsp; Doesn't look
 like I'm the only one out there with the problem. </p>

            <p>Hi Broner,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you encounter an issue that Outlook cannot launch successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To have a better understanding of the issue, please let me know:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What‚Äôs the detailed version of the Outlook client? You can see it by clicking&nbsp;<strong>FILE</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Office Account</strong>&nbsp;&gt;<strong>About Outlook</strong>.</li><li>Does the issue occur to any email accounts configured in the Outlook profile or only Office 365 accounts have the problem?</li><li>What if you remove the account and re-configure it with a new profile?</li><li>Also share the screenshots of the errors you met when you cannot log on Outlook.</li><li>Do you mean that once you delete the old data files, the issue can be resolved temporarily?</li></ol>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lance</p>

            <p>mine typically waits a few days.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm wondering if my problem is that I have 5 machines accessing the same MS Exchange server.&nbsp;&nbsp; It really is a drag though that I pay for the 365 and set up the exchange so that it is all with MS and it still doesn't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Nice when it works, but frustrating to have to reset the profile every 3 - 4 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've looked for solutions and came up with nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; If enough of us are having the same problem, maybe we can get MS to give us a solution or at least tell us there is
 a Bug that they are actively working on. </p>

            <p>Hi Lance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried deleting the registry keys, deleting and recreating the account and profile and was able to consistently reproduce the issue each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">With a fresh head this morning, I tried a slightly different approach:</p>
<p>
</p><div>I ended up removing all profiles and accounts, and then ran the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365, selecting the option regarding being prompted for a password.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>After running its tests, it ended up creating a new profile and starting Outlook, which connected and synchronised the email.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I closed Outlook and re-opened it a few times, and each time it started ok.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I then added a new account to connect to my old POP3 account, set this as my default, and when I restarted Outlook I got those same error dialogue popups.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I removed the profiles and accounts again, and repeated the steps, however after adding the new
</p>
<p>POP3 account I did not set it as default.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I was then able to open Outlook ok, and have tried several times closing and reopening successfully each time.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I then went into Control Panel, Mail (32-bit) and selected my POP3 account as default, and again tested opening and closing Outlook repeatedly, which has worked each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only difference that I can see from my manual attempts, is that the profile name is now the full email address, rather than just Outlook which is what I was using. Although I also added profiles like TempOne, TempTwo etc with the same lack of success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I don't know what the tool has done differently to what I was doing manually, but it is now working, so I guess we'll see how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

                    <p>
</p><p><span><span>I have an Access query that has dates, and Access appears to recognize them as dates (they are formatted as dates).<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I then link the query in Excel where I want to use additional formulas to analyze and summarize&nbsp;the data.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I want to be able to use Countifs to count all dates in 2016 for a particular salesperson (making sure to exclude null values) that occurred in 2016. This works just fine for dates typed into Excel, but it's not
 working on the Access data -&nbsp;Excel doesn‚Äôt seem to recognize the dates as dates.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Similar sample data:</span></span></p>
