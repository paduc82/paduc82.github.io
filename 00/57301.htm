<p><span>Per the connectivity test results and checking your domain, I found that corresponding DNS records related to Skype for Business Online service of your domain

<h2>            Netflix app not working on console</h2>
                    
<p>Hey can anyone help with this. I was using Netflix fine last night. Everything was working normal. Now I go on today and try to start Netflix and doesn't load and immediately goes to the input screen on my tv and says format not supported. It just stays
 on that screen and then I can't even get back to Xbox. I have to restart it using the button on the console. I tried everything I could think of like uninstalling Netflix and then reinstalling it but It still does the same thing. I also unplugged everything
 several times and restarted it and nothing. I seriously dont know why it's doing this especially since it was fine last night. Can anyone help</p>

<p>Hi xMETALxCUPCAKEx,</p>
<p>I am having the same issue. Tried uninstalling, restarting, changing inputs, etc.</p>
<p>I do have a somewhat unique configuration in that due to an in-line audio receiver for surround, I am only able to view menus in 720. If I force the XBOX One to 1080, I lose signal. Because other apps don't have this problem, HBO Go, Amazon Video, Movies
 &amp; TV, etc. -- My educated guess is that Netflix has started forcing 1080 format in their application menu. If your setup has trouble displaying this, then we are out of luck until Netflix changes/fixes this behavior.</p>
<p>Going to run a test connecting my XBox One directly to the TV with HDMI and see what happens. However, this isn't a solution for me (and maybe others), as I would be sacrificing my entire sound system and be forced to use the TV's speakers (*cringe*).</p>
        </p>

<p>Quick update - I have confirmed that the issue is that NetFlix is now forcing 1080 when you launch the application. I plugged my HDMI connector from Xbox One directly into my TV and watched the TV change resolution from 720 to 1080 when NetFlix launched.</p>
<p>This is very unfortunate for anyone running using some legacy HDMI pass through/inline for audio/input control/etc. I really dislike using my TV's built-in sound, but at least it lets you still watch video. Guess I'll have to look at a new receiver.</p>
<p>I can't say if this was intentional by NetFlix, or a fluke. I seem to remember this happening in the past once and then they resolved it. But that's not something we can rely on. Ultimately, not the fault of the XBox One in any way that I can tell.

<p>Yea this is really bad for me because my tv doesn't support 1080 resolution. So if they don't fix it that means I have to buy a. Ew tv just to be able to watch Netflix. That is honestly ridiculous especially when it didn't do this before at all</p>

<p>Yes I will try to send you a screen shot but really it looks like every other screenshot with 100% disk usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started experiencing this this summer when there was a major Windows 10 upgrade with Cortana and all sorts of other things that I don't want or use. Can I disable Cortana?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually when I have the high disk usage, everything I try to do has a blue circle of thinking about it trying to work on it. Usually it just takes a long time but not infrequently I get a timed out message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't actually use very many sites so I have been considering it all. I am not sure but, it seems like perhaps the issue occurs when I don't close out my Washington Post Online. Is that possible?<br />
</p>
<p>I will test the theory tonight and let you know what happens tomorrow.</p>

<p>So I can't give you a screen shot of the 100%CPU because currently it is working fine. I can tell you that while Norton was using a small amount of disk space, the biggest users was "System" and 2nd biggest was something about reporting errors to Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have antiviral software enabled and I can see that one of the steps to perhaps resolving this&nbsp; is to temporarily disable it. I did not disable Norton because I was worried that would leave me even more vulnerable to whatever was going on, however Norton
 disk usage while present was small. Are you aware of any known software issues with Norton?&nbsp; Do you think it is safe to attempt to temporarily disable the antiviral software during the next 100% disk usage crisis?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is what I get when a ask it to show all App history in my task manager, which seems to accurately reflect my usage including the fact that I often leave my computer with Firefox running. I tried once to see if leaving Washington Post open used all
 my disk space, but they actually witched to a new system with respect to commenting the day before I experimented so I am not sure if that was the problem or if the problem will continue. It is entirely possible it had nothing to do with the Washington Post
 site at all. <br />
</p>
<p>I am surprised by the usage of certain apps that I don't use at all.&nbsp; I don't use Microsoft Edge but it&nbsp; had CPU 1:34:52 and Network 84.8MB. Why??? I don't use Cortana and yet it had CPU 0:07:26 and Network 20.6MB. Why? Twitter used CPU 0:00:08 and Network
 2.4MB. Why in the world does Twitter have anything to do with my PC. Can I disable Microsoft Edge, Cortana and Twitter as I never plan to use them on my PC?

<p>I continue to have the issue. Today I tried to disable Norton from the task manager but it would not allow me to do so. I uninstalled Norton, restarted my computer, deleted all Norton files left on my computer and then reinstalled Norton.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We get Norton through Comcast. I contacted Comcast and they referred me to Norton. Norton took control of my computer and verified that I have the latest version of their software, did some tests and Norton seemed to be working properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked the Comcast rep and the Norton rep if they had experienced problems such as this. While they were both tried to evade my questions they both told me that they both said that they are not experiencing problems with 100% disk usage and are unaware
 of problems related to Norton or Comcast. The Norton rep said that sometimes Comcast users may experience problems because updates go from Norton to Comcast to User rather than Norton to User. That was not the case in this instance, because he verified that
<p>
</p><p>While Norton does use some of my disk space, the Norton tech said that&nbsp; is what it is supposed to do, keep checking to see that all is well.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Activation Issues and 2nd Level Support</h2>
                    <p>All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had trouble forcing Windows Update to upgrade me from 8.1 to 10.&nbsp; I tried the media creation tool in order to force the upgrade that way, and it wouldn't work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both would error out with an error that had no error code and just said Windows Upgrade failed...
 nothing else.&nbsp; So I contacted support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st contact - support worked with me and tried all the ways I did to do the upgrade and they could not</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd Contact&nbsp;- Scheduled call from 2nd Level support - They tried to do the upgrade and they tried various permissions settings and other issues and ALSO could not get it to work.&nbsp; They suggested we do a custom install.&nbsp;&nbsp; They did it with the ISO and it didn't
 work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, they had me boot with the thumb drive in order to do a custom install that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got Window 10 to install however it never activated.&nbsp; The 2nd level support said to call back after 48 hours as "they have never seen it not fix itself".&nbsp; I got the following error code when I look at the activation window.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error code: 0xC004C003</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gave it 3 days and it never activated.&nbsp;&nbsp; I called back again</p>
<p>
</p><p>3rd Contact - They told me to run the Windows Activation Diagnostic Tool.&nbsp; This is what I got.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

</p><p>Based on the codes it sounds like they want me to purchase a code.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a valid and purchased copy of both window 7 and then 8 (upgraded to 8.1).&nbsp; I called back again</p>
<p>
</p><p>4th contact - I am sorry you'll have to wait for 2nd level to call you back.&nbsp;&nbsp; I told them that THEY told ME to call back.&nbsp; I am sorry sir.&nbsp;&nbsp; then hung up</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was 2 weeks ago....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I scheduled 2 calls.&nbsp; BOTH times I was hung up on before I was even given a chance to talk.&nbsp; Anyone have any suggestions on how I can contact 2nd level support or how to fix an activation issue like this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Nate,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience caused to you. I would like to inform you that if you're upgrading to Windows 10 from a previous qualifying version of Windows, then after upgrade, Windows 10 should get activated automatically.
</p>
<p>Please be informed that if you perform a Clean Install in the first attempt, then it will ask for the product key, therefore it is recommended that first you should perform the upgrade even if you wish to perform Clean Install in future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to install the previous version of Windows 7SP1/ 8.1, get it activated and then perform the upgrade. If you face issues with upgrading or need further assistance, then get back to us and we'll be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Logitech G19S problems with Windows 8 Pro x64</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been a Logitech customer for 18 years now and I've probably had more Logitech equipment than cooked dinners. And my latest purchase is the eagerly anticipated successor to the Logitech G19 with the G19S. Although it comes with an insane price tag.
 It also comes with a nightmare experience trying to get this device to work on Windows 8 even though t he product has been certified to work with Windows 8 it still caused an absolute headache to get the darn thing to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To an untrained eye a novice, one would think the keyboard has been installed twice. When in fact the keyboard hasn't been installed twice at all, one is for the keyboard the other is for the LCD and USB ports for the keyboard. Although, to confuse matter
 even worse. Windows sets the icon as two keyboard, when in fact it should have been
<strong>G19 Gaming Keyboard</strong> then <strong>G19 Gaming Keyboard/LCD/USB</strong>&nbsp; because all it does is confuse the matter. Look at the properties of the hardware then you'll get an understanding why there are two icons. Although my argument is the description
 should have been separate so not to cause confusion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The G19S keyboard has (USB Ports 500mA MAX) which when coupled with the USB receiver for the G700S mouse, looks as though the ports are being overloaded because when you start Windows 8 it comes up with the blue Windows Logo with (no spinning circle at the
 bottom of the page) I have left it to see if Windows will load but noting. unplug the USB cable from the port and then restart Windows 8 with the USB cable removed it will load fine. reattach the USB cable from the keyboard to the rear of your PC. Everything
 is fine until you turn your PC on again and it comes up with the same problem. What I have discovered, is by removing the receiver from the rear attached to the USB receiver docking port, to the front USB ports without the USB docking port and just the little
 receiver. There is no interference, not crashing or the keyboard causing Windows to crash when loading for the first time.</p>

<p>I need to run some more tests today and see if my theory is correct. But It looks as though at the moment it is stable and I haven't experienced any issues with the keyboard. I have restarted the PC to see if there is any conflict at the initial boot up
 of the PC and it is fine. It looks as though there was a conflict between the receiver for the mouse and then USB cable for the keyboard. Is these are in the same area as the keyboard it causes Windows 8 to be unstable. If you move this to the from of your
 PC. A little receiver sticking out of the front of your PC isn't intrusive. It is small and compact so it doesn't show that much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the research I have done last night and this morning, it looks as though there was a similar problem with the predecessor the G19 I have read articles&nbsp;and community&nbsp;forums with similar problems&nbsp;with Intel and AMD systems. &nbsp;</p>

            I eventually cracked it and you're never in a million years think that this would have been the plausible cause of the problem. The G19S and G700S connected in proximity to each other was causing the USB Bus to overload. Me personally I can't see this
 being the cause... but, it works and it's stable and that's all that counts at the end of the day.
<div><br />
<div>The G700S signal on the receiver is 1000Hz which is a lot stronger than a normal wireless mouse as there is no lag or drop in signal. Although, I found; that with the reviver connected to the USB Dock connected within proximity or next to each other it
 caused the USB Bus to overload. I moved the none intrusive receiver to the USB Port at the front of my rig and it is now all stable and loads every time. This is the most bizarre experience I've ever been through and now I know for sure what the plausible
 cause of the problem was if anybody else experienced the same problem as mine. Just remove the USB Dock for the receiver and plug the receiver in the front USB port of your rig.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What a nightmare of an experience that I shall never forget. That you Logitech you kept me trouble shooting for a whole day.</div>

<p>Status: Failed</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel .. Uninstall a program .. Click View installed updates&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Microsoft Windows .. Find KB971033 .. and Uninstalled this update and restarted my pc but it never worked
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempt 2:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Turn off Windows Updates<br />
Go to Control Panel.. Windows update .. Change setting and select"Never check for updates" .. Okay (never worked)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempt 3:</p>
Status: Failed
<p>
</p><p>By Rearming Windows<br />
Click Start .. Type "cmd" .. click on cmd and tried running it as administrator<br />
I Typed in: SLMGR -REARM but it never worked</p>
<p>then i tried SLMGR /REARM instead of SLMGR -REARM.</p>
<p>never worked and the reply was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error: 0xc004F025 Access denied: the requested action requires elevated privileges</p>

            <p>Hi ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model no. of your computer?</li><li>Did you make any significant changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Are you currently able to boot to the desktop?</li></ol>
<p><span>T</span><span>he MEMORY_MANAGEMENT bug check has a value of 0x0000001A. This indicates that a severe memory management error has occurred.
</span><span>As dump files suggest&nbsp;most crashes were related to memory corruption (probably caused by a driver).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Possible causes of&nbsp;Blue screens (BSOD)&nbsp;include corrupted drivers,&nbsp;third party anti-virus software installed, errors in the disk drives etc. So, in order to avoid such errors, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span>Disconnect all the external devices (printers, scanner, USB (universal serial bus) drives, etc...) Except mouse and the keyboard and then boot up.</span></p>
<p><span>If this corrects the issue then add the devices back one at a time until you discover the piece of hardware causing the issue. Then get any updated drivers\software for the device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
Run Memory diagnostics. The Memory diagnostic tool will check and fix any issues with the computers memory. You can refer these steps to run this tool.<br />
a. Press Windows logo key + X.<br />
b.&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;"Control Panel".<br />
c. Select the Option "Administrative Tools" from "System and Security".<br />
d. Select the option "Windows Memory Diagnostic".
<p>
</p><p>Check if the issue is reproduced after running the diagnostic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p><span><span>This issue could also be caused due to outdated Basic Input Output system (BIOS) or chipset drivers. I would suggest you to visit the manufacturers website to download and install the latest BIOS and chipset drivers.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Important: </span>
</span></strong><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

    <title>How do I close my com port&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mceguy...  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I close my com port&#63;</h2>
                    I have a modem that I'm trying to diagnose, it's a USR 56k external fax modem and its hooked to com 4 with a USB to Com adapter.<br />
<br />
When ever I try to check this modem by querying it, Vista says "another program has this port open, please end the program to continue".&nbsp; Well I have no other programs open, so how do I find out which program has it open? and how do I eliminate this program
 once I find out which program it is?<br />
<br />
I just use this modem to send faxes and I use Vista Home premium.<br />
<br />
Thanks,
                </div>

<p><span><span>Hi MCEGuy...,
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Windows Vista Community site.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1) The issue may be caused by your security program which might have conflicting settings as to not to perform certain tasks. I
 suggest that you temporary disable the anti-virus and check the result again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2) You might need to open the port in Windows Firewall
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the link to open the port:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Open-a-port-in-Windows-Firewall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Open-a-port-in-Windows-Firewall</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2) To check if a third party application is a cause, follow this link (</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</span></a><span>)
 for this Boot to the desktop in Safe Mode with Networking option and check if this issues still persists, if the issue is resolved, you need to perform a Clean Boot by following the steps mentioned below to narrow down the exact source and isolate it:
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>You can perform a clean boot to check if any conflicting / third party application is causing this issue.
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can perform a clean boot when your computer is not starting normally, or if you receive errors when you start your computer
 that you cannot identify or when certain applications are not performing as anticipated, you could consider performing a "clean boot." This operation starts the computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Steps to perform a clean boot on the computer that is running Windows Vista:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click
<strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the <strong>Start Search box</strong>, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an
<strong>administrator</strong> <strong>password</strong> or for a <strong>confirmation</strong>, type the password, or click
<strong>Continue</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. On the
<strong>General</strong> tab, click <strong>Selective</strong> <strong>Startup</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Under
<strong>Selective</strong> <strong>Startup</strong>, click to clear the <strong>Load</strong>
<strong>Startup</strong> <strong>Items</strong> check box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Click the
<strong>Services</strong> <strong>tab</strong>, click to select the <strong>Hide All Microsoft Services</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>Disable All</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. When you are prompted, click
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot and then installing the updates, then follow the steps
 mentioned in the following KB article to narrow down the exact source:</span></span></strong></p>

</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also try using the Event Viewer to find more information regarding this issue.</span></span></p>

Hi Vijay K, I don't think you understand, I am talking about serial ports (com4).<br />
<br />
-I was able to get it to work on Vista. Until I rebooted and now I get the same message as below.<br />
<br />
-But Windows 7 reports that "the port that the modem is using is currently open by another application.&nbsp; Exit any application that may currently be using the port".<br />
<br />
-As of yet, I have only microsoft apps loaded (whatever came out of the box with Win7), I see it comes with Fax and Scan software.&nbsp; I tried to use the fax but it says "there is no modem attached.&nbsp; Install one"<br />
<br />
Do you have any other ideas before I dump Windows 7?

<span><span>Hi MCEGuy...,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>Download and install latest drives for NIC (network card) for Windows 7 from the manufactures website and check if that can resolve the issue.<br />
</span></span><span><span>Open Device Manager, Right click your modem / ports and go to the Properties.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>You can try out these options as well&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><strong><span>Option 1:
</span></strong><span>Right click on the device that is using com 4, then click "properties", then "port settings" then "advanced" on the bottom you will see you can change the com setting. Change it to something other than COM4</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><strong><span>Option 2:
</span></strong><span>Under the Diagnostic tab, click Query Modem. If you get a response then the modem is working. Now go to the Advanced tab here you can change the port of the modem is using.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>If this still fails then go into the bios and see if there are any Serial Ports, disable these, as they may be using the same IRQ as com Port 4
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong><span> Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent
 your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></span></p>

Hi,</p>
<p>
What is the max number of shares that can be defined in windows 2012 server (or windows 2012 server R2)?<br />
Is there a limitation for shares number?<br />
Can this default number be changed (increased)? if so, how?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

    <title>What are you expecting from Mods&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> enendaveyboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            What are you expecting from Mods&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Well I guess everyone knows modding is coming, but I have to admit until now I, all I thought it was, was pretty much people messing about, eg Thomas the Tank replacing Dragons in Skyrim.</p>
<p>I first changed the sound file for the pistol in the orignal doom, with my says bang, it was funny at the time.</p>
<p>However I went back to XCOM on the 360, XCOM is in my top 5 all time games, I played it on my 486 when XCOM was first launched and when it came on 360 I was well chuffed, however I didn't play it for long because of the changes the developers made to the
 game, to drag out game play, they make resource and cash unabundent in all game types, so progressing is slow, and even when you need an event they just don't come, they also remove some of the aircraft you can develop, so it was capped at 6, and you can no
 longer have a craft that has people on it and can shoot, which makes your feel frustrated because you have to spend twice the number of resources to get the better stuff which is already restricted.</p>
<p><br />
Anyway, my point is after wanting more XCOM, I had a quick look to twitch and someone is playing a Mod, I didn't know at the time, but he had loads of resource, loads going on, but the aliens were harder to kill but in a slight different way, and different
 types of aliens, they soldiers have more gun options with greater perks, they have added ships similar to the original, they have increased the base number of soldiers in a ship, all in all, more going on, a little harder, but a much more exciting way to play,
 anyway he was playing a mod called Long War, which completely changed the game.</p>
<p>So I guess modding is much more than I thought, and much more indepth, what are you expecting from Xbox one? or do you think it will be a wasted opportunity, as it seems many of MS ideas seem to be?</p>

<p>The consoles are closed systems so you won't see won't see what's done on the PC on the consoles.</p>
<p>Console modding will be editors built into the software or PC mods that are submitted to the developers, reworked by the developers to work on the console and then downloaded with an in-game client by gamers.</p>
<p>Modders can't access the Xbox OS or game files (at least without violating the ToS) so what can be done will be severely limited.</p>

<p>I don't use mods and prefer to play a game the way it was originally intended. One of my friends LOVES mods and will go on and on about how they, "add to or fix" said game. I don't see how blowing though Fallout 4 in 7 hours using god mode and ammo mods
 does that...but hey, that's just me.</p>

<p>Oh I don't expect them to be the same, I understand the limitations, I was just interested on what other peoples thoughts and expectations are for Xbox imported mods.</p>
<p>and I guess it does depend on how they work, if they reply on an xbox team programming them, they IMO it won't work, if there is a sort of Xbox mod sdk, that anyone can use to develop and then get approved (not sure how) then it has a change.</p>
<p>In the same way, if they develop new game modes and extend the game, it will be good, but there also needs to be some fun, without both it will become meh.</p>
<p>I am just thinking it will under delivered.</p>

<p>I often struggled to take Modern Art seriously until I learned the Pablo Picasso said "I was born with the ability to draw like Raphael but it took me years to learn to draw like a child".</p>
<p>He was a master of photographic reproduction before he started messing with convention. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This mastery gave him license to mess with convention.</p>
<p>In other words, before he went and "MODed" art he not only played the game first, he mastered the game. &nbsp;Got everything he could get out of the game.</p>
<p>Therefore MODs are a great way to extend the life of a game you have played to death.</p>
<p>However there are too many ignorant jerks who will never play the game that an artist has taken the time and vision to create... because they read on the interweb that it's not actually running at 8KHD and requires several self proclaimed "fix" patches before
 it's actually playable.</p>
<p>This is the height of the sense of self entitlement that many gamers feel is simply their due.</p>
<p>Just because you 'can' do something doesn't necessarily mean you 'should' do something but that won't stop champions of self interest MODing in a comedy sword and topless women.</p>

<p>I played through Fallout 4 vanilla, I then started a second playthrough with various mods that made the game run smoother, look better, it added to the crafting system, made the lighting better.....Just made the whole game better. Mods for me aren't about
 adding advantages to make it super easy. The mods I get make the game's so much better and add a lot of extra free content.</p>
<p>If a fraction of these mods can be added it's a good start.</p>

<p>The main thing you have to think about will be.</p>
<p>Will the mods be there to fix issues....... and if so, why are they not updated themselves by the DEVS.</p>
<p>And will they charge for Mods, like you would do for skins, or texture packs in Minecraft.
</p>
<p>PC Gaming Mods are so popular because you can pick most of them up for free but just going to the right websites.
</p>
<p>And if they are chargable, i can only assume that Microsoft will want their cut, which is only right on their closed platform</p>

<p>Well it's the only thing I use my PC for, I enjoy modding anything whether it's a game or not. Modding console games? You're not going to get the graphics improvements like on a pc, the hardware simply isn't there. Removing old code and replacing with something
 special? Absolutely, and Fallout 4 has plenty of that. I don't know any modders who don't entirely know the game 1st. All of those game modes you see in modern day shooters were originally mods, things people take for granted like domination, uplink, s&amp;d etc
 etc Before Halo on the PC. Godmode, unlimited ammo and the likes are not really was a serious modder is looking for.</p>

<p>Fallout 4 also has a season mod, so you can change the game world to reflect the actual time of the year. It looks eerily beautiful with snow covering the ground

<p>I can kind of understand what Az is saying, I actually agree you should play the game untouched to begin with. At the same time though if there is a known bug in the game that at the time of purchase the developers haven't fixed, is it really wrong to apply
 the community made one? Sometimes after all the developer's vision isn't what gets released but what they can do under time constraints from the publisher.</p>
<p>As to charging for mods, I really do wonder what is going to happen. Bethedsa tried that recently with Skyrim on the PC and the uproar was huge.</p>

<p>In regards to charging for mods, I don't agree with it, the main reason is because MS won't be charging 1 or $1 we will be talking nearly 10 for the good stuff, and as soon as it that's price to me it becomes pointless (and yes that is based on massive
 assumptions, but look at the price of mobile games which have be brought over the price difference is just silly)</p>
<p>I am also assuming the developers of the mods won't get a penny which again is an issue.</p>
<p>One of the difficulties is certainly what mods can port over based on the constraints of the system, I think graphically would be more challenging than game mechanics.</p>
<p>Actually for me, this could be another reason to move away from console, I didn't know much about it before, and I need to replace my laptop soon.</p>

<h2>            Trying to play left 4 dead on xbox one live</h2>
                    <p>my mom and I have to separate live accounts. We are using our xbox 360 cloud saves on our xbox one. When only&nbsp;one of us signs in, we can play live no problem. But if we both sign in to our live accounts and then try to join a live game, it kicks us into an offline co-op lobby saying "both gamers must be signed in to Xbox LIVE to play online". As far as we know, we are both signed in. Can anyone help us?</p>

<p>Hi Matteo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>It seems that the mechanism that manages the depression of the key is non-functional, or is experiencing some type of mechanical failure. To isolate the issue, we would like to ask a few questions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>When did the issue begin?</span> </li><li><span>Can you confirm if the issue occurred after a software update?</span></li><li><span>Does the issue persist with different application like Word, OneNote or Note Pad?</span></li><li><span>Are there any error messages in Device Manager?</span></li><li><span>Does the on-screen keyboard work?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>For now, we suggest that you follow the troubleshooting steps provided in this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-surface-keyboards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>and check if the issue will be resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regarding with your other concern, battery life depends on the programs running on your device. Could you tell us how long does your battery charge last? You may also check this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/battery-and-power?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined#Battery10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link

<p>Hello Marby,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou for the reply and sorry for the delay with my response. I have had the keyboard replaced from where I purchased the Surface. The only issues I am having at the moment now are that I am unable to locate where to find the function to have the keyboard
 light up at night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The batter usually will last around 4 hours. The programs I am running are chrome and word mostly at the moment due to assignments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Matteo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you want to turn on the keyboard backlight, you can press and hold the F2 key. If you keep on pressing this key, you can see that the backlight intensity goes up.

<h2>            Surface 2 headphone insertion and flash issue</h2>
                    <p>When we first got the Surface 2, we plugged headphones in any situation and&nbsp;as soon as we unplugged it, no sound whatsoever whether headphones are plugged in or not.&nbsp; Restarted sound is back, unplugged headphones, sound is now broken again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Completed firmware update</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Headphones can now be unplugged and reinserted and there are no issues there&nbsp;EXCEPT for flash video when the headphones are unplugged, the audio quits and the page has to be reloaded for the sound to work again.&nbsp; We also had a problem where the volume was
 stuck at a certain level and no matter how much we changed the volume bar up or down to 0 the volume never changed (restart fixed that problem however).&nbsp; These are very annoying issues.&nbsp; Is this a hardware issue or a software issue that will be fixed soon????</p>

            <p>Problem l: I presume you mean Windows Update.</p>
<p>Go to Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; Windows Update and click Change Settings.&nbsp; Change important updates to read : Download update but let me choose whether to install Them ".&nbsp; When updates are there install them until you find the one that causes
 the problem.&nbsp; The problem one you will right click and Hide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem 2: What is the error message you are getting?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem 3: Control Panel &gt; Hardware and Sound &gt; Devices and Settings.&nbsp; Right click your mouse and click Mouse Settings.&nbsp; Adjust your settings from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem 4: If you have a third party antivirus program installed, uninstall it.&nbsp; It is probably causing a conflict with Windows Defender on your machine.&nbsp;

    <title>Update Realtek RTL8168&#47;8111 Ethernet NIC &#40;NDIS 6.0&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Update Realtek RTL8168&#47;8111 Ethernet NIC &#40;NDIS 6.0&#41; disables network support.  Must system restore to repair.</h2>
                    My system specs:<br />
OS: Win 7<br />
MOBO: Gigabyte GA-EP45T-UD3LR LGA 775 Intel P45 ATX<br />
Vid Card: BFG 9800GT<br />
CPU: Intel Pentium E6300 Wolfdale 2.8GHz<br />
Memory: Mushkin 4GB DDR3 1333 (PC3 10666)<br />
Sound: onboard (SoundBlaster Audigy 4 installed but disabled)<br />
<br />
I've gone through the update system with Win 7 quite a bit recently and when I installed the optional updates my network would be gone after the reboot.&nbsp; After multiple attempts to recover it or even create a new network Windows never finds any hardware at
 all for the network.&nbsp; It can't even detect my router or connect directly to the internet through my cable modem.&nbsp; The only way for me to regain network access is to revert using system restore.<br />
<br />
I narrowed the issue down to the optional 60 KB update for the Realtex Network devices published 11/15/2008.&nbsp; I wasn't able to troubleshoot much deeper because all the automated processes are more or less useless without internet support, and I haven't figured
 how to turn off the Windows training wheels and allow me to tinker with advanced settings yet.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Has anyone run into a similar issue and found a workaround yet?&nbsp; All my updates seem to work just fine except for this one.&nbsp; Any tips?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
On a side note: I love the automation involved with this new release, but I'm a fairly advanced windows user and I like to be able to tinker with and debug things on my own.&nbsp; Is there an "Advanced mode" setting for things like the control panel anywhere?&nbsp; I
 haven't been able to find one.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Right click on that update and HIDE it - its an old one and will not work.<br />
<br />
Check with Gigabyte and Realtek for latest Windows 7 drivers.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Glad to have been of help. See the last two paragraphs here on how to stop those old driver updates from
<br />
loading while still having Windows Updates ON.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For
<br />
each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description,
<br />
version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your
<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site
<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software
<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
<strong>If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually
<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and
<br />
then go look for new ones manually if you wish.</strong><br />

<br />Click Choose what the power button does
<br />Click Change settings that are currently unavailable

<br />Click Restart now and see if it works.

<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, well, we need to try something else. Try resetting the BIOS:

<h2>            Is there a way to see what was purchased with my Microsoft Points</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>Apparently my Xbox live account got hacked and has been in someone elses hands for the past few days. I'm more of a computer gamer so I don't play my Xbox enough to notice quick enough. The last time I logged into live was June 16th and then again today,
 the 23rd. Sometime over the past week, someone got a hold of my account and spent all of my Microsoft Points. I had somewhere between1800 and 2000 points on the 16th. I was wondering if there was some way to check what those points were spent on and maybe
 somehow appeal to Microsoft and see if I could get them refunded.Thanks in advance for any help offered.</p>
