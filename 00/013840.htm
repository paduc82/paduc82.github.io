<h2>            Fields in Design View are not showing in Form View</h2>
                    <p>Access 2010. I used the wizard to create a form and pull fields from 3 tables, all of which have records in them. On the property sheet Visible is set to yes. Display When is set to Always. I have a subform as part of this form and it's properties match
 those previously stated. I have established relationships between the tables and do not understand what is wrong? In tyring to learn on my own I have created this form in the past and it worked perfectly but I had issues with other elements so I deleted them
 now I wish&nbsp; I would have kept one of them. What can I do?</p>

            First you don't have fields on a form, you have Controls that may or may not be bound to fields in a table. This is a subtle but important distinction.
<div><br />
<div>But it doesn't seem to bear on your issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So you are saying there are controls on your form, that you see in Design View, that do not show when you switch to Form View. Are these only on the subform, or on the main form as well? Is the subform in Datasheet or continuous form view? A screen shot
 might help.</div>

            In addition to Scott's response, keep in mind that a sub form won't show if there are no related records for the record in the main form. The whole area is blank.

    <title>Managing multiple relationship - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Managing multiple relationship</h2>
                    
<p>I am having an issue managing multiple active-sync relationships on my Atom O2 device.
<br />
I set up a relationship on a PC at a previous workplace to sync my outlook diary and tasks. I have now setup a new relationship with a new PC (again, only for calendar &amp; tasks) and need to now make this my primary calendar. However to do this, I need to delete
 the relationship with PC1, which also deletes all calendar entries on the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice on how to change the primary relationship without deleting my data?<br />
Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> ppillay  say:</h3>
<h2>            docx file is blank when emailed as attachment</h2>
                    <p>Using MS Outlook 2007 SP2, MS Word 2007 SP2&nbsp;and Vista SP1 as&nbsp;our O/S. </p>
<p>We are experiencing random incidents where users will attach a saved Word doc (.docx) to email (via Word - File - Send - Email option) The docx&nbsp;gets attached and sent to recipient (internal to company)&nbsp;When the recipient opens the attachment it is blank.
 (they are opening directly from email not saving to HDD first)</p>
<p>In checking&nbsp;the sender's&nbsp;"Sent" folder, the document is also blank. the file size is 4kb, however when it is initially attached the sender believes its proper size. When we view the saved document on the senders laptop,&nbsp;the content is displayed correctly.</p>
<p>I found a forum entry on another forum which seemed to&nbsp;be the same problem but we cant recreate in our&nbsp;environment using the solution provided. (<a href="http://www.pchelpforum.com/email-spam-issues/74611-docx-attachments-blank.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pchelpforum.com/email-spam-issues/74611-docx-attachments-blank.html</a>)</p>
<p>We have had this reported on 4-5 occasions (different senders and recipents however we are unable to re-create and therefore are unable to work out what the cause might be. the users are able to use the functionality - just seems to randomly affect colleagues
 every now and then. </p>
<p>Not&nbsp; a world is going to end issue, but very frustrating and it may be more widespread, just not being reported.
</p>
<p>any ideas on what might be causing this would be appreciated.</p>

<p><br />
Hi,</p>
<p>It says at <a href="http://www.roboform.com/browsers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.roboform.com/browsers.html</a> that the Roboform toolbar will run on some 64-bit operating systems, but not on 64-bit browsers. Not a surprise at this time, considering that 64-bit browsers
 are not in widespread use.</p>
<p>Install it on your 32-bit Internet Explorer.<br />
May be helpful:<br />
When you right-click the IE icons in the Quick Launch area, the Start Menu and the desktop then choose Properties, what's in the Target field?<br />
Targets should be either:<br />
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"&nbsp;&nbsp; 32-bit<br />
"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"&nbsp; 64-bit<br />
<br />
Modify those Targets to be "C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" (include the quotes) and the 32-bit version of IE8 should open.</p>

<h2>            Deactivate Office</h2>
                    <p>I installed Office on a Mac computer running Windows 10. The computer no longer boots up so I've traded it in at Apple but need to deactivate the Office program. I went to my account at office.com but I have no idea which computer was the Mac computer. The
 names for each computer say Desktop and then numbers which I never assigned to any of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Office Installed on two other computers. One is the computers I'm typing on and when I go to "computer name," it's a name I gave it, not something that says "Desktop" and then some number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I figure out which install was for the Mac computer?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
When deactivating Office suite using your account, it will show you the device names that uses the said Suite to easily identify which one needs to deactivate. Regarding your concern, have you tried checking the computer information under Settings &gt; System
 &gt; About to identify if the numbers showing is the computer model? Also, can you provide us a screenshot showing the list of devices associated with your account?

<p>The name of one of the PCs is "Momshp" Here's a screen shot of that info.</p>

<p>And this is what I see on my Office account :</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1f0603d-5b62-4385-807b-8b87c6ea0dd1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1f0603d-5b62-4385-807b-8b87c6ea0dd1" /></a></p>
<p>So as you can see, nothing matches. One of the above installs was on the Mac pc. One of them is on an HP laptop and the third one is on a Surface tablet. I have no idea how to tell which is which.</p>

            Thank you for the information. We could say that the second device listed is your Mac computer because the first device it shows is the computer that you're currently using. You can try to deactivate Office on the second device listed to verify if it was
 your Mac computer.<br />
<br />
Let us know if that works for you.

<p>I should have looked at the information on my Surface Tablet before posting my reply to my message. As it turns out, my Surface Tablet was given a Desktop number and letter combination for it's name and it happens to be the first listing under all my installs
 so I knew one install I needed to keep. I decided to take a chance and deactivate the middle install since it started with a 7 and not a 9 like the other two installs so I thought maybe that's because it's a mac computer.</p>
<p>I guess I was right since I can still use Office on my HP laptop.</p>
<p>Thanks for trying to help me.</p>

    <title>How to export Azure AD Connect Settings as a backup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joewarankie  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to export Azure AD Connect Settings as a backup</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We have recently upgraded our DIRSYNC application to Azure AD Connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;The upgrade recommended an In-Place upgrade, however the in-place upgrade had failed and it uninstalled DirSync prior to failing, as a result,&nbsp;our DIRSYNC configuration settings&nbsp;were lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had taken a snapshot of the server prior to the in-place upgrade, so we were able to go back and retry the upgrade again, however instead&nbsp;we chose to use&nbsp;a parallel&nbsp;deployment upgrade, exporting the Old DIRSYNC config to an xml file and importing that&nbsp;xml
 file into a new Azure AD Connect installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So for my question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I would like to create an Azure AD Connect settings file now that it is running and working fine in the event that the server dies or we have to run&nbsp;another&nbsp;azure ad connect setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Is there an easy way to create a settings backup file for Azure AD Connect and will this backup file be sufficient to use on a new Azure AD Connect install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>

    <title>2520 and Internet Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cpfh  say:</h3>
<h2>            2520 and Internet Explorer</h2>
                    I have the Verizon 2520 and overall it's great. However one big problem I'm having is with Internet Explorer. IE often does not register touchscreen presses as clicks. For example, if I'm logged into the full desktop Gmail site it's basically impossible
 to log out by clicking my profile name in the top right corner. It correctly registers as a click about one out of twenty tries!<br />
Anyone else experienced this and have a fix?

            Ive found that it takes 4 or 5 touches on links to get them to go sometimes but Ive also had this problem in the UC browser as well. I just did a total recovery to try to fix the waking problems Ive been having so hopefully this will fix the touchscreen
 issue as well.

            same happens with some websites on Chrome on Android tablets. as this is not endemic to the level of HTML5 support in the browser, though that does help. there is not much you can do about this, as it would work if you used a mouse, but obviously as it
 is a touch screen register it is a different story.

<p>I have found that using a stylus ( I have a Wacom Bamboo Duo ) gives me greater accuracy on taps. It also decreases fingerprint/smears and you can do all the swipping motions required to operate your tablet. I am also using a Favi FE02BT-BL ultra compact
 bluetooth keyboard you can put in your shirt pocket with great success until my keyboard cover comes in.&nbsp;You can also zoom in and make the object of your touch larger which, I have found gives your touch a better chance of registering. Make sure the stylus
 you select is for capacitive screens. Ones for iPads work fine. Hope this was a help!</p>

            Most of the time I have to hit the search on Google 2 or 3 times to even get anything to type into the search bar as well as multiple touches for links to work. Never have I had these issues with any browser on a Android tablet. I've already done a full
 recovery but that does no good, looks like Nokia/Microsoft have some issues to work out with the software.

<p>I am having the same issue.&nbsp; Im not sure if its Windows or Device problem, but I believe it is purely software related.&nbsp; When i try to select a check box (such as the "remember login" options on many websites) i see the touch register as the box will flash
 black but remain unchecked. It may take many presses to toggle to an "x" but every press results in a brief black flash so i know the touch registered with the driver, but IE ignored it.&nbsp; There are many other similar touch problems with ie, but none that i
 have found in any other application.</p>

            the site may not be optimized for touch...as would seem obvious...but isn't.<br />
<br />
often, zooming in on the area some should make the active areas easier to hit.<br />
<br />
I have found that many sites have that issue and it is not a nokia 2520 issue as it happens on the surface tablets too, I have had the RT/Pro1/Pro2, same on the same sites on all three.<br />

I have found that many sites have that issue and it is not a nokia 2520 issue as it happens on the surface tablets too, I have had the RT/Pro1/Pro2, same on the same sites on all three.<br />

<p>Zooming in can help you hit the link, but it will still register the touch by highlighting and underlining and very often do nothing. Same sites dont do that on my Galaxy 4s or old iPhone (all on wi-fi). I constantly have to tap over and over on a link just
 to watch it highlight and do nothing on this thing.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have full access to my account but CANNOT cancel the pending changes to the security information that the hijacker has set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is because I do not have access to the security email address (it is a very old one that has been deleted).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In thirty days the hijackers security information will be set to my account and I will lose it forever.</p>

            <p>The only way I know how to do this is with a macro. However, then you need to save this file and macro-enabled (,docm) and your users have to enable the macros, which can be more confusing for uninformed users than simply telling them "Click on the Review

It's not malware.&nbsp; It's a toolbar you okayed (you may have not read the fine print when installing another program or visiting a site) to download and install on your computer.&nbsp; To remove it you should uninstall it.</p>

            1. Go to control panel, add/remove programs. Uninstall everything you installed or got installed at the same day you have noticed the toolbar first time.&nbsp;
<div>2. Download and run Adwcleaner or Junkware removal tool - both are free and remove such toolbars.&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. (optional) Scan with Anti-malware programs to check if there was no parasite behind the toolbar install.&nbsp;</div>

<h3> montebeery  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word for Mac&#58;  Creating Heading Style with Numbering...and then run-in text &#40;style separator, hidden paragraph...&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've done a fair amount of research trying to accomplish my objective. &nbsp;I need formal legal contract numbering that allows for a paragraph number followed immediately by text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Section 1 - TITLE</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.1 &nbsp;Text of the section.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC alternatives are to use a style separator or a hidden paragraph mark that allows for different styles to be applied to achieve "1.1" and then the "Text of the section...."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Style separators are not available in Word for Mac.</p>
<p>When I try the hidden paragraph method it eliminates the numbering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I do this in Word for Mac?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely Microsoft doesn't expect me to simply live without the capability?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Monte</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your time in research and reporting on my question. &nbsp;I have continued to work the problem and believe I have found a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The technical preview of Office 2016 for Mac appears to have resolved the "disappearing numbers" problem from the hidden paragraph mark method. &nbsp;I will do additional testing, but I believe Microsoft's update may actually address the issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't yet tried the style separator method. &nbsp;Stay tuned...</p>

<br />
<br />
Most likely the battery is drained or out of charge if the phone won't turn on. It's also possible that you have to replace it. Actually, this is beyond our scope of support as your device is already outdated. To help you with this, have you tried taking off
 the battery, then putting it back again? Have you tried charging your phone using a different charger? Can you provide the troubleshooting steps that you've already tried?<br />

<h2>            Unable to sign in to my Yammer Basic Network</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created yesterday a free yammer basic network with my professionnal email address (not my office 365 family address). It worked perfectly.</p>
<p>But today I am unable to sign in. When I enter my professionnal address, I reach a page which says :</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Create your Microsoft Organizational Account to use Yammer</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Already using Yammer with your work or school account? Please continue anyway, because you now need a Microsoft Organizational Account to continue using Yammer."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Then I enter again my professionnal address and I reach a new page which says :</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Sorry...</span></p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It does not makes sense, there is no IT Department for a free Yammer basic licence with no admin. Can you help me ?</span></p>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been contacted by&nbsp;Robbie E D'souza. He told me that my Yammer Network was upgraded from a basic/free network to Office 365 Pro network. The problem is : I never ask for an upgrading and I don't have a Office 365 Pro licence that's why I created a
 free Yammer network.</p>
<p>He send me an article which does not solve the problem (because it needs a licence office 365 pro) and told me to contact support team but I can't create a ticket without an Office 365 pro licence. Can you help me please ?<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you very much,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello Louis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you add a domain in Office365 tenant it also gets synced in Yammer. This will upgrade your Free yammer network to an Enterprise network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you with the below 2 options</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st option</p>
<p>1) You can buy a subscription for a single user in Office365 and all other users can still access yammer.</p>
<p>2) All users present in Yammer you need to create an Office365 account for them and their should be able to access yammer.</p>
<p>The users email id and password will be managed by Office365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to the below support article for more information.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/Yammer/manage-yammer-users/AAD-account-required?branch=yammeradmin-working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/Yammer/manage-yammer-users/AAD-account-required?branch=yammeradmin-working</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please find the support article for Subscription and billing.</p>
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/subscriptions-and-billing/switch-to-a-different-plan?view=o365-worldwide
<p>
</p><p>2nd option</p>
<p>1) Deleted the users present in the Yammer with that domain</p>
<p>2) Remove the domain from Office365 portal</p>
<p>3) Sign up with that domain in yammer which will help you to start a fresh basic yammer network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any questions please let me know. </p>
<br />

<p>Hello Robbie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer, it is very clear.</p>
<p>But I never add the domain of my company in a office 365 tennant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two account :</p>
<ul>
<li>My personnal account (@outlook.fr) which is an Office 365 Personnal licence (without Yammer on the Office 365 Portal : you can see on the screenshot) that I use to post on this forum</li></ul>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6fe12da-10cd-426a-98b9-007f6401fce2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6fe12da-10cd-426a-98b9-007f6401fce2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>my professional address (call it domainA) that I only use to create a Yammer basic network (yammer.com/domainA) and I never linked to an Office 365 tennant (even my personnal account, they are completely independant)</li></ul>
<p>So I think the problem come from something else.</p>

            Hi, I just tried that with the same result. &nbsp;I have tried creating batch jobs with multiple files. Single files using the "create file" process in acrobat. Print to PDF using the print function in word. &nbsp;I have word 2007 and 2010 on the same pc. &nbsp;If I
 open a word doc in 2007 then convert to pdf by any of these methods it always works ok. &nbsp;Opening the same file in 2010 then converting to pdf causes the same dashed lines to become solid. &nbsp;

<h2>            N96 Display Not working after firmware update</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday I installed the latest nokia N96 Firmware (according to Nokia software updater) and everything seemed fine at first bar the phone acting a tad slow. Later today however, After checking my inbox, and putting my phone back in my pocket i looked back
 at my phone and to my suprise it had turned off. Every time i tried to turn it back on i'd feel the usual vibrate but then just a blank screen. I'm not sure if the phone is actually suppose to be displaying anything or it's not really loading up properly at
 all as I don't really hear any other sound. The battery had 2 bars left and i've since charged it but it seems like the problem lies in the phone itself. I think it's the firmware update (which did install without a hitch) that is causing the problem. I tried
 to plug my phone into the PC via USB but since how the phone isn't actually properly starting up it, my pc won't detect the phone and thus i can't roll back the firmware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else had a similar problem to this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrew.</p>

            I think the only thing you can try now is a hard reset. Unfortunately it means that all the data in your phone's internal memory (C: drive) is lost, so unless you've done a backup recently...<br />
<br />
With the phone switched off, press simultaneously the 3, * and green 'call' buttons. Keep them pressed in and switch the phone on. Do not release them until you see signs of life such as the Nokia logo or the region selection screen.<br />
<br />
It may take somewhat flexible fingers and more than one attempt to do this.<br />
<br />
If it doesn't solve the problem then your only course of action is to take your phone in to your local Nokia Care Point.

<p>Odd</p>
<p>&nbsp;I know sometimes the phone can be a little reluctant to start,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;try the following</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) take the battery out, leave for 5 mins</p>
<p>2) Re-insert battery and plug into charger, leave for a few mins,</p>
<p>does the battery charging icon come on when you do this ?</p>
<p>3) try switching on,&nbsp;</p>
<p>does it vibrate ?, does the screen go white.</p>
<p>If so but the phone doesn't&nbsp; fire up, press the on button again.</p>
<p>Try a few more times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn't work a trip to the nearest nokia care point could be your only option, as I'm not sure that any kind of reset will work if the phone won't boot</p>

<p>Hi Andrew</p>
<p>I've just experienced the same problem as you. Then when I've looked back through previous posts I discovered&nbsp;we're&nbsp;certainly not the only ones it has happened to. It appears to be a regular problem. It is disgraceful that Nokia don't acknowledge their shortfall
 and come up with a proper solution for such an expensive phone. I even tried the total reset to no avail.&nbsp;I will now have to try and get a new phone from them. I have had it 3 months and only decided to update the firmware today because I was fed up with it
 locking up once or twice a week. That&nbsp;pales into insignificance with my problem now though. Did you ever fix yours? If so , how?</p>

<p>I took mine down to Nokia care and they said that the screen went blank as there was a fault with a hardware piece called the UI. It apparently connects the main body of the phone to the display. They replaced this and updated the software for me. Thankfully
 all under warranty.</p>

            Have you tried removing every file from your My Documents folder on your desktop except for one file to see if you can sync one file successfully?&nbsp; If one file syncs successfully, add one more file back to your My Documents folder, sync and assuming that
 file syncs successfully, add the next file. Proceed in this fashion until you sync all files successfully or until your start encountering problems again.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I stopped sync these kinds of files because it just created too many problems for me.&nbsp; There really is no reason to sync Office files because the Pocket PC can read full version .xls or .doc files with no problem.&nbsp; I just copy the files directly to
 my SD card and avoid syncing them altogether.<br />
