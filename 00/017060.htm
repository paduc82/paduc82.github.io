    <title>Inserting photos into body of E-mail - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Inserting photos into body of E-mail</h2>
                    Good Evening. &nbsp;This afternoon I was trying to insert a photo into the body of an E-mail and it didn't appear, but was apparently "invisible" as it came through in the E-mail but was labeled as just "image." &nbsp;I tried a number of different .jpg files and
 some would appear and other did not...and no apparently rhyme or reason? &nbsp;Two specific examples, both previously modified/cropped/color enhanced using Photoshop, were a combined photo of my two grandkids and the other a separate photo of my grandson. &nbsp;Trying
 to insert the combined worked fine, it immediately appear in the body of the E-mail...but the one of my grandson didn't appear, but again came through in the E-mail as an attachment labeled image.jpg. &nbsp;Real head scratcher...hoping someone can explain.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Second question deals with trying to send the same photos to my gmail account on my iPhone from Entourage. &nbsp;E-mail gets to the iPhone but the photos won't open. &nbsp;Spent an hour and a half with Apple Care and they couldn't figure it out. &nbsp;Going on line and
 opening my gmail account and the photos are there just fine. &nbsp;Even more head scratching...if I forward the E-mail with the photo that will not open on my iPhone from my iPhone to the gmail account it was originally sent to --- wait for it --- the forwarded
 E-mail and the attached photo open? &nbsp;Black box magic?????</div>

            <p>Hello Carl</p>
<p>Do you have the issue with only jpg files that you have edited? Or does this happen with pictures that are unedited as well?</p>
<p>How large are the file sizes? Can you resize the file (make a copy) down to say 500kb or less, then send. What about if you send the picture as an attachment, will it go through and can you open it?</p>
<p>Just thinking out loud, but there may be an issue with the edit or something Photioshop did to the file. Or it could possibly be too large...I am sure there are other questions or things to try, maybe someone else will add some good info.</p>
<p>Thanks...</p>

            Entourage 2008 will not show jpgs on the message if they are over 400kb.<br />
<br />
You can put your images in a folder and zip them to send. Control-Click (Right-click) on folder and select Compress to zip.<br />
<br />
I suggest you get a free <a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTU3MTI2MTk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DropBox account</a> and use their photos folder to share your images.<br />

            Appreciate the response, just not sure I understand it. &nbsp;Maybe I wasn't making myself clear in my question? &nbsp;I'm drafting an E-mail and want to insert a .jpg in the body of the E-mail. &nbsp;Sometimes it appears in what I'm drafting and sometimes not, although
 it apparently is included as an invisible "image" which is attached. &nbsp;I just tried the&nbsp;combined photo of my two grandkids and the other a separate photo of my grandson (both jpgs are 586KB). &nbsp;Contrary to your asserted 400KB limit, the grandkids opened in the
 E-mail as it was being drafted while my grandson's photo did not.
<div><br />
<div>I appreciate the recommendations and am sure there are a great variety of work arounds, but they don't explain the head scratching "How come this is happening?"&nbsp;</div>

            Can't really answer that...hard to tell what I've edited, usually a given procedure before sending any photos. &nbsp;Shoot the photos, download, edit, save, eventually send. &nbsp;Tried a 'raw' photo from a recent Maui trip and it wouldn't appear as an insert. &nbsp;But
 as noted, edited photos of grandkids and grandson would &amp; wouldn't appear in the body of an E-mail and both were 586KB, so size doesn't appear to be the issue. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>When the E-mail is sent, both arrive with the grandkids in the E-mail and my grandson attached as "image.jpg." &nbsp;I just tried this again and 1st inserted my grandkids...visible in the E-mail. &nbsp;Then inserted my grandson and the visible grandkids "disappeared"
 and my grandson was also not visible. &nbsp;So I inserted the grandkids again and they opened in the draft. &nbsp;When I sent it to myself, the grandkids were visible in the body of the E-mail and both the grandkids and my grandson were attachments, both labeled simply
 "image.jpg. &nbsp;Still looking for the&nbsp;"How come this is happening?" &nbsp;answer.</div>

<p>Note that inserting a worksheet does not make Excel calculate so if you insert a sheet you will have to tap F9 to make the formula update. Deleting a sheet does make Excel calculate and as the formula is volatile it will update automatically.</p>

</p><p>Try using the <strong>Edit&gt;Paste Special</strong> command and paste text as <strong>

            That's some kind of markup, but it doesn't look like straight HTML. If you can post a URL where I can find this, I can give you a better idea of what it is and how to avoid it, if possible.

    <title>Why is there no &#34;Recover deleted messages&#34; file under - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jane elizabeth lotz-drlik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is there no &#34;Recover deleted messages&#34; file under &#34;Deleted&#34;, when one clicks on the &#34;Deleted&#34; file folder&#63;  Outlook gives this direction - no such option. Help&#33;</h2>
                    


I want to check on a response that may have gone to Junk mail, which I may have deleted inadvertently.  (The new Outlook Junk mail viewing process is so slow and difficult, even on fast, new systems, that I have great trouble checking the file and emptying.)   I went to the prompt at page bottom which says "Want to recover Deleted messages?" and clicked the "Learn more" prompt.  The directions came up from Outlook, directing me to click on the "Deleted" folder icon, go down the page, and click the "Recover deleted messages" icon. 



There is no "Recover deleted messages" icon.   



Please help.  I am finding the new Outlook system disillusioning enough as it is: very slow, recovery of Contact list impossible unless I guess at/list every name I can think of manually, and nonexistent filtering in the Junk mail.  I continue to receive, after months of marking them out, e-mails from Raspberry Ketone, match.com, Ivy College, ****, and dozens more.  Since Outlook obviously doesn't bother to

            The Recover deleted messages is not an icon but is instead a link. You should be able to just click on the words "Recover deleted messages". Is that not shown at the bottom of the deleted folder?

            <p>Thank you for your reply, Woodg. I used the wrong wording - icon instead of link.&nbsp; There is, however, no "Recover deleted messages" link available.&nbsp; Before Outlook took over, there was such a link.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any more suggestions?&nbsp; Believe me, they are appreciated - just hate Outlook!&nbsp; If I could transfer my Contact list and e-mails, would be through with Outlook immediately, but Outlook works so badly, I can't recover anything.

<p>The way I see it is that you're not able to find the link for recovering deleted emails and to unblock emails in your account. I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me help you with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is your junk mail filter set to exclusive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, this may have caused your issue on receiving still unsolicited emails in your account. Please it to exclusive now so that

<p>As a workaround, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to Skype.</li><li>Choose any contact, in the chat box type the command /dumpmsnp and click Enter.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, proceed with uninstalling and reinstalling Skype. Ensure to clear the data and reboot your device before reinstalling.</p>

            No, it can't. Instead, we will get the Windows Phone 7.8, which features only new start screen, for now.

    <title>most frequent number in a range formula, but with conditions - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            most frequent number in a range formula, but with conditions</h2>
                    <p>hi everyone, and thanks for looking.</p>
<p>I have a formula (found online and modified only slightly) to calculate the most frequent number in a given range, but now i would like to modify it to return the most frequent in s range below a certain value&nbsp;(which will change every time).so it ignores
 a more frequent number if its too high. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the formula is :</p>
<p>newvalue = Application.Index(rng, Application.Match(Application.Max(Application.CountIf(rng, rng)), Application.CountIf(rng, rng), 0))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it works fine, except that sometimes, the most frequent number isnt the correct one. what it is doing is looking at a list of weights and selecting one where the scales level out. but in some instances (where the scales only get a couple of seconds to give
 out readings) i get an incorrect value. I have also written a consecutive values macro, but it isnt alwyas of use (eg the scales levelling out might not&nbsp; have 2 consecutive values)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>eg in this list, my formula returns 155.74, but i would like it to return 155.24 (i.e. less than 155.5, for example)</p>
<p>its not always the second or third most common ocurrence, so i cant go down that road. Thanks matt.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a worksheet formula I would use this in case there are no value &lt;n</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=IFERROR(MODE(IF(A1:A23&lt;B1,A1:A23)),MODE(A1:A23))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the vb code could become this which simply tests if we've read anything into the array</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub Mode_If()<br />
&nbsp;Dim lastrow As Long, x As Long<br />
&nbsp;Dim GotValue As Boolean, FullRange As Range<br />
&nbsp;lastrow = Cells(Cells.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row<br />
&nbsp;Set FullRange = Range("A1:A" &amp; lastrow)<br />
&nbsp;Dim myarray(10000)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;For x = 1 To lastrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Cells(x, 1) &lt; Range("B1").Value Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myarray(x) = Cells(x, 1).Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GotValue = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't follow all of this but lets say we have a simple data set like below in A1:A20 of 10 * 1s and 10 * 2's</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we calculate the mode in C1 with =Mode(A1:A20) it will return 1 but 2 is equally as common so to get this second mode we could use this array formula to return the second mode</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=MODE(IF((A1:A20)*(A1:A20&lt;&gt;C1),A1:A20))</p>

    <title>Sharepoint Site - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kathrynell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharepoint Site</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've created a site via 'Sharepoint' (not sure now if it is a 'team site' or 'communication site' now!)</p>
<p>Within the 'documents' section, I've added a couple of PowerPoint presentations, but the label on it just says 'PowerPoint Presentation' and I can see no way to amend this on Sharepoint to give it a sensible name so people know what it is (if I upload a
 PDF, it uploads with the name that the document is saved as, which is much better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the image that Sharepoint chooses to showcase - can this be predefined?&nbsp; With the PowerPoint files, it's just selected one random slide in the middle of the deck, in the PDF one, it defaults to the front cover?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can help.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Kathryn</p>

<p>Hi Tina</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is screenshot of the left pane in 'Documents'</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a32cccfa-da74-496c-8fd9-3a28d9880270?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a32cccfa-da74-496c-8fd9-3a28d9880270?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the label - both the PDF and PPT ones:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff0312c3-7fd9-4c1f-bb20-714ae050af5e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff0312c3-7fd9-4c1f-bb20-714ae050af5e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And here is a screenshot showing that I've just right clicked and changed the name of the document within the document library as suggested,which didn't work:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3dec204b-1088-44d9-b4ff-c75c4f08f8cb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3dec204b-1088-44d9-b4ff-c75c4f08f8cb?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Q2.&nbsp; I uploaded both files, neither were created online</p>
<p>Q3.&nbsp; Within the 'documents' area in my sharepoint, I used the 'Upload' and 'Files' options</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks - I'll open a new query for the other question</p>

<p>Hi Tina</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to create screenshot 2, on my sharepoint page I selected 'edit', then navigated down to the 'documents' section, clicked the pencil icon on the left to edit this section.&nbsp; Then in the 'layout' area in the pane on the right, I have it set as 'filmstrip'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I go into the 'documents' area, and use the 'upload' button and select my document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, in this view, all document images default to the title page:</p>

</p><p>We have tried reproducing the same environment and are stuck now. Could you please share with us&nbsp; record a video about how you edit the Documents web part in the screenshot 2, and then encounter the issue,&nbsp; and then upload it via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">Private Message</a> to share with us?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, in the video please explain the below screenshot's settings&nbsp; of the web part or other settings you may have made. And what are the attributes or properties you have set to this presentation? We can see there is a label attached to the presentation.
 So if you create a new document locally and online, does the issue occur?</p>

<p>Hello - I am having a very similar issue.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The powerpoint doc on my computer defaults to a thumbnail of the first slide.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I uploaded it to the <em>documents</em> page on sharepoint and when it displays on the filmstrip view of my main site it is showing slide 7 as the thumbnail.&nbsp; I have tried to delete and upload again, but it keeps showing slide 7 as the image in the filmstrip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to change the filmstrip view so that it displays the first slide as the thumbnail image?</p>

    <title>How to get bar graph to ignore blank cells - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to get bar graph to ignore blank cells</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm working in Excel 2010 and trying to make a bar chart. I have a bar graph with 5 categories. So far, I have 2 data series which have values (manually entered) that are displayed on the chart (10 data points from 10 cells). I have a third data series for
 which I do not have values except for the last category (1 data point from 1 cell). I'm trying to make my bar graph so that there are no gaps in the four categories without the 3rd data series, but it still displays in the last category which has data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried hiding the rows which have empty values and then deselecting the "Show data in hidden rows and columns button". This simply moves the 3rd series from the last category to the first category (not what I want) and still leaves&nbsp;gaps in the other
 categories. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried entering =#N/A in the cells because I read in another forum that supposedly excel will not chart null values, but this also did not change the gaps in the graph.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

<p>Hi Shane,</p>
<p>Please check if you have been assigned the license to download and activate your Office client.
<br />
Go to <a href="https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions</a> , check if you can see "The latest desktop version of Office".</p>
<p>If no, the admin can go to portal-&gt; Admin-&gt; Users-&gt; Active Users, select your account and add your product licenses (Enterprise E3-&gt; Office 365 ProPlus or Business Premium-&gt; Office 365 Business). Then you should be able to see the option&nbsp;then download &amp;
 activate your Office for Mac.</p>
<p>Please let us know your updates for further help.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<h2>            Printing a word document onto a yellow legal pad paper</h2>
                    <p>I am using MS Word 2013 and am trying to get a letter sent out using the yellow lined paper and can't get the words to line up within the spaces properly. Some of them line up but not all of them. Any suggestions as how to make the word line up on the paper?</p>

            I tried that and found another option that worked, but it took alot of trials before I got it right. On each line I created a seperate text box and then worked on moving the text box to fit the lines.&nbsp;

<h2>            How can I copy all Comments from a Word 2010 document and paste them into an e-mail message&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My office PC has just been upgraded to Office 2010 from Office 2000 (yes, really). I work as a copy editor, so I use Track Changes and insert Comments when I have a query for the author of the document. I then have to send the author a "query memo" by e-mail,
 which is basically a plain-text message with the queries pasted into it. In Word 2000, I could easily click in any comment, hit ctrl-a to select all, and copy the whole list of comments out into my Outlook message (or anywhere else). Is there a way to do this
 in Word 2010? I have tried everything I can think of and have searched in the Help files, but I haven't been able to figure this one thing out.</p>
<p>TIA!</p>

<p>Thanks so much, Cindy and Doug!</p>
<p>Entirely by accident, I also discovered another workaround today: it turns out if you have your cursor in the first Comment and use shift-down arrow to scroll down through it, you can scroll down through _all_ the comments and copy them all that way! (you
 can't scroll up through the Comments, though -- only down.)</p>

<p>I am running Bluestacks with no issue on Build 17134.5 in my laptop. You must have Hyper-V completely turned off, and virtualization needs to be on. This is directly from Bluestacks:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
How do I disable Hyper-V on Windows? </p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<div>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>This article will guide you on how to disable Hyper-V.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<p>Since BlueStacks uses virtualization technology and when other hypervisors like Hyper-V, VirtualBox or VMWare are running, it may impair our&nbsp;ability to run optimally. Disabling Hyper-V will help speed up BlueStacks' performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Audience</strong></p>
<p>All users who are looking to boost BlueStacks performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BlueStacks versions affected</strong></p>
<p>All versions&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Geo's&nbsp;affected</strong></p>
<p>All Geo's</p>
<p><strong>Steps to disable Hyper-V:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can&nbsp;<strong>disable Hyper-V</strong>&nbsp;on your PC by following the&nbsp;steps shown below.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel → Programs&nbsp;→ Turn Windows features on or off</strong></li><li>Uncheck <strong>Hyper-V&nbsp;settings</strong>, and click OK.</li></ol>
</ol>

<p>Windows Feature will apply the changes and ask you to restart. Please&nbsp;restart your system/PC<span>&nbsp;</span>to apply changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.bluestacks.com%2fhc%2farticle_attachments%2f115014109743%2fimg2.PNG" height="484" /></p>
<p><span>Once Hyper-V is disabled, your experience with using &nbsp;BlueStacks should be a lot more smooth.</span></p>
<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;Hyper-V is only available in the following versions of Windows</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 8 Pro 64-bit Edition</li><li>Windows 8 Enterprise 64-bit Edition</li><li>Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit Edition</li><li>Windows 8.1 Enterprise 64-bit Edition</li><li>Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Edition</li><li>Windows 10 Enterprise 64-bit Edition</li></ul>
<p>We genuinely appreciate your choosing BlueStacks. We hope you enjoy using it. If you have any further questions, please contact us at support dot bluestacks dot com. Thank you very much.</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most likely you’re signed in to a different Skype account on your Skype app.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If you created your Skype account with a unique or personalized Skype Name, sign in to Skype using the Skype Name and not the email address.
