<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ongoing loading of programs in the background may cause a delay in the computer's response. A pending update, 3rd party programs like antivirus, or changes applied to the device before the issue happened may also cause this. Let's replicate the concern
 by switching to another user account. If none, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13951/windows-create-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a new user profile</a></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>to replicate.</span></p>

            Have you replaced any hardware, or reinstalled Windows 7?<br />
<br />
If it stays at "non genuine" and you have trouble activating Windows 7 open the Windows Activation Wizard while in Windows 7 to use the phone and activate Windows:<br />
1. When you reach the desktop click Start, then in the Search box type:&nbsp; slui.exe 4<br />
2. Press Enter on your Keyboard<br />
3. Select your Country.<br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, then call the number given and hold for a real person.<br />

<br />

You can try what's below, but it probably won't help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Open the Performance Troubleshooter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Open the Performance Troubleshooter by clicking the Start button.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; B. In the search box, type "troubleshooter," and then click Troubleshooting.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Under System and Security, click Check for performance issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, Try Repairing The Windows 7 Installation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Insert the Windows 7 DVD and restart your computer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Boot from the DVD.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Choose your language and click Next.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; D. Click Repair Your Computer and then select the operating system you want to repair.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E. Click on the Startup Repair link from list of recovery tools in System Recovery Options.<br />

            Hi Robert.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends Avast, AVG. Norton or McAfee, but we have solved many problems over the years by having them uninstalled.
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanner install and run a full scan with Malwarebytes free scanner: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />You can turn off the free trial at any time in the app's Settings &gt; Accounts.  
<br />
<br />If there were known hardware or software issues on your PC it would have blocked it, so the fact it keeps trying is likely an install integrity issue.  I'll give you all options now.
<br />
<br />For Version Updates what I do is install Media Creation Tool from this link, choosing the button to Install Tool Now and then open the installed app and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can use another PC to create the bootable media or download the ISO to transfer  back to the problem PC and open the media or click to mount the iSO file, right click Setup to Run as Administrator.   
<br />
<br />If further problems then following these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These special steps lead up to if necessary choosing to save nothing when running the media which almost always works, and is close but not as good as a Clean Install which is also offered as an option.  Your files should always be backed up if you value them at all. 
<br />
<br />If these do not help then report back any verbatim error message or behavior.  
<br />
<br />If you want to temporarily block the update then immediately after it fails try running the Hide Updates tool downloaded and installed from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If it won't find and hide the Update then you can set a Metered Connection to turn off Windows Updates for awhile until the version matures and you can try again using the method I suggest which always works best:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Almost everyone with major version upgrade problems who Clean Installs the same version does not have those problems.  This Clean Install should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />We would like to see the Installation log to check what caused the update to fail/stuck/rollback.
<br />
<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named files from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />
<br />and 
<br />
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing the path in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.
<br />
<br />Use Onedrive/Google Drive/Mediafire to share the files and drop the links in the next reply.

            <p>Microsoft Solitaire Collection on Windows 10 has always been free and this has not changed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a premium upgrade where you get double coins for Daily Challenges, bonuses in basic TriPeaks and Pyramid, and no advertisements, and the premium upgrade has been and will always remain optional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is giving away one week of the free premium edition in Solitaire to anyone who signs in. It doesn't cost anything, and when the free week expires, you'll retain all the benefits of being signed in (like achievements and games saved in the cloud),
 but without the premium benefits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Short version: When your free premium week expires, the game will go exactly back to the way it was before. There will never be a cost required to play Microsoft Solitaire Collection. :)</p>

            <p>Hi Mohamed,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of the PC?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried updating the graphics card driver after upgrading to Windows 8.1?</p>
<p>3. Are other games working correctly on Windows 8.1?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow these methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong>Update the graphics card driver and check if it helps.<br />
<strong>Download and install drivers.<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers</a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To help troubleshoot issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.
 This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

            <p>my laptop is HP pavilion 15 e-017tx . </p>
<p>Not all games are working slow games which&nbsp;are not graphic intensive&nbsp;I mean the one which require directx 9 such as fifa 13(it runs faster in my old machine running win 8),same case for prototype 2,etc&nbsp;used to run perfectly on win8 but not in win 8.1 the
 performance of other games which require directx 10 or higher for example assasins creed 3, cryisis 3&nbsp;works perfectly smooth.</p>
<p>and I have tried all the above methods before only</p>

            If your Security Center Service is <i>really </i>missing, it is generally a simple matter to replace/add the missing Service, but let's be sure...<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
cmd<br />
<br />
Click OK to open a command Prompt window and enter this command to query XP about the Service:<br />
<br />
sc&nbsp; qc&nbsp; wscsvc&nbsp; &lt;Enter&gt;<br />
<br />
If the Service is <i>really </i>missing, you will see a message like this:<br />
<br />
<b>[SC] OpenService FAILED 1060:<br />
<br />
The specified service does not exist as an installed service.</b><br />
<br />
<br />
If the Service is present, but potentially afflicted, you will see a message like this:<br />
<br />
<b>[SC] GetServiceConfig SUCCESS<br />
<br />

<h2>            One Guide TV listings unavailable for Free to air.</h2>
                    <p>So, I live in Australia. I have an Xbox TV Tuner attached to my console via the antenna. Can get a signal fine. Recognises all the channels just fine. One Guide TV listings, however, "no info available". Been like that for about a week. Connected to Xbox Live. I have done the following multiple times:</p><p><br /></p><p>Restarted the console,</p><p>Unplugged the antenna,</p><p>Unplugged the tuner from the console,</p><p>Reset my internet connection and also tried a different router,</p><p>Cleared One Guide,</p><p>Cleared history,</p><p>Scanned for channels again.</p><p><br /></p><p>All the info is still missing, having said that, as soon as I connect to the tv, it tells me down the bottom of the screen what is currently on and next to air. Yet the entire&nbsp;One Guide has nothing&nbsp;to show.</p><p><br /></p><p>Can someone shed some light as to what is wrong and if it can be fixed. I have tried everything except a new device.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Ok, this is getting ridiculous. I contacted chat support last week, told them about the issue&nbsp;and they said they're aware of a problem&nbsp;with the guide and are working on a fix. Contacted them again&nbsp;yesterday, and they assured me it's still supported in the region despite several tweets from the official @xboxsupport account telling people it's not, and that they've escalated it to an engineer. Now, today, after hearing more reports on wirlpool/aussie outages/twitter, I&nbsp;get a direct message from @xboxsupport telling me the guide's no longer&nbsp;supported in my region. What the hell?&nbsp;<br /><br />Please give us a straight answer! If you've pulled support for the guide in Australia, just tell us! I know xbox are trying to appease only gamers these days, but I&nbsp;bought an xbox only a couple of months ago pretty much exclusively for&nbsp;tv/foxtel now/youtube/local media streaming. If the guide's gone, some kind of warning would have been nice so I wouldn't have wasted my

            <p>I have also tried the same troubleshooting as suggested buy the links. To no avail! It is pretty ridiculous if they have decided that as a region we aren’t quite special enough for One Guide any more. And to take it away without so much as notice? A bit of a low blow from MS.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> theshockzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Profilo sospeso causa errore pagamento. Non so che fare aiuto&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Il 1 settembre di mattina mentre cerco di accedere a xbox live mi esce fuori una finestra dove in breve diceva che il mio account era stato sospeso ,a causa di un errore nel pagamento, fino a che non avessi aggiornato le opzioni di pagamento. Io ho sempre
 usato le carte prepagate, ma a giugno o a luglio mi sembra c'era un'offerta di un mese per 1€ e quindi ho usato una carta usa e getta per utilizzare questa offerta. Per tutto il mese di agosto sono stato in vacanza senza usare l'xbox. Poi torno 1 settimana
 prima della fine del mese e provo a giocare online anche se sapevo che era scaduto l'abbonamento. Con mia sorpresa però vedo che posso giocare online, e penso di essermi confuso con gli abbonamenti (invece di un mese pensavo di averne fatti 3). Invece il primo
 settembre mi esce quella scritta, e per di più non posso visualizzare la pagina "il mio account" qui sul sito perchè mi da l'errore "comportamento imprevisto". Cosa devo fare? Da quel che ho capito devo pagare il mese di agosto poichè si era attivato il pagamento
 automatico su quella carta usa e getta che però dopo il primo utilizzo non era più valida, e quindi in pratica avrei giocato il mese di agosto gratis? Mi spiegate per bene cosa è successo e cosa devo fare per risolvere il problema? E perchè mi viene l'errore
 "comportamento imprevisto" qui sul sito?</p>
<p>Grazie a tutti!</p>

<p>L'errore "comportamento imprevisto" il 99% delle volte è colpa del sito o del browser che stai usando, non del tuo account.</p>
<p><span>La prima cosa che ti consiglio di fare è di aggiungere un'altra carta di credito</span>. Non acquistare codici prepagati di abbonamento perché non servono a nulla nel tuo caso. Poi aspetta un paio di giorni che prelevano
 la cifra mancante dopodiché disabilita l'abbonamento automatico.</p>

<p>Ho rimosso il rinnovo automatico e aggiunto una carta di credito, ed oltre a quella è presente quella vecchia. Non riesco però ad applicare all'abbonamento la carta nuova che ho aggiunto perchè oltre a "modifica" e "rimuovi" non c'è l'opzione "applica all'abbonamento",
 come invece fa vedere qui <a href="http://support.xbox.com/it-IT/billing-and-subscriptions/manage-payment-options/change-xbox-live-payment-option" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../change-xbox-live-payment-option</a>. Inoltre non posso rimuovere ancora quella vecchia, e cosa ancora più strana adesso posso giocare online, e non mi da la finestra con scritto "account sospeso ecc...". Però se vado ad aggiungere un codice
 prepagato che mi da un mese di live mi dice che gli acquisti per il mio account sono bloccati perchè appunto il mio account è stato sospeso. Cosa devo fare? Perchè mi fa giocare online? Non ci capisco più niente! Qualcuno mi da il numero dell'operatore se
 non mi sa dire che fare? Grazie!</p>

                    Hello let me first say thanks for any help with this problem.&nbsp; Ive had this problem for about 2 weeks now and have been trying to fix it for awhile now.<br />
Whenever I open a folder on my desktop explorer jumps to 25% and the folder takes roughly 30 seconds to open.&nbsp; Whenever I try closing the folder it takes about 10 seconds to close.<br />
<br />
My system specs are:
<div>OS=Vista x64&nbsp;</div>
<div>HDD=1 TB Seagate Barracuda&nbsp;</div>
<div>RAM= 4GB Corsair Dominator&nbsp;</div>
<div>CPU= 3.0GHz Q6600 Quad Core<br />
<br />
Ive tested this on empty folders and it still happens.&nbsp;<br />
any other file besides folders work fine such as text documents and .exe files. I ran process explorer and under the threads tab there are two things that take up CPU<br />
SHLWAPI.dll and BROWSEUI.dll ive been unable to fix this issue so any help is appreciated. Ive been using process explorer and ShellExView to try to solve the problem.<br />
-Thanks for any help<br />

====================================<br />
<br />
Method 2<br />
<br />
Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party keyboard and<br />
mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For
<br />
each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description,
<br />
version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your
<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site
<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software
<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click TaskBar -<br />
Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick reference (if you have<br />
a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />

<h2>            hd3000 or hd6000 - that is the question</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
<br />
I need a web camera, and have narrowed my selection to either the Lifecam hd3000 or hd6000 but cannot decide which. From the specs on the Microsoft website, the only significant difference I can see is that the latter can swivel 360 degrees and the former can't.
 Aside from this, the price and the clip style, what are the other important differences?<br />
<br />
The "Compare" function on the products page displays so few parameters (which are all the same for both units) that it does not help me select the one that suits me best.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

                    First of all this problem just popped up out of the blue. I cant log into my xbox live account on my xbox. Heck, my xbox wont connect to live at all so none of the accounts on m xbox will connect. The network test shows that its successfully connecting
 to the internet. I can log into xbox live fine on my daughters xbox with my account. My kids can all log into their live accounts on their xboxes. Ive tried removing my profile but now i cant get it back since it wont connect to live. Ive reset the cable modem
 and router several times. The router recognizes my xbox and i see an ip assigned to it. I even tried manually assigning the xbox with the ip that the router is giving it, to no avail. Ive ssince put it back on auto ip assignment and even tried resetting the
 network configuration in the xbox. If i hook up my xbox straight to the cable modem then everything works fine and i can log into live, so this must mean its a router setting. The only thing is that i uavent made any changes to m

<p>In addition to the post by Vibroplex, you can mention @xboxsupport with any issue/problem if you have a twitter account. This is especially useful if you have a quick question and may prove quick and useful for you in particular if you run into a snag while
 "restoring" everything back to "the way it was". It may be quicker than having to re-post here in the forums.

            <p>Hello PinchedParty570,</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The Sweepstakes is accurate. We do not see any half hours of playtime on your account this week. While we do see a small amount of playtime on the 25th this week, we do not see any amount of playtime that award a sweeps entry. Be sure that you are playing on this gamertag if you would like to be tracked for sweeps.</p>
