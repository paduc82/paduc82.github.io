<h2>            outlook.com e-mail not working in new iPhone 6s Plus and iOS 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This question seems generic because I find a lot similar but not exact in the communities.&nbsp; I've got a new iPhone 6s Plus, and installed iOS 10 on it right out of the box.&nbsp; I setup my work e-mail just fine, but when I try to put my personal outlook.com e-mail
 on it there are problems.&nbsp; Initially it didn't allow me to put the e-mail account on it at all.&nbsp; I would get through the login in the mail setup on the iPhone, but after answering how needs to synchronize (mail, contact, calendar, etc) the setup would just
 go back to the login page and the e-mail would not be setup.&nbsp; I tried again later, and it worked this time.&nbsp; I then viewed the inbox, and saw that messages were listed.&nbsp; But now no message will show up when trying to view it.&nbsp; Also, one attempt the inbox became
 completely corrupted on the phone, not showing the inbox properly.&nbsp; I had to remove the account completely.&nbsp; Re-setup of the account worked as before, but again while the inbox shows messages, it will not complete retrieval of the message at all.&nbsp; Is anyone
 else having this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
                </div>

<p>Providing an actual "link" would be helpful.....</p>
<p>Plus, I've done everything by the book so far.&nbsp; If it doesn't work that way, then there is a problem beyond my attempts to fix.&nbsp; I shouldn't have to jump through hoops here.</p>

            <p>You did not highlight the "link" so I didn't see it originally.&nbsp; I hate that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That page was for the Outlook app, it didn't address any problems with the iPhone's own mail app not synchronizing outlook.com mail.&nbsp; I don't have the outlook app installed, and do not want to install yet another app to something that the iPhone should be
 capable of doing without.&nbsp; I only want Apple's mail app to work with Outlook, and currently it is not working.</p>

            I removed and re-added it a dozen times previously before posting here.&nbsp; The last time, a day or so ago, I just left it there.&nbsp; Checked it again in a couple hours, still the same problem of the inbox showing messages, but none of them coming through.&nbsp;
 The other 3 e-mail accounts&nbsp;I had on the phone were working flawlessly.&nbsp; (Yahoo, GMail, and a work Exchange account.)&nbsp;24 hours later it appeared to be starting to&nbsp;work properly.&nbsp; Though synchronizing still seems a bit slower than normal.&nbsp; (10's of minutes
 instead of the normal couple of minutes...)&nbsp; There is an obvious problem here, not sure if it's in the iPhone or on the outlook.com side of the equation.&nbsp; But, I hope it's found before I upgrade to my next phone.&nbsp;

            OK, I finally got it working on my iPhone just by retrying again and again.&nbsp; But I'm now working on my wife's new iPhone and it also ran into this same issue.&nbsp; And, by the way, the link you posted has instructions that are old and don't apply to iOS 10.&nbsp;
 iOS 10 will now ask for the 2nd factor authentication while attempting to log in.&nbsp; What is happening on her iPhone is you enter an outlook.com address, type in the password, do the 2nd factor authentication, it asks for what to sync, then instead of saying
 done it goes back to asking for account and password without finishing.&nbsp; After trying enough times, it may finally work but we are still not there on my wife's iPhone.&nbsp; It's frustrating.

            <p>If you are running the latest updates(if not, download and install them), try a soft reset(vol.down + power for ~10 sec. until phone vibrates). If that doesn't help, try these steps-</p>
<p>1. Plug in a different headphone and see if it works.</p>
<p>2.After plugging in a headphone, hold the vol up button on your phone to increase the volume.</p>
<p>3.Try playing different media files. Does any file play?</p>
<p>4.If the above steps didn't help, download the windows device recovery tool on your PC and use it to reset your phone.</p>

<h2>            Non Stop Synchronizing Folders</h2>
                    <p>I just switched from Outlook 2007 to Outlook 2013 and since then my email inbox has been crazy.&nbsp; It constantly is non responsive, and is constantly stuck while synchroizing folders&nbsp;
</p>
<p>How do I stop it synchorinizing folders.</p>
<p>How do I stop it synchroinzing with my iphone account as I&nbsp;don't want all hundreds (and mostly filed)&nbsp;emails on both Outlook express and iphone.</p>
<p>I don't know where mails comes into - some messages quickly appear in a folder called important, but others come into the inbox.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>FYI - My folders are:&nbsp; inbox (with personal subfolders); [Gmail]; drafts; sent mail; bin; important; spam; starred; deleted items; outbox; RSS Feeds; Search Folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are these folders?</p>

<h2>            Upgrading windows 10, formatting a disk</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have the Windows 10 technical preview build 9926 and it is about to be expired, so yesterday I downloaded the latest build of Windows 10 as an iso. file. When I start installing it, it gets to 18% and then says that "Something happened, Windows installation
 failed." Why is that and what can I do?</p>
<p>Another quick question, I am unable to format disks, any disk I try to format, windows says "Unable to complete format". Why is that?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Mareketplace apps lists are not up to date</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. When I go to the Marketplace, click games and then go to the XBox Live list, there are some missing applications.</p>
<p>When I go to xbox live games in the Marketplace, there are 32 applications with the top application being James Patterson's Women's Murder Club. On my wife's phone (same model and carrier) and in the Zune PC software there are 34 applications. The additional
 games are Star Wars: Cantina and Bubble Town 2.</p>
<p>If I search for these applications using the Marketplace search on my phone I can find and install them.</p>
<p>Phone: HDC HD7</p>
<p>Provider: O2, UK</p>
<p>Please can anyone help to recify this.</p>

<p>
</p><p>These headsets work just fine with Skype for Business.</p>
<p>

    <title>Cortana refresh interval&#47;Win 10 Phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana refresh interval&#47;Win 10 Phone</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Win 10 on a Lumia 735. I really like&nbsp;Cortana's ability to easily customize interests for a simply scrolled news and schedule&nbsp;list, and one which easily coordinates with other apps.. However, I don't use it because when I drill down in a listed
 item in the interests stream&nbsp;(typically down to a broader Bing list and then linked to a web page) when I return to the Cortana list, Cortana refreshes-- which of course means I have to start at the top again, and furthermore Cortana will have changed the
 order of the listed links. Dumb, Dumb, Dumb.&nbsp;This consumes so much time as to&nbsp;render this Cortana functionality essentially useless for no good reason (not to mention the annoyance).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is-- is there a way to adjust Cortana's refresh interval or keep it from updating temporarily long enough to get through a review of the whole list of links. (I have tried closing the Edge instances separately and trying to scroll Cortana before
 it gets a chance to start a refresh which seems to work but only about 1 in 10 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found nothing in the app or phone settings or in&nbsp;Cortana's&nbsp;Notebook page that seems likely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Sunset on WP 8 &#40;and 7&#41; Support and Security Updates - Ends July 2014&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just read that Microsoft will cease supporting Windows Phone 8 on July 2014.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What??&nbsp; Is this true?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just purchased a WP8 phone and had to bind myself to a three year contract with the Carrier in order to get the best deal.&nbsp; I'll still have 1.5 years left and still owe over $300 on the phone in July 2014.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, people who own very old Blackberry, Android and Apple phones (we're talking 5+ years old) still receive updates and support.&nbsp; Isn't this true?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will be a deal-breaker for me.&nbsp; At the end of the life cycle, I'll have to switch platforms to an OS which doesn't junk my investment every 18 months.&nbsp; I can't be using a phone for business that doesn't keep current with Security Updates, etc., regardless
 of how old the OS is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was going to upgrade my wife's WP7.5 to an 8 this week, but that's on hold now.&nbsp; We'll be switching her in July next year to another OS when I change mine.&nbsp; These things are just too expensive to be treated as throw-aways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry Microsoft, I love WP8, but I need to get greater value and longevity from my investment.</p>

            <blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But in the US, that phone is locked to a network and you're on a 2 year contract with harsh early-termination penalties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this is more akin to a Service Pack update. For example, Windows 7 is no longer supported by Microsoft. WAIT WHAT!? WINDOWS 7 ONLY CAME OUT IN 2009!? FRIGGIN MICROSOFT! Oh wait, if you apply Service Pack 1, Windows 7 is supported again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By then, we will probably see WP8.5 or whatever's next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Yes, it's the same here - the phone is $650 with no service contract, reduced to zero on a three year term which amortizes the phone cost over the 36 months.&nbsp; However, leave early, pay the balance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that you're right - that WP8 will no longer be produced (similar to Win 7) but will still be supported in a continuing stream of security and other necessary updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
I think what Entegy was saying....if Windws phone 8.5, or what ever the next major update wll be, is installed on your device, the warrenty, the End of Life is extended to what ever date is used for that release.&nbsp; Remember, we , well, me, got WP8 on&nbsp;release
 day.....the timer was ticking.&nbsp; When Portico was released, its a WP8 release so the ticker is still going.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next major release will be a WP8.x release....ticker stops on WP8, because you have WP8.x now.&nbsp; that counter starts over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its all really simple....when you throw back a few pints that is.&nbsp; \</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You really won't have a problem with the OS.&nbsp; However, the financing over 3 years will always be an issue.&nbsp; Very few companies officially support a Mobile for greater than 3 years...usually only18-24 months...</p>

            <p>Embedded pictures are the common cause for large PowerPoint files. Office for Mac 2008’s PowerPoint has a built-in tool that can compress your embedded images and shrink your PowerPoint file:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. With PowerPoint open, click PowerPoint on the menu bar at the top of the screen and choose Preferences...<br />
2. Choose the Save tab<br />
3. At the bottom of the window, check the box for "Compress graphics files". This will automatically compress all graphics in your PPT files.</p>

<blockquote>I have internet shop and i want to create time calculation(Time in, Time out) and total in hours of usage and calculate in Money.&nbsp; For example:
<br />
<p>Colum A1=Time in, B1=Time Out, C1=Total Hour usage, D1=Total amount of money to be paid.<br />
[....]<br />
This is the condition: 1hour =1usd <br />
If user use start from 2 hour free half hour. <br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
If A1 and B1 have just time in the form hh:mm (or h:mm AM/PM), then try:<br />
<br />
=C1*(B1-A1+(A1&gt;B1))*24 - (B1-A1+(A1-B1)&gt;=TIME(2,0,0))*C1/2<br />
<br />
Multiplying by 24 converts the Excel internal representation of time (fraction of a day) into decimal hours.&nbsp; For example, 3:45 (3h 45m) times 24 becomes 3.75.<br />
<br />
The expression (A1&gt;B1) covers the case when time-in is before midnight and time-out is after midnight by effectively adding 24 hours.&nbsp; For example, if A1 is 23:00 (11 PM) and B1 is 2:00 (2 AM), B1-A1 is -21:00.&nbsp; By adding 24:00, we get the correct result, namely
 3:00 (3h 0m).<br />
<br />
But that assumes the session is no more than 24 hours.&nbsp; It would be easier if you recorded date as well as time in the same cell, even if you format the cell to display only time.&nbsp; Then the formula can be:<br />
<br />
=C1*(B1-A1)*24 - (B1-A1&gt;=TIME(2,0,0))*C1/2<br />
<br />
The last expression subtracts half the hourly charge (C1/2) if the session time (B1-A1) exceeds 2 hours (TIME(2,0,0)).<br />
<br />
Veasna wrote:<br />
<blockquote>At column A1=Time in, can we just put other key to make current time automatic to that column? and about Column B1=Time Out too.</blockquote>
<br />
You can certainly create a button linked to a macro that inserts current time (and date) into A1 and B1, if that is what you mean.<br />
<br />
But that raises a whole set of questions.&nbsp; In a nutshell, I do not believe you have explained your requirements in sufficient detail for us to give you a good answer for this part of your question.<br />

                    <p>I am trying to forward an original email in outlook.com, but it keeps giving me the most recent iteration of that email chain of correspondence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is sensitive information in that chain I don't want forwarded, but want the original email sent only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I do that ?&nbsp; In hotmail, I just went to the original, or whatever step of the communication flow I wanted forwarded and send that email.</p>

<h2>            Excel freezes just after opening a blank workbook</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My Excel 2013 freezes just after I click on Blank Workbook after launching the application. Even after waiting for a very long period of time, Excel window is still in the frozen state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to open an already present workbook, I see the message "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Microsoft Excel is waiting for another application
 to complete an OLE action</span>". Even with long wait times, the OLE action does not get completed and it falls into a loop. To remove this error, I tried to go to the account settings '<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">File-
 Options- Advanced- Clear the Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) check box, and then click OK'&nbsp;</span>after opening the blank workbook, but couldn't change as Excel freezes after opening the blank workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if I can change the DDE setting somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jay</p>

            Try following one by one as check after every step whether it resolves the issue-
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br />Note - Since you are on Office 2013, repair may ask for your product key. Hence, repair only if you are having your product key.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.
<br />
<br />Now open Excel and see if the problem disappears or not. 
<br />
<br />Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
<br />Open Excel &gt; ALT+F11 &gt; If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window &gt; Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter &gt; You will have your path below.
<br />
<br />3. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Couldn't try out this method as I do not have the product&nbsp;key as the Office installation is provided by my organization.</li><li>Tried this out, but no luck. Excel still freezes after clicking the blank workbook icon.</li><li>There was just one Addin which was enabled. Disabling it too didn't help. Nevertheless, I am able to open a blank workbook or existing workbooks in safe mode. But this is still not allowing me to change the DDE setting. I can use EXCEL temporarily in safe
 mode but I am not sure what all features would get restricted.</li></ol>
<p>Please let me know if there is any other workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Repair should solve the problem. Work with your IT to repair. It might ask. It is rare but if you fall under rare, then you will have to provide.

<h2>            Outlook flagging on Friday</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
When I flag an email message for follow up for "tomorrow" and the current day is Friday, I want "tomorrow" to be Monday (my next work day) not Saturday.<br />
<br />
My Outlook options already have my work week set so that the checked days are Monday--Friday.<br />
<br />
How can I address this?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<p>I'm aware of the current functionality from the article and the table. My question is how do I change the functionality so that if the current day is Friday, then flagging for "tomorrow" will set the start date and due date to the next work day which I have
 set to Monday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't make sense for items to start and become due on Saturday when my work week is Monday to Friday.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t paste sign in details so NBG with password managers</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a LastPass password manager user and for some reason Skype on Android (8.0.0.44736) is one of a few annoying apps that won't allow LastPass to auto-fill it, and what's more Skype doesn't permit&nbsp;pasting of the sign in fields (a long press in the user
 field&nbsp;only gives Copy, Share, Select All options) , effectively rendering it unusable for those using password mangement apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this?</p>

<h2>            Xpress Music, Broken Screen and addressbook</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a express music 5800 and a broken screen. I want to get the addressbook off the phone and perhaps some other data, but from memory if I try to do this with PC Suite I get prompted for "Data Xfer Mode" or "PC Suite mode" on the phone when I first connect
 it to the PC. Not being able to see the screen (cause its broken) how do I get around this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Al</p>

<p>just connect the phone and let it run for a minute and then press the green key, it should start in PC Suite mode by default !</p>
<p>Good Luck</p>
