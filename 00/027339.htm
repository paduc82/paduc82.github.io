            Hi Douglas,
<br />This Outlook.com on the web's Deleted Items folder? If you select the messages and delete them, do they delete?  
<br />
<br />FWIW, it can take a surprisingly long time to empty the Deleted items folder when you click the button to empty the deleted items folder. Also, if you deleted a large quantity of mail (as in thousands of messages), you should empty the recovery folder.       
        </p>

<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community using my experience with Microsoft products.

<br />Try to use another browser, and In Private mode. Sometimes extensions or cookies can block authorization and cause problems. It is also recommended to clear cache and cookies from time to time. In this article you will find the way how to delete the cache and cookies for most of the browsers <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies</a>
<br />
<br />It is better to avoid Safari, Firefox and Chrome for this as there are lots of problems with browsers recently <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-on-outlook-com-8c95d913-d96b-4065-9171-e1fa44b03ff5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-...</a> That is why please test this in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer in Private (CTRL+SHIFT+P)

<p>Diane Poremsky, Yes its the deleted items' folder or trash which isn't emptying. I noticed that a few months ago, several (4-8) Trash items were not being emptied out of say 1000 selected. Now its all of the Trash folder, which is not emptying. My Chrome
 browser seems to be working well. I can still delete items from my Inbox which go into Trash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other problem is that today I'm not receiving gmails, so I'm not sure what this is about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your knowledgeable background.</p>

            Another issue which I'm faced with over this past 45 days is my 'Delete as Junk' doesn't include 'Mark as Junk'.&nbsp; I was using Zoom-Diagnostics from MacKeeper.&nbsp; A local professional who helped me 45 days ago to&nbsp; replace my defective hard-drive (original
 issue which I turned to Zoom to solve) with a Solid-State-drive advised me that Zoom creates more problems than they are worth.

<br />I can still delete items from my Inbox which go into Trash.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />If you delete them from the trash folder, do they delete? You can select the first message, hold shift and scroll down and select another message to select a group. Then delete them.

            Dear Douglas,
<br />
<br />When you are deleting emails from Inbox or another folder they are no actually deleted, they are moved to the deleted items folder. Afterwards they are deleted after 30 days. If you want to delete them earlier, you need to go to deleted items and actually delete them from there, in this case space will be released.
<br />

    <title>emails not downloading to Outlook 2007 from server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sergio pelligrinelli  say:</h3>
<h2>            emails not downloading to Outlook 2007 from server</h2>
                    In the last few days Outlook has stopped downloading emails from my ISP server, or rather an envelope appears but without subject header or any content (File sizes are 836B - 868B). &nbsp;The emails are on the server when I check via webmail and they arrive
 on my smartphone. &nbsp;I can send emails from all my Accounts in Outlook. &nbsp;I initially used the Tools function to change the settings slightly on my Accounts, and the problem went away, only to return a day or so later. &nbsp;I then deleted the Accounts and recreated
 them, and the problem went away, only to return the next day. &nbsp;Any advice for a user with limited expertise would be most welcome. &nbsp;Thanks.

            I did all this, still nothing. The issue started after I put on WIndows 10. It had so many glitches I went back to WIndows 7. Then when I went to zone.msn games it said cab verification failed on Popcap Games for a few days. Next came the value of the
 property HasFlashVersion... Seems like it is a Microsoft problem. I took off and reinstalled Flash, IE, did all other fixes suggested, no luck. Now what???

    <title>Hotmail login then goes to blank page. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicko265  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail login then goes to blank page.</h2>
                    <p>Tried Using mozilla firefox, chrome and Safari. PC is running Windows 7, Toshiba QOSMIO.
</p>
<p>I enter username and password into hotmail (outlook.com page) and then it redirects to blank page that eventually loads, stating there is a problem with outlook at the moment.
</p>
<p>I can either, enter the 2 stage verification process (which I have done about 200 times) or you can report the issue to microsoft (and they do... well I dont know what they do because nothing has happened for 4 days now)
</p>
<p>I have read tons of forums and all say similiar things. </p>
<p>So I have changed my hotmail password, I have followed the instructions of clearing browser, cookies, cache, history, checked the computer date and time, made sure the browsers are up to date, made sure windows update is up to date, have run three anti virus
 checks a malware check, reinstalled firefox, used the fiddlercap app to gather the data (but dont know who to send it to) checked the add ons and extensions made sure they are all up to date. also have reset the router, and started pc in safe mode with networking....
 NOTHING!!! </p>
<p>I was able to access hotmail momentarily (on the first day this started) after installing Boxer lite app onto iphone 4 but then it crashed my phone and after that happened itunes crashed and still does not recognise the phone. So any help from the anonomous
 microsoft powers that be would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit</p>
<p>I have tried on 3 different computers and two different iphones 4 and 5s</p>

<p>The folk at http://css.one.microsoft.com/ &nbsp;sent an email on 06/06 stating they would be in touch within 24 hours. That was sent more than 72 hours ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I'm a bit unsure what to do now and was just wondering how long am I meant to wait.</p>

            <p>Hi Froilan,</p>
<p>Thanks for replying, in answer to your questions, </p>
<ul>
<li>What is the date/time when you installed your&nbsp;Boxer app?</li></ul>
<p>I installed the boxer app on May 30th AFTER Hotmail stopped working <br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Were there any recent app updates?</li></ul>
<p>I know there were some updates around that time, unfortunately my old phone has been formatted back to factory settings, so I can't check the update history (there may be a way but I'm unsure)</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the version of the Boxer app?</li></ul>
<p>4.4.4 According to their site in the app store they updated on the 21st May. </p>
<ul>
<li>When did you first notice&nbsp;the issue?&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the issue happened&nbsp;right after installation of the Boxer app, or at a later time?</li></ul>
<p>I first noticed the issue (not being able to access hotmail) on 30th May. I installed boxer the same day, but after the Hotmail issue arose (I installed boxer as a way to try and get into hotmail).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone crashing issue happened a bit after I had installed boxer, I opened the app and a bit later tried to open hotmail through the native email app on the phone. ( I don't think I had closed the boxer app in the background) When I did this I couldn't
 get into hotmail and my phone was really unstable. But I couldn't access from a P.C either (and still can't)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what else I can provide to the tech's, <br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps </p>
<p>Regards </p>
<p>Nick</p>
<p><br />

<p>&nbsp;I appreciate yours, and the other mod's help. I gotta tell you though, I'm a bit over it now. I've been waiting since 29th May without a resolution. I have been in touch with the support techs and they have passed the buck back to you guys. I understand
 that you are volunteers and can only deal with so many problems at a time (but it's still very frustrating)
</p>
<p>Let me know when someone in the support specialist department and actually has a solution.</p>
<p>Thanks </p>

<h2>            Compile error in hidden module&#58; link - Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>10/21/16 UPDATE - I have not been able to get an answer from the person who had this problem originally. I would love to mark someone's response as the answer, but I'm not sure what method he used. If I ever get this information, I will pass it along. Thanks
 so much to the group for all the helpful suggestions. I truly appreciate it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE - I apologize - just found out the person uses a MacBook and Office 365 - if this question should be posted in another group, do you know which one? Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a user who is receiving the message "Compile error in hidden module: link" - other than that, Word works fine, but it is annoying and he's like to get rid of it. It happens when he launches Word. If it helps, he is launching Word from the pinned icon
 on his taskbar tray.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found articles similar to the error in the subject, but not specific to "link" - can someone explain this error and suggest how to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Tammy</p>

<h2>            Outlook repetitiously asks user to delete ost file before it can function.</h2>
                    <p>The user can use outlook online, but their Office 365 Outlook app gives a message that the user need to delete the .ost file. He has done this several times, but he still gets the message. Currently, there does not appear to be an .ost file to delete. What
 steps should we take te resolve this?&nbsp;<br />

<p>Am using Microsoft Office 2010 (Beta) and will shortly have to purchase a full, current version.&nbsp; I know that Microsoft Office 2010 Professional&nbsp;licence is for 1 PC.&nbsp; However, the product description (on some websites)includes the following, 'one user on
 Primary <strong><em>and</em></strong> Portable PC'.&nbsp; This statement<strong><em>seems
</em></strong>to indicate that the product can be installed on a single users home pc<strong><em>and</em></strong> also on that same single users mobile laptop.&nbsp; Is this the case?&nbsp; Grateful for clarification.</p>

    <title>Default Mail App in Windows not automatically Outlook after install - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Default Mail App in Windows not automatically Outlook after install and setup</h2>
                    <p>Hey All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Outlook 365 installs and is setup, is it supposed to change the default mail app to Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't checked in years, but I've come to notice that the majority of our machines don't have Outlook set as the default app and the ones that do, that was set manually through the Windows 10 GUI. I could have sworn that Outlook used to set itself as
 the default mail app or maybe I'm just crazy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Outlook 365 is NOT supposed to set itself as the default app automatically, is there a way to make that happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>-Dave</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes. The default mail app won't change by default. You need to manually change it. In Office 365, it is impossible to change the settings for multiple users at a time. Your requirement is related to Windows settings, it is suggested to contact Windows support
 for further assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;you have more than one email program on your computer, you can follow the steps below and make the Outlook as default mail app.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Outlook.</li><li>On the <strong>File </strong>tab, choose <strong>Options &gt; General</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Start up</strong> options, select the <strong>Make Outlook the default program for E-mail, Contacts, and Calendar</strong> check box.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't work, you can go to the Start menu, select Settings&nbsp; &gt; Apps &gt; Default apps, select which default you want to set, then choose the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Few programs cannot start after update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing 9897 everything worked fine for couple days, but then some updates were installed, and problems began. I cannot start mail, calendar, store applications. Cannot use search. I tried to install mail, then install it back, this is how I found
 store app cannot start. I uninstalled these latest 4 updates, they were installed on 11/28, it didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm stuck. No app store, no mail, no calendar, no contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ironically, Windows feedback app doesn't start either.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank for the update. Sorry to know that you are facing similar issue with apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Windows 10 Technical Preview is still in development stage. The graphic drivers which are required for Windows Apps to run might not be available by manufacturer or it might not be compatible. Hence you might be facing this issue. You may try installing
 graphic drivers in <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">compatibility mode</a></strong> and check. For more information refer this article:</p>
<p>

<h2>            New Contacts Don&#39;t Show up in TO or in search</h2>
                    <p>I have web email - outlook live mail (msn.com). &nbsp;Over last couple of months noticed that some of my contacts won't show up as suggestion in "TO", and if I do a "search people" when trying to address, the person doesn't even show up in search. &nbsp;And, when
 I go to PEOPLE, and do a search, the person does not show up in that search either, even though I can scroll down and see the person in my contact list. &nbsp;I do get a response when I "search directory.." &nbsp;in PEOPLE, &nbsp;but that does me no good when trying to address
 the email to these people (which I do all the time). &nbsp;For one person, it has been working forever, but just stopped about a week ago. &nbsp;And nothing I do helps (tried deleting contact in my IPHONE and in live mail and re-adding). &nbsp;For the other person, I simply
 changed her email address. &nbsp;Now, she never shows up in TO as a suggestion or with Search. &nbsp;HELP</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Normally, contacts whom you normally send an email will show up as suggested contacts when entering info in the TO field. Regarding your concern, does the issue occur if you use another web browser? Also, are the contacts appear as suggested contacts if you
 send an email using an Outlook app?

 the most. &nbsp;<br />

            Thank you for the information. We're currently investigating the issue so that we could identify what's causing the problem. In the meantime, can you check if the issue occurs using an InPrivate browser on your computer? Also, kindly check if you have
 installed the latest Windows update on your computer? This will help us to validate that the issue is not with your computer.<br />
<br />
We look forward to your reply.

<p>As I said originally, I use WEB outlook.com mail. &nbsp;I don't use the mail account that comes with my MAC. &nbsp;So, there are no accounts configured. I do not have a profile, except on my web email and I have not made any changes to that account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not technical. So, if Outlook.com has different types of email accounts, I am clueless about what they are.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern with Outlook.com can be due to the configuration of the email account in the server. To isolate issues related to contacts, we'd recommend exporting and importing them back to Outlook.com. To do this, we'd recommend performing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Export</span></p>
<p>You can refer to the steps posted on this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Export-contacts-from-Outlook-com-to-a-CSV-file-578cca22-3550-4c73-b3f0-9978cfeac83f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to export your contacts. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: A CSV file will be created and you'll have to save it on a location that you can remember so you can easily import it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Import</span></p>
<p>You can refer to the <strong>Step 2 </strong>section of this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-contacts-to-an-Outlook-com-account-285a3b55-8d93-4ac8-93df-43fffd13b2f1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />Which version of Android is installed?
<br />
<br />Try below steps and see if the issue still persists:
<br />
<br />Go to your Phone settings and look for Applications or Application Manager.
<br />
<br />Look for Skype and then select Force Stop &gt; Clear cache &gt; Clear Data &gt; Uninstall.
<br />
<br />After uninstalling, kindly do a reboot on your device.
<br />
<br />Once it pop-up, please install Skype using Google Play Store.
<br />
<br />After installing Skype, please do another restart before signing back in. 
<br />
<br />Check if it now works on mobile data.

<h2>            DDE error</h2>
                    We would like to mail merge using Excel to Word where Word imports the data AND formatting from Excel, not just the raw data.&nbsp; We currently are doing this using MS Excel Worksheet via DDE (*.xls).&nbsp; THIS DOES NOT WORK IN OFFICE 365, and we'd like it to.
 &nbsp; Currently, our agency is mostly Office 2010 and 2016, but some newer machines have 365.&nbsp; And our agency will be switching everyone to Office 365 sometime soon.&nbsp; In order to use this mail merge function, we've had to "roll back" the Office installations to
 2016.&nbsp; We don't need to do my mail merges using the antique DDE methodology, but we would like the formatting to come through from Excel.&nbsp; Such as commas in numbers, etc.&nbsp; Please tell me Office 365 will be rolling out an update that will allow for this. &nbsp;

            Instead of persisting with the long-since deprecated DDE approach, you should use the default ADODB connection method and apply the relevant formatting switches to the mergefields. See, for example, the applications of these switches discussed in&nbsp;the

<h2>            Powerpoint 2011 &#38; Wacom tablet issue</h2>
                    Hi;<br />
<br />
Started noticing this recently, using my wacom Intuos 4 tablet and Powerpoint 2011. Very frustrating. When I move my pen away to type or do other functions, the pages in my powerpoint document start paginating. So basically, if I'm in a powerpoint slide, and
 I attempt to type in a text box, and then move my pen away to click on something else, the slide I'm on changes and moves onto a different slide!! Very annoying. This only happens with my tablet. It' basically rendered my workflow moot at this point. Hoping
 someone has a solution for this. Appreciate the help.<br />
<br />
thanks;<br />
John<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Edge Browser Problems</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<div>
<p>I am running Windows 10 Build 10240 the final version of Windows 10 since 7/15/15.&nbsp; Everything is great with the upgrade installation through windows update&nbsp;and seems stable enough for release.&nbsp; However I have notice problems with Microsoft Edge as of today,
 7/16/15.&nbsp; I have read numerous articles that it faster it terms of speed versus Chrome Browser.&nbsp; That seems to be true.&nbsp; I have problems with Microsoft Edge stability.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had one incident where&nbsp;the page automatically keeps opening tabs on its own and so I
 would have six or seven tabs.&nbsp; I would have to close each one of the tabs.&nbsp; Then it seems like the web page I was on would be freezing since I couldn't do any type of scrolling on that website.&nbsp; I&nbsp;tried closing the webpage but no response.&nbsp; So I had to right
 click on the Microsoft edge icon on the task bar and choose close all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone notice any problems with Microsoft Edge browser.&nbsp; I am running on a desktop PC, Athlon x64 with 3GB of RAM.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Hello Ddomininc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. As you have mentioned that Microsoft edge browser is not working fine in the new build.
</span>It is unfortunate that these features are not working after updating to Build 10240.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was working fine in previous builds&nbsp;then there might be a chance that there is some system file corruption. So, I would suggest you to run
<strong>SFC scan </strong>and see if it&nbsp;brings any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System file check is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption. The sfc
<strong>/scannow</strong> command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted, changed, or damaged versions with the correct versions where possible.
<em>&lt;Moderator corrected slannow to scannow&gt;</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the SFC program twice but did not help. It so annoying.</p>
<p>I tried now to click reply but did not let me that is why I am resnding this question</p>

    <title>How do I add contact and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesmagnetude  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I add contact and</h2>
                    <p>This new update is a nightmare. I use Skype for sending projects, but now there is a limit to how big the files I can send are. I found a way around it though, and that is creating a .zip file, but still, the ease of use with Skype has really changed and
 it is more complicated than previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had to spend a day to go through and edit my contacts back to names that they were before the update, as I lost all of that information, and logged out and back in and everything went back to being their Skype names. Took 5 attempts, but have sorted
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One particular thing I can not locate now is how to add someone to my contacts. I followed a previous thread of uninstalling Skype and reinstalling it, but I still have the same issue and it is pretty frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I can do is add them to groups. I clicked on a contacts profile and scrolled down, but still, no "Add to contacts" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help.</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even on older versions, there are size limits to files you can receive and send in Skype. According to this support article:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34644/skype-file-sharing-file-types-size-and-time-limits?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype file sharing: file types, size, and time limits,</a> there is a 300 MB file size limit on shared files. If you send a file that is too large, you'll get the error
<strong>"Not sent - File is larger than 300 MB."</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you're not seeing the "<strong>Add to contacts</strong>" button when you click a profile in skype, it is most likely because that person is already part of your contacts list.&nbsp;You can not add someone to a group if you're not part of each other's contact
 list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have further questions.</p>

</p><p>Since receiving updates I suppose.&nbsp; I have had slow internet service in certain areas.&nbsp; Streaming youtube after 4 clips slows things down and Going to sites to do ancestry work online cause the computer to slowdown also.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I restart I get a good speed
 for the first 10 minutes then slows gradually.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to uninstall and re-install IE-11?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another problem.&nbsp; I have 2 types of Explorer options.&nbsp; 1st is I can use through desktop and the other I can use through ?!?! um I guess I would call the start page as soon as my computer finishes its turn on operations.&nbsp; Do I have both options constantly
 running?&nbsp; I like desktop version the best.&nbsp; Hated the Edge when I tried windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I shut down the second way to get to Explorer for windows 8.1 64bit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI I am not a big fan of being micromanaged and it seems every little thing is being recorded.&nbsp; This is the problem with monopoly companies such as google and Microsoft.&nbsp; NO OPTIONS LEFT Linux vs. apple vs. Microsoft.&nbsp; Apple sooooo expensive the cost of
 name alone is double in price.&nbsp; Linux is least invasive but doesn't work for all situations I have been told and Microsoft is in the middle of invasive but increasing as time passes.&nbsp; sorry about this rant.</p>

    <title>Find and Replace Values in All Excel Files in a Specific Directory - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Find and Replace Values in All Excel Files in a Specific Directory</h2>
                    Is there a macro that can find a value in every spreadsheet in a specific directory and replace it with another value? I am visualizing a macro that prompts me for the directory of the files, the value to look up, and the replacement value.<br />
<br />
Is this even possible? Basically, I sometimes have to replace identical values in 50+ excel files that are in the same format, and I am trying to find the fastest way to do this.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
