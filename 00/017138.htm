            Hi All,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>It is now 14/1/2014 and I have been getting this connectivity issue since November 2013. I have followed all the troubleshooting suggestions and I do not have any other computers. I only have this one, which is a laptop and I am using Google Chrome. The
 Connectivity Issue message appears when I am in my junk mail and trying to move it e.g. trying to change 'junk mail' to 'not junk mail', moving junk mail to inbox, etc. I am able to delete the junk mail without a problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I do believe you Microsoft experts are totally hopeless at fixing your own network issues. It is also very obvious that it is not a computer problem by how many of us that have this issue. I find it frustrating at the way your help does not help at all
 and your advice is always the same no matter who is writing it in the Forum.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>WHERE'S A REAL COMPUTER TECHNICIAN EXPERT WHEN YOU NEED ONE!!!!!!</div>

            I'm having exactly the same problem... unable to mark certain junk mail as safe and remove it from the junk mail folder. It removes it temporarily and returns it to the junk mail folder after a few minutes. I have also tried to add the sender's email address
 to my list of contacts, but this doesn't help. <br />
<br />
This problem started about a week ago. The junk email will be automatically deleted after 10 days, so it's getting down to the wire. How am I going to save these emails that Outlook won't allow me to check as safe?<br />
<br />
I'm using Firefox. I have also tried Explorer to no avail.<br />

 am getting it on four devices. It also fails to display messages and sometimes I have to refresh several times before I get to see my mails, either in box, sent or drafts, this has been going on for a few weeks now and is getting to be a bind. I also notice
 that I&nbsp; am&nbsp;usually&nbsp; dub 112 but now I am dub 129 sometimes , the sign in time can be slow and it can just sign me out when it likes and gives me the above message. Since the introduction of outlook from Hotmail I have had nothing but problems and there always
 seems to be some niggling problem with it or a big problem every few months , still miss the days of reliable platforms of Hotmail and messenger and hate the outlook and Skype we had forced upon us.&nbsp;

    <title>Win10 TP corrupting hard drives&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> parallaxchain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 TP corrupting hard drives&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have installed Win10 TP 9926 on my laptop twice now. Both times, I've had few issues with Win 10 as far as hardware goes. In fact, I've been quite impressed. Except for one tiny detail... The first time I installed the TP, I had it running for approximately
 2 weeks before my hard drive started reporting reallocated/pending sectors. This was on a dual-boot setup with separate Win7 and Win10 partitions with my documents stored on other partitions. I realize it may sound silly, but I actually run a single hard drive
 with a system partition and three other partitions (documents, general storage, and documents backup in case of user error). Although I am technically savvy, I'm certainly not a real pro when it comes to knowing all the ins and outs of computer technology.
 I figured that the bad hard drive was either due to coincidence-- drive just happening to fail right then while still under warranty-- or perhaps because of some quirk of the drive or a glitch in the Win10 programming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I did a search on the forums here, I did hear mention about people having issues with hard drives with power-up in standby or whatnot, but this seems to be an unrelated case. My laptop is on (and awake) 24/7 and I have never had a problem with the drive
 failing to spin up or disappearing on me. I supposed another potential problem may have been overheating, so I addressed those issues when I replaced my dead drive with a new one-- same model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of installing as a dual boot this time, I installed Win7, then upgraded over top of it. After about a week, the TP started giving me maintenance messages or whatnot saying that there were 'file system errors' and I should run chkdsk. Chkdsk never
 reported to me that it discovered any problems, but seeing how I can't afford to keep replacing hard drives, I sort of panicked and reverted back to Win7. No problems in the few days since reverting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hard drive is an HGST Travelstar (SATA III). As far as I know, the laptop is only a SATA II. I considered the possibility that maybe the cable was incompatible, but this laptop ran flawlessly with Win7 for over a year with this replacement drive, so I
 don't see the cable being the problem. And for the record, the stock drive that came with the laptop didn't die. I just upgraded to a bigger drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the hard drive specs given by Speccy, a free utility. Note that Speccy here says I'm actually running at SATA III, though I'm pretty sure it's SATA II.</p>

</p><p>Does anyone have any insight into what my problem may be? My instincts tell me that my problem must be a bug with Win10, but it seems like I'm the only person who's posting about having these same sorts of issues. First time around, I don't recall 'file
 system errors', but my hard drive definitely died and the replacement is still in the mail from Hitachi. Second time around, there were no bad sectors, but the unknown 'file system errors' are making me hesitant to keep trying the TP.</p>

<h2>            Missing functions since last update</h2>
                    Following the last automatic update and restart on my Lumia 830 windows 10 mobile, I seem to have lost the function of word suggestions and auto-correction of spelling mistakes when sending text messages or using microsoft edge. Anyone else experienced
 this problem? If so, how did you fix it?

<p>Hi Cazza,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue may be a software related given that settings are good and that the issue occurred only after the latest Windows update. To resolve this, let's perform a
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">soft reset</a></strong>. This method will not remove
 anything at all from your phone, and it is completely safe to attempt in any situation.<br />
<br />
To perform a soft reset:<br />
1. Make sure your phone is turned on.<br />
2. Press and hold the volume down and Power button until your phone vibrates and restarts.<br />
<br />
Take note that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'Slide down to power off' prompt appears).<br />
<br />
After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
We're just here if you have further questions.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Entourage receives but won&#39;t send</h2>
                    I have Entourage 2008, version 12.3.6 on my Mac using POP3 settings for comcast email. I can receive messages, but I can't send. I keep getting an error that says "an operation on the server timed out. - error: -3259." I have checked my settings and Apple
 Mail sends and receives without a problem. This is only a problem with Entourage. Is there a fix?

<h2>            LOST DOCUMENT - HELP&#33;&#58; I was tracking changes in a Word document - I&#39;ve tried to save it and it has disappeared completely</h2>
                    <p>I was tracking changes in a Word document that I had been emailed over several hours. I saved the document into a new folder with a new name. Then I immediately tried to email it from within the document ("share"), Word crashed and closed down, and it has
 deleted my document. I've lost all my work and can't find an autosaved version - it's not on the Recent Documents list, the new folder doesn't exist, and searching for the file name doesn't work. All I can find is the version I was sent with 3 other people's
 tracked changes, without any of mine.</p>

<p>At this point, looks like you should do a clean install since something got corrupted in a previous build. Download the latest Insider ISO which is 16299 but since 17025 has gone to slow ring, MS may post that ISO shortly. Make sure you backup anything that
 is important.</p>

<p>I don't think warranty has much to do with that really.<br />
Your phone is intended for another part of the world or a smaller region. Adding another language is an extra service which you usually will have to pay a tiny fee for.<br />
<br />
My sister does a lot of traveling and bought a Nokia without norwegian. She got Norwegian installed for free at a care point in Norway. A friend at my school are from pakistan and bought a phone without norwegian. He had to pay for the language, but it was
 next to nothing. - This was about 6 months later.<br />
<br />
What I suggest you do is to call your nearest care point and ask about it before going there. You can find your nearest care point here:

http://europe.nokia.com/support/repair-and-recycle/repair/care-points</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: The main rue is that you have to pay for it as it is an extra service.</p>

            <p>Yeah, for the most part I never have ann issue playing any YouTube video (although I admit it is rare when I go there to watch).&nbsp; There have been a few occasions with my 6.* devices that I had issues but I cannot remember any problems with Windows Phone.</p>
<p>As Entegy referenced, there are some partner videos that do not go over to mobile so if you cannot view, most likely that is the reason.</p>

    <title>Categories in Outlook Calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kriswilson1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Categories in Outlook Calendar</h2>
                    We are a small group, new to Outlook and would like to have a shared calendar with categories that people can update. It seems if I just create the calendar and share it, the categories don't transfer over, so I first sat down with each person and on their
 personal calendars, I created a (fake) event and with in that event I created the 8 categories I have on the shared calendar. I was careful to use the exact words and colors. It seemed to work, when I shared the calendar after setting up the categories, everything
 seemed to show up correctly. Is this the closest I can get to "sharing" categories? And what implications does this have moving forward? If everyone is given permission to edit the shared calendar, can they add categories or do I have to send an email to all
 telling them to "add XYZ category and make it Purple" ???

            I'm pretty certain it's the <em>only</em> way to share Outlook calendar categories, but I could be wrong.

    <title>Availability and Functionality of WP Apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xke68  say:</h3>
<h2>            Availability and Functionality of WP Apps</h2>
                    <p>I posed this question about 2 yrs ago and I'm about to update my phone &amp; still find the need to ask again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have owned three WP’s, WP 6, 6.5, presently 7.5, and considering going to 8.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However the phrase from companies and industry of “download our App for iPhone and Android”, I have heard more often now.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A useful answer I got from the community in 3/12 was to use IE to go to a companies' site.&nbsp; However I have found this has limitations, such as the banks have an App where one can take a photo of a check and make a deposit.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Only 2 out of the big 4 banks' mobile Apps have this photo capability for the WP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has the community experienced any other short fall of capability of a mobile App after going to that sites’ page thru IE?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also do you find this limitation in WP8 apps a shortfall or do you work around it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

<h2>            Office Home &#38; Business 2013 on Asus S400C continually crashes when opening&#47;printing etc.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the above problem. I have disabled all add-ins under the 'file', 'options' route - as advised by many forums - I have uninstalled and reinstalled a few times, also as advised by forums. I don't have Aabbyy. My printer is a Samsung SCX-3405W. I've
 also uninstalled and reinstalled it, but the same problem keeps occuring. As soon as I try and print,&nbsp;Word crashes.&nbsp;Potential issues I can see:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I have three versions of Microsoft SQL Server</p>
<p>- I have six versions of Microsoft Visual C + +</p>
<p>- Although I have a product key for Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business 2013 (purchased and downloaded online) it doesn't appear in my Microsoft Account, where it still says my trial subscription of 365 has expired and needs to be renewed. The email address
 I purchased it with is the same as my account, so I don't know why it's not showing there</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any advise for this specific issue that might be of help (I have already trawled through all of the generic response forums, which haven't come up with any solutions)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey Deepa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for this help! To answer your first questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- the printing crash occurs with all Office files, Excel, PowerPoint etc. As soon as I click print, they crash.</p>
<p>- this has been a problem ever since I purchased and installed the 2013 Office, about one month ago.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Printer problem</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I changed the default printer to Microsoft XPS Document Writer as advised, and when I tried to print to that&nbsp;new default printer the files still crashed as before. &nbsp;So as requested here is a detailed log for an Excel&nbsp;crash:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm unable to find a cancel option in my account, the only option is "set up an auto-renew subscription". I can't seem to get rid of the trial 365 version I had, or to get my current Home &amp; Business Office 2013 registered there.</p>

            <p>Hi Brad</p>
<p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need more information to assist you better:</p>
<p>Since Office Home and Business does not show under the Microsoft account when you login to ‘My account’ page, how did you install it on the computer?</p>
<p>Product key will not be provided if Office 2013/365 subscription purchased online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you visit the ‘<a href="http://www.office.com/setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://www.office.com/setup</font></a>’ and register the account? Since you the product key then I would suggest you to visit the link to register the product key with Microsoft
 account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding Office 365 Home Premium trial subscription issue, as you are not able to see the cancel subscription option, I would suggest you to wait as it would be deactivated in stipulated time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to troubleshoot the issue, try to start the computer in clean boot and try to print the Office files and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Refer to the link below to know how to start the computer in clean boot:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</font></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Note</font></span>: Ensure to restart the computer in normal mode once troubleshooting is completed.</p>
<p>Clean boot is performed to disable all startup programs and 3rd party services on the computer and check if they are conflicting with the Office program. If so, you may disable the unwanted software which conflict with the suite or get them updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above steps does not help then we need to manually remove Office 2013 and reinstall it, however if the Office 2013 does not show under the Microsoft account after trying the suggestions as mentioned in this initial response then we might have to re-associate
 it with different account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to re-associate the Office 2013 to different account I would suggest you to contact the phone support.
</p>

<p>I hope the above steps helps. Let us know if you need any helps.</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the continued support!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the product key, I purchased Office 2013 Business &amp; Home online, and the online company (IT Directdeals) emailed me the Product Key, which I input on the link that you shared with me (<a href="http://www.office.com/setup)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com/setup</a></p>).
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The clean boot worked, in the sense that I was able to print and perform other Office functions under the clean boot that I couldn't do before. So I suppose this means one of the third parties is in conflict with Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there any usual suspects here? Or could it be any of them? Do I just have to go through in trial and error to find out which one's causing the problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brad</p>

            <p>Hi again,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to identify the culprit, which in my case was Mirekusoft Install Monitor. Which I've now deleted. Thanks for guiding me through that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for registering my product, no that hasn't updated. When though I check my account from the
<a href="http://www.office.com/setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.office.com/setup</a> website,&nbsp;I'm offered Microsoft Home &amp; Business 2013 for download with a product key different from the one I was given by the company I purchased it from. Which is strange. And I don't need to download
 it again, as I already have it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But should I delete what I currently have, and accept this download in order to be officially registered?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem is certainly secondary though. The main one - Office continually crashing - has been resolved, thanks to your support!</p>

            Hi CO,
<br />I'm not sure where you are signing in at the link for outlook.com is 
<br /><a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/owa/</a> 
<br />There should be no request to use your facebook account so I am not sure what link you are using to get this sign in. 
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

<p>Thanks for the quick response. I use the ios outlook app on iphone. Have used it for about a year and like it. Today a message at the bottom of the app says&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>please sign in to you *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never appeared before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>it won’t go away. Ive rebooted etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Selecting the login requires you to sign in via Facebook, which of course is rediculous. &nbsp;Unless of course Microsoft has bowed down to Facebook. Then we can understand but it’s even worse as we cant trust Facebook at all.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi CO 
<br />I would suggest that you uninstall and reinstall the outlook application. It should not be asking for your facebook password. First I would also go into privacy setting in Facebook and at the bottom Edit and Say no to Do you want search engines outside of Facebook to link to your profile. 
<br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy</a> 
<br />I would do the above from your computer as I'm not sure if mobile setting have this option. 
<br />Then uninstall outlook restart your iphone and then re-add your outlook application. 
<br />It's not Microsoft that is causing this so I'm thinking facebook. I think doing the above may solve the problem. 
<br />Let me know if not we'll have to investigate further into the matter. 
<br />I wish they would all just play nice together. 
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

            <p>Hi santa kelly,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Let me assist you with your emails on your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you missing emails on your account? If so, I recommend that you perform auto recovery to try to recover the missing emails. You can click on this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/how-recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> for steps on how to perform auto recovery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If auto recovery does not work, get back to us with the following information so we can investigate on the issue further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><font>·</font><span> What is your i</span></span></span><span>mpacted account?</span></p>
<p><span><span><font>·</font><span> </span></span></span><span>When was the account switched to Outlook.com?</span></p>
<p><span><span><font>·</font><span> </span></span></span><span>Did the data loss occur right after Outlook.com upgrade or was the data still there for a brief time?</span></p>
<p><span><span><font>·</font><span> </span></span></span><span>Did you have issues logging in before noticing data loss – did you have to reset your password?</span></p>
<p><span><span><font>·</font><span> </span></span></span><span>Did you click on any link before the issue occurred?</span></p>
<p><span><span><font>·</font><span> </span></span></span><span>Did you try to deactivate/close the account before the issue occurred?</span></p>
<p><span><span><font>·</font><span> </span></span></span><span>When was the last time you logged into your account?</span></p>
<p><span><span><font>·</font><span> </span></span></span><span>Description of the data lost (all messages before a date<font><span>,<span>
</span>date</span> ranges, estimated number etc.)</font></span></p>
<p><span><span><font>·</font><span> </span></span></span><span>Do you have folders? Are they nested? Is the mail missing from the inbox or a folder?</span></p>
<p><span><span><font>·</font><span> </span></span></span><span>Are you<font><span>
</span>seeing the missing mails on a mobile device or the web UI, or a mail client program?</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font>You can provide the affected email address on the private message.

            <p>It is for Nokia handsets only (since it is developed by Nokia). HTC, Samsung and all other manufacturers can add this functionality too but they are far from as active as Nokia unfortunately.</p>

<h3> ch12152012  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can I only access the internet using internet explorer 64-bit.  &#40;IE 9&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Some months ago I suddenly could no longer use "regular" internet explorer on my HP&nbsp;laptop&nbsp;to access the internet.&nbsp; Whether I am using wi-fi or directly connected to my internet connection, I still can only use internet explorer 64-bit to get on-line.&nbsp; I
 also can't access my e-mail anymore using Microsoft Outlook on my laptop.&nbsp; I can access my e-mail by wi-fi on my iphone but not my laptop, so it doesn't seem to be an internet connection issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas how I can fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks very much,</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia Icon email sync</h2>
                    <p>I just got the Lumia Icon, still running 8.0 until Verizon pushes 8.1 to the Icon hopefully in early January.&nbsp; I have two email accounts, one an exchange to an Outlook 365 account for work, and one to outlook.com, an exchange active sync account.&nbsp; both are
 set to get items as they arrive.&nbsp; Several times a day I find it does not sync the email.&nbsp; I will open up the email apps, it says "last synced an hour ago" or something like that, I tap the sync command, and then I get emails.&nbsp; Why won't it sync them as they
 arrive?&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Enabling use of unsigned drivers. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Enabling use of unsigned drivers.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I will find the answer to this eventually but, does anybody know if Windows 10 will enable the loading of an unsigned driver. The reason is that I have an Epson Perfection scanner that I use to scan 35mm slides.&nbsp; This scanner has not been supported
 by Epson since Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to track down instructions on modifying the .inf file to make the scanner believe it was a later model and compatible&nbsp; with Windows 7. Finally I had to configure Windows 8.1 to enable the use of unsigned drivers (which then caused the warning
 about using untrusted drivers). The scanner works perfectly in this mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know if this will be the case under Win 10? I will not be able to find out until sometime down the track as this laptop that I am using for testing has physically faulty USB ports, and I wont be risking my main machine for a while yet.</p>

            <p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, 64-bit versions of Windows&nbsp;Vista and later versions of Windows will load a kernel-mode driver only if the kernel can verify the driver signature.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer to the suggestion provided by ATM on October 4, 2014 where he was able to install an unsigned driver:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_tp-tms/touchpad-scroll-and-2-finger-tap-for-right-click/e84d84ff-f56d-43ef-80db-a7d801266cf0">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_tp-tms/touchpad-scroll-and-2-finger-tap-for-right-click/e84d84ff-f56d-43ef-80db-a7d801266cf0</a></p>
<p>Note: It is advised not to install unsigned drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would instead suggest you to install the scanner driver in compatibility mode.</p>
<p><span>To install the driver in Compatibility Mode, follow these steps:&nbsp;<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Download the graphic card driver from manufacturer's website.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Locate the&nbsp;<strong><span><span>executable</span></span></strong>&nbsp;file (.exe file) for the driver installation program.<br />
b. Right-click the file, and then click&nbsp;<strong><span>Properties</span></strong>.<br />
c. In the&nbsp;<strong><span>Package Name</span></strong>&nbsp;<span><strong><span>Properties</span></strong>&nbsp;dialog box, click the&nbsp;<strong><span>Compatibility</span></strong></span>&nbsp;tab.<br />
d. Click to select the&nbsp;<span><strong><span>Run this program in compatibility mode for</span></strong>&nbsp;check box, click&nbsp;<strong>Windows
</strong><strong><span>Vista&nbsp;</span></strong>with which it is compatible with in the Run this program in compatibility mode for list, and then click&nbsp;<strong><span>OK</span></strong></span>.<br />
e.&nbsp;<strong><span><span>Double-click</span></span></strong>&nbsp;the executable file to start the installation program.<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. If you have more queries, we will be happy to help.</p>

            I the latest Epson driver was for Win7, but it would not be recognised by 8,1 until I did the minor edit on .inf4 which of course broke the security. By using a tip from another source and enabling loading of unsigned drivers I got the expected warning.
 The driver installed OK and I have full functionality including transparency. I am just hoping Win10 will do the same. Thanks.

            <p>I would hope the ability to use unsigned drivers exists in 10 as in previous versions. It has been removed from the usual System properties page. If there is a work-around I'd like to know it as I'll need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider this a rant to vote in favour of unsigned drivers option.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"Note: It is advised not to install unsigned drivers.</strong>"</p>
<p>That's fine, if you are willing to write new signed ones for other manufacturers hardware that needs it. There are many examples of unsigned drivers being the only way to get some hardware to work in more modern versions of Windows. I had a tvtuner designed
 for Win2000 that I had to use unsigned drivers for several of it's devices in order to get it working in XP. Once I worked out how to get it running I used it for many years that way. It would have been $150 of junk if XP hadn't let me use the new drivers.
 The card still works 15 or so years on and is only retired as pci itself is retired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This <strong>will </strong>be an important issue for upgrading users. Particularly those with old business hardware such as scanners that they don't want to replace because they are not broken. They will more likely not upgrade windows than replace working
 equipment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can name webcams and multifunction printers and scanners just off the top of my head of gear I personally have here at home that requires an unsigned driver to work in 7.</p>

            <p>EH ??</p>
<p>No issues with unsigned drivers - the MS tech is dreaming, </p>
<p>
</p><p>boot into recovery, troubleshoot, advanced options, startup options, hit reboot, then when the options screen comes up - chose 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>No worries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have issues, then (with signed drivers disabled as above) in driver update - choose select device - I have disk - point to your drivers - Roberts your aunties brother.</p>
<p>
</p><p>;)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will warn you though, win 10 is not stable - the registry is subject to insidious corruption. I would advise that you stick with your current system and give 10 a miss until MS redesigns it or releases a new version.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 32-bit to Windows 10 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>Related to: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/frequently-asked-questions-windows-10/5c0b9368-a9e8-4238-b1e4-45f4b7ed2fb9">
Frequently Asked Questions: Windows 10</a></p>
<p>I'm currently running Windows 7 32-bit on my hp laptop. The laptop hardware is capable of running both 32-bit and 64-bit software. I would like to test Windows 10 64-bit technical preview as I have more than 4GB of ram. I was able to create an install media
 on a USB stick with the Windows 10 64-bit ISO, but when it boots and tries to install Windows 10 it says it needs drivers.
</p>
<p>Question 1: Is this Microsoft's way of saying that Windows 10 64-bit can't be installed because my laptop is currently running Windows 7 32-bit?</p>
<p>Question 2: Will the future free upgrade to Windows 10 force me to Windows 10 32-bit as well?</p>

            <p>Thanks to All for your inputs. (This Q&amp;A tool could use a Reply All selection).</p>
<p>As I suspected the problem with the USB 64-bit Windows 10 install stick was creating it on a 32-bit Windows 7 OS. I was able to successfully create it on a buddy's 64-bit Windows OS and boot it on my laptop. I have a new problem for which I will open a new
 thread if I can't find a solution bu searching this site.</p>
