<h2>            The cursor jumps erratically when word processing</h2>
                    <p>The cursor jumps erratically when word processing in Word or Mail and odd operations are performed.
</p>
<p>This seems to be without rhyme or reason. Please what is going on? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Medion laptop with Windows 7 and Office 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, as I typed this question the cursor jumped backwards &amp; then downwards. As a touch typist it is driving me crazy. Somewtimes I find paragraphs and text have been deleted as I have typed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Help please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further to the above. I am using a wireless mouse (Logitech) which worked fine until a few weeks ago. I have also tapped into the keyboard without touching the Finger Pad - and it is still erratic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't get the settings to allow me to disable the thing.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Does this happen while opening Office 2010?</p>
<p><br />
I would suggest that you check if the mouse settings are correct.<br />
<br />
1. Open <strong>Mouse</strong> by clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button, clicking
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>Hardware</strong>, and then clicking
<strong>Mouse</strong>. <br />
2. Click the <strong>Pointer Options</strong> tab, and then do any of the following:<br />
<br />
‚Ä¢ <strong>To change the speed at which the mouse pointer moves</strong>, move the Select a pointer speed slider towards Slow or Fast.<br />
‚Ä¢ <strong>To make the pointer work more accurately</strong> when you're moving the mouse slowly, select the Enhance pointer precision check box.<br />
‚Ä¢ <strong>To speed the process of selecting</strong> a choice when a dialog box appears, select the Automatically move pointer to the default button in a dialog box check box .<br />
‚Ä¢ <strong>To make the pointer easier to find when you move it</strong>, select the Display pointer trails check box, and then move the slider towards Short or Long to decrease or increase the length of the pointer trail.<br />
‚Ä¢ <strong>To ensure that the pointer doesn't block your view</strong> of the text you're typing, select the Hide pointer while typing check box.<br />
‚Ä¢ <strong>To find a misplaced pointer by pressing the CTRL key</strong>, select the Show location of pointer when I press the CTRL key check box.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Change mouse settings</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Change-mouse-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Change-mouse-settings</a><br />
<br />
<br />
If the above step fails then refer the below Microsoft kb article and try the steps mentioned.<br />
<strong>Troubleshoot a wireless mouse that does not function correctly</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/321122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/321122</a><br />
<br />
If the above steps fail then I would suggest that you visit the mouse manufacturer website download and install the latest update for the mouse.<br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps!<br />

<h2>            Why i can&#39;t use RDP to login to server after it left Active Directory&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I got this problem while trying to re-deploying a new Remote Desktop Service role for my Windows Server on new domain AD. (AWS environment). Let's take a look at the steps i did</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Login to server using RDP and credentials of old domain (call it domain A.com)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- in Computer Name/Domain Changes: changed member of Workgroup, restart. Then changed into member of new domain (call it B.com)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- At this moment, i couldn't login to server with RDP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I know this might happen, so i installed tightVNC to get access to console. From this tool, i took a look at Remote Desktop Services -&gt; Overview and got the same error as this topic<br />
https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1790030-remove-an-old-rds-from-server-pool-2012-r2<br />
It said: The following server in this deployment are not part of server pool<br />
EC2-XXXX.A.COM</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I followed this, first i deleted RDS-Connection-Broker roles then restart. And i could login using RDP again.<br />
- But right after adding it again, i couldn't.<br />
Anyone can shed a light on this please?<br />
I need to install RDS Connection broker because without it, i couldn't deploy RemoteApp.</p>

            <p>I have an ACER M5 laptop with the same problem.&nbsp; I did some digging and found a possible fix, at least it fix the problem with my ACER.&nbsp; The most common work around is manually pressing the power button everytime, but this kinda defeats the purpose of shut
 down and may cause unnecessary strain on laptop batteries if the mains is not connected.&nbsp; The other fix that worked for me is under power management: minimum processor state in power management needs to be set to 100.&nbsp; This is a similar problem with Win 8
 (and I think I remember having the issue there as well).&nbsp; Quickest way to change the setting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 search, search Power Option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the selected plan (mine was Balanced), select Change Plan Settings then select Change Advanced Power Settings in the next dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Power Options pop-up opens, scroll down and expand the Processor Power Management option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expand the Minimum processor state and change both battery and plugged in state to 100%.&nbsp; Press OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to do this for each power plan that you use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I understand from reading, Windows and Intel might have a conflict to who actually controls the processor for power management.&nbsp; If you set it to 100, this forces the CPU to keep control and removes this conflict.&nbsp; I might be wrong, but I researched
 more on how to fix and not so much the cause.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            So I have had this issue with my Dell Latitude E5520. Tried all the suggestions but nothing worked. Finally wiped machine and fresh installed Win 7 Pro w/ SP1, installed WIFI driver and activated. Then upgraded directly to Win 10 Pro with usb created with
 the media creator downloadable from Microsoft. Now works. I figure it was either and app conflict or driver. I have seen some people able to fix by going though each driver in the Device Manager and click check for update. I really didn't want to have to wipe
 my machine but at least now I have a pretty clean load that finally works and I can now shutdown and restart with out it getting stuck in permanent limbo.

            I tried that, but it did not help.&nbsp; I have an older Dell with bits and pieces of newer hardware/software. My only recourse was to revert back to Windows 7.<br />

            I went back to Windows 7 as well.&nbsp; I have an older Dell with components from different companies for other hardware/software.&nbsp; I also had other problems with Windows 10 such as no sound, could not play Xbox games and Skype did not work. Guess my computer
 motherboard is too old and/or CPU is too old.&nbsp; I was on with Windows Tech support via chat for over an hour and a half on early Sunday morning (midnight to 1:30am) and they could not help me with either shutdown or with sound problems. Tech took over my computer
 and after doing several things in DOS window, declared I needed Tier 2 support help.&nbsp; They were supposed to call me Sunday around 9am but never called me back.&nbsp; Not sure what needs to be changed out to allow Windows 10 to run without any glitches.<br />

            <p>my best guess advise to someone in the same boat is </p>
<p>1. disable "File History" </p>
<p>2. disable " turn on fast restart"&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. disable show hibernation in power menu"</p>
<p>then reset the boot order in Bios to the default order. Once that has reset put the drive with the window install at the top</p>
<p>
</p><p>if these don't work for you try and disable "scheduled send and receive" in outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have try a number of time changing settings, with short term results each time.&nbsp; Never a permanent result&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the few times it manages a soft shutdown; &nbsp;there is a strange double-take: &nbsp;the screen goes dark, then it returns to the colour background and spinning dots and text " shutting down"... before it powers off completely</p>

            <p>I'm going to be replying this to every thread I'm following just to see if anyone has noticed this little part to the main issue. After all of these solutions I've been doing, I've noticed that they seem to work temporarily after restarting or shutting down
 (hard reset way) and starting up my device again. Just now I did a little test to see if it would happen again if I do no solutions and just hard reset the device, and it seems to be successful.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did was basically this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Shutdown or restart your device right on the spot (may need to hard reset).
</p>
<p>2) Turn it back on</p>
<p>3) Login to your device</p>
<p>4) Let it boot up and get everything ready</p>
<p>5) After booting, immediately test out the sleep mode by tapping on the power button or closing the lid, or test out shutting down your device</p>
<p>After doing this, it seems that the device will do those modes perfectly. If this is the case, then what could be stopping the device from working flawlessly after a couple hours of use? Some weird process? A driver that needs to be updated? Something in
 the power settings? Man, this issue is so weird.<br />

<p>It sounds like (from what little i could read) that you arent old enough to know much about the evolution of gaming and what was. Gamers today are spoiled with options, customization and free play. It used to be about the experience the story the game offered.--Now
 its about what freedoms the player can choose from. Freedom in games is great, but the problem is the same 90% bulk of the douchy gamers. They all play the same thing and buy the same kind of games... then whine because there is little difference between them.
 Don't get me wrong, today's games are giant leaps and bound forward from the classics (even from last gen games), but most of my personal gripes with today's games are the gimmicks the developers aim toward the casual gamer and the tryhard gamer.</p>

<p>Hey Roper</p>
<p>Me again. listen i'm begging you please tell the guys to lower the minimum number of players it takes to start a game. ive been trying to play all day but i can only get in a suppression. I'M SICK OF SUPPRESSION. i want to play medley but can't cause there's
 never enough guys. like today, went to a medley and 18 yes 18 playes showed, three fn minutes go by everyone's waiting for 2 guys to show 2 GUYS! nothing. after the three minutes everone left. hell in fact i'm writing this while waiting for a FN MEDLEY now.
 i know there is a patch but we don't get any info on it, so please PLEASE change the minimum to start a game. I WANT MY "TACTICAL SHOOTER" &nbsp;GAME BACK! not some cod rip off. ........................wait its starting. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;( 2h 37m later) just got
 done playing my medley and it was amazing. the Zip and i played with and against each other and had a blast. got a recruit too. anyway my point being,we as gamers shouldn't have to wait so long for a game. i love my socom and always will but HURRY UP on the
 dam patch. those smg's are ridiculous.</p>

<p>also one of the large voices in the socom community had somthing to say Just an FYI, I think the new SONY mods are really trying to understand our community. As a favor, I would ask some of you that are still active on SOCOM.com to give them a chance if
 you care. I don't think they are part of "the conspiracy" lol, and are really trying to help. Here's a little convo I had earlier today...<br />

Interesting post Luk, and while I can't speak for the gameplay and development I can say from my team's point of view we are trying to keep discussion lively but constructive whenever possible.
<br />
<br />
We feel that the essence of a forum is the ability to share experiences both good and bad with others who share the same passion/interest as yourself. Additionally with that in order to keep that open atmosphere the sharing has to be kept at a level that no
 one feels as through they are being attacked personally for their views/beliefs.<br />
<br />
We would like to see this core idea/belief to be understood by more people on the forums and realize it can be a bit of a learning process especially when you have a group of individuals who feel disenfranchised.<br />
<br />
As to specific forum bugs, I have another meeting with the engineers early next week but last I heard they were quite close to fixing the specific bugs which have been effecting the MAG &amp; SOCOM forums since integration, though I'll know more next week.<br />
<br />
Lastly, while thinking over what you said it did spark a question for me in my mind, and I'd encourage anyone interested to take a look at my question here:
<a href="http://community.us.playstation.com/thread/3889863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://community.us.playstation.com/thread/3889863</a>

First off, thanks for reading. This community is not easy to assess, and I have the feeling that some of the SONY mods are a bit intrigued by this forum. I have also seen a deeper willingness to "reach out" in recent weeks which I view as a good sign from your
 staff. We aren't ones for warm welcomes because we have seen many a mods/"gaming reps" come and go throughout the years, so forgive us for taking so long to open up.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I would love to answer your question and give you a dynamite response in your thread. But the thing is, I'm inclined to link incredible threads that have already been written for examples throughout the years. Ironically enough, that is a very difficult
 process with the state of the forums right now. Our fanbase's history is pretty much unaccessible at the moment. We have typed everything there is to know about SOCOM. Which features work, which ones don't, and our opinions on everything from game modes &amp;
 maps, all the way to finer details by the truck load that you could read everyday for the next 2 years and not cover it all. (and we've done this for each and every SOCOM that has been released) It's getting to the point, where the SOCOM forums are not worth
 investing that kind of time again and again. I for one would rather make podcasts, videos, and host my own articles, because I know they aren't going anywhere and can be referenced years from now if needed.<br />
<br />
And any entity that is careless with hundreds of thousands of hours worth of heart felt investments on these boards is one cold cat. Seeing this forum in the last 3 months was like watching half a library with rare and one of a kind books burn to the ground.
 People have poured their heart and soul on these boards. Our community built the ultimate database for ANY developer and publisher to read regarding the demise of this franchise and how to save it. And we offered a lot more than just criticism as well. This
 was our ecosystem outside of the in-game interactions. A digital coral reef if you will, that is dying away as we speak...<br />
<br />
And at this point, we have been absolutely disarmed in that regard. It's definitely a slap in the face if you ask me. It's no surprise that conspiracy theoriests out there feel like that was done on purpose, in some kind of attempt to give us all a dose of
 "e-riddlin" to calm the masses. Time and time again, this franchise continues to change and revamp itself, all the while the fanbase cries for simplicity.<br />
<br />
We have watched this series become riddled with crappy launches, incomplete retail versions that require months of patching, subpar marketing &amp; advertising, inabilities to thwart hacking, and a bigger list I could rant on for another 3 paragraphs. Our franchise
 has alienated us, and now our communication channels to address it have been hindered as well. Whether this has all been intentional or not, this community is finally losing the will to carry on. I don't forsee the forum empire being rebuilt if our old threads
 are truly gone for good, or remain unaccessible. What's the point?<br />
This is a big problem if a company out there doesn't want to see this happen. It's not our doing as a fanbase, therefore, we can't really fix it. But we sure try the best we can anyways...<br />
<br />
At this stage in the game, what the new mods are witnessing are EXTREME gaming fanatics having their addiction ripped from their hands. And there doesn't seem to be any clear reasons why this should take place from our standpoint. From a community aspect, it's
 counter productive. More longtime fans are leaving, than "new fans" are joining. From a business standpoint, the sales speak for themselves do they not? Almost a decade of loyalty, thousands of $$$'s spent by each of us, the greatest online network of clans
 gaming has ever seen, has now transformed much like the game. We were once some of the most "mega hardcore" gamers found on any console, and now we have "revamped" into one ****** off mob.<br />
Do you blame us?<br />
<br />
I will add I have been a fan for a LONG time. I've read probably over half a million posts on these boards. I have been to Zipper's studios and visited with a lot of the devs. I have written countless articles, recorded podcasts, made videos, built websites,
 and have even volunteered for a contract for the same publisher that I blame for a lot of my frustrations. And I can tell you, that coupled with the history of SOCOM paints a pretty clear picture from my stand point.<br />
<br />
Alot of "small people" really care about this franchise. And no matter what we do, there is a handful of decision makers somewhere out there that could care less.<br />
<br />
The problem is beyond me, beyond you, beyond this community, and beyond half of Zipper. And our fanbase may have never fully understood all this if we hadn't dug so deep.<br />
<br />
What I have typed up above resonates with a large core of the SOCOM community. There is a lighter side that views all this as just a game, and doesn't take all this that serious. But those people also haven't devoted almost a decade of their life defining what
 SOCOM is. I may sound arrogant saying this, but this Community defines what SOCOM is. Not the dev, not the publisher, and not even the disc itself. The gamers who buy SOCOM, build the online communtities, keep the franchise alive, and create the opportunity
 for a business to make money define it. And the day someone tried to remove that control from our hands, was the day they quit making so much money. Plain &amp; simple.<br />
<br />
There's only two solutions to our community's problem. Bring back the original formula, or let SOCOM die for good and give us all closure. If we had a great SOCOM, it wouldn't matter what kind of forums we had. TRUST ME.<br />
But in the meantime, the following is pretty much what you can expect on these boards...<br />
People seeking some kind of closure, posters in denial, snipers trolling for laughs, or confused fans being creatures of habit because some of us have been here so long, we don't know how to stop logging in. It's hard to just stop talking to people online you've
 been friends with for years and years...<br />
But maybe, just maybe, we'll find a way to persevere and find hope again... we'll just have to see what the future brings us.<br />
<br />
This is pretty much the situation you've walked into as our new mods. Best of luck. I'll help when I have time.<br />

            <p>That option won't cause any harm. &nbsp;It simply helps make sure that the drive is ready to be unplugged safely (with most modern/USB drives you don't even necessarily have to do this, but it's not a bad habit).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make the drive show up again, simply plug it back in (or unplug it and re-plug it in). &nbsp;Or if you can't reach the cord, just restart the computer and all connected drives will be available again.</p>

            Hi Davit.    I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) See fixes here for 100% disk usage:
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-100-disk-usage-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-100-disk-usag...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-100-percent-disk-usage-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-100-pe...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Sound Interruption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glassgirl866  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound Interruption</h2>
                    I've had my laptop (Acer-AMD Dual-Core Processor C-50)&nbsp;- Windows 7 for over a year and only recently it has problems with the sound.&nbsp; It sounds like there is a loose wire (a buzzing sound every few minutes)&nbsp;but there isn't, it isn't the speakers (I have
 checked all wires) or connection to the computer.&nbsp; It is the computer itself.&nbsp; When I Skype sometimes it screeches until I hold down the on/off button and&nbsp;force a shutdown.&nbsp; It has done this several times.&nbsp; When listening to streaming music or music directly
 from the computer it has intermittent interuptions in sound and makes a buzzing sound&nbsp;for just a second or two.&nbsp;&nbsp;What could this be?&nbsp; &nbsp;Need help.

            Hi
<div>Thanks for&nbsp;contacting&nbsp;Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are using external speakers, make sure your cell phone is away from the speakers. The electromagnetic waves can cause disturbance in speakers. This is usually found in external speakers and not in internal speakers because of the insulation provided
 in internal speakers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the issue is not solved or the reply is not related to your query, kindly reply here.</div>

            No cell phone is nearby, only TV turned off and no other electronics running.&nbsp; This sound is coming from the computer not the speakers but thanks for the info anyway, never heard of the cell phone thing.

<h2>            Game clip trim feature not working</h2>
                    Tried to use the trim feature accessed by clicking the guide button, going to recent captures and selecting the clip to trim. I set my in and out points, press X to save and am brought to the "Trimming your video, please wait. Don't leave this screen"
 message.&nbsp; The progress bar pretty much instantly goes to 60%, but stalls there for a few minutes before closing, saying I'll need to trim. Tried several times but no successes. Any ideas?&nbsp;

<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A suggestion here, attempt to follow our <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/troubleshooting/recording-problems-with-gamedvr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Recording problems with Game DVR</a></strong> article as it is universal to assisting
 with issues regarding any/all captures on the Xbox One console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give these steps a shot, as a last resort though attempt a <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reset your console to factory defaults on Xbox One</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When choosing to do this option, remember to select:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Reset and keep my games &amp; apps</span></strong><span>. You should use this option as your primary choice when troubleshooting. It will reset the OS and delete all potentially corrupted data without deleting your
 games or apps. This will save you from downloading or reinstalling the large game files. In some cases, if a corrupt game file is causing the issue you're troubleshooting, you may have to choose
</span><strong>Reset and remove everything</strong><span>, but you should always start with
</span><strong>Reset and keep my games &amp; apps</strong><span> and save </span>

            Trim has only worked once out of 50 times. What is wrong over at Microsoft? Because this console is falling apart. Are they about to shut down the Xbox division? They add features but they don't work and they never fix anything. The Dashboard is laggy,
 the background round color changes to green by itself, and just poor performance all around.&nbsp;

            Also they are getting rid of all Xbox forums, rewards, and turning into Microsoft everything. It's as if they are setting it up for Xbox to be killed off. The is just TERRIBLE.

<p>Hello !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having the same problem for months : the trimming option doesn't work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time, i'm allowed to trim one video. If i try trimming one more, the process freezes. If i do a hard reboot, i can trim again, but still only one video. It's as if the program could not clear the data by itself once it finishes one process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, i did reset my console to factory defaults. No, it does not make the trimming work any better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has been around for months now. None of the 30 or so friends i've told about it has ever been able to make the trimming option work properly. None of us is mad about that ridiculous situation where the "most powerful console" can't even do what
 my old cellphone from 2015 can in a heartbeat. But if the xbox dev team could fix this, we all would be glad. I'm sure some engineers have looked at the problem and did the best they can... whoever fires them deserves a rise.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 &#58; Cannot use DSIM &#47;Online &#47;Cleanup-image &#47;RestoreHealth and cannot install new processor updates</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since almost one year (ever since I got my computer) I've been unable to install windows processor updates (http://i.imgur.com/eVWadSY.png, http://i.imgur.com/B3OdfKX.png).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found on the windows help a command that would repair Windows Update : dsim /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth (the option to check corruption showed me corruption : http://pastebin.com/4BKG1TQx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DSIM said it's fixable, so I tried the /restorehealth command. Which failed. http://pastebin.com/vqjB7vTr</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found another person that had the same problem as me, his problem got fixed by running http://pastebin.com/f0UYnaK3 as admin, which didn't work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm stuck here, without a possibility to install updates, and with very low chances to get this problem solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>(ps: Pardon my bad english, I'm French)</p>

            <p>Wow, nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't even know if Microsoft guys realize that if you ask a question on Debian forums, or BSD, you get an answer in less than twelve hours and your problem gets solved as fast as you can solve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So sad I paid 100$ to get an OS that can barely get updated, and the "dedicated microsoft support :)" written on the stupid "Features list" isn't even available. Where, on a free (free as in freedom) it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That really show the mentality of MC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to Debian... At least, it's working fine.</p>

                    <p>I've got the 512 / i7 / 16GB Surface Book. My main concern is the temperature it runs at.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Intel Extreme Tuning to monitor the temps (not change any settings), I can see a package temp and core temp of 85- 90C with power limit throttling running once I start to do anything remotely taxing for the CPU (30 - 50% CPU utilization, not GPU intensive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can hear the fan is working hard, but can't feel any air moving out of the side of the machine. i'm worried I may have a bad fan.<br />
</p>
<p>Can other Surface Book users feel the air being expelled by the fan?<br />

                    <p>I recently had windows 10 upgrade on my computer. &nbsp;I was having issues with it shutting down and restarting. &nbsp;Telling me I have security kernel errors and missing files. So I perform update scan. It finds updates then fails to update halfway through. Restarts
 two more times. I formatted and attempted to install my Windows 8.0 retail version it gets to 59-62% then gives me error 0x80070570. &nbsp;After reading peoples other concerns about Win10 causing same install error code due to bad iso, Does anyone know where I
 go to get a downloadable copy of retail version Windows 8 to install on my computer that I can use my factory Code?? I do not want to buy another full retail copy just to get it installed again. Any help would be useful as I have attempted to use the quick
 link Microsoft provided for a NON-RETAIL version of windows 8.0 to no avail.&nbsp;</p>

                    Hello community,<br />
<br />
I am currently running Win 7 Ultimate 64-bit- I bought a Win 7 Ultimate 32-bit and then bought an upgrade DVD to 64-bit through my school. Since my computer was getting slow, I upgraded the processor, mother board, RAM and added a Toshiba 128 GB SSD. I have
 320 GB HDD partitioned into OS and data. Using NTI Echo cloning software, I cloned the OS partition to the SSD and let it do its thing. The computer booted up from the SSD and made my HDD offline. I then made my only mistake (big one as it turns out) and made
 the HDD online as I wanted access to my data (in hindsight, I should have formatted the entire drive at that point). I tried booting back, but get the dreaded "missing operating system" after the bios boot screen. NTI Echo tech support said that the cloning
 software does not touch the source disk and I could have a corrupt MBR that prevents win from booting. Here is what I have done since.<br />
<br />
1. Disconnected the HDD and tried to boot from the SSD- does not work- get the same "missing operating system" error.
<br />
2. Booted with the SSD and the Windows 7 32 bit DVD- does not recognize the SSD as the one with the OS. I have not used command prompt from the repair/install screen to erase and reformat the SSD yet<br />
2. Disconnected the SSD and tried to boot from the HDD- does not work- get the same "missing operating system" error.<br />
3. Booted with the windows 7 64-bit upgrade DVD- nothing happens- this is the strangest part<br />
4. Booted with the windows 7 32 bit DVD- got into the windows install/repair screen and wanted to repair but was told that it was the wrong version- which i can understand because it is 32-bit vs 64 bit<br />
5. Booted with a repair disc made from my lenovo win 7 pro 64-bit laptop- get into system repair- after a while i get "could not repair system". I got into advanced settings, got into command prompt and did the MBR clean up commands
<br />
<br />
<span>bootrec /fixMBR </span>
<span>bootrec /fixMBR </span>
<p><span>bootrec /fixBoot </span></p>
<p><span>bootrec /rebuildBCD <br />
</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>I get the operation completed successfully after each command, when I try to reboot from the HDD, the splash screen starts, freezes and I get the "windows could not start properly- start with system repair disc" screen.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Do i need a full Windows 7 ultimate 64-bit installation disc to repair or have I corrupted the installation beyond repair?</span></p>
<p><span>I will be happy to get the HDD back and will deal with the SSD later.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Thanks in advance!<br />

            The BIOS recognizes the hard drive and lists it. I made an ISO image file of Win 7 ultimate 64-bit and used it to try a system repair.<br />
I was able to get into the install windows screen and start the system repair. After scanning for a while I get the "Windows could not repair your problem" message and the list of the tasks completed. The listed error was this<br />

After doing a bootrec.exe to clean the MBR and also a sys scan which confirmed the integrity of my hard drives, nothing helped.<br />

I have decided to unlpug the hdd and install windows 7 fresh on the ssd after formatting it. Its a shame that I will have to reinstall all my drivers and programs onto the SSD. I still need to figure out how to format my old hdd as I will be using that for

    <title>Stunt Plane time trials problem..&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Stunt Plane time trials problem..&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;I have just now gotten around to getting 100% on the SP, I only have a few things left to do now, one being the Stunt Plane Time trials. I have heard that I do not have to do them to get the 100%, but when I go to Rockstar Social club and check out my checklist
 it says I have done 57 of 59, one being stunt planes and the other being the last race. It doesn't say compete 58 of 59 for 100% like it does for Random Events. The main issue I am having is I have completed the Stunt Plane Time Trials, I didn't get gold on
 everything but I did pass them all, for some reason it is not registering as completed...</p>

<p>&nbsp; Any suggestions, ideas or comments?</p>

<p>You don't need to do the stuntplane challenge to get 100%</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>On the Social Club Checklist page, the only missions you need to do to get 100% are the ones with the colored bar on the left side. For example, you&nbsp;don't need to complete the arms trafficking missions or the bail bond missions to get 100%.&nbsp;For Hobbies &amp;
 Pastimes, you only need to complete 42 of the 59 to qualify for the 100%.</p>

<p>Yeah, I knew you didn't HAVE to do the stunt plane trials... Just bugged me that I did them and wasn't getting credit for it on Social Club. It finally unlocked though, guess it was slow with updating.

<p>The helicopter trials were easy, I tend to spend most of my flying time in the choppers, planes not so much..</p>

<p>I tried a few of the stunt plane trials, didn't enjoy them much and never finished them. I much prefer the choppers as well.</p>

<p>Just wanted to update you wonderful people at xbox live: aformentioned SunshineSumo59 is now typing heinous homophobic and anti-semitic slurs at me in the match lobby. That's right! Not only is he preventing my whole group of friends from having fun on Xbox

<p>If that is okay with you guys, then by all means don't ban him. If you guys think this is unjust, GIVE HIM THE BOOT! NOW!</p>

<h2>            &#34;File name too long&#34;  unable to rename or delete the file</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
<p>Environment is Win 8.1 w/ all updates applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a photo that came to us with a very long file name (must be over 260 chars).&nbsp; Can‚Äôt delete it by right clicking on it ‚Äì says file name is too long.&nbsp; Can‚Äôt rename it.&nbsp; Can‚Äôt open it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can‚Äôt delete it from the command line either ‚Äì file name is too long. &nbsp;{This is not a case of the path name being too long; the problem is that the file name is too long. &nbsp;By going to the directory in which the file resides via command line and using delete
 at that point, pathname isn't an issue.}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried short name of first 6 chars of the file name followed by ~1.ext as in</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verylongfilename.tif&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verylo~1.tif</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Command line shell says it can‚Äôt find the file using the short name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Googling for help got me the hint how to to get short file names (just to verify the 6 chars~1.ext formula)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;‚ÄúThe "/x" switch on 'dir' will give you the short name of files and folders.<span>‚Äú</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This works fine on our Win 7 system but on the Win 8.1 system, where the file with the long name resides, it doesn‚Äôt work. &nbsp;It doesn‚Äôt yield short names for file names
 that aren‚Äôt over-long, let alone the problem file name.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What has changed in the command line shell for Win 8.1?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Any suggestions for how I might deal with this file with the file name that's too long?</span></p>

<h2>            Visual Studio 2015, Diagnostic tools, Memory Usage&#58; What is &#91;Self&#93; &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Visual Studio's Diagnostic tools, Memory Usage, I attach to&nbsp;my running process (a service, Native C++)&nbsp;and&nbsp;take a snapshot. Looking at it I see in the Heap tree an item called [Self] under [External Frame], and a few functions I know. Those functions
 don't show a lot of memory allocations, but [Self] does. It seems [Self] is leaking massively.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those functions have a little arrow on which I can click to go down and see the stack trace of the allocations. But [Self] does not have such an arrow.</p>
<p>I have no clue what [Self] is or what could be causing these apparent leaks, I am&nbsp; not even sure these are 'real' leaks.</p>
<p>So my question is: how can I investigate these allocations under [Self] ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Etienne</p>
