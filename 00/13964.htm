            issue fixed by disabling Cisco Any Connect service.&nbsp; Uninstalling the VPN software allowed by network to work again, so installed and the issue came back.&nbsp; going to local services and disabling is how I can use it or disable if I need to get to another
 network.&nbsp;

<h2>            Outlook 2010 and prompting for smart card</h2>
                    <p>When the clients try to connect to Exchange via Outlook on the local network, they get an error about a smart card? This started happening after applying the latest service pack.<br />
KB2553248<br />
They uninstalled this Outlook 2010 update and that fixed it?<br />
They installed a service pack and the problem came back.<br />
They can close the error and then access their email.<br />
User says they already are set to require SSL in IIS and ignore client certificates.<br />
They are Win7 clients with Office 2010, with one Vista system.<br />
User is not sure if the Vista box is 64-bit or not.<br />
User says this is the only Exchange server and it has never been migrated.<br />
User says Out Of Office works fine.</p>
<p>Apparently there is no fix for this?<br />
Talk to Wayne Ricketts, per <a href="http://blog.minkatec.com/?p=489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.minkatec.com/?p=489</a>.<br />
Indeed the internal URL is an external address, but it does resolve correctly.<br />
Send ownership email with that link.<br />
Change it to an internal address.<br />

    <title>Build 10130 - Freezes After Upgrade Installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cj roth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 10130 - Freezes After Upgrade Installation</h2>
                    <p>Hey, I've been trying to get Windows 10 installed on my Asus Flip TP500 for a couple months now since I got it, but I've been having a few problems every time I installed. Now that Build 10130 is out, I thought I'd give that a try. When I tried to install
 it at first via clean install, the Intel HD Graphics Driver wouldn't install, and I found out a few builds ago that that was because Intel has not officially released a Windows 10 version of their drivers. So I figured I'd try an upgrade install from a copy
 of Windows 8.1, like I had before. This time however, the bug hit right after I finished installing Windows 10: the operating system freezes as soon as I click on next at the "choose user" screen. I don't know if there's a way to work around this, but if there
 is, I'd really like to know so I don't have to wait till the next build. Thanks!</p>

            <p><span><span>Hello,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for choosing Windows Insider Program.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>From the description of the issue I understand that you are unable to go beyond the Choose User screen, hence Windows 10 doesn’t boot properly in this scenario.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the Graphics driver is the only real cliché we are facing like you have pointed out, Safe Mode will do just fine. As because
</span></span>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers<span><span>. So let’s work around a bit to find out if the Graphics Driver has prevented you from entering into Windows Desktop.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Firstly, I would suggest you to try repair your Computer with the Windows 10 Disc, and subsequently try entering into
<strong>Windows Safe Mode</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Change the boot order in <strong>BIOS</strong>, so that the CD, DVD, or BD drive is listed first.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Insert your bootable CD, DVD, or BD in your disc drive.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Restart your computer.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Watch for a message. “<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD</strong>”
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To boot from the disc, you'll need to press any key on your keyboard within the few seconds that the message is on the screen.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>On the first displayed screen, click <strong>Next</strong>, and then click
<strong>Repair your computer</strong> from the next box.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Once the computer shuts down and begins to restart, start pressing the
<span><strong>F8</strong></span> key repeatedly until you see the <span>Advanced Boot Options</span> menu.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">When displayed, use the arrow keys to go to the </span>
<strong><span><span>Safe Mode</span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)"> option and press
</span><strong><span><span>Enter</span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)"> to start Windows 10 in
</span><strong><span><span>Safe Mode.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If&nbsp;the&nbsp;Windows successfully&nbsp;starts&nbsp;in Safe mode, please uninstall and reinstall the video card drivers in
<strong>Compatibility Mode</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the steps below to install a driver in <strong>Compatibility Mode</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A. Right click on the setup file of the driver for </span></span>Intel HD Graphics
<span><span>and select <strong>Properties </strong>from the list.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>B. Select <strong>Compatibility </strong>Tab.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>C. Place a check mark next to <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong> and select the operating system accordingly from the drop down list.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>D. Let the driver to install and then check the functionality.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try&nbsp;the <strong>Program Compatibility Troubleshooter</strong> which works with most of the programs to detect and fix common compatibility problems.</p>
<p><span><span>Link: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: The above link is works for Windows 8 and above.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Kindly update us on the status of the issue. If it still persists, we will be glad to help you.</span></span></p>

            <p>Yep, some USB ports on computers have better voltages than others, you might have to find a "strong" one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, ensure that the Windows Phone App for Desktop works and can connect to the phone.&nbsp; If WPAD works, and NSRT doesn't, then the issue must be software related.</p>

<h2>            Why does it take so long for Outlook 2003 to connect to my email server&#63;</h2>
                    Up to just a few days ago, Outlook 2003 connected to my email provider's server (WOW) virtually immediately.&nbsp; Connection is made via standard pop3/SMTP connection. &nbsp; Now, it takes from 1-2 minutes to make the connection and to download emails from the
 server.&nbsp; I have contacted my service provider and they indicate that the problem is not theirs.&nbsp; The only change I have made to my system is to change the password to the server.

<h2>            Unchecking &#34;Do not check spelling . . .&#34; doesn&#39;t hold</h2>
                    In MS Word 11 -- and it seems especially since the last, recent auto-upgrade a few days ago -- I continually discover that my spell/grammar checking isn't working as I type. I have it selected in AutoCorrect, and when I go to TOOLS &gt; LANGUAGE I find that
 the "Do not check spelling and grammar" is checked in spite of my having "unchecked" it repeatedly. I select my English US language again, uncheck the box, click on Default, etc. -- and it will hold for the doc I'm working on. But the next time I start a new
 doc I have to uncheck the box again.

<p>Open your Normal.dotm template as a document. Do this by opening Word, select File &gt; Open ... then navigate to ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates/Normal.dotm (~ represents your Hard Drive and User Id).</p>
<p>With the template now open, go to Tools &gt; Language and set the checkbox the way you want it. Type something on the page and delete it, this resets Word's save switch. Then save/close and quit Word completely. Re-open Word and verify if the problem has been

            <p>OK, so it sounds like an "accidental" Win 10 "upgrade" rather than a "clean install" of Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case, your previous Windows installation should be backed up in "C:\Windows.OLD".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have 2 options. One is to backout of the Win10 "upgrade" if it has been less than 30 days since the upgrade has happened. In that case, in theory at least, you should get your Office 2007 installation back.&nbsp; The other option is to use one of the following
 tools to extract the 2007 product key from the C:\Windows.OLD backup folder. Then you can install 2007 on Win 10.</p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>You can use any of the following tools to extract the Product Key from you computer. These tools report on many installed programs on your computer, not just Office.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>PS</span></strong><span>: you should keep a copy (printed and/or file copies on external storage devices) of the report(s) generated by these tools so you have all of your
 product keys / registration numbers available for future re-installs</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>FYI</span></strong><span>: I (Rohn) have not tested these tools in Windows 8 (just haven’t had an excuse to make/waste the time), but I don’t expect any problem. The underlying
 mechanics of Windows 8 are essentially the same as Windows 7 if you ignore the Metro User Interface. Think of metro as “lipstick on a pig”. The pig is not changed by adding a little paint on the surface.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:
</span></strong><span>these tools no longer work for Office 2013 and 2016 after MS "improved" the way the key is stored on your computer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><span>Normally you have several resources to find your Retail Product Key.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><span>O<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Your original package or purchase confirmation e-mail</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Online download account</span></li><li><span>You can extract the Product Key from the machine itself</span></li><li><span>Image copy backups of system with Office installed</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Activation backup utilities </span><span>From what I’ve read, MS uses a file called
<strong>TOKENS.DAT</strong> to store encrypted product activation keys:</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\<strong>Tokens.DAT</strong>
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SoftwareLicensing\<strong>Tokens.data</strong><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>C:\Windows.Old\ProgramData\Microsoft\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\<strong>Tokens.DAT</strong> (if you did an in-place Windows Upgrade)<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: Do not expect the Windows.OLD folder to be there until you delete it. Win 10 will “help” you by deleting the backout files 30 days after the “upgrade”
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After you extract the Product Key, make sure to write it down and keep it in a safe place. Burning a copy of the installation file to a CD would also be a good idea if you don’t have the installation disk.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: OEM (factory install and activated) licenses use a different key than the one reported.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Only the factory can use the PK from the original factory activation. You would have been provided with a separate piece of paper with a Product key for reactivation.</span></p>

 location depending on where your windows.old folder is located, but you want to basically browse to the following and open this file:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><span>C:\Windows.old\Windows\System32\config\RegBack\SOFTWARE</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>After opening this file select ok; you may have to wait a few minutes for it to load the hive and give you your keys, but if they’re there you should see them and be able to fresh install your MS Office.</span></p>

<p><span>Magic Jelly Bean Keyfinder doesn’t work for Office 2010 or Office 2013 suites and applications. However, Office 2010 and Office 2013 already include a vbs-script which will reveal the last 5 characters of your Product Key. It’s pretty
 safe to state that these 5 characters would already be more than enough to find out which Product Key you have used (as you should already have safely stored the full Product Key code somewhere else together with your other license information).</span></p>
<p><span>You can run the vbs-file in the following way;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Open a command prompt. For instance via:
<ul>
<li><span>Start-&gt; All Programs-&gt; Accessories-&gt; Command Prompt </span>
</li><li><span>Windows XP <br />
Start-&gt; Run: cmd </span></li><li><span>Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8<br />
Start-&gt; type: cmd </span></li></ul>
</li><li>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the command prompt, type the following:
<ul>
<li><span>Office 2010 (32-bit) on a 32-bit version of Windows <br />
cscript “C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\OSPP.VBS” /dstatus </span></li><li><span>Office 2010 (32-bit) on a 64-bit version of Windows <br />
cscript “C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\OSPP.VBS” /dstatus </span>
</li><li><span>Office 2010 (64-bit) on a 64-bit version of Windows <br />

<h3> markindevon  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Word 2010 - How to add a letter prefix to a page number</h2>
                    <p>Hello - </p>
<p>I've got a largish document (300 pages) and for&nbsp;section 2 the page number displays as 1-1 which&nbsp;is the&nbsp;Heading 1 number followed by&nbsp;the page number for that particular section which&nbsp;is fine.</p>
<p>However for the first section I need the prefix to be the letter S (so the page number displays S-1) and I need the page letter &amp; number to appear in the TOC - how would I go about that?</p>
<p>I've tried creating a new&nbsp;style based on a H1 linking to the&nbsp;level 1 of&nbsp;the multilevel list letter of S using the "Number style for this level:" and starting at S but trying to format the page field to display the S&nbsp;doesn't work as it seems to only pick
 up the official H1 style.</p>
<p>Can I insert the S manually into a Page field which is picked up by the TOC. If that is the right way to go how would I go about that?</p>
<p>Hope that makes sense and any help much appreciated!</p>

            <p>Yes, that is the way that you will have to do it, using the built-in Heading Styles.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition however, it appears that you will need to use the Heading&nbsp;1, Heading 2 and Heading 3 as S, S.1, S.1.1, (assuming that you need the three levels), in the first
 Section of the document and you must omit the use of Heading 4 and Define the numbering for Heading 5, Heading 6 and Heading 7 as 1, 1.1, 1.1.1</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>See the article "How to create numbered headings or outline numbering in your Microsoft Word document" on the following page of the Late Shauna Kelly's website:</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Having just tested it here, I have determined that you must omit the use of the Heading 4 style as otherwise, the heading in the second section will not include the required heading numbering.</p>

            <p>Hello SnowBallFighter and others:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the follow up and trying the steps discussed in my previous post.&nbsp; At this point it is beginning to look like this is an issue with the Microsoft account being used.&nbsp; We are looking into this further as there have been others reporting the
 same thing.&nbsp; It is unclear on when more information will be available but I will be sure to update this thread as new details become available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime I would suggest you reach out to Microsoft account support regarding the error you are getting.&nbsp; They have live chat support available
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/getsupport/hostpage.aspx?oaspworkflow=start_1.0.0.0&amp;wfname=msa&amp;pesid=10123&amp;locale=en-ie&amp;wf=0&amp;ccsid=635134699774807516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure you get the most out of this chat I would focus on the fact that you are required to verify your child's account and the error message you get when you attempt to do this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to make sure we have all the information needed to do through research on this issue.&nbsp; Please provide the following details if you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>What country are you located in?</li><li>What OS is running on the PC you are trying the verification from?</li><li>What browser are you using?</li><li>Where were the accounts created, on the accounts.live.com website, on a Xbox console, on a Windows phone, etc....?</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any new details to add or any other questions or concerns we can address.</p>

<p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have understood correctly you receive the error "This domain name can't be used with Admin Center because it's already registered with Microsoft" when trying to register your domain in Windows Live Admin Center. I'd be happy to assist you. It is possible
 that you are encountering this issue because your previous subscription in Microsoft Office 365 is still not cancelled. Kindly verify if your subscription is already cancelled then try to register your domain again in Admin Center to check if the same issue
 will occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how things turn out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi, Karla!<br />
<br />
Tnx for the prompt answer! I was not expecting for you to replay at the next day. :)<br />
<br />
As form my problem - yes that is the case, I was (and from your answer I understand that I still might be) registered with Office 365, but the thing is, I am 99% sure I deleted the domain from the 365 account and 100% sure I cleared all may email addresses
 including the admin one (I renamed it to [something]@adx.on<span>onmicrosoft.com)</span>. And now I don't remember the login user name and I most certainly can't recall the password that I used for the 365 admin panel. The only thing I am sure of, is that
 for admin account I specified one of my gmail accounts... so that I could probably resset the password... if I new the username and of course if the account still exist. :)<br />
<br />
Before you mention, yes I tried to guess it using https://prs-scu.passwordreset.microsoftonline.com/Default.aspx , but with no luck...
<br />
<br />
Is there any way you could help? <br />
<br />

            Please help. I'm trying to setup staff members already registered with Microsoft 360 however no one knows who the account is registered to. The owner, himself, when logged in, shows he doesn't have the rights to his domain. We need this to work for everyone.
 It states&nbsp;"This domain name can't be used with Admin Center because it's already registered with Microsoft." Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

<p>What device is it you are using?</p>
<p>You indicated that you have activesync installed but it does not connect to your phone (so I assume youhave not been able to establish a partnership).</p>
<p>If that is the case, can you uncheck Advanced Network Functionality to then see if it connects?</p>
<p>Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Connection USB to PC. Uncheck Advanced network functionality. Then connect your device again.</p>

    <title>Equivalent to OPK for Volume Licensed Versions&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Equivalent to OPK for Volume Licensed Versions&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there an OPK-like installer&nbsp;for volume licensed (MAK) versions of Office? I have tried MAK keys for Office Standard and Professional Plus with the Office PreInstallation Kit with no luck (see this TechNet article:
<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/odsupport/archive/2011/04/15/getting-invalid-product-key-error-when-trying-to-input-mak-key-for-volume-license-version-of-office-2010.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, is there an equivalent way to install VL versions of Office (Standard and Professional Plus) that work like the OPK, where I can preinstall the software for an image-based PC and have the user enter a key to complete the installation? I don't want
 to have to use ISOs or real CDs to do this.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting to the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, since you’re facing issues while installing the volume license versions of Office 2010 (using MAK), it would be best that you post this
 query in the Office IT Pro link. You would receive better suggestions in that forum.

            <p>Did you try building this expression with the expression builder?</p>
<p>Looking at the list of functions, I don't see the replace() command, so there is very little surprise that your expression is not valid.</p>
<p>Remember, that code you write for a web browser MUST run in a web browser. Last time I looked at the web browser running on Apple iPad, the web browser did NOT have a replace() command.</p>
<p>So, the commands you use inside of web browser are more limited since web browsers don't have all the same functions we are used to say when running Access client based where they have VBA + Access installed.</p>
<p>So, since you are new to this, I would suggest that you use the expression builder for most expressions, as it will display/show only what functions are legal as opposed to you "guessing" what functions are available and which are not.</p>
<p>So, the reason why replace() does not work is because the code you are writing has to run inside of a web browser and as such a web browser is not known to have that function and feature available.</p>
<p>As noted, the best way to "know" and "see" what functions are to use the expression builder, since it will then ONLY show what functions you can use in the web browser when writing code that has to run in a web browser.</p>

            <p>Ah, good, ok, at least we are now defining the problem in some kind of context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming this form is bound to table assets (you have to confirm this assumption here (please)).</p>
<p>So, you have this:</p>
<p>=Replace("Check Out: |","|",Nz([Item],"(Untitled)"))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, is [Item] the column from the table Assets? <br />
</p>
<p>Is this form bound to table Assets?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, it not clear why we have all that extra stuff like those vertical bars etc?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as noted, we don't have the Replace command in web form. However, looking at what you have so far, we might not&nbsp;require that function anyway.</p>
<p>Assuming all my above assumptions are correct, then as a source for this text box on that form, (and assuming the text box name is NOT named item, then:</p>
<p>If the datasource is set:</p>
<p>=([Item])</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the text box will display the column [Item]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you as per above want the text "check out" to be displayed, then:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=("Check out " &amp; [Item])</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Above would display the text "Check out " and then your data column [item]. And again we are assuming this form is bound to the table Assets – you MUST clear up this issue since if this is not the case, then my suggestion will not be of any use to you and
 I am sending you on a wild goose chase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, if the column [Item] might be null, then we could have the null text replaced with some text such as "untitled".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could then use this expression:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>=("Check out " &amp; Nz([City],"Untitled"))</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, even if we were doing this in VBA, we likely still would not need to use the replace command. And let's leave out all that "," and "|" junk for now until we get the basic expression working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, move forward in "small" steps. I having to "guess" here a bit, but I am sure we can file down this problem untill it starts to work!</p>

<h2>            Unable to edit Group Calendar through the web nor through Sharepoint phone app</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we have a group site for our department and we are experiencing some issues with the group calendar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No one is able to edit the calendar through the web browser nor through the phone apps including the members who have full control.&nbsp; The only way to update the calendar is by connecting the calendar to Outlook and editing it through outlook.&nbsp; I tried to
 make another group calendar to see if I have tampered with the default settings, but even with a fresh calendar the issue persists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the web browser, the "add event" button exists and I can add all the information for an event but when I hit save, the page reloads and nothing happens.&nbsp; However, with the phone app, NO "add event" button exists and upon my research, it is not a common
 issue! Is there a way to fix our issue here?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much Appreciated.<br />

<p><span>Hi Faisal,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I think I find something about this issue. Please do the steps below to see if you can get rid of the issue:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Add an app &gt; Select “calendar” &gt; do not click “advanced option” at this time &gt; create a non-group calendar first.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>After creating this calendar &gt; go to Calendar menu tab &gt; list settings &gt; List name, description and navigation &gt; set “Use this calendar to share member’s schedules” to “Yes”</span></p>
<p><span>It seems when we create it as Group Calendar directly, the issue will happen. But if we convert the calendar to Group Calendar, the issue will not happen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you set "Use this calendar to share member's schedules" to "no" then set it back to "yes", the affected group calendar should also work fine for new added events.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can you help us confirm that?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Rena</span></p>

                    How do I delete a "corrupted" pst file in outlook 2010? I have tried a <strong>
repair unsuccessfully</strong> using scanpst.exe. I have un-installed and re-installed office, but the problem still exists. I have created a new<strong> default</strong> outlook data file but cannot
<strong>remove</strong> the offending pst file in the normal way (in the data file tab). The offending file
<strong>"cannot be found"</strong> under the "settings" tab.&nbsp;Under the "remove" tab the message reads " You cannot delete this outlook data file. Configuration information in the file&nbsp;is being copied to your new default data file. You can delete the file after
 this information is copied" - I believe this claim&nbsp;to be&nbsp;erroneous !

</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If you are using 64-bit internet browser, switch to 32-bit.</p>
<p>2. Open outlook.com &gt; top right, next to your name, click the Gear icon &gt; click More mail settings &gt; under Writing emails, select Attachments &gt; select Always send files as attachments &gt; click Save when done.</p>

            <p>Hi Debra, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue you aren't able to attach a document to Outlook, kindly remove your profile and re-configure it to Outlook once again. Also, since you already have the Silverlight updated, try to use a different web browser and check to see if the same issue
 persists. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>

            The first thing to try is to log into your mailbox, select the Deleted folder, then click "restore deleted items". &nbsp;If that doesn't bring back the messages, then they're gone for good. &nbsp;Microsoft keeps deleted information for only five days, according
 to other posts I've read in this forum.

<h3> fredbaileyivcf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing default from &#34;Microsoft Office click-to-run integratedofficeexe&#34;  to Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have installed Win10 (Microsoft 365) and upgraded to Excel 2016. Find I can't open .xls files as default app to open them is now "Microsoft Office click-to-run integratedofficeexe". Windows 10 won't let me open an Excel file with the current default (which
 I don't want to do anyway), without removing Excel 2016 (which I also don't want to do). But Excel of any kind (including Excel 2016) is not an available option in the system or in the App Store to set as default app to open my .xls files. This doesn't make
 sense that Excel is not the default&nbsp; or at least an available option for .xls files. Any help here to fix this?</p>

<p>Hi Fred,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If Microsoft Excel is installed on a Windows 10 computer, it should be the default application for opening
<strong>.xls</strong> files. One of the possible reasons why you are experiencing this issue is due to some software conflicts. Before changing the default app, we suggest that you boot your PC to safe mode. Booting a device into safe
 mode could get rid of the most common software conflicts between the applications installed on your computer.

</p><p>I can open your web-site on my 14915 build and using Edge just fine. But that's all I can test as I&nbsp;don't speak the language. But Lawrence's post is correct. This is not the place to ask such questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

            I tried your website in build 14915.1000 and build 14393.105 and with both internet explorer and Edge and both show a lot of printing in reverse as if you are reading it in a mirror and a lot appears to be upside down. The pictures look fine

<h2>            Mark Index&#58; &#34;Mark all&#34; no longer active.</h2>
                    I am using Word 2007 and trying to create a name index for a book.&nbsp;&nbsp; Initially when I opened the Mark Entry box, (References, Mark Entry) &nbsp;I could click either the "Mark" tab to mark the entry once only, or "Mark all" to mark it every time it appeared
 in the book.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, half way through the book, the "Mark all" option is not active.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any suggestions how to re-activate it please?

            This unfortunately cannot be avoided. An issue Nokia seems they have decided they are not going to fix as its been there ever since the 6630.<br />
<br />
However there is a workaround.<br />
<br />
Instead of using both the first name and last name fields, just put the persons full name in the first name field and ignore the last name field.<br />
<br />
That way when texts come in from the person it will show the persons name correctly.

            Yeah, that's the way around it... provided you do not want to screw up everything in Outlook.
