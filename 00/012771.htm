<h2>            Sync Contacts Between Windows 10 Devices</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows PC, Surface 4 Pro and a Lumia 950XL, all running Windows 10. I want to use one set of contacts for messaging and email on all 3 devices. I have Office 2016 on all three devices. I am logging into all three devices with the same live account.
 I have added live contacts to Outlook on my PC. When I look at People&nbsp;in my browser, Surface, phone,&nbsp;or live contacts in Outlook on my PC they are all different. Goal is simple;&nbsp;one set of contacts I can maintain from the People app on the web,&nbsp;my phone, PC,&nbsp;and
 Surface that&nbsp;is the default contacts for&nbsp;Office 2016 and&nbsp;messaging. I have checked the forums without luck. Most refer to Windows 7 or Windows 8.1. None seem to address my issue or have solutions applicable to my goal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any help or guidance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Wayne</p>

<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To resolve this issue we need more information. Let us know the following.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>What is the type of email account you have setup for your Live account in Outlook 2016, Surface Pro 4 and Lumia Phone? For example
 POP3, IMAP, Exchange Active Sync (EAS) or Microsoft Exchange. To check the type of email account configured in Outlook 2016 click on
<strong>File &gt; Info </strong>&gt;<strong> Account Settings &gt; Account Settings</strong> drop-down. EAS account refers to Hotmail.com, Outlook.com or Live.com email accounts.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To sync your contacts between all the devices, you need to setup your account as Exchange Active Sync (EAS) on Outlook 2016, Surface Pro 4 and on your Lumia Phone.

            <p>Update after some working with Outlook. Turns out the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account contacts in Office 2016 do update nicely across devices. I updated that contact list in Outlook on my PC and the changes were applied across devices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where the confusion come in&nbsp;is when I open the People app on my Surface, PC, or on the Web I get a different set of contacts. The People app on my phone seems to be tied to the Outlook and messaging app on my phone. I rarely use the People site on the web,
 PC, or Surface so the way it is working now is great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EAS on all 3 devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is are there two People contact list: one tied to Outlook EAS&nbsp;and the other tied to the live web, PC, and Surface People apps?</p>

            <p>I understand that now. What caused the confusion for me was the People app on my phone was tied to Outlook and Messaging. While the People app on my PC, the Web and Surface was tied to People on my Live account. Not sure why they don't just tie it all together
 or make the difference clearer. The People app should be the same across platforms. That being said, I am glad the People app on the phone is tied to Outlook. Accomplishes my goal of a single contact list for Outlook accross platforms and Messaging on my phone.</p>

            <p>Not quite there yet, I understand the difference between People on my Live account and People in Office 365. The problem is, it looks like, the Outlook app on my phone uses the People app on my Live account. My assumption is the Outlook mail and calendar
 apps on my phone are mobile apps tied to People and Calendar on my Live account. I could not find the Outlook 365 app in the Windows store and when I tried to install it, it said the OS was not compatible. Two questions:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>1. Can I link the contact list in Outlook 365 to the Outlook mobile app?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>2. If it cannot be linked; how do I install Outlook 365 om my Lumia 950XL?</p>
<p>

            <p>Just when I thought I had it down I hit another snag. I am working with my PC, Phone and Surface on the same desk. The contacts (People) on my phone match the contacts in Outlook 2016 on my PC and Surface. The People Contacts on outlook.com and people.live.com
 match. When I updated a contact in Outlook 2016 on my PC I checked it in Office 2016 on my Surface. The contacts on my surface doubled. When I checked there was a difference in the duplicates. I delete the entry that was out of date and it deleted both entries
 on the Surface. The entry on my PC did not change. I am hoping it is a sync issue and that all I need to do is wait before checking updates to give things a chance to sync. If that is the case how long does it take changes to prorogate??</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Obviously, using a single contact list across Windows 10 devices is going to be more of a challenge than I thought. Is there a White Paper or article I can read that will explain how syncing between Outlook 2016 works and one that explains how it works in
 People Live? If not I see many hours trying to figure this out by trial and error. Would be much easier if I was a business and had technical support. I am only an individual that thought by going all MS I would make my digital life easier by having one contact
 list for phone, email and messaging.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>With patience and help from the Community I will figure this out. Once I do I will publish a simple, or as simple as possible, How-To on the community forum&nbsp;for others having problems figuring out how this all fits together.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi William,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer to your question depends on which games you are asking about.&nbsp; If you are concerned about the Solitaire, Hearts, Minesweeper, etc. that come pre-loaded with Windows 7, then yes, I'm afraid you will lose those if you move to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Windows 10 does include a modified version of the Microsoft Solitaire Collection that was originally introduced with Windows 8, and was previously only available as a download from the Windows Store.&nbsp; It does have a few new variations of Solitaire
 which I enjoy playing.</p>

            <p>Do you mean games that work in W7 or games that come with W7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is the former: Most games should present no problem. It is always possible with any OS update that some old games may not work with the latest graphic drivers or updates to gaming platforms</p>
<p>
</p><p>If games like solitaire, hearts and minesweeper - these have been replaced by free (with ads) downloadable games in the Store. Hearts has gone but the Solitaire has several more types of games</p>

            <p>Yes. The app games don't live up to the quality of the Windows 7 Games.</p>
<p>Windows 10 gutted out all of the good features of Windows 7 and forced the consumers to use or buy apps. That is the reason it is "free".</p>

            <p>I completely disagree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solitaire and minesweeper in Win7 is about as simple and limited as you can get - Aside from being stable, they are not what I would call "quality" games and nor are they even meant to be. They are simple, easy, limited functionality games only initially&nbsp;included
 to help people learn to use a mouse and to test&nbsp;performance . They&nbsp;are&nbsp;only comfortable because they&nbsp;have been around so long.&nbsp;Both have been improved greatly by their replacement with free apps - solitaire as part of Windows 10 and minesweeper as a free download.
 They have&nbsp;many more new&nbsp;options i.e. different games and just as much flexibility. What good feature has been removed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not have to buy either, they are both free&nbsp;- you can choose to pay to have the ads removed but, really, why bother? If MS enforces payment to play then there are many free alternatives. After all, who chooses their OS by the bundled basic games?</p>

            This was helpful but in a negative way. The downloaded hearts &amp; solitaire programmes are inferior to those available under Windows 7 &amp; discourage play. Perhaps this was the intent. We wait for a viable alternative to Windows.

<blockquote>&nbsp;How do you turn off&nbsp;the music which is paused&nbsp;without having to power down the phone?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you turn off the music without going into a paused mode.</blockquote>
<br />
For the most part you don't. Like some other modern music players there's not a state that is distinctly seperate from "Pause" exposed. The only time that the mini controls disassociate from a track are when the phone is reset, after a video has been played,
 or when the phone is connected to the Zune desktop client.

<p>
My wife has a <strong>Nokia Lumia 735</strong>. She received it Brand new in February this year. We also purchased&nbsp;a brand new&nbsp;<strong>class 10 Samsung 128GB</strong> micro sd card&nbsp;for it(specs state the phone supports cards up to 128 gb). I 1st formatted the
 card while in the phone. I&nbsp;then loaded Videos, Music &amp; Pictures onto the card via a usb cable hooked directly to our PC. The videos had/have stayed in the Video file folder since day 1(no problem there really), However, the music(which was displayed properly
 for about 3 weeks/a month) has since&nbsp;somehow moved itself, and the pictures loaded onto the card &amp; taken by the phone's camera are
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">nowhere</span> to be found. Under storage sense what should be in the music folder(I recognize the amount/gb), is now in the folder titled "other". The files can no longer be accessed by her music player/xbox play app
 on her phone, yet when I check through the PC(hooking up her phone with usb cable &amp; searching for files) all the music is IN the music folder?!? Anyone know what is going on here? This is very strange &amp; my wife is
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>EXTREMELY</strong> frustrated </span>
by it. I'm fairly savvy when it comes to most phone /computer issues but this is boggling my mind as well.</p>

            <p>The disappearing music and media files can be explained, if the media folders and files got their file attributes changed to System. It will then move to the Other category in Storage Check, and become invisible to apps on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest review the attributes of the media folders and files on the SD card, via USB in a PC file manager (or a command line) and unmark as System, if this is the cause?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please take care to only alter the attributes of media folders and files. There are other folders and files on the SD card that must remain System and/or Hidden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have experienced the issue, and cause, after using the SD card in another phone.<br />
To hopefully avoid the issue in the future, also keep in mind that older PCs may not be able to correctly handle memory cards and/or connected devices with more than 32 or 64 GB capacity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how it goes?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Enterprise - I cannot get into the BIOS even with Secure Boot turned off.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo W530. In the BIOS I have 'Secure Boot' turned off and I also have 'UEFI /Legacy Boot' set to 'Both'. The 'UEFI/Legacy Boot Priority' is set to 'Legacy First'. This should allow me to enter the BIOS, boot to a USB key, CD/DVD, or even boot
 to the network. Even with these settings in place, Windows 10 is not allowing me to select a boot device or enter BIOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ONLY way to get into BIOS is to load into Windows 10 and follow these steps:</p>
<p><strong>PC Settings -&gt; Update and Recovery -&gt; Recovery -&gt; Advanced Startup/Restart Now</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>From there select:</p>
<p><strong>Choose an Option/Troubleshoot -&gt; Advanced Options -&gt; Startup Repair</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once 'Startup Repair' is selected the computer will reboot and the BIOS options will be available. However, once you load into Windows 10 again it will lock you out of all of the boot up options once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it ignoring the 'Secure Boot' option in the BIOS. With 'Secure Boot' off, I should be able to enter the BIOS, boot to a cd, USB, or even network boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to make it to where these settings are always available. Anyone figured out to get this resolved yet?</p>

            <p>Yeah I just found it. Thanks. Here it is in case anyone needs it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So basically the 'Fast Startup' option was turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is how you turn it off:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to 'Control Panel -&gt; 'Power Options' -&gt; from the left hand column select 'What the Power Buttons Do' -&gt; at the top of the page select 'Change Settings that are currently unavailable' -&gt; scroll all of the way to the bottom and uncheck 'Turn on Fast Startup
 (Recommended)'. Then click 'Save Changes'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you really have to do all of this just to boot to a CD, USB key, or enter the BIOS? That should be easier.</p>

    <title>Distressing Changes to Outlook for 2016 Message List in Inbox and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charmoffensive  say:</h3>
<h2>            Distressing Changes to Outlook for 2016 Message List in Inbox and Other Folders in 15.27</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft continues to "improve" Outlook by making fundamental and often unwelcome changes to the user interface with no way to turn back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of 15.27, the message list, notably the Inbox, but also the list of messages in other folders, has undergone deleterious changes making my email much harder to manage. As with other changes Microsoft has been making, there is no option to turn these off.
 These changes frustrate settled user expectations and are maddeningly difficult to deal with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A note to users: Everytime you update Office for Mac to a new version, <strong>
you are opening a Pandora's box. </strong>Microsoft application product mangers are crowdsourcing and groupthinking their way to decisions with their smiley faces and voting counters, decisions that radical alter the interface, removing features you counted
 on or adding those you don't want, willy nilly and randomly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new Message List in 15.27 changes the Outlook message list in a radical departure from all previous versions of Outlook going back to Office 2003:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Unread messages were previously signfied by <strong>displaying the entire From:, and Subject:, in a bold light blue.</strong> This made it easy to glean and skip unread messages. Now there is only a blue dot and the time field highlighted in blue. Result:
 it's a lot harder to glean, and skip over unread messages when they come in. It used to be really easy to recognize junk and unimportant messages. No longer. &nbsp;Highlighting the entire From: and Subject: has been done since time immemorial. That is also how
 Gmail shows unread messages. Thanks Microsoft.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The second &nbsp;UI choice, arugably even worse, is to 1) add prodigious amounts of white space between the messages in the list,2) increase the font size of the to:, subject:, the preview line fields, and 3) lightening the line that separates the messages to
 the point of invisibility. Colectively these are<strong> horrible changes</strong> and especially for people who have vision challenges. Fewer messages can be displayed in the list than before. There are no visible demaraction lines between the messages, and
 overall the ability to glean your messages and deal with them is reduced. In terms of wasted space, it is as if the resolution of your screen went from 1920x1080 to 1024x768 insofar as the amount of screen real estate that the Outlook listbox now occupies.</li></ul>
<p>There appears to be no way to configure the display of the inbox messages as there is in the Windows version of Office and there is no turning back. I tried to go back to 15.26, but &nbsp;my Outlook database has been updated so I cannot do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new display will slow my work down, make it harder to manage messages, give me eye strain and make me less efficient. Microsoft has made radical unwelcome and unwise changes the Message List UI, with no option for backward compatability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The options above do not address the issue. Perhaps you don't truly understand the issue. &nbsp;This issue is with the list of messages - not the message in the right pane itself. It's the center column.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Take a look at the image below. It contrasts the message list in 15.27 with the Message list in the native Mail app. In 15.25, Outlook for Mac has a message list similar to the native Mac Mail App. &nbsp;What Microsoft has done here is radically alter the UI, waste
 screen real estate and make it harder to manage mail.<br />
<br />
It's a radical departure from the way that list has been since time immemorial.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Home Is there a way to sync calendar and contacts with Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an office 365 home account, and I am trying to see whether I can set up my Outlook 2016 Office 365 app to sync email, calendar, and contacts (and ideally tasks as well).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The automatic setup option doesn't work, and neither does the manual setup and select "Office 365" as the account type from the outlook 2016 account setup - both these options give errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use the Windows 10 setup screen to set up a mail account, it seems to work correctly, but it only appears in the Windows 10 mail, calendar and contacts apps. &nbsp;I can't find a way to make it work with Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One complication here is that my Office 365 account has the same name as my primary email account with another provider, so if I put that into the automatic setup, it will set it up as an IMAP account with the previous provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look in the outlook online settings in Office 365, it appears that my "real" Office 365 email address is "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" i.e. outlook followed by a random set of characters. &nbsp;I tried setting it up with this, but this didn't work
 either (although it did work in Outlook mobile on an ipad!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also seen contradictory information on the web, some of which seemed to indicate that you can't sync calendar etc unless you have office 365 for business, but then other articles that contradicted this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is - should it be technically possible with an outlook 365 home subscription including contacts, calendar and email to Outlook 2016? &nbsp;If the answer is yes, does anyone know what I am doing wrong here when trying to set this up?</p>

            <p>365 is a subscription license type, not an Office version</p>
<p>Currently 365 Home uses 2016 desktop components</p>
<p>In MS Outlook you add your mail account from whatever ISP/Mail provider you have, using the auto setup page where you enter simply your mail account username and password.</p>
<p>The win10 mail/Contacts/Calendar is completely separate and different to MS Outlook</p>
<p>A pop mail account wont sync</p>
<p>An IMAP mail account will sync mail only</p>

</p><p>I was missing two key points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I needed to set up an email alias from within Office 365 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I then needed to use the Activesync option hooking up to EAS.outlook.com using the alias email address, and NOT selecting "Office 365" as the account type (which is of course confusing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, it appears that it is now working as I wanted.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Print to PDF Cutting off Sides of Headers &#38; Footers on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> liamdmcl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Print to PDF Cutting off Sides of Headers &#38; Footers on Excel</h2>
                    <p>When I select "Microsoft Print to PDF" from the printer list and print my Excel sheet as a PDF, about half an inch on each side of the headers and footers are cut off on the PDF. This cut off doesn't apply to sheet content that is at the edge of the page,
 just the headers and footers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I use Microsoft Print to PDF to print my Excel sheet without the sides of the headers and footers being cut off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I "Save As.." "PDF" the document saves as a PDF perfectly. I'm only trying to print to PDF as a workaround for embedding fonts (because Excel doesn't allow fonts to be embedded).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

            Yes. Like I said, the cut off doesn't apply to text that extends to the edge of thr page, just the header and footer. This implies that the edges of the page are within the printable area.

<p>
</p><p>To further isolate the concern, we suggest that you download Microsoft Office Configuration Analyzer Tool 2.2

            <p>Hey Radney,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the OffCAT tool and it identified 3 issues and fixed 2. This didn't solve the issue I am facing. The issue it couldn't fix was "Add-ins have been automatically disabled because of performance or stability issues". Does this seem relevant to the issue
 I'm facing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran another experiment and found out something new about my issue. The Print to PDF margins only appear when printing over multiple sheets, and they only appear on the pages of the sheets
<em>after</em> the first sheet. The issue does not present itself when printing multiple pages on the first sheet. To see what I mean, see the attached screenshots of the PDF (I just put one large picture in the header).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have any ideas!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3f546e9-d6ba-4f93-a160-22254eb529c6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3f546e9-d6ba-4f93-a160-22254eb529c6" /></a></p>

<h2>            Javascript apparently not working even though enabled</h2>
                    <div>Using IE9 on Windows home premium 64bit, downloaded and installed a few days ago, version number is not showing under About (it is blank)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many websites are not displaying properly in IE9, I suspect it is a javascript problem for two reasons</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) The default login for Skype shows no form fields, this apparently happens when Javascript is not enabled in IE</div>
<div>2) The source for Facebook, which only displays the header and foot on most pages, suggests it is showing a "no_js" frame.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I recently had to manually remove Mcafee anti-virus from my system which included removing all the registry keys pointing to it, I suspect this is where something went wrong.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have reinstalled IE9 twice, I have also removed it as a Windows feature and added it again, I have disabled and re-enabled javascript, I have cleared data and reset settings several times, none of these have worked, I have also re-registered a couple
 of dlls following a Microsoft support document but I think that was for an earlier version of IE</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What can I try?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you in advance.</div>

            I have exactly the same problem. Javascript not working, Skype without login form.<br />
Fix from 
RajithR was not working (dll registration succeeded), compatibility set, scripting in IE was enabled.<br />
Computer is clean (new Acer laptop).<br />
Any other help?<br />
Thank you<br />

<p>This is an outlook.com account set up in MS Exchange, if I'm saying that correctly.&nbsp; I found a gobbledegook entry in help that says I can't change the outlook.com password directly in Outlook.&nbsp; I also cannot delete the outlook.com account in Office 16 Outlook&nbsp;
 without deleting all other accounts as the outlook.com account is primary, which I would like to avoid.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when you say delete the account, do you mean go to outlook.com and delete my account there and then set it up all over again with the new password?&nbsp; OR must I delete everything in MS Office outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is amazingly annoying. I'm sure there's a reason for it but my inclination would be to dump outlook.com altogether if I did not use it as my primary address for all sorts of important things.</p>

<p>Palcouk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response but I don't understand parts of it. When I set up Outlook, I designated my outlook.com email as the primary and default account. In Account Settings I have no direct password access, as the first reply stated. I assume that is because
 my outlook.com email is an MS Exchange account. The example I saw had a pop account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm not getting is this:&nbsp;&nbsp; "...you need to remove the a/c and add it back in."&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the a/c?</p>

            According to <a href="http://support-hk.samsung.com/galaxynote/eng/benefit.html?type=find" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support-hk.samsung.com/galaxynote/eng/benefit.html?type=find</a>, you can use the installed Polaris Office to read and save Office docs. It may be that you would&nbsp;have to open the appropriate Office app before trying to open the Word file. It may also
 be that it opens only .doc and not .docx files.<br />
<br />
But you would be better advised to ask this question in a Galaxy forum since there seems to be no Microsoft app for Android--at least not yet: according to

http://androidcommunity.com/microsoft-office-for-android-coming-november-10-according-to-rumors-20120531/</a>, there's a rumor that one is coming. And the deceptively titled

</p><p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In such case I suggest you to try it with different browser and check if you get the same issue.</p>

</p><p><strong>Turn off add-ons</strong><span> </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Add-ons are apps that browsers use to interact with web content like videos and games. Incompatible or out-of-date add-ons might cause Internet Explorer to run slowly, crash, or prevent sites from displaying correctly. Before you

<p>
</p><p>You may download the Skype classic version if you prefer to use the previous version. Here are the steps on how to get classic Skype:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Skype download page via this <strong><a href="http://download.skype.com/msi/SkypeSetup_7.40.0.104.msi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LINK</a></strong></li><li>Click "Run" on the dialog box to start the download and install</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please make sure to disable the updates after installation by going to<br />
<strong>Tools &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Automatic updates</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Given that what I see here is exactly from the Wikipedia page on Microsoft Office (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office), I would assume that this document has been saved as an html file, which is why it is opening in Web Layout view.</p>
<p>So press F12 to get the Save As dialog, and make sure you save it as a "Word Document" and nothing else.</p>
<p>Then, when you reopen it, it should open in Page Layout view.</p>

<h2>            Error on joining caller to a group</h2>
                    I have used Skype&nbsp; in a group, but last attempt had an error.&nbsp; I had three others on line and another person rang in, when I answered them Skype put the others on hold.&nbsp; When i tried to join all parties the screen said resume, I pressed the button but
 it would not respond.&nbsp; How can I get several people on line and joined in without cutting off those already there?&nbsp; Advice appreciated.

<h2>            E75 keeps receiving message when pairing with car</h2>
                    I have a new Nokia e75 which&nbsp; I purchased&nbsp; because the old E51 would not synchronize contacts with my car (Audi Q7 factory build phone preparation ). Now it synchronizes my contacts, my dialed list... But EVERY TIME IT PAIRS WITH THE CAR I GET&nbsp;an identical&nbsp;&nbsp;message
 message containing a business card from a friend . Please help :is it a network provider problem, a car problem , or something with the phone? Its very annoying because every time a get into the car, start the motor, I must&nbsp;delete this message .

    <title>Onmicrosoft domain is showing up as reply address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> delberthenderson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onmicrosoft domain is showing up as reply address</h2>
                    
<p>We just migrated from an SBS box to Office 365. We are synchronizing AD to the cloud. Oddly enough, just last night, when all of our users started sending messages, they started being sent with the onmicrosoft domain instead of our company domain. I read
 several articles and one of them told me that I needed to check my proxyaddress in adsiedit. It was not set so I added "SMTP:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" and forced a dirsync. Now, when I log into the office 365 portal, I see the users primary email address set as "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"
 instead of "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***". However, still, when they send an email, it shows the onmicrosoft domain. What else could be wrong here. Below is the link to the article that I used that seemed to fix the primary email address for each user.</p>

<p>Hi Delbert,</p>
<p>Your steps of modifying the primary SMTP address of the synced users are correct.</p>
<p>Based on my knowledge, it might have delay because the information is not synced to Exchange Online directly. It will be synced to Azure AD first and then Azure AD will pass it to Exchange Online. So I suggest you monitor the status for a while.</p>
<p>And you can check the primary addresses for users in Exchange admin center:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to EAC.
</li><li>Navigate to <b>recipients</b> &gt; <b>mailboxes</b>. </li><li>Double click a user and go to <b>email address</b>. </li><li>See whether the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** address is in bold. </li></ol>
<p>If the issue persists after a long time, I want you to do a test by creating a new user account in AD and sync it to Office 365 to see if the same behavior can be reproduced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Henry Huang</p>
