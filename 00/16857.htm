<h2>            OneNote sign in issue</h2>
                    I have onenote through a school account that I use pretty frequently. &nbsp;I am having issues with staying signed in. &nbsp;Every time that I start the application, there is a sync error that requires me to sign in again to sync my notebooks. &nbsp;This is occurring
 in both OneNote for Mac and OneNote for iPad pro. &nbsp;I am not having issues with the notebooks themselves, and the applications still function, but I was wondering if there was anything that I could try that would make it so that I don't have to sign in every
 time I want to use the app.

    <title>Group video call - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Group video call</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>I started having issue with a group video call a couple weeks ago. When I initiated a group call, I can only see the person I first connected with and after I added the other 2 participants, no image appeared on the screen (only voice). I was advised to
 uninstall the program and download a new program which I did. When I made a call last night, the problem wasn't resolved. However, when I was a participant in another group video call, I could see the other participants on the screen. So the problem is only
 when I initiated the call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;<br />

<p>The issue can be with the connection of your contacts. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that your contacts are also using the latest version of Skype and have enough bandwidth for good video quality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they are already using the latest version and still experience the same issue, ask them to uninstall and reinstall their Skype to troubleshoot the issue.</p>

    <title>MS Word Wrap Text Causes Program to Freeze - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chas1stan  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Word Wrap Text Causes Program to Freeze</h2>
                    <p>I'm an Office 365 subscriber and have Office 2016 running the latest updates to Windows 10, as well as the Office programs themselves.&nbsp; I check for updates every day.&nbsp; I do not need to update my programs, just to get this out of the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an embedded Excel spreadsheet in a MS Word doc, as a CPA this is a feature I use a lot, in the last few days after the object (the Excel spreadsheet) is selected and I choose the Text Wrap menu item to set how I want text to wrap, the program freezes
 completely.&nbsp; I have two computers, a desktop and a laptop, and both are completely up to date and running the latest Windows 10 updates and Office updates.&nbsp; The same problem happens on both computers in an identical fashion.&nbsp; Both machines have plenty of RAM,
 and I've made sure nothing else was running and I still have the problem -- as soon as the Excel spreadsheet is selected and the Text Wrap drop down menu is clicked, Word freezes.&nbsp; It EVENTUALLY unfreezes but only after several minutes of waiting, but freezes
 immediately if you try to do the same procedure again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need help.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Insert -- Table -- Excel Spreadsheet</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insert -- Object -- Create New-- Excel Worksheet</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same problem happens when inserted either way, though one can't help but wonder why there are two ways, but that's a conversation perhaps for another day.&nbsp; Ought to work regardless.&nbsp; At any rate, there is a spreadsheet inserted and attempting to make a word
 wrap selection around this object results in the program instantly freezing.</p>

<p>I'd love to try a few different ones, but again, the program freezes before I can see the results of the various settings that are available. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked to see if your installation is having the same problem?&nbsp; It's hard to imagine I'm the only one that this is happening to.&nbsp; I have almost new computers, totally updated software, plenty of RAM, very few other programs installed on the machines.&nbsp;
 Nothing unorthodox in any way.&nbsp; Everything is just very clean.&nbsp; I feel the need to stress this because it makes this whole thing make even less sense than it otherwise might.&nbsp; Again, this is happening identically on two computers, a desktop and a laptop, both
 of which are less than six months old.</p>

<p>Using either of the methods that you mention to insert a spreadsheet into a document, the spreadsheet is inserted In-Line with Text and there is no way of changing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as I asked, what layout are you wanting to apply and how are you trying to apply it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If for some reason you wanted the text to wrap around the spread sheet, you should insert the spreadsheet inside a one cell table and the text wrapping for the table to Around via the Table Properties dialog.</p>

<p>I want to be able to select the wrap-text menu, with an object selected (it crashes with other objects besides an embedded spreadsheet by the way) without the program crashing.&nbsp; If you have thoughts on that, I'd love to hear them otherwise your responses
 are borderline argumentative and are certainly not helpful. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If wrap text around an object isn't available when an embedded object is selected, then Word should gray it out rather than let the user walk into a trap that crashes the program.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This used to work.&nbsp; Now it doesn't.&nbsp; I'm looking for an answer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Embedding the spreadsheet into one cell of a table is an interesting workaround, and it may come down to doing just that, but from 30,000 ft. it screams 'absurd.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take a look below.&nbsp; I do not use LibreOffice.&nbsp; In fact, before I created the item below I had never used it before.&nbsp; I downloaded it and within about three minutes after installation produced what you see below.&nbsp; It should be just as easy, and used to be,
 in Word.&nbsp; Something's changed, and that's what I need help figuring out or MS needs to fix a bug that has somehow been introduced into the code.&nbsp; No computer program is supposed to crash if a user merely selects, or attempts to select, an item in a drop-down
 menu, but again this is precisely what it happening with Word.&nbsp; This is not user error, and I'm not trying to do anything remotely unorthodox.</p>

<p>OK, I found out how to access the Format Object&gt;Layout options, but here, when using a 64-bit installation of Office 365 Proplus, Version 1905 (Build 11629.20246 Click-to-Run), there is no problem when changing the layout options.</p>

    <title>Errors saving emails to a PST file in Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Errors saving emails to a PST file in Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>I just purchased Office 365 moving from Office 2010. Periodically I get a message that an error has been detected in the PST file I am trying to save emails in and it asks me to run the repair tool. I've run the repair tool a couple of times but it still
 will not save them.</p>
<p>Since repairing didnt' work I created a new folder, moved all the contents of the offending folder into the new folder and then moved the new email into the new folder then moved everything in the new folder back to the original folder. After that I can
 save emails to that original folder that had been giving me errors.</p>
<p>Any idea what's going on and how to fix it?</p>
<p>BTW I'm running Windows 7 Pro 64-bit if that matters.</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>Generally, the root cause might be that the original folder structure is corrupt. So you may try to

create a new profile</a> and set up your account in it. Then import the related .pst file again to check if there is any improvement.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Android impossible to remove, causing issues with synchronizing contacts</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last month, we've experienced problems with Outlook for Android not always properly synchronizing contacts.</p>
<p>This was only resolved if we reinstalled the app from the play store, and then toggled synchronize contacts again. It would eventually pull all our contacts back in from our office environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since last week monday, outlook is starting to show up as a device manager app, meaning we can only disable the app, not uninstall it. This is happening despite the fact Outlook is NOT set as a device manager app, and does not have any further access
 or special access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is occurring on Motorola G5S and G7 devices. I have checked all permissions for the app, and none are toggled. Despite this, we can't remove the app on many of our devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To offer a comparison, we use Sophos Device Control (which actually IS a device managing app). We are able to uninstall this by removing all permissions and restarting the device. Outlook still gives the message that it is a 'system' app, not a device manager,
 so something else is going wrong with the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, to summarize, for some reason Outlook for Android is being registered as a system app, not a device manager app, meaning that we can't uninstall it from our devices despite any application settings. This is mostly occuring on Motorola G5S devices.</p>
<p />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I mentioned, outlook is not set as a device manager/administrator app. Nor are any other permissions applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I explained, outlook mentions that it is a system-app, rather than the notifications you would expect if it was set as a device administrator.</p>

<h2>            Planner bug&#58; Old deleted task still assigned and sending me late reminder emails daily</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use Microsoft Planner and a task was created to respond to a client about a proposal.&nbsp; Somehow this task got bugged and was duplicated: one version of the task I could open but the other I could not, therefore I could not remove people from the bugged
 task and I also could not mark it as complete.&nbsp; So I just deleted it and kept the task that worked.&nbsp; However now I get constant reminders that I have an out of date task and I can't seem to sort it out in any way.&nbsp; How can I solve this problem?&nbsp; I tried contacting
 Microsoft but my account doesn't allow support apparently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Equation editor for word</h2>
                    <p>(1)On my own PC I had been using Word 2016. I know that MS no longer supports Eq. Editor 3.0 and I installed the source program Math Type (paid version!).</p>
<p>(2)I was visiting someone who has Word 2016 (Windows 10), they have the Equation Editor and it works OK&nbsp; I thought Eq. Editor should no longer work???</p>
<p>[I clicked "insert", "Eq. Editor", the full menu I <em>used</em> to have appears.]</p>
<p>(3)I just upgraded to Word 2019, but I can't get LaTex to work, you need the Eq. Editor to get the proper interface, which I don't have.</p>
<p>I'm confused???</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />The reason you are confused is because it is confusing.
<br />
<br />1. You can continue to use your MathType as far as I know.
<br />2. Word did change its Equation Editor and as far as I can tell it is not as capable as the paid MathType that you already have.
<br />3. Word's new Equation Editor cannot edit old equations.
<br />
<br />The old Equation Editor was based on an abbreviated version of the commercial product MathType, the program you have apparently paid for.
<br /><a href="http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/</a>
<br />
<br />Here is a link to Microsoft's page on the new Equation Editor.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Equation-Editor-6eac7d71-3c74-437b-80d3-c7dea24fdf3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Equati...</a>
<br />
<br />Using MathType as a workaround with old equations is suggested on this Microsoft Page:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4057882/error-when-editing-an-equation-in-office" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/405788...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />

    <title>Unable to Connect Outlook Mail Using Outlook Client - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pappybe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Connect Outlook Mail Using Outlook Client</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since a specific time this morning, I cannot connect to my Outlook (Live/Hotmail) mail address using my Outlook 2016 client, getting continual authentication prompts. This is occurring on two separate devices using the Outlook client. As a coincidence the
 Samsung mail app on my Android phone also stopped at this same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly the Outlook app on my phone still continues to work, the Windows 10 mail app still works and I can log in to Outlook.com OK. The problem seems to be specific to the Outlook (Office) client and mail app on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anything changed, or are there any issues at the backend?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, JB</p>

<p>Hi Kris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes as mentioned I am using Outlook 2016. Interestingly the same thing happened today for about 4 hours and then came back to life again. This is now the 3rd time this has happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using eas.outlook.com as the mail server on the two mail clients in question (Outlook 2016 on Windows 10) and the native Email app on Android (Edge 7, app version 4.0.70-0). Is this the recommended mail server for an Outlook/Hotmail address?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Rachelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly the issue has happened twice again today - happening right now as a coincidence. It seems to be a Friday thing!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two different&nbsp; Windows 10 devices, running Office versions Version 1705 (Build 8201.2102 Click-to-Run) and Version 1704 (Build 8067.2115 Click-to-Run), both experiencing the same scenario in Outlook. As mentioned, also of interest is the in-built
 Windows 10 Mail app works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re the configuration, as mentioned it is setup as Exchange Active Sync using&nbsp;eas.outlook.com as the mail server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default mail app on my Android device (Samsung Edge 7) is setup exactly the same way (Active Sync and eas.outlook.com) and that has stopped as well. The Outlook app on my Android does work, so as mentioned before it looks to be isolated to Active Sync</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>

<p>Outlook.com has not utalised EAS for some time, any Outlook.com mail account added to MS Outlook 2016 should have been added using the auto setup page where only the mail address &amp; user name is used, the account would be verified as Exchange, not EAS.</p>
<p>There may be extra hoops to jump through, if in the web access Outlook.com settings page you have set two step authentication</p>

    <title>How to force rows in a table to have a specified height - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomporter3  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to force rows in a table to have a specified height</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working with a table that has both Japanese and English text in it. I'm noticing that when I type in Japanese, that row comes out a bit taller than rows that have only English or have nothing in them. I want to force all of the rows to have the same
 height as the one used in the Japanese rows, but for some reason checking the "specify height" box makes things go crazy. Let me explain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is a picture of the table in question:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59b47f97-4256-4d29-8b74-25266a0bc316?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59b47f97-4256-4d29-8b74-25266a0bc316?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note how the blank rows are smaller than the ones with text (of course the one with two lines is bigger still). When I click on one of the rows with Japanese in it, it says it's 0.6'' tall, also seen above. So I figure I can set all the rows to be that height
 and things will line up properly, right? </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d3ce38a-9812-4fa3-9dcc-b0558f3f171e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d3ce38a-9812-4fa3-9dcc-b0558f3f171e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Well, if I do, this happens:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d871869e-2abc-4649-8c60-197f72cee4e8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d871869e-2abc-4649-8c60-197f72cee4e8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>???????????&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea why it's acting this way? I'm rather lost at this point...</p>

            <p>If I understand correctly you want a dropdown in the ribbon which will have a bunch of items in it and when you click on one of them, it will insert some pre-defined text at the cursor position? If that is what you want, you can do that with a macro using
 the Onetastic addin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://omeratay.com/onetastic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://omeratay.com/onetastic</a></li><li>Download the Onetastic addin, and install it (pay attention to 32 bit vs. 64 bit)</li><li>Start OneNote</li><li>Click on New Macro button on the Home tab</li><li>Click on Import</li><li>Paste the following:</li></ol>
<p>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&lt;Macro name="Goal 1" category="Goals" description="Insert Goal 1"&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ModifyVar name="TextToInsert" op="set" value="Goal 1" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;For first="Text"&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;That hasProp="selected" op="eq" value="true" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ModifyVar name="TextToInsertAndSpace" op="set" var="TextToInsert" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ModifyVar name="TextToInsertAndSpace" op="add" value=" " /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ModifyProp name="value" op="set" var="TextToInsertAndSpace" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/For&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;For each="Text"&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;That hasProp="selected" op="eq" value="true" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;That hasProp="value" op="eq" var="TextToInsert" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ModifyProp name="selected" op="set" value="false" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/For&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&lt;/Macro&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Click OK then Save, then close the Macro window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you will have a drop down named Goals, and Goal 1 under it, clicking on it will insert Goal 1&nbsp;at the cursor position. To change the inserted text, edit the pasted XML where it says Goal 1 (in three places) and put the goal text you want. To add more
 of these, change the XML again and create new macros. You need to create macros once, and then you will have your dropdown there forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this is what you want and if that works for you or not.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge download issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been receiving the following problem ever since we upgraded to Windows 10. This issue is not replicated in I.E 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I try to download an excel file using edge it begins by downloading a partial file, this partial file also appears in my download folder during the time which the file is being downloaded. You can see this in the image below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf21d4df-356b-46a9-9029-cd65aaed91a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf21d4df-356b-46a9-9029-cd65aaed91a2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once the file is downloaded however, the file is renamed in my downloads file and If I click on the open button, it states that the file is missing and/or has been removed. However, when I look in the view downloads tab in edge, it states that the file is
 missing and/or has been removed. I then cannot click on this download.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I can open the file if I move into my downloads folder. This happens on every page where I try to download an excel file.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Quickly review sent E-Mails that have not been replied to&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I send an e-mail I would like some indication in my sent history that that e-mail was replied to by the recipient. &nbsp;For instance, I send around 25 -50 e-mails per day which require the recipient to respond to me. &nbsp;As you can imagine, keeping track of
 what I sent and if it was responded to becomes a pretty big undertaking when people don't respond immediately. &nbsp;Is there any way to see this without having to look for similar items in the converstaion on each e-mail?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this makes sense and I appreciate your prompt answer!</p>

</p><p>Having an indication displayed on your sent emails when the recipient has already responded to it is definitely helpful for your tracking purposes. We encourage you share it with us by sending a feedback

<p>Hello Shelly,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I'd like to share with you is that if you configured your email account to Outlook with IMAP/POP, you calendars and contacts will not be synced to the new Outlook Client. So before you are trying to check the details of calendars and contacts, please
 use your email account to sign into the email web app to check if you could find your calendar and contacts entries there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example your account is Office 365 account, you can sign into&nbsp;<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/owa/</a>&nbsp;and have a look there.&nbsp; If you can see your calendar and contacts entries
 there, please go back to your Outlook Client to check if you have configured your email account as IMAP/POP via clicking File &gt; Account Settings, if so, you need to change back to Exchange. In general we can directly use email account and password to sign
 into Outlook without using Manually Setup to achieve it, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it is helpful for you</p>

<h2>            retrieve emails from external hard drive  WD my book elite</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was getting a new laptop from my employer and wanted to back up all the data off my old laptop&gt; I purchased a WD my book elite external drive.</p>
<p>Plugged it into my old computer and backed all my files up including outlook emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have my new laptop now, running wondows 7 , I needed an old email so I plugged in my external drive found the back up files opened them .</p>
<p>Pictures , old desk top, documents all open fine. The outlook files sent and recived will not open. The error message says they must be opened in OUTLOOK. I have 11 gigs of old emails , I do not want all that data on my new laptop .&nbsp; Just need to find 1
 old email . I called WD and they said my email setting have to be changed so the new laptop will see the email files. I see them on my screen but can't open them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I just change my OUTLOOK setting to see the WD mybook drive and select the email I need?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks ,</p>

            Do you have Outlook installed on the new machine? If you don't, you need to. Outlook stores data in a Personal Folders file, this is what should have been backed up and is what you need to open. From within Outlook, "File&gt;Open&gt;Outlook Data File", navigate
 to your old Personal Folders (.PST) file, select it and click OK. The folder set will appear in Outlook, you can go get the email you need, then close the file when finished. If the file won't open, check to make sure it was not set to READ ONLY status when
 it was backed up; right click the file, select "Properties", and remove the check mark from the "Read-Only" check box, if you find one there. More info on the process is here:<br />

            It doesn't matter where they are stored, you still need Outlook installed on the PC in order to open them. You would open the PST file from Outlook, view the data you are interested in, then close the PST file.<br />

<h2>            Outlook email does not download attachments</h2>
                    My Hotmail has just been upgraded to Outlook and in Safari 5.1.7 on OSX 10.6.8 if you click on an attachment to download it then literally nothing happens but some error is shown in the Activity window: "A server with the specified hostname could not be..."
 (that is all that it shows). &nbsp;Firefox 19.0 has the same problem. &nbsp;So I can no longer download attachments, which is not very helpful.

            One cause for this is when you restarted, MS did an update. But the update wasn't completely successful. When you logged in this time, you were logged in to a "temporary profile" on the computer.  HEre are some possible fixes:

            1. First see whether they are installed or not. To check this type Excel or Word or PowerPoint in Windows search and see whether they come up or not. If yes, they can be pinned by right clicking on them.
<br />
<br />2. Start Excel &gt; CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to open Task Manager &gt; In Processes tab, right click on Excel &gt; Open File Location &gt; See whether Word.exe and Excel.exe and Powerpoint.exe and other MS Office product exe are there or not. If they are there, right click &gt; Create shortcut and pin the shortcut 
<br />
<br />3. Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)

<h2>            Lumia 925 not showing contact informatio&#8203;n for incoming calls</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife has a new Nokia Lumia 925. Previous to that she had a Nokia Lumia 800. She is using the same micro-SIM card she used with Lumia 800. Back when she owned Lumia 800 she imported all SIM contacts to her Microsoft account. The new Lumia 925 is configured
 to use the same Microsoft account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From time to time her Lumia 925 does not show contact information for incoming calls. It acts like the number that's calling is not present in the contacts list. But my wife knows for sure that those numbers are in the contacts list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my wife accesses the call history it takes some time for the names to be displayed. For a few seconds the call history contains only phone numbers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If my wife restarts her phone it works fine for about one day. Today for example she received two phone calls from the same person. For the first call the log displays the caller name. For the second call the log displays only the phone number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please tell me what I can do to fix this problem. I already advised my wife to try to reimport all SIM contacts although they were previously imported in her Microsoft account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Cosmin G. Petrenciuc,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you have an issue with your contact information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can&nbsp;be an issue with the mobile phone operator, when you buy a phone from a mobile phone operator, depending on the&nbsp;network&nbsp;settings sometimes it can prevent the user&nbsp;to see the contact information;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is an article where people have encountered
 the same issue on the forum: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wpgroups/contact-name-display-problem/8c6001db-120a-41c3-9188-7409f036aaa1">

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Its is also suggested to put in front of the numbers the country code and see if this can help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions but I don't think the problem is related to my network operator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previous to Nokia Lumia 925&nbsp;my wife&nbsp;used a Nokia Lumia 800 and&nbsp;she have never experienced this problem. Nokia Lumia 800 was unlocked. Nokia Lumia 925 was bought with a subsidy from&nbsp;her network operator (Orange Romania).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife&nbsp;hasn't changed&nbsp;her micro-SIM card when&nbsp;she upgraded from Lumia 800 to Lumia 925.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further more, the phone works fine for a few days. It displays contact information for incoming calls. And then, after 3-4 days, all the sudden, it stops displaying contact information for the same callers for whom yesterday the information was displayed.
 For instance I called my wife yesterday and the phone displayed my picture and my name. I called my wife today and the phone didn't displayed my picture and my name. It displayed only the phone number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem is not related to only a short list of phone numbers. When the phone stops displaying names it does it for all incoming calls. Also, the names are not displayed neither in the call log.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife has to restart the phone in order to make it show the names of the callers.</p>

            <p>Based on the information you've provided (same SIM card, works intermittently), it would seem to be more likely a problem with the way the cellular provider is sending 'caller ID' information to your phone along with the connection stream.&nbsp; Perhaps they
 are using differing formats depending upon the source of the call??&nbsp; (Don't know).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 'stall' when your wife looks at the call history could be a clue though, since this is (as far as I know) stored directly on the phone and should be almost instanteous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing to think about might be the number of contacts stored on the SIM card.&nbsp; If there are lot of them, that might be contributing to the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thinking there might be some sort of memory fragmentation/corruption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to hard reset the phone.&nbsp; All her contacts should remain the same or be re-downloadable from the SIM card, so you should be OK there.&nbsp; She should also sync her contacts to her Microsoft account, so they can be downloaded from there
 as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, immediately after the hard reset and reconnection to her Microsoft account, re-import the contacts and see if the problem persists (without adding any of her added applications).&nbsp; If everything is OK, start adding apps one by one to see if any of them
 are causing the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem is still there immediately after hard reset, then it's most likely are hardware fault and you should contact the phone supplier for repair/replacement.</p>

            <p>Hello Don,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the recommendations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already did a restore to factory settings. After that I connected my wife's phone to her Microsoft account and her contacts have been re-downloaded. Also I have re-imported her SIM contacts as well.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a while (5 days I think) everything seemed to be OK. But today the issue reappeared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her SIM does not contain a lot of contacts. There are&nbsp;about 100 contacts on the SIM card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now I have finished reorganizing her contacts from Microsoft account. There were duplicated phone numbers and duplicated names. Also I've added country prefix to all the phone numbers from her Microsoft account. Maybe this will fix this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll have to monitor her phone&nbsp;for the following days. If she does not restarts her phone&nbsp;I should have an answer in about 5 days or less.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I'm considering changing her SIM card with a new one, one&nbsp;which does not contain any contacts at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll keep you posted on the progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Cosmin Petrenciuc</p>

            <p>After I reorganized my wife's contact list&nbsp;by&nbsp;eliminating all duplicates (phone numbers and/or names) the call log seems to be working correctly.&nbsp;Now it is showing &nbsp;names for all calls in the log. Before that I was having the situation in which my morning
 call was identified (my name was displayed in call log), and my evening call, made from the same number was not identified and the call log was just showing my phone number. On the same call log page there was my phone number&nbsp;with my name on it and the same
 phone number without my name on it. Now this issue seems to have been resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in order to make the phone identify the caller, I had to restart the phone this morning. So&nbsp;reorganizing&nbsp;the contact list didn't solve the problem. After the phone was restarted, my test call made&nbsp;from the same number as&nbsp;2 minutes earlier&nbsp;was identified
 correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will keep monitoring my wife's phone for the following days but I'm expecting to exhibit the same strange behavior after several days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to be clear, in these days my wife didn't installed any new app, didn't add any new contacts. She just received phone calls and SMS, checked her two GMail accounts, and her Facebook account. And took a few pictures. So nothing extraordinary. She doesn't
 play games oh her phone, and she browse the Internet with moderation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you have any other suggestions about what I can do to solve this problem, those will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

Yesterday something strange happened.I had a chat with MS support and they advised me to change all numbers with 009xx in the country code to simply 9xx.This solved the issue for incoming calls ,but obviously outgoing stopped working as the country code is
 wrong.So just for trial I changed 9xx to&nbsp; +9xx and amazingly it started working.I exported my google contacts to excel and repalced all 009xx,009-xx etc&nbsp; with +9xx and imported back to google and synced again to phone.Now it is OK I think.But will have to
 observe for sometime.For some people it stops working intermittently.In other Windows versions there used to be editable registry to solve this issue ,but now either Nokia or MS has locked down registry (as per XDA threads).<br />

            I've entered country code (+40) to all numbers in the contacts list. So far the phone is working, but it is too early to tell. Only 48 hours have past from the last restart.

                    <p>I am completely stumped on this. I have done an entire days worth of research on similar problems other people have, but I can't seem to get the formulas to work. I have a worksheet that I need to count how many unique text string values are contained in
 a column if the text on another cell in that row CONTAINS certain text. Here is my example:</p>

<p>What we are searching for is how many&nbsp;<strong>unique</strong>&nbsp;<u>Voyage</u> numbers are in the column and where
<u>Cargo Desc</u> contains&nbsp;'Direct Consign', regardless if 'Loaded' or&nbsp;'Discharged' accompanies it. In this example. the answer is 4.&nbsp; There is about 6,000 lines of this data and I am looking for a formula to calculate this instead of using filters and manually
 counting. I truly appreciate the help that anyone can give me.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Try this ARRAY formula , see below on how to enter an ARRAY formula.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have assumed this data are in columns A thru G.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>=COUNT(1/FREQUENCY(IF(LEFT($A$1:$A$7000,14)="Direct Consign",IF($C$1:$C$7000&lt;&gt;"",MATCH($C$1:$C$7000,$C$1:$C$7000,0))),ROW($C$1:$C$7000)-ROW($C$1)+1))</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is an array formula which must be entered by pressing CTRL+Shift+Enter<br />
and not just Enter. If you do it correctly then Excel will put curly brackets<br />
around the formula {}. You can't type these yourself. If you edit the formula<br />
you must enter it again with CTRL+Shift+Enter.</p>

            <p>This is awesome! I plugged it in and it seemed like it worked for what I described. But I accidently left out an extra condition. In addition to the first column having to&nbsp;contain 'Direct Consign', it also must contain 'Containerized' in the next column.
 After that is when I need the count for unique values in the third. Will you please see my edited example below and help me?</p>

            <p>Hey Mike,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm really close with this. I manually&nbsp;filtered out all of the information like I always do&nbsp;to get the exact count of unique returns, which according to Excel, is 68. I plugged in your formula verbatim, ensured that all cell references matched up and the
 function was set into an array. However, the count I receive from your formula is 55. I have since tinkered around, checked and double checked that all values in the formula line up with what I have on the spreadsheet. Any other additions or suggestions? Below
 is a copy of what I have. I slightly modified&nbsp;the first column because it would otherwise be too large for this message.&nbsp;The '55' off to the side is the cell that I have the function plugged into.</p>

            You might want to take another look at your 68 entries. I modified my suggested formula for
<i>contains&nbsp;DC</i>&nbsp;rather than the original <i>is DC</i>&nbsp;and I came up with 55 from your newest sample date.

<div><br />
<div>The <i>standard formula</i> in H2 is,</div>
<div><br />
<div>=SUMPRODUCT(ISNUMBER(FIND($E$2,$A$2:$A$999))*($B$2:$B$999=$F$2)/COUNTIF($C$2:$C$999,$C$2:$C$999&amp;""))</div>
<div><br />
<div>The <i>array formula</i> in G2 is,</div>
<div><br />
<div>=IFERROR(INDEX($C$2:$C$999,MATCH(0,IF(ISNUMBER(FIND($E$2,$A$2:$A$999)), IF($B$2:$B$999=$F$2,COUNTIFS($G$1:$G1,$C$2:$C$999),1),1),0)),"")</div>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not now sure what we're looking for in Col A but assume that we can use the first 2 characters DC as our criteria.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If we do that with the ARRAY formula below then it returns 55 unique entries from the 68 records. This can be verified by using the remove duplicates function in Excel that also detects 55 unique values.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>=COUNT(1/FREQUENCY(IF(LEFT($A$1:$A$7000,2)="DC",IF($C$1:$C$7000&lt;&gt;"",IF(B1:B7000="Containerized",MATCH($C$1:$C$7000,$C$1:$C$7000,0)))),ROW($C$1:$C$7000)-ROW($C$1)+1))</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If that doesn't return the value you expect to get then I think we need to see the data. You can upload a copy of the workbook to skydrive and post the link here.</p>
