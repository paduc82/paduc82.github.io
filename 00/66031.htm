<h2>            WD Passport &#40;Ext HDD&#41; Fatal Error Please Help Urgent</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am trying to back up my computer files so I can transfer them to another CP I haven't acquired yet. So I have no data on my HDD and don't care if it gets wiped/formatted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I am having is that in "Computer Management &gt; Storage &gt; Disk Management", my external Hard Drive is seen as "Unknown" and Not Initialized, as seen below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8882e0cf-aa6c-4dfd-9a1c-cd96565fa7c5" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have looked through MANY sources online to try to fix this problem, but they haven't worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to "Initialize Disk" by right clicking it, using the MBR (Master Boot Record) partition style gives the error of "fatal device hardware error". Also, using the GPT (GUID Partition Table) style gives the error of "specified disk is not
 convertible because the size is less than minimum size required for GPT disks".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't care how this is solved and what is wiped, but can someone please suggest a solution for me? I will be very grateful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further information: earlier in the day when I connected the ext HDD it worked fine, I reformatted it and it passed the WD tests (status of drive, complete drive test). I backed up everything but when I tried to open the files on the hard drive,
 it was extremely laggy and then a fatal error occurred. Now it won't even pass the first simple test. 2 days ago while my drive was connected to the computer my power went out, maybe this had something to do with it? But if it was the power outage at fault,
 I could still back up all my files today until it stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me if you can I will be very grateful :)<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

&nbsp;Hello there, </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I'm sorry to hear that you are experiencing such issues with your drive. Since this is a USB drive the first thing you need to check is the USB cable. Please make sure you are using the cable supplied with your WD My Passport and also test with another short
 USB 3.0 cable. Make sure the external HDD is connected directly to one of the USB ports on the back of the case and not through a USB hub.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
If none of that helps you might need to run the WD DLG diagnostics again. From your explanation it seems that the problem is either with a misbehaving cable or the HDD itself. Keep me posted. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            virtual hard disk disappeared after reboot</h2>
                    I created a VHD to install an ISO package. the install required a reboot. Now I can't see the VHD. Did the space in the physical HD get recovered or is it gone for good?

    <title>surface arc mouse simultanious clicking - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            surface arc mouse simultanious clicking</h2>
                    <p>Hello to all Microsoft hard workers. I wish you all good health. I have a serious problem with my arc mouse which I have bought with a very expensive price in my country. I have figured out the right click and the middle click settings and I guess I have
 to live with it. Though the main issue is clicking both left and right clicks for game purposes. For example aiming and then shooting. I tried pushing the buttons at the utmost end of both sides of the mouse. And I'm sure the driver is OK. Because everything
 else works perfect. I ask you to please give me detailed instructions about doing this. It's the only surface product I probably can buy for my entire life and I really hate to be disappointed about this. Thank you all.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>SAJ</p>

<p>RA: Looks like you have allowed "three finger click" to be Search. &nbsp;<strong> What else are you allowed to do there?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>SD: If you look closely there is scrolling options underneath witch also doesn't have related options to simultaneous clicks.
</p>

<p>
</p><p>I was looking at the Search <strong>link.&nbsp; </strong>Typically it would lead somewhere which would allow you to create a macro and tie it to a modified button press.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, I can only see a way to tie the macro to the button press, not have a modified button press.&nbsp; Too bad.&nbsp; However, just because it is not documented does not mean it may not be possible; so I would try digging deeper into the implementation to see
 if it is possible.&nbsp; Certainly it would be possible to create a Click Both macro and use it only for one particular app, which may be all that you would need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck</p>

<p>

<h2>            Cod WWII refuses to work on my xbox 1</h2>
                    I've been been trying for months to get ww2 to work on my xbox 1 and no matter what I do or try I just end up staring at a black screen that never actually loads into the game. &nbsp;I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, deleting data, switching pretty
 much anything I can think of. At this point I feel like giving up and trying to get a refund.&nbsp;

<p>Hey there Jordan!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about the funky issue you're dealing with. </p>
<p>For a variety of issues including games not starting up the way that they are supposed to, then the first thing that I'd try in your position if to try the steps here on “<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/game-freeze-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">My
 Xbox One game won’t start or freezes during gameplay</a>” and see if that helps out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work , then I would try what we call a soft reset. </p>

<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>It's
 a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 make sure that before you go ahead with it, that you do know all of the sign-in information for any/all of your accounts (as they will get removed )&nbsp;and have easy access to your internet network.

<br />Can you use Keyboard tester and press these keys to see if these keys are physically fit?
<br />
<br /><a href="https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html</a>
<br />
<br />If the key is physically fit - Note sure what steps you have already tried. Hence, I might repeat steps -
<br />
<br />1. Run Keyboard Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down and click Keyboard &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall Keyboard Driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Keyboards &gt; Right click on Standard PS/2 Keyboard &gt; Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer to reinstall

<h2>            Changing User name cause problems, Cannot change desktop background image</h2>
                    My operating system is windows 7 ultimate.<br />
Once I changed the user name using the facility in "Control Panel\User Accounts and Family Safety\User Accounts\Change Your Name". But it didn't affected all the user files in the computer. Some were changed, some didn't. After that I got some problems in several
 applications like mozilla firefox, etc. when Firefox restarted it opens all tabs which were opened before that situation. I removed firefox and reinstalled but it didn't run anymore. Then I edited registry and got that problem solved. But some other problems
 remained. I changed user name again and kept earlier one but it didn't make any change.<br />
Some of those problems are as follows.<br />
<ul>
<li>Some applications are giving error messages when windows starts and shuts down
</li><li>I cannot change desktop background any how (Theme is changing but desktop images don't apply.it remains what it were on that moment which I changed user name.) Only thing I can do is change picture position.
</li></ul>
Please help to solve those problems.<br />

I created a "Policies" key and "ActiveDesktop" under&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic">
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ActiveDesktop\ and </span>
then DWORD NoChangingWallPaper with a value of "0". After reboot , I still can't change background.

Now my switch user option also doesn't work<br />

    <title>Missing Boot Manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garethooo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Boot Manager</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span><span>I'm running Vista on a 3-year old Dell Dimension E521.<br />
Suddenly it won't boot (goes to "Windows Error Recovery"), and safe mode doesn't start either. From the Boot Device Menu the option "bootable hard drive" reports that<strong>"BOOTMGR is missing".</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>I've tried to repair using the Vista installation CD. I select the language/time/keyboard options, then "repair your computer" this gives
 me "System Recovery Options" but it fails to find an installed operating system (the list titled Operating System/Partition Size/Location is empty).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The</span><span><strong>SYSTEM RECOVERY MENU</strong> then gives the following options :-<br />
Startup Repair<br />
System Restore<br />
Windows complete PC restore<br />
Windows memory diagnostic tool<br />
Command prompt</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>STARTUP REPAIR eventually reports "Windows cannot repair this computer automatically". under "problem details" it reports<strong>"Problem
 signature 06 : MissingBootManager"</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>SYSTEM RESTORE fails with the message "to perform an offline System Restore you must specify which Windows installation you would like to
 restore"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>WINDOWS MEMORY DIAGNOSTIC TOOL reports "Windows cannot check for memory problems. A problem is preventing Windows from checking for memory
 problems during startup"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I've checked the boot sequence in the BIOS, and it is correct.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I have seen other similar problems reported (www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/fixing-bootmgr-is-missing-error-while-trying-to-boot-windows-vista)and
 the suggested solution was to try :-</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>X:\ Sources&gt;bootrec/fixboot<br />
</strong>However this gives the error message "incorrect function" from the COMMAND PROMPT.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I got some advice to get to<span>system recovery menu by trying :-</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></p>
<p><span>at the command prompt. However this failed with the message :-</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>“Beginning system scan. This process will take some time.<br />
Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Next I tried Microsoft (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927391</a>). Their Method 2 (rebuild the BCD store
 by using Bootrec.exe tool) failed at the first hurdle, typing <strong>Bootrec /RebuildBcd</strong>at the command prompt gave the message :-</span></p>
<p><span>“successfully scanned Windows installations. Total identified Windows installations : 0”</span></p>
<p><span>(it was supposed to find a Windows installation path)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Their Method 3 (Rebuild the BCD store manually by using the Bcdedit.exe tool) also failed at the first hurdle, typing<strong>cd /d c:/Windows/System32</strong>
 at the command prompt gave the message :-</span></p>
<p><span>“The system cannot find the file specified”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Can you help me ?</span></p>
<p><span>I would be extremely grateful&nbsp;- I'm out of ideas !</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Some of these you have tried however here is the complete troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;serious error and "may" not be repairable without professional tech support from<br />
a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox Stores) or your<br />
System maker's Support.<br />
<br />
Here are the troubleshooting methods to try to fix the issue :<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>
<p>This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or use a Vista Disk<br />

System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already own Windows. Also you<br />
can make a repair disk on another computer.<br />

<p>Hi Rebecca,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Resource and Performance Monitor Stuck at Collecting Data</h2>
                    I'm having trouble with this program that I need to use to help with another problem I posted on the forums. Basically it says collecting data for 60 seconds and doesn't seem to want to generate the report. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
 I've waited as long as 4 hours for it to work and it doesn't seem it will. Anybody got any suggestions.

<h2>            Error downloading Netflix, Hulu plus and various other apps</h2>
                    I just installed Windows 10 on my PC and I want to download Netflix and Hulu apps, but I am receiving an error saying to try again and its giving me this error code:&nbsp;0x803F70003. I have restarted my computer, reset the app store, searched online for any
 fixes or troubleshooting and have found nothing and nothing has worked. I really don't want to have to revert back to Windows 7 because 10 is neat, but I don't want to have an app feature if I can't download any apps. Apps that are already installed onto the
 system that came with the OS updated and downloaded with no problem, so why can't new apps be downloaded? Please help!

<h3> bernardmarquardt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fax modem and fax service</h2>
                    Hi there. Got a Conexant USB modem CX93010 ACF. Yesterday, after the upgrade to Win 10, I was able to receive faxes, but there is no log being kept, no faxes saved as it was with Win 8.1. It just prints them out. Today it does no longer receive them. Sending
 has not been possible. When I go into the configuration for Windows Fax and Scan, Fax settings detects the modem and shows its name. But fax accounts tells me I need to connect to a Fax. That's fine, but it just shows fax modem, and it is grayed out. So I
 cannot change or edit anything there. So far I have stopped fax service in windows and restarted it; I have uninstalled the modem and reinstalled it in device manager. No changes. What else can I do? &nbsp;

<h2>            Wallpaper names.</h2>
                    Is there any way known to be able to add the picture name on the desktop with the wallpaper changer that is in windows 7, whenever the wallpaper changes to the next one or will I have to get a third party wallpaper changer to get that feature.

<h2>            I have an acer aspire 5542g windows 7 home premiumx 64 32 bit with black screen on startup</h2>
                    I have a black screen on startup. &nbsp;I am unable to try to boot up into anything as I cannot see anything from the get go. &nbsp;You can hear everything going but only have power light. I have checked the Acer website and it seems that alot of people are saying
 it could be a bios problem,but there are 3 different files to download, how do I know which one it is? &nbsp;I made all of my backup and recovery disks but cannot see anything to know what is going on. &nbsp;Anyone with any ideas? It sure is nice once your warranty
 is up know one wants to help you anymore.

Why is my screen black when I start Windows 7?<br />

<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7. <br />
<br />
</strong>Saving any needed data and re-installing Windows 7 might be the best<br />
option though here are a few others.</p>
<p>You can save your files by putting the drive in another computer or an <br />
external drive case and then backing them up. Do so using several <br />
methods in a redundant manner. Of course a real computer shop or <br />
your System maker can help recover the files.<br />
<br />
Or you could use an Ubuntu boot CD to back up the data.<br />
<br />
Use Ubuntu Live CD to Backup Files from Your Dead Windows Computer <br />
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer</a><br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - Double
<br />
Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver - then Right Click on <br />
Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
A method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;<br />
and Safe Mode) is to CTRL + ALT + DEL - Task Manager and on <br />
Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - <br />
then on Applications&nbsp;Tab - lower right - New Task - type in<br />
EXPLORER.exe. Safe Mode is reached by repeatedly tapping F8<br />
as you boot up. CTRL + SHIFT + ESC also starts Task Manager.<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back<br />
to this thread.</p>

<p>Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is <br />
usually on a hit or miss basis. That there is no information on a black<br />
screen like there is on a blue screen just adds to the difficulty. Often <br />
using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect.<br />
<br />
You can try a google to see suggested repairs some of which have <br />
worked however these cover a wide field of efforts.</p>
<p>Here is a video of one fix.</p>

<br />
Do you have a&nbsp;Window 7&nbsp;Disk? You can try System Restore from it. <br />
If you do not have the disks your system maker will sell them cheap. <br />
Or try from Safe Mode if you can get there.<br />

You can create a Recovery Disk or use someone else's same version<br />
(to do the System Restore it only has to be bootable).<br />

<h2>            Low Battery Shut Down Lenovo During Windows 10 Updates</h2>
                    Lenovo laptop with Win 10 upgrade&nbsp;hadn't been turned on for a while. My customer started it up and it began doing the Windows updates. She didn't realize that the laptop was unplugged, and the laptop ran low on battery power. She plugged it in and restarted.
 Now it won't go past the Lenovo screen. There isn't a rescue drive. Any recommendations?

    <title>Xbox One controller disconnects after plugging in headphones to 3.5mm - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seantoomey_original  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One controller disconnects after plugging in headphones to 3.5mm jack</h2>
                    
<p>Whenever I try plugging in any headphones to the 3.5mm jack on the bottom of the controller, it disconnects from the wireless adapter after ten to twenty seconds. It will not reconnect until I unplug the headphones and cycle the wireless adapter by unplugging
 it and plugging it back in. All of my drivers are up to date and I have the latest controller firmware. I am able to use headphones with the controller when it is plugged in via USB, but I find it really annoying that I can't use the headphone jack and the
 wireless adapter at the same time. Is there any way to fix this?</p>
<p>Xbox one controller model: 1697</p>
<p>Firmware version: 2.3.2385.0&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wireless adapter for windows model: 1713</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>&nbsp; After some experimenting, I found that the only thing that works is a headset with a TRRS (tip ring ring sleeve) plug. However, this only works if I don't set the USB audio out as the default, then switch it over after about 30 seconds. Anything with a
 TRS plug causes my controller to instantly crash... This makes no sense since I can use my normal headphones when the controller is tethered via USB without any problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I am guessing that I'm the only one with this issue since I have spent the better part of two days looking for a solution. As far as I can tell, there isn't one. This is a problem that Microsoft really needs to look into.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Oh. After I was able to somewhat get the controller to work with headphones, the drivers freaked out and my pc crashed about 45 seconds later...With that, I give up. Looks like I'm sticking with the tethered connection for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h2>            No Wireless or Sound</h2>
                    <div>Dear Sirs,</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 30, 2017 nighttime EST my computer suddenly lost wireless connection and sound. Other computers can still connect to the home router so it is not the router or modem, only my PC is affected. The list of available networks shows nothing,
 usually it would show my router plus several in the area but now nothing. I get no sound at all either.</div>
<div>
<p>Below are screenshots, the first is what I get instead of the usual wireless icon indicating signal strength I have never seen before.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33d06336-1cd0-4424-bd2d-90d92d6bc792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33d06336-1cd0-4424-bd2d-90d92d6bc792" /></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The second is the speaker icon marked for no sound, it will not turn on. I have tried my speakers, headphones and external mic, nothing, I get a box from Windows Audio Service that No Audio Devices are installed though there are.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9f2b918-4c42-4711-a2e5-f1f2c3c0a5b7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9f2b918-4c42-4711-a2e5-f1f2c3c0a5b7" /></a></p>
</div>
<div><br />
I had to send this from the local library since my service is out.<br />
I tried reinstalling the Wireless, Ethernet and Audio Drivers from backup but nothing works.</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you’ve encountered regarding the network connection and sound on your Windows 10 computer may be caused by some configuration or programs that prevent Windows from working properly. To sort out your concern, we suggest that you
<strong>run System File Checker (SFC) tool</strong> to scan and correct if there’s a possible integrity violation on the system. To do this, you may follow the steps provided on this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="System File Checker (SFC) tool">link</a></strong></em>. Once you’re on the page,

<p>Mr. Ban,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried it, still not working. I tried a few times in different ways, I even tried using a physical cable to connect the computer to the router, still the same problem. Device Manager shows the Audio and Bluetooth devices as faulty as seen in the screenshots
 below. I also went to the website of the company that made the computer (Dell) specifically for this computer model, downloaded the latest drivers for both there and let Windows install them plus did a manual installation, still get the results seen below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I check the Properties of the 2 under Network Adapters, both have, "Windows is still setting up the class configuration for this device. (Code 56)," in the description.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I check the Properties of the 2 under Other Devices, both have, "Reinstall the drivers for this device. (Code 18)</p>
<div>To reinstall the drivers for this device, click Reinstall Driver." in the description.</div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I try to update them within Device Manager, I get what is seen in the second screenshot.</p>

<p>Mr. Ban,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have done the 2 troubleshooters, results shown in the screenshots below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; About uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers, I did that on 3 different occasions, nothing changed. I also downloaded recent drivers for those 2 items fro Dell and 1 from RealTek, still nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. Ban,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Tried again and got the same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure if this is important but I am running the ISO tool on laptop to create the USB needed. The computer with the problem is a desktop with no internet connection. When I run the MediaCreationTool.exe file, I have to run it on the laptop for
 it to work, it will not work on the desktop. When I try to run the file on the desktop to create the USB needed I get the screenshot below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52ec0568-01e5-4422-9a14-fff322a9e4ba?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52ec0568-01e5-4422-9a14-fff322a9e4ba?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So neither method works.</p>

    <title>intel battery manager device driver, tablet going on &#47; off AC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> murble1  say:</h3>
<h2>            intel battery manager device driver, tablet going on &#47; off AC charging every few seconds</h2>
                    <p>The problem..<br />
My tablet does show battery remaining, time till full charge and so on.<br />
If I do a "powercfg /batteryreport" the table of recent usage, under "capacity remaining" only shows blank entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long version:<br />
I have a cheap tablet (Chuwi). From new, it had an interesting problem. If plugged in, it would cycle between showing AC power/not on AC power every 1 to 2 seconds. I am not the first person to see this. Their forum is full of debates.</p>
<p>I went to the device manager and disabled the "intel battery management" driver. The on/off charge behaviour went away.<br />
I began experimenting with "intel battery management" driver from various tablets. If I have a version with 10156 in the version number, I get the pulsating on/off charge behaviour. If I have a version with 10146 in the number, the tablet seems quite happy,
 but the batteryreport has not idea about the state of the battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have experimented with removing, disabling, enabling and updating every conceivable driver.<br />
The tablet seems basically happy, although I cannot tell if the battery status is accurate.<br />
I have a feeling some parts of the system are not talking to each other (ACPI driver, WMI), but I have not found any clues in the event viewer.</p>
<p>You may well say, you get what you pay for. This is true, but not helpful.</p>

<p>This is normal windows, creators update, although the problem was there with the previous version (anniversary update). This thing is a z8350-based windows tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no error messages. There is the problem that powercfg /batteryreport does not know about battery capacity.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is definitely a driver issue, but one should not contact the manufacturer. There is a long debate about this issue in the "chuwi" form. Somebody posted a video on youtube of the screen pulsating as the poor tablet decided it was going on and off AC power
 and dimmed the screen every second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still curious. How is it technically possible that the charging circuitry reports something back to windows (xx % charged and yy minutes until fully charged), but the batteryreport from powercfg does not have any information ?</p>

<p>Many people (a few) have contacted chuwi. There will be no assistance from them. This is what one gets with a cheap chinese tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My technical question still remains.</p>
<p>The battery charge indicator shows charge remaining. It thinks the battery is there.</p>
<p>powercfg /batteryreport does not have any record of the battery levels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do the different parts of windows get their numbers from ?</p>
