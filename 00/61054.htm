<p>Hey there Ace, I'm sorry to hear you are having troubles after the last update. How about you try doing the update again and see if that helps. While connected to LIVE, navigate to the Storage menu, highlight the Hard Drive, and press Left Bumper, Right
 Bumper, X, Left Bumper, Right Bumper, X and accept the prompts. The console should update again. Then try playing your games and see if you have the same issues or not. Let me know what you find, thanks!

<p>Definitely try Mister Gwyther's suggestions. &nbsp;Beyond that, there is some more troubleshooting you can try, which can be found here: &nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/errors/error-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../error-codes</a></p>
<p>Follow the guides for both the e71 as well as e79 after following a system update reinstall. &nbsp;Both of those are related to troubleshooting hard drive issues, so it really does sound like you got a potential bad update or your hard drive might not be functioning
 properly. </p>

    <title>Xbox One stuck on black screen after boot up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cyberneticmaple  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One stuck on black screen after boot up</h2>
                    
<p><strong>This happened to me yesterday:</strong> I was playing Destiny like normal, when it started acting up and it froze. I quit the game and went to the dashboard, and then the
<em>dashboard&nbsp;</em>froze on me. I did the only other thing I could do, which was turn it off and turn it back on again. The green logo screen came up like normal, and then the screen goes black like it always does. After that, it is
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">supposed</span> to show me that I am logged in, and it is
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">supposed</span> to put me at the dashboard. But instead, the screen&nbsp;stays black, as if frozen. It never goes to the dashboard. I tried booting it up in a different resolution, different HDMI cords, etc. I tried unplugging
 it and waiting a few minutes, but that didn't work at all. So I left it unplugged for a few&nbsp;<em>hours</em> to see if that would work(twice), and it STILL did nothing. It just remains black. At this point I have no clue what is going on and don't know what
 to do to fix it. I need help, and especially now since the holidays are here and I'd like to be able to use my console!</p>

<p>Same thing here. Had to power-cycle (hold down power button for 10s) about 3-4 times before it FINALLY worked. All of our woes with XBO can be traced back to when we first installed Minecraft for XBO. Prior to that, no issues since launch. Since then? Constant
 freezing issues--not just with Minecraft but with other games, on start-up, etc.

<p>The same thing happened to me this morning. Xbox worked last night and started downloading Forza free demo. Turned it on this morning and got the White XBox logo but start up did not continue after that. Turned it off and back on and now all we get is a
 black screen. I have tried unplugging it and plugging it back in and I still get black screen. &nbsp;Tried to power-cycle (hold down power button for 10s) and I still get black screen. Tried different HDMI inputs and that did not work. &nbsp;First day of Christmas vacation
 for my son and no Xbox. &nbsp;Please help.</p>

<p>Same thing here, loads up the logo then just black screen, can;t do anything. SO it's now called the Black Screen of Death.</p>
<p>Decided to go tow almart(HUGE MISTAKE) and purchase a "new" console to only realize it was simply the same thing, it took for ever to start, ALWAYS strict nat setting (no matter what i do, has hard time finding teredo ) and had someone else profile on the
 xbox still. Going to return it and hopefully get one from a reliable store like futureshop or best buy.

<p>I too am having this issue. It started yesterday whilst playing Halo. The Dashboard was painfully slow and lagging. I turned my console off and now it won't load up beyond the black screen. &nbsp;I've tried all of the above possible solutions (except clearing
 storage as I can't get to the dashboard) but to no avail. </p>
<p>Weird how this has started to happen to people at a similar time.</p>

</div>
<div>Why did Skype version 7 forcefully require updating ???</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do not want to use the unfinished new version of Skype, it, as if softer so to speak, does not at all correspond to the convenience of how it was in version 7 of Skype. Constantly some departures, bugs, you can not find those functions that were in version
 7 of Skype. I have already written to the developers several times, but they cannot implement these functions in any way, but they quickly closed the old version. Use the deformity that we support.</div>

            Eaglemaster,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having Windows 7 64bit should not effect your ability to download contect for any game.&nbsp; If you upgraded your PC from XP to Windows 7, then you may want to uninstall\reinstall the game and then attempt to download\install the additional courses.&nbsp; If you
 have a problem getting them to download, verify that your firewall or anti-virus is not stopping the download.&nbsp; You can perform a
<span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean Boot</a>&nbsp;and then attempt to download.&nbsp; If there is still a problem you should contact EA support to see if they have alternate download sites to try.</span>

<p><span>Original Title: Installer says, "... Runtime DLL installer fails ...", logs indicate: "... vcredist_x86 problems ..."__What is wrong here?</span></p>

<p><span>Hi.</span></p>
<p><span>I'm running vmware server 2.0.2 on Windows 7 64bits version on a x64 PC.</span></p>
<p><span>Suddently after installing some new security patches from Microsoft the vmware web console did not respond anymore.</span></p>
<p><span>After many hours of reading I did not find out anything about this problem, so I deinstalled VMWare server, and then trying to install it again.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
But installation fails.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the message I get from the installer:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
"Setup cannot continue. The Microsoft Runtime DLL installer failed to complete installation."</span></p>

<p>Hello Peters909,</p>
<p>You might try and see if you have a System Restore point to before&nbsp; you were installing updates.<br />
To choose a System Restore point,</p>
<p>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Desktop click the Pearl (start) button<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Search Field type ‚ÄúSystem Restore‚Äù and hit enter<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once System Restore is open, select the option ‚Äúchoose a different restore point‚Äù and hit next</p>
<p>Once on the next screen, pick a restore point to go back to when it last worked for you. Once you select the restore point, click next, then select finish, this will start the restore process.</p>
<p><br />
Once you restore, you can then do a manual download of the updates and then install one at a time and reboot. If the issue doesn't occur, go to the next update and install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Hi xJoycex</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
As I see the game is compatible with windows vista, the following link will show the compatibility, I would suggest you to run the program as administrator and see if that helps.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=Sims 3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=Sims%203</span></span></span></a><br />
<br />
I would suggest you to perform a clean boot to see if any third party service is causing the problem.<br />
1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.
<br />
2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.
<br />
3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box.
<br />
4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.
<br />
5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click OK, and then click Restart. <br />
Check if the issue is resolved. If the issue is resolved check which third party is causing the<span>&nbsp;
</span>problem, referring the link given below:<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></span></a><br />
<span>&nbsp; </span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></strong><strong><span><br />
<br />
</span></strong><strong><span>If the above steps fail, I would suggest you to uninstall and re-install the game and see if that helps, if it was working fine before in vista, I would
 suggest you to install in vista compatibility mode; the following are the steps to install in vista compatibility mode.<br />
</span></strong><span>1. Right click on the icon for the program<br />
2.Click on properties<br />
3.Now click on compatibility TAB<br />
4.Under compatibility section, put a check mark on ‚ÄúRun this program in compatibility mode for:‚Äù<br />
5.In the drop down box select windows Vista<br />
6.Under privilige level check mark "Run this programs as an administrator"7.Click on ‚ÄúApply‚Äù<br />
8.Click on ‚ÄúOK‚Äù<br />
<br />

<h2>            Skype for Windows 10 messaging unavailable for Skype for Business contact</h2>
                    It says "messaging unavailable" only in relation to a Skype for Business contact that I have. How do I resolve this?

<p>Hi, I have the same problem with one of my Skype business Contact:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can chat with him, then suddently the textbox changes to "Messaging unavailable" (Messagerie indisponible in french).</p>
<p>After that, I cannot chat anymore with him, even after restarting the app or rebooting computer.</p>
<p>The only way is to uninstall/reinstall the app from the store and then I can discuss with him again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really annoying...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to contact me if you want further details (logs, screenshots, ...)</p>

<p>
</p><p>then I do a fresh install to check it all works fine, and no problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>so then I reinstall again on my new SSd and windows will not activate, says product key blocked !</p>

            <p>You cannot change hard drives and expect windows 10 <em>upgrade</em> to activate. The activation is tied to the hard drive and computer you first installed it on. That drive had the qualifying windows 8.1 on it and the activation and all the hardware info
 is on MS Servers. The new one didn't have a windows operating system. MS knows you did not have windows 8.1 on the ssd (it possibly could be on a diff computer) so you don't qualify for the upgrade but you do have the option to purchase the license.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to get the install media for windows 8.1 from Dell which is usually free or for a small fee as long as you are still under warranty. Then install windows &nbsp;8.1, do all the updates. Then do the free upgrade to windows 10 again. The Dell site
 to order the media is<a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/media?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> HERE.</a></p>

<p>1st off i did not change my hard drives and expect the upgrade to activate!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>i had already upgraded using the existing hard drive that had the windows 8.1 os on it,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd i had then done a fresh install on another hard drive to prove it all worked off the bat ( as i stated in my 1st post my understanding was you had to upgrade 1st so MS knew you had an OEM product as with DELL product codes they are embedded on the bios)</p>
<p>
</p><p>knowing then i was good, i fully formatted and install windows 10 on my new SSD which is where i am at,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>obviously if i get know where here then i will have to get the windows 8.1 media from dell, but whats the point of upgrading if you cannot do a fresh install, its nuts that you would have to reinstall windows 8.1 then upgrade everytime,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>also my further understanding is, with anything in life, products fail hence why mostly the o/s is tied to the motherboard rather than any other component, so i dont understand why it would be tied to my hard drive</p>

<p>
</p><p>it seems there is alot Microsoft are not telling about upgrading free to windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>it appears from an OEM upgrade point of view, in the 1st instance you have to upgrade from whatever windows 7/8/8.1 to windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT even then a complete fresh install is not advised,, i did this again without changing a thing this time and it still failed, called the automatic phone activation which also failed and the person i got through to was of no help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>but i have since found out that if you wish to do a fresh install after upgrading to windows 10 you have to use the recovery method creating a recovery drive, you can then choose to &nbsp;install wiping everything bar the windows 10 OS,,,,&nbsp;&nbsp; im yet to do this
 myself but there is agreat guide on dell community forum, so will see what happens,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>but the punch line is if you want your cake and to eat it, best buy windows 10 !</p>

                    Estava instalando o windows xp em um netbook, utilizando um pen drive boot√°vel. At√© a√≠, tudo ok... Ap√≥s a instala√ß√£o, fui formatar o pen drive, quando, no meio do procedimento, a bateria deste netbook acabou, deixando a formata√ß√£o pela metade. Agora, ao
 plugar o pen drive (um SanDisk 2.0 de 4G) no meu windows 7, ele n√£o aparece em meu computador. Ao abrir o gerenciador de dispositivos, ele aparece como "Driver de Volume de Sistemas de Arquivos WPD" com um ponto de exclama√ß√£o amarelo do lado. Ao tentar reparar
 probelams, ele tenta instalar um drive para esse dispositivo. Meu pc n√£o est√° reconhecendo o pen drive como um poen drive. O que posso fazer para format√°-lo de maneira correta? Como posso fazer para que seja reconhecido como um pen drive? O prompt de comando
 tbm n√£o reconhece a letra que havia sido dada ao pen drive. O que posso fazer? Me ajudem!

<h2>            Latest Update for Xbox 360&#47;Kinect problem&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Tonight Iwe turned on the xbox and found that we were not connected to Live. &nbsp;We signed in and immediately were prompted to download an update, we use the xbox everyday so I am assuming this is a &nbsp;new update. &nbsp;After the update any Kinect game we attempt
 to play prompts us with a corrupt memory error and then says we must download an update. &nbsp;Other &nbsp;apps seem to work ok, but Hulu did freeze when trying to exit. &nbsp;Is this just a coincidence that our memory may have gone bad at the same time as this update or
 is there a problem with the update?</p>

<p>having a similar issue with an update that wants me to update but wont let me use xboxlive which means i cant update. ive been told to use a usb or cd to locally download the update and then update it to the xbox. the code im getting is a memory code/harddrive.
 so id go that route and try the usb and cd to download the update and then use that to your 360.</p>

<p>Solution 1: try reinstalling the update </p>
<p>Solution 2: Make sure you have enough storage space </p>
<p>Solution 3: Clear the system cache </p>
<p>Solution 4: Reinsert the storage device </p>
<p>Solution 5: Copy the update to a USB flash drive or CD/DVD (from xbox support site)</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have 4 computers all on Windows, three 1803 updates went OK and had no issues but on my Surface Pro 4 I have problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update I was being continuously asked for Administrator privileges. This morning I decided to re-install windows, the initial install went as expected but when installing the 1803 features update it stuck at 31% the fan came on and the computer
 got extremely hot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then discovered that my permissions had changed and that 'Authenticated Users' had no permissions at all, I changed them to what they are on my other computers. I reset the computer and found I was then able to copy as normal, I checked the updates and
 it had started downloading again. The install then got to 67% and stuck so I tried copying a file again (C:\Temp to C:) and got the error :-</p>

<p>@op and mrkerr</p>
<p>thats usually a sign of a nad internet connection or you using a vpn or a "friend"to queue your downloads without being in region</p>
<p>if your actual region does not match your account region that would be why they Must match
</p>
<p>if they do match and no vpn is involvrd then hardreset your modem and router by turning them off for 5mins</p>
<p>then delete it and clear system cache</p>
<p>only if your actual region matches</p>

<p>Thanks ngocphi. I am indeed currently living outside my home country (I am from the UK and am living in the UAE, which is a supported Xbox Live country). I am not using a VPN.</p>
<p>IF the region mismatch is the problem, can you explain why I can buy/dowload all other types of content from the marketplace (full-price games/Live Arcade games/demos/etc), which I have been doing regularly since moving here, but not the one free game that
 is available. It is available in my home country, it is available in my current location, why can't I download it when I can download everything else in the Marketplace?</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help and advice.</p>

<p>well if you read your own post that is a region violation</p>
<p>you need to match your region it has been said many timess for the best experience with live your regions must match</p>
<p>regardless </p>
<p>uk and uae are not the same country nor does using a relative in the account country to queue it i</p>
<p>you wouldve recieived the not available in your region error otherwise</p>
<p>what that means is you cannot download the uk content while in uae</p>
<p>you will have to use a uae account</p>
<p>this is listed in the offical trouble shooting faq for fable 3 downlosd everyone else who matches their region downloaded it</p>

<p>Thanks again for your reply. I understand what you are saying and take on board all your points.</p>
<p>i don't think it is a violation - I am a UK resident. My bank account used to py for Marketplace content is with a UK bank. My home is in the UK. I am just temporarily working in the UAE. But I accept what you say that Microsoft lwould prefer the account
 region to match the physical location. Unfortunately, in the modern world, people travel around for for work and this is not always possible.</p>
<p>My main question remains unanswered. Like I said, I do NOT use a VPN with my Xbox so I still do not understand why, if using my UK account in the UAE is indeed a violation, I have been able/allowed to pay for and download several games and DLC packs and
 demos in recent months (amongst many others: The Walking Dead, Assassin's Creed IV season pass, and just the other night Catherine from the Sunny Day sale) BUT I cannot get a game that is being given away for free to download. That makes no sense to me and
 that is what I would like explained. The same Marketplace that lets me buy all the purchases I have made has offered me a free game, then won't let me download it.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help and just to be clear I'm not having a go at you, ngocphi, I realise you are just trying to help - but this is a bit frustrating! Cheers.</p>

<p>it si explained</p>
<p>due to international laws which you have to abide by</p>
<p>you cannot get uk content out of region</p>
<p>if you want fable 3 or halo 3 by intrrnational law you must download the correct copy which is the uae copy</p>
<p>any region locked content has the law beside them&nbsp;</p>
<p>content providers and governments can and will decide what distibution rights and contrnt you will have access to</p>
<p>google distibution rights for the long form version in</p>
<p>I short you are only legally entitles to your current regions content by default that would require a uae account</p>
<p>not a uk account if you want to download uk content you are required tobbe in uk</p>

<p>I've had the same problem, almost. I'm in Australia, just moved here from UK. Although I can't even get the download to start, it says 'not available in your region'. I understand all the reasons mentioned above, but it does frustrate me that my dashboard
 advertises everything as if I am in the UK. I cancelled my Gold membership before moving here, as wasn't sure if it would work correctly. But once I set the console up and saw the new Free games option with Gold, I specifically paid to go back to Gold for
 the free games coming out. Nothing in the process indicated these free games would not be available, despite the fact the system clearly knows I am not in my home region. That seems a little dishonest to me. Is this likely to happen with all the free games
 coming to Gold members? The poster above mentioned that several other games/DLC worked fine for him. Is it something special about Fable 3?</p>

<h2>            Hyper-V&#47;VMConnect&#47;RDP multi monitor on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed Hyper-V on Windows 10 Enterprise and have also installed a Gen 2 VM with Windows 10 Enterprise.</p>
<p>I have four physical monitors and would ideally like a connect 2 of monitors to the VM and rest for local use.</p>
<p>I have added RemoteFX adapter with 2 monitors 1920x1200 with 512MB dedicated Video Memory.</p>
<p>Whenever I connect using RDP or VMConnect and have Use all my monitors option ticked. It only connects me to one screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I connected to it for the very first time, I was able to all my four monitors connected, but since then it doesnt connect all four but only one.</p>
<p>With regards to 2 on 4 setup I found a group policy setting where you can limit the maximum number of monitors, I had set it to 2, but then I remove the group policy setting as either way I couldn't get more than one monitor connected.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You "slave" it in another computer as a secondary Drive; you do not try and run it in another Computer as a Bootable Drive.</p>
<p>The best and easiest way is to use a "USB Hard Drive Enclosure" &gt; put the failing Hard Drive in that &gt; plug into working Computer &gt; try and read from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is too damaged to read&nbsp;you may have to contact Data Recovery specialists; but they are very&nbsp;expensive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            Windows Spotlight not working</h2>
                    <p>My Windows Spotlight has stopped working. I have tried to delete the background images many times and used the powershell&nbsp;command to reset Spotlight and that hasn't worked either. It is stuck on the same image which does not change. I have Windows 10 build
 1709. It has not done the latest build update yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist.&nbsp;</p>

            1. Windows Key+I &gt; Personalization &gt;Lock Screen &gt; Cange Background to Picture. 
<br />Copy following and paste in Windows Start Search box
<br />%LocalAppData%\Packages\
<br />And now locate Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager__........folder
<br />Make a copy of Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager__........folder (for the sake of backup) and then Delete everything from inside the folder
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Personalization &gt;Lock Screen &gt; Cange Background  back to Windows Spotlight
<br />
<br />2. If above doesn't work, Look into this thread. There are many possible solutions which you should attempt. Let me know in case of further query and help.

            Hello, I‚Äôm Virginia an independent advisor here.
<br />You could use this fix from the tenforum to reset &amp; re-register Spotlight: 
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/82156-reset-re-register-windows-spotlight-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/82156-reset...</a>
<br />There‚Äôs a bug with Spotlight since the Fall update, if you choose ‚Äònot a fan‚Äô it permanently resets the background to the default photo so you have to run this fix again.
<br />This is fixed with the 1803 update.
