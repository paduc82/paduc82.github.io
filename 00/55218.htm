<p>How recent? The family pack has been discontinued, about 3 weeks ago I think. I'm guessing they renewed every member of your family on a regular gold subscription. I thought they might for the primary but not renew all the secondaries at full price! But
 yeah call support right away. </p>

<h2>            Skype Number Issue</h2>
                    My subscription had an issue with the automatic monthly payment. &nbsp;It is fixed now, and I renewed the monthly subscription. &nbsp;It seems that in between that time it was down and now, someone else has the same number on their cell phone. &nbsp;When I call out is
 still show up the same number as before on caller ID, and when called it will even show I have a missed called but it is delayed. &nbsp;How do I get a new number or what should I do??

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the Skype number on your account renewed, there should be no one that has the same number.
</span><span>When you cancel your Skype Number, your subscription will remain active until its expiry date. After it expires, Skype will reserve your Skype Number for you on your account for 90 days. This means
 no one else but you can purchase this particular number during this period. You can renew your Skype Number subscription from your account. Skype numbers can be cancelled, but not refunded</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can purchase multiple Skype Number subscription, but only for each country. You may also refer to this FAQ articles below for more information.</span></span></p>

<p>If you're talking about Windows Explorer, there's the option in Folder Options to open new folders in a new window (but I'm sure you've already checked that).&nbsp; I'm not sure why it is not working on your system. However, you can add "Open Folder in a New
 Window" to the right click context menu so all you have to do is right click on the folder and then click that option (two steps instead of one or automatic, but it works).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
<a href="http://www.askvg.com/add-open-in-new-window-option-in-folders-and-drives-context-menu-in-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.askvg.com/add-open-in-new-window-option-in-folders-and-drives-context-menu-in-windows/</a>.&nbsp; Since this involves working with the registry, I suggest you first make a system restore point and then backup the registry as follows:
<a href="http://www.adamsdvds.co.uk/tutorials/vista/regedit/backup.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adamsdvds.co.uk/tutorials/vista/regedit/backup.php</a>.</p>
<p>Let's check some of your system files and your hard disk to see if there is any corruption:</p>
<p><span>Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It may want to schedule itself to start at the next startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Agree and then reboot so the program can run. It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If SFC comes up with corruption it cannot repair,
<span>
we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>====================================================================================================================</span></span></p>
<p>To open new folders in a new Window in Internet Explorer here are the general procedures:
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/91587-open-folder-same-separate-new-window.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/91587-open-folder-same-separate-new-window.html</a>&nbsp;(though I have a feeling you've already done this).&nbsp; If that doesn't work, then go to Tools / Internet Options / Tabs and disable Tabbed Browsing (then close all open IE windows).&nbsp;
 This may actually make things worse for you if you're now using Tabs (as I am) but it might clear up the other problem if it sees no alternatives (I'm just guessing here).&nbsp; If that doesn't work or makes things worse, then turn it back on, close all open IE
 windows, and the next one you open will have tabs back.</p>
<p>If it is Internet Explorer, here are two other options you can try (but be forewarned that the latter will delete your history and a lot of other stuff from your system - but it does give a warning message telling what it is going to delete and giving you
 the option to continue or cancel - so the decision is yours.&nbsp; You can try them or you can go directly to the IE Forum to get their advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Troubleshooting and Internet Explorer’s (No Add-ons) Mode [Applies to IE7 &amp; IE8 in all OSS] - the issue may be caused by some add-on and this will help rule that out.<br />
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/07/25/678113.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/07/25/678113.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>Does the behavior persist if you Reset IE Advanced settings (RIES)?<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue is with Internet Explorer (I'm not clear from your post), and the above doesn't work then I suggest you repost in the Internet Explorer Forum at:
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/InternetExplorer/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/InternetExplorer/threads</a>&nbsp;where people who are experts at IE will be more than happy to assist you with your problem. Be sure to include your version of Windows (for example, 32-bit Vista Business SP2) and
 your version of IE8 and everything you've tried to resolve the problem (so they don't give you advice you've already received or tried).</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>Warning&#58; Do NOT Assassinate Tebaggers&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tj21717  say:</h3>
<h2>            Warning&#58; Do NOT Assassinate Tebaggers&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I just assassinated one tonight and boy was he mad! He was being really aggressive with me throughout the remainder of the match. I noticed he just ignored everybody else that was shooting at him and focusing all his attention on me the entire time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's just a warning though. For those of you who are thinking of assassinating a teabagger, you probably shouldn't. If you do, he'll be so embarrassed he'll want to come after you and kill you. I know what most of you are already going to say. You're going
 to tell me that he's going to kill me even if I didn't assassinate him while he was in the middle of teabagging my teammate. I just noticed he was very aggressive with me after I assassinated him.</p>

<h2>            Virtual Hard Drive missing.</h2>
                    HI&nbsp; I have a 2TB hard drive which I created a Virtual Hard Drive (600G) on to store media files. using&nbsp; the computer management software. Worked find and drive showed on Computer Management and Explorer. This morning when I rebooted the VHD won't show
 at all, but the space is still taken from the main hard drive. Any suggestions on how I can get computer to recognize it or recover space? I am running Windows 7 Home Premium.

</span><span>Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>No – Nothing installed, added or changed as far as I can remember</span></p>
<p><span>2. Did you use any third party software to create the Virtual hard drive?</span></p>
<p><span>No – Looked at MiniTool Partition Wizard, but didn’t use as the Windows one looked fine.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Are you able to see the drive in disk management?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>No – I can’t see the virtual drive. The disc it is on looks fine and has the right size, but when I look on explorer the disc
 has the virtual drive amount of space as used, but there is nothing you can access.&nbsp; There is no unallocated space.
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I used the WinDirStat program which gives a graphical representation of the drive and it shows the space is on the drive as a “.VHD” file, which has “Windows Shell Common Dll” as the means of opening.
 Not too sure if that is significant or not. </span></p>
<p><span>Could I just delete the “.VHD” file or would that make the situation worse.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer to the article and check if it helps:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;I tried this but couldn’t find the “click Configure a device” option on “Troubleshoot Hardware and Sound so I ran Hardware and Devices but it found no problems. I wonder if this was because the drive
 itself is fine and this is a virtual drive.</span></p>

            Thanks this does make the drive visible - my problem now is that I have to do this every time I reboot - when I reboot the VHD is not there. Is there any way of making this attachment automatic?<br />

            The problem here is permanently attaching the VHD - whenever one reboots it vanishes and needs to be attached again.
<br />
There seems to little point in creating a VHD if it can't be easily accessed, and as Win7 will only allow a couple of particans, most of which are used my manufacturers there is a real problem here.
<br />
Is there a simple solution to this issue or is it a bug in Win7?<br />
<br />

<p>BHDrvx64, ID IS BHDRVX64\0000</p>
<p>I have norton anti-virus which is set to expire in a couple of weeks. &nbsp;A few months back symantec sent me a trial upgrade to internet security which has since expired. &nbsp;Anti-virus indicated a problem which led me to symantec help which could not resolve
 the issue so I dwnld the removal tool, removed, then tried to reinstall the av. It wouldn't take apparently because the av still sees the trial internet sec, even though it is expired. I am going to best buy to buy a new 2011 int sec anyway and will remove
 both the aborted av install and the trial int sec before I install the new 2011 int sec. &nbsp;I know the new int sec should remove all that first but I didn't want to take chances so I'll clean what I can first because, unlike my reinstallation attempt, the new
 version needs to take!</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't know whether or not my dev/drv issues have any bearing on this but I would like to resolve them as well. &nbsp;Aside from my monitor, keyboard, mouse and cricket broadband I have no other devices hooked up. &nbsp;Everything has always worked fine.
 &nbsp;All other diagnostics and checks on my machine show all is well.</p>
<p>BTW, my system is win7,64bit. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Your Problems are all related to Symantec You need to use whatever removal tools Symantec has on their site, and / or their manual removal instructions.</p>
<p>Untill you can ensure that both the symantec Trial and any previously installed Symantec apps have been completely removed you are going to have issues.</p>
<p>I would be wary of installing any new Symantec version untill you have cured these issues.</p>

<p>I have 4 usb ports in use, two are a pig tail for cricket bb, the other 2 are for keyboard and mouse. I disconnected all and rebooted which only works until I am asked for my password. Point is there are no changes to the error msgs.</p>
<p>I did a restore, then removed the norton anti virus. &nbsp;I checked and saw;&nbsp;</p>
<p>the ps/2 mouse issue</p>
<p>usb cf reader issue</p>
<p>usb ms reader issue</p>
<p>mini sd reader issue</p>
<p>Then I removed the norton safe web lite and upon checking saw the addition of;</p>
<p>usb sd reader&nbsp;</p>
<p>usb xD/SM reader</p>
<p>dev = WPDBUSENUMROOT\UMB\2-37C186B-1-STORAGE#VOLUME#_??_USBSTORE#DISK-VEN_GENERIC_PROD_*******************************************ETC.</p>
<p>There are some variations of #'s being represented by the wildcards but I'm starting to tire of typing.</p>
<p>If its any help all the usb issues appear to be in drives f:\ &nbsp;g:\ &nbsp;h:\ &nbsp;i:\ &nbsp;and j:\ respectively which I'm pretty sure I don't have and if I do, &nbsp;they aren't being used.</p>
<p>I reiterate that these usb errors are&nbsp;definitely occuring after the symantec removals. I am confident that I have found everything symantecally related in this machine.</p>
<p>I also can't help but wonder if installing 2011 int sec will have a reverse effect on this whole goat scr.</p>
<p>I am moving past scratching my head to preparing to rip out hair.</p>

<p>Hi bill,</p>
<p>It looks like Norton or Symantec has added filters to the registry to prevent malicious behavior from USB drives.</p>
<p>The F:, G:, H: etc. are related to the filters.</p>
<p>I suggest uninstalling the USB devices from the Device Manager, then clicking the Scan for new hardware button or restarting.</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>Thanks for your input. &nbsp;Initially I wanted to uninstall them but wasn't sure if that was the right move. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I did successfully install a new Norton internet security yesterday which didn't change anything one way or the other in respect to my present issue. &nbsp;It did allow me back online however, which&nbsp;definitely needed to happen.</p>
<p>So, &nbsp;based on your advice I uninstalled all 5 and rebooted. &nbsp;The computer reinstalled all 5. &nbsp;Then I tried uninstalling and did the scan for hardware changes and all 5 were immediately reinstalled complete with configmgrerr19 msgs.</p>
<p>The mouse thing is still there with the configmgrerr24 which started me on my little ride but I'm thinking that one may be fairly common.</p>
<p>The thing is I've never went looking for this stuff before I had a little problem with my old version of anti virus so I don't know whether this is all new or if its been around awhile. &nbsp;I gave some thought to doing a restore to several months back to see
 if the device issues go back that far. &nbsp;I know I can undo it if&nbsp;necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another question would be if I go there will my new Norton int security be in conflict with previous programs and should I uninstall first? &nbsp;The other question would be if I uninstall new Norton, &nbsp;would reinstalling new Norton constitute a strike against
 the 3 pc's part of my package or will the software recognize that its still the same pc and not count it as a new install? &nbsp;I could check it out at symantec but since I found your response in email and I am typing right now I thought I'd throw that one at
 you!</p>
<p>I know the importance of trying these things one at a time so even though I may have several questions I am not going to run the&nbsp;gauntlet in one session then cry that my problems are even worse.</p>
<p>Ultimately I have a pretty good running machine and it stays that way because I try not to do stupid stuff. &nbsp;(Try is the operative word there.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know you have a lot going on but I would appreciate your further input. &nbsp;At the very least I am able to go back online, so that's a positive. &nbsp;Please drop me a line at your convenience.</p>
<p>Thanks, Bill S. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay in response.</p>
<p>I'm leery about using System Restore points older than a week or so, though a quick backup will give you the ability to experiment without the threat of losing any data.</p>
<p>I'd uninstall the Norton before the restore. Just the fact that it's an anti-virus can cause conflicts, let alone a previous installation.</p>
<p>I don't think reinstalling the Norton after a restore will qualify as a second installation instance of the product. You may have to contact Norton to get it reactivated.</p>
<p>I think the license is pretty much tied to the motherboard, so a reinstall on the same hardware should be OK.</p>
<p>You're doing a great job troubleshooting this issue.</p>
<p>Before trying the System Restore, you might try creating a new profile to see if the issue exist there:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you ever get a chance to run System File Checker, suggested by Palcouk?</p>
<p>My thoughts at this point are that the chipset drivers may have become corrupted at some point and are causing the errors.</p>
<p>They are the drivers for the motherboard that cover the on-board stuff, like the card readers and the PS2 port.</p>
<p>I suggest checking with the computer manufacturer to see if there is a version on their website to download and install.</p>
<p>You might have a look for a BIOS firmware update while you're over there.</p>

<p>I checked drivers, they are up to date. </p>
<p>Apparently problem is that I have Sony VAIO computer. When I looked at VAIO update, I saw that they don't guarantee that&nbsp;VAIO will work without problem with&nbsp;Window 10 and they even have link to return&nbsp;back to Windows 7, what I finally did.</p>

    <title>When adding a journal for storage spaces, is the journal added to the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikebar  say:</h3>
<h2>            When adding a journal for storage spaces, is the journal added to the storage pool or a the storage space&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm planning to create 2 storage spaces, 1 for backup and 1 for my main data. I was going to add 1 journal to each storage space, but it looks like the journal applies to the storage pool, not the storage space. Is that the case? if it is, is the better
 approach to add 2 SSD drives to the storage pool as journals? If I add 2 drives as journals, how do I change the friendly name of the drives? Both of my drives that I want to use as journals have the same exact name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Tried to clean boot, now its all black</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to update to windows 10 when it wouldn't continue past the part where it's searching for updates. When I looked for an answer online, someone suggested to try a clean boot, and I followed the instructions at&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135.
 Once I booted up and put my password in though, I was greeted by a black screen with my cursor still showing. No matter how long I wait or how many times I restart its the same thing. I started up in safe mode and tried to undo the changes I had made in msconfig
 but I'm continuing to get this black screen.</p>

            <p>Hi Sachin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The latest item in my Update history is "Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3124200)" installed on Dec 17. Event Viewer also shows KB777778 on Dec 22 and there have been a number of Windows Defender definition updates
 (last night's was KB2267602 - Definition 1.213.1168.0). I'm currently on Windows 10 Home Version 1511 Build 10586.36.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. As far as I know, only Epson Scan is missing. The last time I used it was on Dec 14th. However, the shortcut icon lives on my desktop and it was there yesterday. This morning it was gone. The KB3124200 update switched my default PDF reader from Acrobat
 Pro to Edge and Calendar stopped working for a few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. No, I only use Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. No error message or warning of any kind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

 I need to get that list back and in a place I can get to a file or whatever. Can you or anyone help?</p>

<p>
</p><p>A more customer friendly approach would be to provide some sort of opt-in notification rather than just uninstalling an application without my approval. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows has detected a program that may be incompatible with the current operating system. Please disable or update this application. Reference: Epson Scan."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean, seriously, would that be so hard?</p>

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>Dawn Kelley,</span></p>
<p><span>Connect the laptop to the docking station.
<br />
Note: If you do not see the "Undock Computer" option, it is possible that your laptop is not properly configured for docking or that you do not have the necessary administrative permissions to undock the laptop.</span></p>
<p><span>To undock the laptop, follow these steps:<br />
1. Click Start, then click "Undock Computer". (Located next to the options for "Shutdown" and "Restart")<br />
2. Wait for a message to appear saying that you have successfully undocked your laptop.
<br />
Note: Some laptops will not provide this message but will instead make a sound confirming that the laptop has been undocked.<br />
3. Push the eject button on the docking station down until the laptop pops up.<br />
4. Remove the laptop from the station, pulling the back end up first.</span></p>
<p><span>Tips and Warning:<br />
Dell laptops have the "Undock Computer" option. Some laptops, however, may have an option for "Eject PC" in the start menu instead of "Undock Computer".
<br />
It is extremely important to undock your laptop from the start menu before ejecting it from the docking station.
<br />
Ejecting a laptop from the station before it is undocked from the start menu can result in data loss.<br />
It can also result in hardware damage of your laptop or other devices connected to the docking station.<br />
Read the manufacturer's manual for detailed undocking instructions for your specific laptop.</span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: If the laptop is not connected to the docking station, then the undock pc button is not available in the Start menu.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.<br />
Let me know if&nbsp;this worked.<br />
All the best!</span></p>

                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1); text-align: left">Hi Everyone,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I'm typing this on my Acer Aspire 5100-3357 laptop that originally came with windows vista home premium 32-bit installed on it. I recently purchased a authentic/genuine dvd disc that has windows 7 home premium edition w/sp1 on it, it's
 the 32-bit edition. It's already been 'legally' activated via microsoft. I've already tried once to install windows 10 home on this laptop via the 'upgrade' method, it finally finished but it took a VERY LONG time. It never did function correctly..it ran as
 slow as cold molasses. To make matters even worse...I was having so many issue's that I got frustrated and performed a reset this pc. Of course when I did so, I couldn't easily go back to windows 7. So I had to reinstall windows 7, as I'm not one to give up
 easy..I tried a second time using a different method. I created a new partition on my hard drive, I already had a windows 10 ISO image dvd, so when I booted my laptop, of course I chose to boot off the dvd, I was asked where I wanted to install windows 10..of
 course I installed to the new partition. The install process when much smoother than the 'upgrade' method..but windows 10 still seemed to run slow, should I just forget about installing windows 10 on this laptop ? I'm enclosing my computer spec's., so hopefully
 some other user's can share their opinion's. By the way, windows 7 runs GREAT !!

            <p>If possible, I would recommend maxing out the installed RAM. Windows 10 uses a lot of background resources. You might even want to consider upgrading from a mechanical hard disk to an SSD, two things that can definitely boost the performance of the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing all this might not be worth it. You could purchase a cheap laptop with Windows 10 Home preinstalled and lots of RAM.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As suggested, Windows 7 is still supported until January 2020, so you could continue using that version for a pretty long while.

<p>Just like Andre stated..I'd be better off to just buy a newer laptop with more ram..etc. .I'm still glad I have a genuine/activated windows 7 sp1 home premium edition 32-bit running on that laptop, so much better that vista. Have a wonderful day !!</p>

<div>The above link has someone who had the same problem as me, and the replies suggest that the .NET framework doesn't update&nbsp;mscoree.dll in system32 from v2.0 to v4.0 when the .NET framework is installed. I checked mscoree.dll in my system32 folder, and in
 properties -&gt; details it says the file version / product version is 2.0.50727.4927, and was last modified on 6/10/2009 4:40PM. Several posts later, one of the users "nbeerbower" found a solution:</div>

<div><span>Hey everyone! I was having the same exact problem! In fact, none of my programs that used .NET 4 would work! But I've been searching the internet to fix this bug.</span><br />
<br />
<span>The problem is the result of the .NET 4 installer never updating mscoree.dll from .NET 2. So, here is the new dll and some instructions on how to fix it.</span><br />

Hi, I'm nbeerbower. I was having trouble with my .NET 4.0 and it resulted in a 2908 error when installing XNA which is needed for Terraria.<br />
The problem is because for some reason .NET 4 does not update mscoree.dll from .NET 2.<br />
Here's a 'kit' to help you fix it.<br />
<br />
1. Open Take Ownership.reg and add the registry keys. This allows you to easily replace mscoree.dll<br />
2. Go to Windows/system32 (if you have a 64x OS also do the SAME procedure in the folder Windows/SysWOW64)<br />
3. Find mscoree.dll and right click and Take Ownership(you can alsocheck properties and see version, if it's 2.00 then this fix will work!)<br />
4. Replace with the included mscoree.dll<br />
5. Repeat in SysWOW64 if you have a 64 bit OS<br />
<br />
Have fun!</blockquote>

<div>This solved the problem for the other users, but the links he provides are old or broken. Can someone provide links that work to a solution? OR tell me directly how to update mscoree.dll? Or is updating mscoree.dll unnecessary to solve this problem?</div>

<h2>            kernel security check failure win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I am having an issue with the kernel security check failure with my new laptop. I have tried using the recovery media and it will not boot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>the laptop came preinstalled with windows 10 and it worked fine for a while and the last thing I remember installing is the GFW client so I could test a few games. And it has gone into a boot loop. It tries to use the automatic repair and it gets the same
 error and when I contacted Acer for help they sent a recovery USB. I tried to boot it and am getting the
</p>
<p>error. </p>
<p>
If I could get a little help it would be greatly appreciated. And if I have to download some stuff I can as I do have a desktop in working condition.</p>

            <p>I created the USB and plugged it into my laptop. booted it and pressed F12. when the boot menu came up I hit enter on the usb. The light on the usb started flashing. after about 30 seconds it gave the same error and then told me to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant get it to read usbs or cds due to this error. (I tried a tech preview cd as well to see if I could get the command prompt and same issue as the usb.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I <strong>DO NOT </strong>care about my data on the laptop at this point. its all on Steam and can be redownloaded. and there was nothing else on it except a couple pictures from my dropbox folder. so hopefully this will help in finding a way to fix this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again I have tried a Manufacture Recovery USB, the USB from the media creation tool (which reads fine on this computer.) and an outdated tech preview DVD.&nbsp;&nbsp; Automatic repair does not work and the bios is the only thing that will successfully allow me to
 touch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>is there a way I could upload a picture of the screen or do you all have an idea of what it says. I could do a picture for each or a video if that helped.

</p><p>The F12 Boot Menu allows you to choose&nbsp;which device that you would like to boot the computer's Operating System from by pressing the F12 key&nbsp;during the computer's Power On Self Test, or POST process. Some notebook and netbook models have the F12 Boot Menu
 disabled by default.</p>

            <p>I can't get into the os at all right now. Having issues all the way through. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Called acer to see if they could help. They managed to get the recovery USB they sent me to work. But as soon as it finished it rebooted and started up again. So now I'm stuck with no actual windows os. When I boot it it comes up as "Acer recovery manager"
 and wont allow me to do anything. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The person at acer helped to a point. Then he went to talk to his tech and put me on hold and it hung up on me. They are going to take it and reflash it it sounds like but I have to phone back today to see if this guy updated the notes or just dumped it
 thinking I hung up. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also tried the USB with win 10 on it and it wont allow me to use it either. Still getting the same blue screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Is there any other way to get the log files because i would if i could to see if it is fixable</p>

            <p>Generally speaking that error code is related to a driver (often a video driver) so probably fixable.&nbsp; I am surprised that Acer did not suggest you boot from a win 10 ISO and do a repair install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would follow Acers instructions first but if you dont get a swift resolution you might want to take matters into you own hands and try the repair install.&nbsp; You can get the ISO here</p>
