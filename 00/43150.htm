<h2>            Game freezes randomly</h2>
                    <p>My game keeps freezing randomly during game play. I&nbsp;have already tried a new disc, my Xbox One is up to date, the game is up to date, I have cleared the cache, I&nbsp;have uninstalled the game and reinstalled it, done a hard restart, and preformed a soft factory reset.&nbsp;</p><p>Can anyone help?<br /></p>

<b>Remove</b>. </li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once the account has been removed from your console, download your profile again to create a fresh version of the account data. Here's how:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Return to the <b>Home</b> screen and scroll left to open the guide. </li><li>Select <b>Sign in</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Add &amp; manage</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Add new</b>. </li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Type in the email address and password that you use to access your Microsoft account (the same account that you just removed).
</li><li>The console will walk you through some account setup steps, like privacy info, sign-in and color preferences, etc. Follow the console prompts until you are returned to the
<b>Home</b> screen. </li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once your account is downloaded, try playing your game again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To further troubleshoot your concern, please make sure that&nbsp; your Xbox One console is horizontally positioned on a level, stable and uncluttered surface.&nbsp;The positioning of your console may be causing your gameplay issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since you have mentioned that other game discs are working fine, we suggest that you uninstall the game, reboot the console, and reinstall the game with the console offline to resolve the issue. It's possible that the installed game data is corrupted.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To uninstall the game: </p>
<p>1. From the <b>Home</b> screen, select <b>My games &amp; apps</b>. </p>
<p>2. Highlight the game title that you want to uninstall. </p>
<p>3. Press the <b>Menu</b> button on your controller. </p>
<p>4. Select <b>Manage game</b>. </p>
<p>5. Highlight the game title and press the <b>Menu</b> button again. </p>
<p>6. Select <b>Uninstall</b>. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Once the game is uninstalled, restart your Xbox One console: </p>
<p>1. Return to the <b>Home</b> screen and scroll left to open the guide. </p>
<p>2. Select <b>Settings</b>. </p>
<p>3. Select <b>Restart console</b>, and confirm by selecting <b>Restart</b>. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now, reinstall the game with the console offline: </p>
<p>1. On the <b>Home</b> screen, scroll left to open the guide. </p>
<p>2. Select <b>Sign in</b>. </p>
<p>3. Select your account, and then select <b>Sign out</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Make sure <b>all</b> accounts are signed out so that the console is not connected to Xbox Live for the next step.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Insert the game disc into your console. The console will check whether the game is already installed. Since you previously removed this game from your console, you should now be prompted to install the game.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Once the game has been reinstalled, try playing it to see if the issue reoccurs.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've actually already tried that too. I ended up just buying a new Xbox One so that I didn't have to deal with this problem any longer.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
There could be a system conflict that's why you're facing this issue. We would like to determine the device that you're using, to connect your external hard drive so we can isolate your concern.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, we suggest that you update the wireless mouse and USB port drivers and check if it helps.
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We'll keep an eye out for your response.</span></span><span>

<p>Since all drivers are updated but the issue still persists, possibilities that this is an interference issue with the USB 2.0 and USB 3.0. This interference can cause a delayed response to the wireless mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your laptop has multiple ports available, we suggest that you connect the USB 2.0 on the other side of the laptop. Make sure that the wireless mouse is closest to your wireless receiver (USB 2.0).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Update us with the outcome so we can provide further assistance.</span></span><span>

<p>hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for late reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have connected the mouse to the opposite side of the laptop which is 3.0 port and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works fine regardless of the distance. Even used it 6 ft away from the port without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem mainly occurs when a USB 2.0 mouse is Connected With &nbsp;A USB 3.0 HDD and Both the ports are located on the SAME SIDE. Then the mouse starts to lag, shutter. or even stops working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S the mouse works fine when the USB 3.0 HDDs or any USB 3.0 devices are disconnected. In the picture you can see both the devices are connected on the same side. The mouse receiver is in USB 2.0 and lagging and USB 3.0 HDD in USB 3.0 port. Issue is faced
 when the are connected in the same side of the laptop. I prefer to keep mouse in USB 2.0 as i frequently need to plus lots of USB 3.0 devices on other port,</p>

<p>Is this problem exclusive to Saint's Row 3? Assuming it is, you will want to clear your system cache. To do this, go to System Settings, Memory, then select your main memory device with Y (most likely your HDD) and choose Clear Cache. This will clear all
 of your Xbox's cache, similar to how you can clear a computer or browser cache. It fixes things related to updates as well, so it could help here.</p>
<p>If you wouldn't mind, try clearing the cache and then coming back here. If it works, then you're good. If it continues, then we will look for other options.</p>

<p>Do you have any stored updates on your hard drive? If you do, try to delete all updates and DLC off of the HDD. One of the updates might be corrupted and making you download it every time you get on, and keeping you from playing online correctly. Deleting
 all of your updates and downloading them again may fix the problem.</p>
<p>I'm sorry that this is happening to you; it's strange that it only happens on one game.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the original thread was derailed by a moderator-wannabe and now serves no purpose.&nbsp; Part two of "Zombies Elite" continues, with networking potential capable of bringing the Zombie leaderboard to its knees.&nbsp; All I ask is that you consider your
 skill level before committing any emotional attachment to this thread.&nbsp; I did not design this thread to make fun of, antagonize, or berate anyone associated with it.&nbsp; For crying out loud, it's just a game!&nbsp; But for those of us who actually enjoy this game
 for a particularly lengthy session, then feel free to post your scores.&nbsp; </p>

<p>All these scores are what I can remember. I cannot remember kills and points though.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kino - 31 </li><li>Five - 36 (not online) </li><li>Ascension - 46 (solo) </li><li>Call of the Dead - 17 (still working on a strategy) </li></ul>

<p>I think elite zombie players should not worry about how high of a round they got to. I feel that it is more about the moments where other players would have messed up or gone down. Almost anyone can run circles somewhere. Say your teammate goes down across
 the map but he has good guns(ray gun, LMG, etc.). An elite zombie player would be able to get them no problem where as a normal zombie player wouldn't know how to control the zombies.</p>

<p>And I agree with you, Noxious. &nbsp;Higher rounds are not more important than good ol' fashioned teamwork. &nbsp;But there's a fine line between teamwork and babysitting. &nbsp;The guys that go straight for the box and go bankrupt before round 10 are the ones left spectating.
 &nbsp;The guy who got cornered on his way out of the juggernog room is the one I'm sacrificing myself to revive.

<p>If anyone could run circles, why don't they? &nbsp;(Instead of bringing their horde crashing into mine) &nbsp;Lolz</p>

<p>============================================================</p>
<p><strong>BCCode: 1E&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000001E&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remove ALL power and reseat all the cards, memory, and cables (both ends when<br />
possible)</strong> - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Those are for a PC and about all<br />
that can be done for a laptop is reseat the memory and clear the vents. Make sure the BIOS,<br />
low level chipset drivers, and major device drivers are all up to date by check manually at the<br />
makers' sites.</p>
<p>Many Bluescreens are caused by&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and other major device drivers<br />
which are not the most current even though the computer is new. Check manually for updates<br />
using the methods for updates as&nbsp;indicated in the troubleshooter linked above and/or the methods<br />
below (which are the same).<br />
<strong><br />
</strong><br />
<strong>BCCode: 1E&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000001E<br />
<br />
Cause</strong></p>
<p>This is a very common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT
<p>An unaligned data reference was encountered.</p>
</li><li>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT
<p>A breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.</p>
</li><li>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION
<p>A memory access violation occurred. (Parameter 4 of the bug check is the address that the driver attempted to access.)</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the <em>ntstatus.h </em>file located in the<em>inc</em> directory of the Windows Driver Kit.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution </strong></p>
<p><em>If you are not equipped to debug this problem</em>, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques. If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates. Try changing video adapters.
 Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.</p>
<p><em>If you plan to debug this problem</em>, you may find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter 2 (the exception address) should pinpoint the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, this indicates that a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system was started with the<strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly, make sure a kernel debugger
 is connected and the system is started with the<strong>/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame will supply additional information.</p>
<p>If the specific cause of the exception is unknown, the following should be considered:</p>
<p><em>Hardware incompatibility. </em>First, make sure that any new hardware installed is listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.</p>
<p><em>Faulty device driver or system service. </em>In addition, a faulty device driver or system service might be responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.</p>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS
 file system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you need to start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote control program. If such software is installed, the service can be removed by starting the system using the Recovery Console and deleting the offending
 system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x1E. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS might also resolve the error. You should also run hardware
 diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is a system BIOS incompatibility. BIOS problems can be resolved by upgrading the system BIOS version.</p>

<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (Major drivers and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Copy them to the Desktop or Documents folder. Then you can upload them. If more than<br />
a few please ZIP them up in one ZIP first. Upload to the SkyDrive or a file sharing site and<br />
be sure to post the link to that site in a message here.<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors especially tiny speed differences between sticks that<br />
appear to be identical. Faster memory always has to be in front of slower memory so you<br />
may need to work the memory around in different patterns and groups.<br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps. </p>

<h2>            All rollup updates fail to install</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>since a few months the monthly rollups fail to install. Windows Update shows me that there are no new update available for my computer. However if I take a look at the update history I can see that the monthly rollups have not been installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I download a rollup from the update catalog the install process will fail with an error telling me that this particular rollup is not suitable for my computer (which is wrong since I downloaded the correct version fro the update catalog).&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>This is what update.log shows:<br />

</p><p>The first link lets me reinstall the update stack. This was one if the first things I tried. No success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second link is not really related to my problem. The update stack is current. Searching for updates is speedy but does not find any updates although monthly rollups are marked as failed. Furthermore any attempt to install any rollup fails. Only non-rollup
 updates will successfully install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thanks for your help but the problem is still there. Maybe you and others have any more ideas that I could try.</p>

<em>without</em> quoting my post:</p>

</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase <em>the computer?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Sony; Lenovo)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. Did Win7 64-bit come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it, did you do a clean install of Win7,
<em>or did you upgrade&nbsp;a (e.g., Vista; WinXP)&nbsp;computer to Win7? </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1d. Has Windows 10 ever been installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1e. Have&nbsp;you ever done a Repair Install and/or a clean install of Windows 7?</p>

<p>7a. How long have the "monthly rollups" been failing to install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7b. May I assume that KB4012215, KB3212646, KB3207752, KB3197868, and KB3185330 have all failed to install (and are therefore listed in your
<strong>Update History</strong> as failed updates - assuming you've never run the Windows Update troubleshooter or reset Windows Update manually)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8a. Is&nbsp;<span>KB3020369</span> listed in <strong>Installed Updates</strong> [1] (<em>not just
<strong>Update History</strong></em>) and if so, when (exact date) was it installed?</p>

<p>
</p><p>10b. What Update Version &amp; KB number are displayed in the <em>second line of text</em> in IE11's Help | About [<strong>Alt+H+A</strong>] tab; e.g.,

9. Is Firefox <em>version 53</em> (or higher) and/or Google Chrome <em>version </em>
<em>58</em> (or higher) or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Juego que compr&#233; en la Windows Store no se guard&#243; en mi biblioteca &#91;Translation - Game I bought on the Windows Store was not saved in my library&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hace como 6 meses compré Halo Wars 2 Standard Edition. Para eso lo pagué por medio de unos de los métodos de pago en efectivo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luego me dieron como un código y lo ingresé en mi cuenta de Microsoft e instalé el juego en mi computadora.<br />
</p>
<p>Recientemente reinicie mi computador a sus valores originales, predeterminados, porque estaba muy lento y seguramente tenía virus.</p>
<p>Y en cuanto ingresé mi cuenta Microsoft para volver a descargar el juego este no estaba en mi biblioteca.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No entiendo por qué no se guardó, si por ejemplo en Steam eso no es un problema. Uno compra un juego y este se guarda en la biblioteca de uno. Pero este no fue el caso.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ahora cuando busco el juego en la Windows Store ¡me sugiere que tengo que comprarlo de nuevo! Eso no es justo. Necesito que por favor me colaboren solucionando este problema.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p><strong>[Mod Translation -&nbsp;About 6 months ago I bought Halo Wars 2 Standard Edition. For that I paid through one of the methods of payment in cash.
</strong><br />
<strong>Then they gave me as a code and I entered it into my Microsoft account and installed the game on my computer.</strong><br />
<strong>I recently restart my computer to its original default values, because it was very slow and probably had viruses.</strong><br />
<strong>And as soon as I entered my Microsoft account to download the game again this was not in my library.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I do not understand why it was not saved, if for example on Steam that is not a problem. One buys a game and it is stored in one's library. But this was not the case.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now when I look for the game in the Windows Store suggests that I have to buy it again! That's not fair. I need you to please assist me in solving this problem.]</strong></p>

<p>Hi Monico,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us with this issue. Since you redeemed the code for Halo Wars 2 but after your computer reset it wasn't listed in your games, in order to re-download the game to your computer, you'll want to search the Microsoft store for it.
 Once you find the version you own, it should say "Install" then you can select it and the download and installation will begin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option would be to <a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
sign into your Microsoft account</a> and go into Payment &amp; Billing to view your order history to confirm that that account is the one that the code was redeemed to. Once you confirm that its the correct account, you should then be able to
<a href="https://xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">sign into your Xbox account</a>, go to My Games and then select your game to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps out and please let us know the results.</p>
        </p>

    <title>Unable to log in with a PIN - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottseverance  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to log in with a PIN</h2>
                    <div>
<p>After my computer decided to run some updates, I was unable to login with my PIN. I had to do a password reset. I'm trying to re-enable the PIN, but I'm having difficulties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in Settings &gt; Accounts ? Sign-in options. Under the PIN section, I should see an option to change or reset my PIN. However, that option doesn't appear. Instead, there's a button labeled Add.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When clicking the Add button, I get the following dialog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Making sure it's you</strong></p>
<p>We need to verify your identity for *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p><em>[PIN entry box]</em></p>
<p>I forgot my PIN [When clicked, changes to: You can reset your PIN by going to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in options. Which is where I am, and no, I can't reset it there.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No matter what I enter in the box, it disappears once I enter the same number of characters as the length of the PIN I had been using, regardless of which characters I enter. When the dialog closes, nothing further happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I set a PIN?</p>

<h2>            Receiving skype calls.</h2>
                    The problem we have is that incoming calls do not ring on the laptop unless the skype window is open. So, if a contact calls us when we are viewing another website or emailing, for example, there is no way of knowing that there is an incoming call. Our
 skype account is on our pc and the laptop is on the same account. Can anyone help, please?

    <title>MS Has killed the community... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frag monger  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Has killed the community...</h2>
                    
<p>When the original Xbox launched, Microsoft was really into it.&nbsp; They built&nbsp;a strong and supportive COMMUNITY for Xbox users, and keeping that communiyt strong and involved&nbsp;was forefront on their minds.&nbsp; They even had a whole staff at MS devoted to the development
 of the Xbox COMMUNITY.&nbsp; No longer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember Trixie?&nbsp; LONG gone, along with the majority of those who ran the COMMUNITY in days past.&nbsp; Sad.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now... things have really, really changed.&nbsp; MS no longer seems to listen to it's users.&nbsp; The visionaries who put Xbox on the map in the first palce have moved on to new jobs, new places, and their lack of involvement with the Xbox brand CLEARLY shows.&nbsp; Xbox
 has become nothing more than a consumer product to MS.&nbsp; They no longer seem to care about or are very involved in the community (unless/except when a VERY public photo-op or potential for a widespread media article&nbsp;presents itself).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, I have watched in horror as the strong and supportive Xbox community I used to Love crumbled before my eyes.&nbsp; MS no longer lends virtually any support to fan/blog sites (they used to offer a LOT of support to these types of
 sites &amp; even have occasional 'community days' at MS, where people who ran fan sites/blog could come to MS - no longer), they no longer seem to really care about the user.&nbsp; We're just a number to them now and they'll do what they want regardless of how the
 COMMUNITY feels about it (these HORRIBLE forums are a good example!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mods/VIPS used to be very involved with the community - virtual ambassadors for the Xbox brand - now, for the most part (there are a very few exceptions), it's beome nothing more than mods who do nothing but STRICTLY enforce (or rather over-enforce)
 the rules and VIP's who are nothing more than an 'elitists' club - where they constantly brag about what extras and benefits being a VIP affords them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the fun here is gone.&nbsp; And the forum redesign no longer even makes it a good place to search for/find helpful information/users.&nbsp; You can't keep track of what you post/reply to nearly as easily as before - and many won't make the extra effort it takes
 (understandable - everything on the forums that used to take ONE step now takes THREE or more!&nbsp; Worst redesign in history!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RIP MS' care about Xbox &amp; it's loyal Xbox fans/customers.&nbsp; <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-6.gif" />&nbsp;

<p>Also agreed...it could be due to Xbox Live's growing popularity as well. Back in the days of yore, it was easy to have a close knit community - things have gotten bigger since launch. Still sad though. (Insert forever alone face here)</p>

 choose.&nbsp; The 10 little dots at the top just send you to a&nbsp;&nbsp; dial pad.&nbsp; That's not helpful.&nbsp; Your website say you can chat but there is no option to choose chat.&nbsp; all you get are the frequently asked questions or putting in a community questions.&nbsp; HELP

<p>
</p><p>If this is happening to certain contacts only, the issue might not be on your end. You may ask them to check their audio settings or if there are loose connections.</p>

    <title>DVD&#47;CD Drive Error - Code 19 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cloby  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVD&#47;CD Drive Error - Code 19</h2>
                    
<p>I have a TSSTcorp TS-L632D DVD+RW drive that is giving me errors. CD's will not run when inserted into the drive, and when I open My Computer, the drive doesn't even appear. Under the Device Manager I can see the device with a warning icon next to it. Under
 properties it gives me the following error:<br />
<br />
Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (Code 19)<br />
<br />
I have run the automated Microsoft tool and it was unable to fix the problem. After looking around a bit, I think the problem may have to do with using Roxio CD software that came with my problem. There are several forums that have mentioned similar problems
 after using this program. I have found several solutions online, but I don't trust them enough to mess with registry settings on my PC. Any help would be awesome. Here's some more information about my PC that may be useful. Feel free to ask any other questions
 so that I can help you help me. Thanks!<br />
<br />
Also, I recently downloaded the free edition of Alcohol 52% to create a virtual drive on my machine. This drive is experiencing the same problem as the TSST one if that helps.<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
<br />
Problem:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is&nbsp;incomplete or damaged. (Code 19)<br />
<br />
Drive:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TSST TS-L632D<br />
OS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32-Bit Windows Vista<br />
PC Model:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dell Inspiron 1501<br />
<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said it fixed the problem, but that the problem may still exist (?), which it does.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Checked manufacturer's website for updated driver. Did not work.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Roxio, or other players/programs that use the drive, could be the cause and you may need to<br />
uninstall them and then run through these a 2nd time.<br />
<br />
Code 19 means there is a driver conflict such as two devices trying to use the same resources.<br />
<br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total process which
<br />
solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab - click<br />
Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT
<br />
this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose cable or<br />
slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

<br />
The CD drive or the DVD drive does not work as expected on a computer that you upgraded to Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929461</span></a><br />
<br />
When you insert a CD or a DVD, Windows Vista may not recognize the disc<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD burn and
<br />
CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others do so properly.
<br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some registry entries<br />
that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause. <br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the correct<br />
Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course as there will
<br />
other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD drive
<br />
from someone with the same model.<br />
<br />
Forums - a lot of real expert help<br />

<p>&nbsp; The first troubleshooting option you can try is Microsoft's own Windows 10 Troubleshooter for Windows Update. In the Windows 10 Creators Update, you can find it in Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot, click Windows Update then click
<strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are running Windows 10 Anniversary Update or an earlier version of Windows, click Start, type: troubleshooting, hit Enter then launch the Windows Update troubleshooter.
</p>
<p>You can run the troubleshooter a couple times to see if it helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:<br />
&nbsp;Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive.
 Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.<br />
<br />
2. Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;net stop wuauserv<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;net stop cryptSvc<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;net stop bits<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;net stop msiserver<br />
<br />
3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old<br />
<br />
4. Now, let’s restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Typethe following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; net start wuauserv<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; net start cryptSvc<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; net start bits<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; net start msiserver<br />
<br />
5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it and then restart the computer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<p>I recently had my xbox 360 break, and a friend loaned me his xbox, he forgot to tell me his xbox was banned... But whatever. So I put my unbanned HDD in the Banned Xbox and recovered gamertag ect. I can go online, use netflix, all the good stuff, but some
 of my saved files are now corrupted. Mass Effect 2 and Resident Evil 5 are corrupted... but Call of Duty Black Ops and Fable 3 are still good.. is this a known issue?</p>
<p>Resident Evil 5 was a Marketplace download directly to my Hard Drive, the game works, but the save file keeps comming up "Failed to Load." For Mass Efeect 2 a message popped up on the start menu saying multiple files are corrupted, would you like to delete
 the files? So im not sure whats going on.</p>

<p>Go to the memory section of the system settings blade on the dashboard, locate your saves and check to see if there's an exclamation point next to any of them, if there is then they're lost. Whether this is a consequence of the console being dodgy or an
 unwelcome conincidence I don't know. If the console was banned you wouldn't be able to go online with it by the way.</p>

<p><span>A banned console can no longer create signed content, such as saved games and profiles. I suspect that you just didn't try playing the games with uncorrupted saves, or you didn't make any progress that needed to
 be saved.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>As another gamer said, you'll need to find the corrupted files in your System Settings (under Memory) and delete them. There's no way to fix the "corruption".<br />

<h2>            Error 25003 when trying to install Office XP on 64bit Windows 7 Home Premium</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought a new haddrive and Windows 7 Home Premium. I installed the 64 bit version of Windows 7 and am trying to install Office XP and I get the Error 25003 that a file is corrupted. I can hook up my old harddrive with Windows XP on it and this disk
 installs just fine, so there doesn't seem to be a problem with the actual disk.</p>
<p>I tried copying all the files to the harddrive and installing from there, but it will not copy OFFICE1.CAB and says the files is corrupted. On my windows XP drive, the file copies just fine.</p>
<p>This is a brand new install of Windows 7. I installed it on a brand new HDD and then immediately tried to install Office XP.</p>

<p>Hello WayneC67,</p>
<p>In addition to what Andre stated, Windows XP Mode can only be installed on Windows Ultimate, Professional and Enterprise.<br />
Since you have Windows 7 Home Premium, you will not be able to install XP Mode. <br />
<br />
<span>If you run Windows 7 Home Premium, try VirtualBox (<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.virtualbox.org</span></a>) or VMware Player (<a href="http://www.vmware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.vmware.com</span></a>)
 or any other 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party virtualization software and install a separate copy of Windows XP (either Home Edition or Professional) for that purpose.<span>You can find virtualization software free of charge that will run on Windows
 7 Home Premium.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely, </span></p>
