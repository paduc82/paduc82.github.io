<h2>            Windows Phone - Outlook Sync Issue 85010004</h2>
                    I have a HTC Trophy and Windows Phone 7.5<br />
<br />
I have been unable to get it to connect with my company email at all.&nbsp; I have tried some other methods on these forums like removing the task sync etc. and nothing works.<br />
<br />
According to my IT dept I am using the same Exchange/ActiveSync settings that Andriod, BBerry and iOS users are using to connect to the email and it works fine for all of them.&nbsp; The error I am getting is 85010004.<br />
<br />
Why do Android, BBerry and iOS all work fine with Outlook Exchange but my WINDOWS PHONE doesn't work correctly?<br />
<br />
Is it a server setting that IT has to change for me?&nbsp; What is going on?&nbsp; It is very frustrating to have a Windows Phone, on windows computers and servers and have it not work.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t change margins under Page Setup in Word 2003 &#40;Microsoft Office Professional Edition 2003&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>After PC clean-up/speed-up I can't change margins in my Word documents under "Page Setup". There's a shaded portion on top ruler that won't budge, so I have to pick up the markers individually and move them sideways to lengthen the typing line. It was perfect
 before (same software put into new box, reinstalled, that's all).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've received 2&nbsp;suggestions by email. Tried doing the 1st one but couldn't (changing normal.dot template). So tried the 2nd one, which was changing the margins to my requirement, then pressing "Default" (but it didn't work before, with many attempts, so
 I don't know why it worked this time). Thank you both.</p>

            <p>With Word closed, change your normal.dot template file to read normal.old and then open Word.&nbsp; Word will create a new template.&nbsp; This will, unfortunately, change any other formatting that you may have defaulted to be part of the normal template but if it
 doesn't work, you can delete the new normal.dot file and change the normal.old back to normal.dot and nothing will be changed.</p>

            <p>The alternative to built-in is user-defined (or custom) style. In Word's blank document template, which is being used unless you explicitly chose something different, all styles are built-in.<br />

<p>..... I mean, I could go on for pages, but I'm interested in the generalities in how to do this more than&nbsp;in specific styles. Isn't there an easy&nbsp;way of telling which styles are built-in vs. user-defined? I notice that to the far right of each style there
 is one of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"reverse-P"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"lower case a"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "reverse-P + lower case a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; both underlined"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do these distinguish built-in vs. user-defined? If so, where's the secret decoder ring? (I guess using "BI" vs. "UD" would've been too easy)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS -- A blank MS Word 2007 document only has "Clear All" "Normal" and&nbsp;"Heading 1" styles. Does that mean every other style is a user-defined one? That can't be right.</p>

            One way to find out which styles are built-in vs. user-defined is to try to delete them. If it actually goes away, it was user-defined; if it stays (although possibly reverts from some modified state to its original definition), it was/is built-in.<br />
<br />
The only other way I'm aware of is in a macro. Every style is represented by a Style object, and each Style object has a property named BuiltIn that has the value True if it's a built-in style, or False otherwise. This macro will check every style in the current
 document, and then drop a list of the user-defined styles (if any) into a new blank document for you to refer to. See

<br />
Regarding your PS: A new blank document contains definitions of all the styles present in your Normal.dotm template (which are all built-in unless you created user-defined styles and chose the "New documents based on this template" option in the New Style dialog).
 The Style pane can show all of them, or only those that are currently "in use" or "recommended".<br />
<br />
To change what the pane shows, click the Options link at the bottom and change the setting in the "Select styles to show" dropdown. You can also change which styles are "recommended", by clicking the Manage Styles button (the third of the three similar buttons
 at the bottom of the Styles pane), clicking the Recommend tab of the dialog, and using the "Show", "Hide", and "Hide until used" buttons.<br />

            When you delete a style, you are deleting it from the document, but not from Word. And whether a style remains in all styles pane depends on whether it is a built-in style and on the view set in the Style Pane options.<br />
<br />
Recommend view shows the recommended styles that are available for use whether they are in the document or not. So deleting a built-in style from a document indeed does delete it from the document, but the recommend view still shows the style as still available
 for use --but with its built-in settings. A deleted custom (user-defined) style will no longer appear in the list.
<br />
<br />
The All-styles view shows all the styles that are not marked <span style="font-style: italic">
hide</span><span> <span>or</span></span> that are marked <i>hide until used</i> but have been used.&nbsp; Again, deleting a built-in style from a document indeed does delete it from the document, but the all styles view still shows it as available for use --with
 its built-in settings. A deleted custom (user-defined) style will no longer appear in the list.
<br />
<br />
The In-current-document view shows the styles that are actually used in the document.&nbsp; Any style that can be deleted from a document will disappear from the list.<br />
<br />
The In-use view shows all the styles that are or have been used in the document and its template (at the time the document was created). Any style that can be deleted from a document will disappear from the list.<br />
<br />
The&nbsp; remove&nbsp; from Quick Style Gallery command is different from delete from document.&nbsp; I've not noticed any styles remaining after being removed.&nbsp;

<p>Are you sure that styles once set to be included in the gallery will always resurface? I haven't been able to reproduce that behavior (within the document that was open when you chose to remove the style, that is).

            Stefan,<br />
<br />
Oh good.&nbsp; It's gone.&nbsp; The behavior was there in September, the last time I had a job where I deleted some styles from a client's style set.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I was working in the document, pasting from other documents, applying styles and such, styles would be added to
 the gallery--always near the front indicating that the recommend value was 1. Some of them were styles I had previously deleted from the gallery. &nbsp; I think a poster here also complained about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I can't duplicate it today, though. So I will edit my reply.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>In 2010 you can turn track change on and off on the Word status bar at the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; I believe that also works in 2003.</p>
<p>If you don't see the option in 2010 right click the status bar and choose Track Changes.&nbsp; Then a button will appear on the status bar to let you turn this feature on and off.</p>

<p><span>It sounds like you're using Track Changes. If you don't want to track changes in your document then you'll need to turn off Track
 Changes (On the Review tab, in the Tracking group, click Track Changes) and then Accept all changes in the document, also found on the Review tab.
</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to track changes but don't want to see formatting changes on the screen, then on the Review tab, in the Tracking group,
 click Show Markup and turn off Formatting.&nbsp;Or you can use the Final view to suppress them from view on your screen. Note, however, anytime you turn off the view of track changes, they'll only be suppressed from your view and others will be able to see the
 revisions if they open the document. The only way to prevent track changes from being created is to not use track changes.

<h2>            Office 365, Office 2010 and Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 365 loaded on Windows 7, but also have my previous Office 2010 installation too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time Windows Update installs new Office 2010 patches, I need to do some form of (re)install of Office 365 for it to work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried a number of ways but want to know if I have hit upon the best one:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel&gt;Programs and Features</p>
<p>Navigate to 'Microsoft Office 365'</p>
<p>Right Click, </p>
<p>Change and then </p>
<p>Quick Repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst retaining Office 2010, is there a better way to get Office 365 (2016) back in control?</p>

<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-in/article/Office-2010-and-Office-2013-side-by-side-eb569695-ce97-4841-831e-236f095f7803?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-IN&amp;ad=IN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-in/article/Office-2010-and-Office-2013-side-by-side-eb569695-ce97-4841-831e-236f095f7803?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-IN&amp;ad=IN</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue still persist as a work around you may stop Office updates by checking

Give me updates for other Microsoft products when I update Windows</a>&nbsp;which would stop updating Office and other Microsoft products updating. Then you can choose to update Office 365 manually by going to FILE&gt;Account&gt;Office updates&gt;Update Now.</p>

            <p>Thanks Varghaman S, </p>
<p>I looked at the link you supplied and it covers well how to set up a computer to run the two versions of Office together but doesn't quite go far enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the situation where Office 2016 (365) and Office 2010 are both installed, Only one Outlook (2016) is being used. and File Associations are allocated to Office 2016. If Office 2010 is now updated by Windpws Update, the File Associations revert to Office
 2010!</p>
<p>What I was hoping to find out is: What is the best way of keeping Office 2010 current with patches while, at the same time, using Office 365 (2016) applications as my usual ones.</p>
<p>So, is the 'repair' set of instructions in my post above the best way?&nbsp; Or, is there another, better, way?</p>

            <p>Hi Palcouk,</p>
<p>I started off in December thinking I would be better off not uninstalling it yet as my Wife runs 2010 and it can be useful to be able to reproduce any problems she has.</p>
<p>Other than that, it's confidence. I use Office every day and am happy with 365/2016 now for just about everything.</p>
<p>Maybe it is the time to remove it from my PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding my question, it would be good to know the answer, I'm aware that another person has this problem too.</p>
<p>
John</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just wondering if you know how to stop the arrows from becoming distorted? I tried to make a flowchart in Word, and the arrows look beautifully neat, but after saving it they become really weird - the shape goes odd. I've had to save it as a PDF and
 then cut and paste into my document as this is the only way they retain their shape, but I'm wondering firstly, if anyone else has had this issue and secondly, if there's a way to remedy it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            OneNote - Keeps reverting back to old Section Names and section locations within the notebook after sync.</h2>
                    
<p>When&nbsp;changing the names of sections from "New Section 1" to an actual section title and or moving the section to a section group (or even deleting a section), and after syncing to Office Live, the section name reverts back to the "New Section 1" and goes
 back to its original location.&nbsp; How do i "make it stick?"&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Problems with build 10162 on a surface pro 2</h2>
                    <p>I have been running into a few problems with build 10162 on the surface pro 2 I own running windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, the wifi doesn't work right. The computer sees the wifi chip but I can't turn the damn thing on. I tried tapping and clicking the wifi button in the taskbar and it didn't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, none of my settings are saving, my desktop was rearanged, dpi settings changed back to default and those settings do not save at all when I log out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had these problems and more importantly, have they found out how to fix them?</p>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing.<br />
<br />
1. Did the issue started only after upgrading to the Build 10162?<br />
2. How did you upgrade to the latest Build 10162 through clean install or upgraded from Build 10159?<br />
<br />
If you have upgraded from Build 10159, then I would suggest you to download the ISO from the following link and install.<br />
<br />

</span><span><br />
</span><span><strong>Note: </strong>When you perform a clean install make sure you backup all the data.<br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span></p>

<h2>            Not Receiving Emails from Sender on my safe list</h2>
                    <p>I was regularly receiving emails from&nbsp;a sender&nbsp;with no problems until December 2013. The emails are not in my junk folder and the&nbsp;sender insists that they are sending the emails. I have responded to the questions from other post below. I appreciate your
 help in resolving this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>• Does issue persists when using a different internet browser?&nbsp;<strong> Yes</strong><br />
• Does it also persist when using a different computer? <strong>Yes</strong><br />
• Is there any error message? If so, please provide the complete and exact error message.&nbsp;<strong> No error message</strong><br />
• What were the actions you have taken prior to this issue? <strong>Check spam and verify sender is on safe list.

<h2>            LUMIA 1520 Touch issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>can you please help me in fixing my phone as the screen starts shaking up automatically and my touch stops working at the same time. Cortana too pops up suddenly, due to which i am unable to perform or work properly with these issues. To fix the touch i
 generally lock my screen and unlock it back but sometimes while inserting my pin i face the same issue. It automaticay types sone nos then delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried soft and hard reset but still see the same issue over and over again. Please let me know if there is any fix for this.</p>
<p>

Thanks</p>

            <p>turn off "use touch screen with most types of gloves". if you are running windows 10, go to settings-&gt;extras-&gt;touch</p>
<p>
</p><p>i don't remember where it is found on windows 8.1 - you might have to search for it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Calculating Processors take too long in a spreadsheet</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a spreadsheet that isn't that in-depth but when entering data it seems to want to recalculate across the 4 processors every time - there aren't many formula included but sheets are linked together to form summary pages.&nbsp; Only 7 sheets included in
 the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea on why it is very slow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Michelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It doesn't matter how many formulas you have in a single Excel file as long as it's long, you'll experience slow or long calculating process than the normal. Usually, you'll experience long or slow calculating process if the formula you are using is too
 long that needs to check every single data in the file. Just to add, if you have chosen the automatic calculation, formulas will automatically recalculate when you make any changes. However, we still need to determine what's causing the issue. That being said,
 the issue you are experiencing may be caused by the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Corrupted data / corrupted file<br />
</li><li>Used long formulas</li><li>Automatic calculation is on</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed with the troubleshooting steps, we'd like to know more about this concern. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is this the first time that you encountered this issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li><li>Have you tried recreating the said file?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Reply to us with the information so that we can assist you better.</p>

<p>I have managed to speed things up by removing obsolete FORMAT CONDITIONS - but it still takes 2 hits on the enter button for data to populate in a cell - which I have never seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have repaired office online and opened in safe mode and neither worked.&nbsp; Before I recreate (which will take a while) is there anything else you can advise on?</p>

<p>
</p><p>The issue you are experiencing in Excel may have something to do with your Office or with the computer itself. As per our previous response, this issue may trigger if you have used long formulas. However, Excel can still calculate long formulas as long as
 the computer permits by the use of the computer's RAM. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two things that we can do to resolve this concern. First, we will completely uninstall and reinstall your Office. Kindly follow the instructions under
<strong>Option 2 - Completely uninstall Office 2016 with the easy fix tool</strong> through this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. If uninstalling and reinstalling your Office doesn't work, we advise turning off the automatic calculation by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on the <strong>File </strong>tab.</li><li>Select <strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Formulas</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Calculation options</strong>, select <strong>Manual</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps you. In case you need further assistance, don't hesitate to post back.</p>

<p>I haven't tried uninstalling as its only this document that I have the issue with and was just wondering if I had added in something that will make it calculate constantly plus when you enter something in a cell the delay once enter is pressed is quite long.</p>

            Your problem will undoubtedly be that of Word's inability to override the printer driver which it interrogates to format the document. Word will only use page sizes that the printer driver will allow, and 4.3" x 12" is not one of them. You will have to
 setup a standard page size that the custom page size will actually fit on then make up the difference with the margins.

    <title>Where are the back-up files for Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> walter seaton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where are the back-up files for Word</h2>
                    I have upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and from Office 2003 to Office 365 (2016?). Previously when I opened a Word document which I had created and made some changes, Word 2003 left a backup copy of the pre-changed document in the Explorer. This
 does not seem to be happening anymore. Is there any way of getting it back, because it prevented some mini disasters for me on previous occasions.

<p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the situation, I'd like to confirm the following things:</p>
<p>1. Do you sign into OneNote Clipper with Microsoft account or work/school account?
</p>
<p>2. Access OneNote Online with the same account, check if notebooks can be opened without problems.
</p>
<p>3. Change to another location to see if the issue is related to a specific notebook.
</p>
<p>4. Do you sync/open your notebooks with OneNote for Mac? If yes, is there any error message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>
</p><p>Do you have work/school account or other Microsoft account? Please check if the issue is related to a specific account. Meanwhile, as you mentioned that Safari itself doesn't work properly. Please try the following two options to check the outcome.
</p>
<p>Option 1.<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Access Mac safe mode</a>.
</p>
<p>Option 2. <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25796?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create a new Mac account.</a></p>

            Method 1: Click in the desired entry box in the matrix. Type the characters before the subscript, then type an underscore, and then type the characters of the subscript. For example, x sub 12 would be typed as&nbsp; x_12 . Then press the space bar, and the
 subscript will appear. This works both with and without a matrix. For a superscript, use a caret instead of an underscore, as in x^2 to write x squared.<br />
<br />
Method 2: Click in the desired entry box in the matrix. On the Equation Tools tab of the ribbon, click the Script button and click the Subscript template (the second one in the top row). The entry box now shows a smaller box to the right, where you enter the
 subscript.<br />

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and I appreciate your efforts taken to resolve the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to <strong>Manually reset the Windows Updates Components</strong> and check if it helps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Resetting Windows Update Components&nbsp;will fix corrupt Windows Update Components and help you to install the Windows Updates.&nbsp;Please follow the below steps to reset the Windows Updates Components:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong> on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Stop the <strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer </strong>and the <strong>
Windows Update Services</strong>. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop wuauserv</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop cryptSvc</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop bits</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop msiserver</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Now rename the <strong>SoftwareDistribution</strong> and <strong>Catroot2</strong> folder. You can do this by typing the&nbsp;following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Now, let’s restart the <strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</strong> and the
<strong>Windows Update Services</strong>. Type </span><span>the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the
<strong>ENTER</strong> key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start wuauserv</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start cryptSvc</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;net start bits </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start msiserver</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. Type <strong>Exit </strong>in the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> to close it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now you may try running the Windows Updates and check if the above steps resolve the issue.</span></p>
