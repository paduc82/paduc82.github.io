<h2>            Can the Skype To Go calls inexpectedly go through local operator&#63;</h2>
                    Unexpectedly our Skype To Go calls went through local opetator. And we noticed that after we received a big bill to be paid. Who should be ressponsible for that? Is it Skype failure or local operator's?

</p><p>Skype is only charging you directly to your Skype&nbsp;account itself&nbsp;and your local network carrier is charging you as local rates for Skype to go calls.&nbsp;I suggest you to contact your local network provider&nbsp;for further information about your bill.</p>

            Thank You, Kenneth, for Your reply. The situation is that for some reasons we don't know - our calls disappeared from Skype To Go calls and went through local operator. We chaneged nothing, just did regular Skype To Go calls. It was some kind of throw
 off of readdressing the calls. After weak it cames back in normal ( We went abroad and make a call with another operator. The Skype ToGo calcalksls were back again.) We do not want to pay our local operator, because it should be Skype To Go calls - not local-and
 for 2 years we monthly pay Skype for that. We try to find out who is responsible for that...

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is good to know that you have not changed anything on your end, thus the calls should default to your Skype-to-go.&nbsp;However, we have checked here that the last time you used Skype-to-go was dated May 9. I suggest you to check you usage by opening this
 link: <strong><a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/usage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype calls usage</a></strong>. Filter your calls starting May 1.</p>

<p>Dear Kenneth,</p>
<p>I cheked our usage.&nbsp; I am speaking about June and about only one Skype To Go number (+.......308)</p>
<p>June 2 and 4 - calls go through Skype To Go. </p>
<p>Starting from June 5 till June 14 (20:16) - calls went through Telia mobile operator. And I've got 130 Eur. bill for that week.</p>
<p>June 14 (20:46)&nbsp; - call went through Skype To Go.</p>
<p>June 15 - Skype To Go.</p>
<p>And we stopped calling that number because of such strange things. I sent a query to Telia, but they still keep silence :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You for Your help!</p>

            Hi, go to the pivot table, in the ribbon look for Change data source, it will show the range you have, to extend it just holding the Shift key go to the last cell you want to include

<h2>            Losing internet connection on Wi-Fi &#40;Nokia E52&#41;</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Hi Everyone!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I have:</strong></p>
<p>1) PC (Windows 7) with ASDL internet (D-Link DSL-200) and USB Wi-Fi Adapter (TP-Link TL-WN821N)</p>
<p>2) Two netbooks (Windows XP)</p>
<p>3) Smartphone Nokia E52</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I want to:</strong> share the Internet from PC to other devices via Wi-Fi adapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> on PC Wi-Fi connection disconnects with smartphone. But on smartphone, connection is active, the smartphone sends the packets, but the PC is not responding</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Updates, drivers, firmware:</strong></p>
<p>Windows 7 - all the latest updates.</p>
<p>Windows XP - all the latest updates.</p>
<p>D-Link DSL-200 - installed the latest driver.</p>
<p>TP-Link TL-WN821N - installed the latest driver.</p>
<p>Nokia E52 - installed the latest firmware (091.003 \ 03-Apr-2012)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was standing on a PC Windows XP. First I tried the program Connectify Pro. Speed is low, not always connected. I created connection manually by Ad-Hoc mode (I manually prescribed IP and DNS addresses). On netbooks, connection is good!
<strong>But the problem is with the smartphone</strong>. Sometimes the connection is lost, on PC Wi-Fi connection disconnects with smartphone. But on smartphone, connection is active, the smartphone sends the packets, but the PC is not responding. I thought,
 that USB Wi-Fi adapter's power saving is active, but it was disabled. My friend recommended installing Windows 7. I’ve install it.
<strong>The same thing ...</strong> (on PC Wi-Fi connection disconnects with smartphone. But on smartphone, connection is active, the smartphone sends the packets, but the PC is not responding). Situation is the same in Ad Hoc mode and in SoftAP using MS Virtual
 Wi-Fi or Connectify Pro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is there any solution?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way! I forgot to say, if any of netbook will be connected to the PC via Wi-Fi, the smartphone does not lose internet connection, but turning off the netbook creates the same problem after minutes (on PC Wi-Fi connection disconnects with smartphone.
 But on smartphone, connection is active, the smartphone sends the packets, but the PC is not responding).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi connection on netbooks is good, internet works, no disconnects.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read on the Russian forums, that such a disease is on all Nokia S60 smartphones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Sorry for my bad English.</p>

<p>Hi AssIsBack,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback and welcome to the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description I make it you are creating the ad-hoc connection using the&nbsp;<span>TP-Link TL-WN821N? As a general rule it is not advisable to use ad-hoc for 'permanent' WLAN connections. This is more intended for quick 'point to point' connections and
 is generally considered to be both unstable and insecure. Also it could be you are using the same USB hub on your PC to connect both the modem and the WLAN interface which may cause these two devices to interfere with each other.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would strongly suggest you replace the&nbsp;<span>D-Link DSL-200 with a modem which has a WLAN accesspoint built in. You will find this will increase your networks dependability and speed. It will also allow you to have your PC turned off and still be
 able to use WLAN with your phone.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>What you are experiencing is inherent of an ad-hoc WLAN connection. A proper WLAN accesspoint will provide a much more stable setup.</p>

</p><p>I was asked to convert my skype account into Microsoft account, and since after this I cannot log in anymore on my mobile or Skype app.</p>
<p>On the other hand I can log into the Microsoft account with the same credentials without any problem - using Chrome, which means the account is OK but the apps are not.</p>
<p>I have some credit in my Skype account that I was using for calls or SMS, which is now lost because I cannot use it!</p>
<p>How is this possible?</p>
<p>And no, I don't want to upgrade to the latest Skype application, because there is no more SMS in it! I want to continue using the same Skype app that I used for months until yesterday.</p>

<p>Hello DimoValev,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Older versions of Skype are no longer working. It is necessary for you to update the Skype version to be able to log back in to your account and use the new and improved services and features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While we understand that you do not want to upgrade the Skype version for your mobile due to SMS unavailability, we suggest to use Skype on a different
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype?q=system+requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
supported platforms</a>&nbsp;or Skype for Web.</p>

<p>Hello Karen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand what you mean, but can you explain this please:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my laptop, my Skype worked very well until 2 days ago... then it stopped working after the password reset, and there is no way I can log in again. The password is just not accepted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, I use Skype in my office, on another laptop, and this other account
<strong>works fine </strong>and CAN SEND SMS without any problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means it is not the app version that makes the problem, but the Microsoft account, that I was FORCED to create after the password reset, no other explanation is possible. Does it mean that if I reset my Skype password at the office it will also stop
 working? How is this attitude friendly to your customers? I am sincerely amazed to see this happening in 2017...
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Also: what happens to the credit that I have in Skype that I cannot use anymore for SMS? Who will reimburse it to me?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know, anyway I don't think I will continue using your platform; btw I am not the only one who has this problem, I have friends all over the world with the exact same issue - skype not working after a password reset.
</p>

<p>Hello Karen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I logged in and saw your message. I cannot contact support and there is nobody to answer my question live.</p>
<p>I have spent 5 minutes browsing the community posts without finding the answer, and I don't have more time to deal with Microsoft's problems.</p>
<p>All I want to know in a simple phrase is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Why can't I log into Skype after being obliged to create a Microsoft account? It is impossible both on my mobile and laptop.</p>
<p>2. Why, on another computer and with another account, I still can log in and use Skype (older version), send SMS etc, but on my new computer, with a newer version of Skype - I cannot do it, using a Microsoft account? Is there segregation of the users? What
 is this discrimination?&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. I think you don't have the right to block accounts and oblige your CLIENTS to update. Moreover, I have money in the account, and in case I won't be able to use it anymore, I request this to be refunded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be very happy to receive the answers asap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best</p>
<p>DV</p>

<br />
If you want two separate data series, equally-spaced with regard to the X axis, first create the Line chart for a single data series. Then use the Source Data feature to add the second data series.<br />
<br />
If you want to plot the location of X,Y data points and then connect those points with lines, do not use the Line chart type. Instead, use the XY (Scatter) chart type which can be formatted to include lines.<br />
<br />
If you do want an XY chart, the simplest way is to arrange the data pairs in adjacent columns, one data point X and Y on each row, with X data on the left and the corresponding Y values on the right. Select all data pairs (without selecting text headers), and
 Insert an XY (Scatter) chart type. <br />

<p>Hi Nate,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with the crash moving email to an IMAP account was caused by a change in the service.&nbsp; A new property was introduced that Outlook was not handling well.&nbsp; The Outlook Team has developed a fix for it and it will first release to
<strong>Current Channel</strong> as build 16.0.8229.2073.&nbsp; Fixes for all other versions including MSI are in process but not yet scheduled.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue causing the problem was turned off in the service you should not see issues with new emails that youmove into the IMAP account.&nbsp; The property that the service was stamping on the emails is no longer being applied.&nbsp; Existing emails that you
 moved prior will have the property stamped on it and still cause the issue until you install the client fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need the Outlook 2016 Client to handle the problem today then you could install Office Insider Slow.&nbsp; That channel currently has the fixed build that is going out tomorrow to Current Channel.&nbsp; To install Insider builds see this documentation,

<h2>            Office 365 Email Notification to another email address</h2>
                    <p>I have a work email address and can only view these by login into my account. As I only work casually I would like to set up so that when my work email receives an email it sends an email to my personal email address so I can check the work email. I do not
 want the email itself redirected but a simple email like "You have email in your work account. Please log in to check" (or words similar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if this is possible and how to do it?</p>

<br />
Thanks for your posting. You can use the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/inbox-rules-in-outlook-edea3d17-00c9-434b-b9b7-26ee8d9f5622?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

transport rules</a>&nbsp;(need admin role) to forward or forward as attachment the email sent to you. Meanwhile, you can create the inbox rule to send a text message to your mobile device when emails come to your work email address. But, it might be impracticable
 to send a notification from your internal email address to your external email address when the internal email address receive emails and I have tried to find any solution and workaround about it but in vain. If it is really inconvenient for you and you really
 want such related feature, it’s recommended to <a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
submit a feedback</a> and your comments will be valuable. Thanks for your time and understanding.<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2013 slow to receive emails</h2>
                    I am super frustrated with Outlook 2013 at the moment. I bought Office 2013 because I started a business and Outlook 2013 takes sometimes 20 minutes to receive an email that was received on my iPhone 20 minutes before that. I have a GoDaddy account setup
 with IMAP. I've already reviewed numerous threads and have not been getting anything to work.

            <p>There have been reports on various forums with regard GoDaddy, IMAP and outlook 2013</p>
<p>What integrated anti-virus are you using? and if you start Outlook using the safe switch (Hold the Ctrl Key when starting OL) does that make any difference?</p>

            Not sure I have an integrated anti-virus? I have Microsoft Security Essentials as my only anti-virus program on my computer.
<div><br />
<div>I've never tried the safe switch, but I can give it a go.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Edit: I tried it in safe mode and it's still slow, but not as slow. Seemed like it's only taking 1 - 2 minutes instead of perhaps 10 - 20 minutes. On my iPhone it's practically instant.</div>

            Ok, safe mode isn't doing anything different. I'm still getting emails 10 - 20 minutes later than on my iPhone however sometimes I do get them a bit more timely.
<div><br />
<div>I have been sending several test emails and basically when I receive the email in Outlook, the time it says the email was received is actually different than the actual time it was received in my inbox. Example: Outlook says I received the email at 9:06am
 however it was only actually received at 9:18am according to my computer's clock.</div>

            You're not alone, Ryan. &nbsp;My work account is doing the same exact thing with my emails not getting to me up to an hour or more later, down to not being able to finishing synchronizing subscribed folders.
<div><br />
<div>And today it has additionally taken upon itself to remove all of my emails from my inbox. &nbsp;They're not in the trash or any other folder, and Outlook 2013 Safe Mode doesn't work. &nbsp;Restarting my computer doesn't work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All of the above problems happen with at least two of my other coworkers. &nbsp;Our email accounts go through GoDaddy. &nbsp;My coworkers have McAfee anti-virus installed but I do not (it expired on mine). &nbsp;I disabled all of the add-ins in safe mode and still nothing.
 &nbsp;I have also tried restarting the computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's extremely frustrating as my job requires emails to be sent out very often.</div>

<h2>            I am not able to make outgoing call from my Nokia C7</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I observed one weird thing, I am not able to make any outgoing call from my Nokia C7 with Vodafone Sim inside it. After sometime I put some other card and It started working fine. I thought the problem is with Sim hence I put my Vodafone Sim in other
 phone and It also worked fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I am trying to make call from Nokia C7 with old Vodafone Sim it gives error "NO ANSWER".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I dont understand that why Nokia C7 is not working with Vodafone Sim which was inside it since I purchased the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help as Vodafone customer care has nothing to do as Sim is working fine with other phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Firoz Shaikh</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Did you try a different sim of Vodafone itself? It may be a problem with that particular sim card.

            Hi Ranjitha.
<br />
<br />What version of Windows are you running on your PC?
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager
<br />
<br />Expand the 'Sound, Video and game controllers' section
<br />
<br />Do you see your audio device listed
<br />
<br />If so, does it have an exclamation mark beside it?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Also, ff you are running Windows 10:
<br />
<br />
<br />Right click Your Sound Icon
<br />
<br />Choose 'Playback Devices'
<br />
<br />Clikc your Playback Device in the resulting Dialog and click Properties
<br />
<br />On the second dialog, click on the Enhancements
<br />
<br />Disable all enhancements
<br />
<br />Save and close those dialogs
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - Playing Audio
<br />
<br />Run that troubleshooter to see if it resolves this issue . . .       
        </p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>I have no issues using PowerPoint itself, I can launch any .ppt or .pptx email attachment from Outlook 2013 just fine. Its only the preview function/pane thats an issue, giving the error dialogue as the previewer is starting. &nbsp;To recap my findings;</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Problem does not exist with Office 2013 on Windows 8.0, only Windows 8.1</div>
<div>2. I have verified with another user they get the exact same results Win 8.0 fine, Win 8.1 problem</div>
<div>3. All other Outlook 2013 previewers on Win 8.1 work fine e.g. Word, Excel, Visio, PDF, media file etc.</div>
<div>4. I've run Office repair, but it makes no difference</div>
<div><br />
<div>Its honestly looking like a glitch purely with the 2013 PowerPoint previewer in Outlook 2013 running on Windows 8.1.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards</div>
<div><br />

<p>The suggested solution is not working for PowerPoint 2013. I have unchecked all the items in Trust Center, but I am still unable to preview ppt and pptx attachments in Outlook 2013.</p>

            I agree with Pavel Slavov. &nbsp;I unchecked all items in PowerPoint and Word Trust Center. &nbsp;Still unable to preview ppt attachments in Outlook 2013.
<div><br />
<div>This is a clean Windows 8.1 Enterprise install about 2 weeks ago with Office Professional Plus 2013.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Excel and Word previewers function OK inside Outlook even WITH all three Protected View options checked.</div>

<div>I am able to open Powerpoint files by double clicking (so file associations are correct). &nbsp;And I am able to right click on a Powerpoint file inside of Outlook and select open.</div>

The November 2013 update for Office 2013 has fixed this issue for me. Sorry...can't narrow it down to a specific KB as about 30 of Office related patches just installed on my machine today, November 26, 2013.

<h2>            Microsoft Office Constant Re-Authentication Message</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work for a large IT Company, "TechnologyOne" and we are experiencing issues whereas OfficeProPlus is not allowing users to access or save documents to their OneDrive or Sharpoint folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will constantly ask for authentication through a pop up window but once you sign in, it re prompts and does not allow access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have found this has happened after the Windows 1803 and office updates just recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried the following;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempted Fixes<br />
1. Sign out of office and login.<br />
2. Remove all Office Credentials from the Credentials Manager<br />
3. Remove Regedit entries as per Solutions in SD<br />
4. Run the CMD for Office Licence<br />
5. Uninstall and reinstall.<br />
6. Created new user account - same issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be much appreciated.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Here's an even more 'dastardly' solution: if the date is on or after the specified date, then the workbook immediately closes after an announcement that the license has expired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This goes into the ThisWorkbook code module</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub Workbook_Open()<br />
&nbsp; Dim termDate As Date<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; termDate = #3/1/2014 12:00:00 PM#<br />
&nbsp; If Now() &gt;= termDate Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "The license on this software has expired.", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vbOKOnly + vbCritical, "License Expired"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ThisWorkbook.Close<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you'll set the VBAProject security to require a password to view the code, then they will have a difficult time even getting to their data.&nbsp; While they can hold the [Shift] key while opening the file to stop the shutdown code from running, then none of
 the other VBA code in the workbook is going to work either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do assign a password to the VBAProject, be sure to keep a copy of the file
<em>without</em> that lockdown so that if you forget the password in the future, you'll have a copy you can open and work with easily.&nbsp; I'd also&nbsp;actually 'write down' the VBAProject password in a .txt file and store it in the same folder on your computer with
 the source files.&nbsp; That helps you remember it, and since presumably others don't have access to your computer, it's still secure.</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer 8 32 bit on Vista 64 bit OS</h2>
                    I am hoping that someone has an answer to this question.&nbsp; I have Vista premium home edition 64 bit and I constantly have issues running the IE8 browser for any length of time.&nbsp; I get the windows not responding pop-up and then the browser re-opens again
 and runs for awhile and then will crash again.&nbsp; I have checked the logs for this type of crash on my system and it states APPCRASH iexplorer.exe and the fault module is NTDLL.DLL.&nbsp; I have tried all the solutions listed as far as running with no add ons, disabling
 add ons, scannow, chkdsk and so forth.&nbsp; I can use the 64 bit version of the browser with no issues, however there is no flash player available for 64 bit so many webpages and content cannot be viewed working with that browser.&nbsp; I would like to use the 32 bit
 version of the browser without it crashing and have not come up with any solution that works.&nbsp; Can someone here point me in the direction of a fix?<br />
<br />
Thanks

    <title>N95 WLAN issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n95_rit  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95 WLAN issues</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
from my experiments with WLAN support in N95 (using fw 10.0.018), I found a few issues that Nokia should look at and solve !<br />
<br />
List of bugs / issues / suggested enhancements<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
* WLAN AP does not have LEAP authentication support. Can't use it in my office network<br />
<br />
* WLAN AP connection is not intuitive - no diagnostic function like ping available - when it says connected to AP, AP shows no connection (from looking at AP logs and status). Only when one browses, connection with AP is made!<br />
<br />
* Web browsing to WLAN AP IP address fails with a mysterious error message. This is a problem of N95 firmware since I am able to browser other IP addresses (of other PCs) connected to the access point.<br />
<br />
* WLAN AP search and connect is quite unreliable. APs appear and vanish w/o moving from the same physical location, and signal strength is 25-50% lower than that seen by my laptop for the same AP :-(<br />
<br />
Hope these issues are addressed in firmware upgrades!<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Ritesh

            Hi Ritesh,<br />
<br />
If WiFi is important to you, don't under any circumstances upgrade to V11. I can not get the phone to get the IP settings automatically (i.e. via DHCP) in any WiFi network, regardles of the security or lack thereof.

<h3> shannon_irind  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#42;In Access 07&#42; - Can an axis in a chart automatically adjust when values increase&#63;</h2>
                    My search on here keeps giving me answers for only Excel, maybe someone can help me with this for MS Access.<br />
<br />
I have a column chart in a report, when I made it at the beginning of the year I set the max of the Y axis at 10,000 (just to start out with and to make sure my chart worked). I did not look at it until now (doing monthly reports), and I see now that after
 I have a months' worth of data and the value has gone beyond the 10,000 value, the scale on the axis did not adjust accordingly. Is there an Auto setting for this? Like Excel's Auto or Fixed options in the Layout tab of a chart? In Design view in my Access
 chart I don't see it, I am hoping I don't have to manually adjust the axis max/min every month.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the help!!<br />

<p>
</p><p>I first noticed the issue a week ago; however it's possible that it dates from the purchase of a new computer with update of Office to 365 (including Outlook 2016) approx 1 month back and I simply didn't have reason to check before.</p>

<p>Hi there&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/1b83a490-7145-4df3-8079-374b0cdebb63" title="ToniIdowu"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">ToniIdowu</span></a> and welcome
 to the Skype Community!<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you specify what Skype and iOS version you are using? Also, what type of file will you be attaching?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that there are limitations in file sharing on Skype. The maximum size limit for a shared file is 300MB.&nbsp;If you send a file that is too large, you'll get the error
<strong>"Not sent - File is larger than 300 MB."</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, to send a file in Skype:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Tap the contact or conversation you want to send a file to. </li><li>Tap the icon that matches what you want to send, or the action you want to take. Click the paper clip icon to expand the menu options if they are not already there.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA3091/how-do-i-send-and-receive-photos-videos-and-other-files-in-skype?q=sending+file" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong> for additional details. Let us know if you need

<h2>            Does Windows Phone 8 support s&#47;mime&#63;</h2>
                    My employer uses s/mime email encryption on their exchange server, and I need to ensure that any mobile phone I get supports s/mime email. Does Windows Phone 8 support s/mime?&nbsp;If not, are there plans to support it in the near future?

    <title>Your Outlook Data File Cannot Be Configured - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> troy fulkerson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Your Outlook Data File Cannot Be Configured</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Office 365 installed locally. Outlook opens and works just fine. But when I open Skype for Business after a minute or so, I get the error "Your Outlook Data File Cannot Be Configured.&nbsp; [my file name](9).nst&nbsp; The 9 is the ninth instance
 of this file since this error started occurring. Never had this problem over the past few years of using Office 365 with Skype for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error is coming from Skype for Business as this is the icon in the task bar that is posting the error message. Error doesn't happen if I never open Skype for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our IT department has received about 10 Help Desk tickets since Friday with this exact issue. &nbsp; I myself am seeing this issue on my Surface Book running these builds:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Pro 1703 15063.296</p>
<p>Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus 1705 8201.2025 First Release for Current Channel (Office Insider Slow)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm worried that as folks update to newer version of Office, we will be seeing this more and more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have our organization set to "<span>First release for everyone &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Get updates early for your entire organization​"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is there a fix for this? &nbsp;Is there a way to roll back to a previous version?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There is thread over on the standard release Office forum where many users are reporting this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_sfb-mso_win10/your-outlook-data-file-cannot-be-configured/b60d74c5-7138-4c7b-852e-2488c97e8e26</p>

    <title>Outlook Contacts - File as Last, First, or First, Last&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook Contacts - File as Last, First, or First, Last&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I currently have my Outlook contacts organized into folders (which the rest of the world calls "Groups", and Outlook has it's own Groups which are entirely different. But that's beside the point). I display the contacts in list view, rather than card or
 one of the others, where the "Display As" in First-Last in alpha order by last name. To me, I find this natural and personal. For example, If I need contact info on my friend "Joe Smith" it just seems more natural to look for that name in the S's.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what about the File As option? The default is Last, First which has been the standard for filing systems every since before the information age. There has always been a certain logic to this because filing systems were often used by more than one person
 and it takes a certain familiarity to look up people by first names. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This logic may still hold true in larger organizations with larger and combined and centralized contact lists. But what are some of other reasons to file names a certain way? Do you have a certain preference or use case to set this a particular way? For
 example. does it help to create targeted mailing lists, or perhaps, print address labels?&nbsp; What about compatibility with devices and syncing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know in the scheme of things, it doesn't matter a great deal. It just makes me wonder why this feature was included. Did the developers have certain use cases in mind, but less common than the default setting? Or did they just do it because they could
 and it only took two lines of code? </p>
