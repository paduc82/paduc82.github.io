<h2>            &#40;broken&#63;&#41; folder icons in windows explorer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>sometimes in windows explorer, some folder icons have been appearing like this:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73f2d7b0-f0f2-4f79-98ce-13de8ee6c208?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73f2d7b0-f0f2-4f79-98ce-13de8ee6c208?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>the folders that appear like this stay like this. if i open them, the contents are all the same and normal. but the icons themselves are like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so far, i've deleted and restored the icon cache followed by a restart and i've relaunched windows explorer using task manager. i'm not sure what's causing this and it's starting to bug me. i'm worried it's a sign of corruption or infection. help would be
 greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>

            Hi, Entropyenigma,
<br />
<br />I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />1. To rule out malware download Windows Defender Offline and run a Full Scan.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17466/windows-defender-offline-help-protect-my-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17466/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Run the following scans which can detect corrupt files and repair them if they are repairable.
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-update/troubleshooting-component-store-system-files/8acbd614-678d-42b9-859c-56d3e6f8342a">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>?
<br />
<br />3. Right Click on Start &gt; Select PowerShell (Admin)
<br />Copy/paste the following commands into the window then Press Enter after each command.
<br />
<br />ie4uinit.exe -ClearIconCache
<br />
<br />taskkill /IM explorer.exe /F
<br />
<br />DEL "%localappdata%\IconCache.db" /A
<br />
<br />DEL "%localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\iconcache*" /A
<br />shutdown /r /f /t 00
<br />
<br />This will rebuild the icon cache.
<br />
<br />4. Restore File Associations - Select Option 2

            Hello my name is Bradford and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I will try to resolve your problem. 
<br />
<br />It sounds like your Icon database in Windows is corrupted and has to be rebuilt. In Windows 10 the procedure is a bit long but I've outlined it below for you:
<br />
<br />To rebuild the icon cache database on Windows 10, close any application that you may be running, and then do the following:
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows Key+R to open the “Run” box. 
<br />2. Type “cmd” into the box and then press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to run the command as an administrator.
<br />3. Type the following command to navigate to the icon cache database location and press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>cd %homepath%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer</code>
<br />
<br />4. Type the following command to verify the icon cache database files are at the location and press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>dir iconcache*</code>
<br />
<br />The output of the dir command should list these database files:
<br />
<br />iconcache_1280.db
<br />iconcache_16.db
<br />iconcache_1920.db
<br />iconcache_256.db
<br />iconcache_2560.db
<br />iconcache_32.db
<br />iconcache_48.db
<br />iconcache_768.db
<br />iconcache_96.db
<br />iconcache_custom_stream.db
<br />iconcache_exif.db
<br />iconcache_idx.db
<br />iconcache_sr.db
<br />iconcache_wide.db
<br />iconcache_wide_alternate.db
<br />
<br />--VERY IMPORTANT about step 5: Once you terminate File Explorer, your desktop background and taskbar will disappear, leaving a black screen — but it's OK, it's only temporarily. You need to close File Explorer to be able to delete the icon cache files. Otherwise, you won't be able to do it.
<br />------
<br />
<br />5. Type the following command to stop File Explorer and press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>taskkill /f /im explorer.exe</code>
<br />
<br />6. Type the following command to delete the iconcache files and press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>del iconcache*</code>
<br />
<br />Note 1: If you get access denied trying to remove the files, you're probably not running Command Prompt with as an administrator. Repeat these steps, but making sure Command Prompt starts with administrative privileges.
<br />
<br />7. Type the following command to verify that you successfully deleted the icon cache files and press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>dir iconcache*</code>
<br />
<br />Note 2: If you still see some iconcache files, then it's likely that some apps are still running, which will prevent you from deleting the database files. Make sure to close them all, and repeat the steps.
<br />
<br />8. Type the following command to start File Explorer and press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>explorer.exe</code>
<br />
<br />9. Close Command Prompt to complete the task.
<br />
<br />Once you completed the steps, Windows 10 will automatically recreate the database files with fresh icons, this should fix the problem
<br />
<br />If following the above steps doesn't resolve the issue please let me know!

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier today my computer crashed into a BSOD and ever since then it is stuck on a BSOD loop when trying to boot into windows.<br />
<br />
Things I have tried so far:</p>
<p>-Booting from a USB Windows&nbsp; (Loads the windows logo then BSOD)<br />
-Letting it do automatic repair (BSOD)</p>
<p>-Letting it do disk check (BSOD)<br />
-Running it with different RAM sticks (BSOD)<br />
-Running it without the 1060 (BSOD)<br />
-Clearing BIOS settings (BSOD)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss. Any help appreciated.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd definitly be able to help you with this BSOD issue you're having, if you have not already repaired the problem yourself. I do, however, need to know the specific Model ID of your PC in order to be of better assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, in order to give you one advanced method you can try right now, it would be to use the BitDefender RescueMe CD to scan your computer's integrity and apply fixes from within that space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read these instructions carefully:</p>
<p>RescueMe CD is downloaded as a .iso file. It's purpose is to scan and clean your system completely without Windows and it's root files ever realizing it is being accessed. This is made possible by creating a Bootable USB with the CD's ISO. It can do that
 because the program itself is more than just that, it is also a derivative of a Linux Open-Source operating system. In other words, you will have a real operating system to do what needs to be done in order to salvage or rescue your PC. Your window's will
 not boot when using this method of troubleshooting, therefore you will not get a BSOD. While the tool is active, you will be able to perform advanced troubleshooting, all while the intensely in-depth system scanner does its thing. You can: Save any precious
 files in the event that you must perform a complete system restore - delete the last few files or drivers you've downloaded that potentially caused this unwanted behavior, potentially being the remedy all in itself - as well as have the peace of mind that
 comes with a malicious file scan that has the ability to even sweep your BIOS for threats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that you know what it is, here are the links to everything you will need to make it work for you.</p>
<p>1) <a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/downloads/rufus-2.12.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Use this to make the ISO file into a Bootable USB.">
Rufus Bootable USB Creation Tool</a></p>
<p>-Rufus will take your downloaded ISO and mount it onto a USB Flash Drive with all of the necessary details needed to make it a Bootable USB. If you've ever used the Windows Media Creation Tool to make a USB for Recovery, this is the same concept.</p>
<p>2) <a href="http://download.bitdefender.com/rescue_cd/latest/bitdefender-rescue-cd.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="This will be mounted to become a Bootable USB by Rufus.exe">
BitDefender RescueMe CD's ISO File</a></p>
<p>-This will be mounted to become a Bootable USB with the Rufus.exe tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before doing ANYTHING. Verify the Checksum Algorithms of the files you've just downloaded. This will ensure that you have gotten then exact same files that I have, and that they have not been tampered with by another party. Download the MD5 and SHA Checksum
 Utility from <a href="http://download.cnet.com/MD5-SHA-Checksum-Utility/3000-2092_4-10911445.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="For download verifications">
this cnet download page.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Values generated for Rufus-2.12.exe should be exactly:</p>
<p>MD5 Checksum: A1951DED627B47D449CB451DAFF192F<br />
SHA-1 Checksum: ED704DD3DC89B861F4EDE5532C80DABF66C35CA5<br />
SHA-256 Checksum: CDAE63982321D72AACB332C44C57438AD4A10B829F76C93E5BF427F18DF1170A</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Values generated for BitDefender.iso should be exactly:</p>
<p>MD5 Checksum: 1103F1A38139E6F8841B835C69D231FC<br />
SHA-1 Checksum: 86EC68579C15EA55C739AF76CCDD8F1AEA2E1DB0<br />
SHA-256 Checksum: B4B65C3789BCE4CBFE5CC8EEFB31671AB63FF5F0E1E1FE504BBC39DE98FB1691</p>
<p>
</p><p>These values are up to date as of the date and time of this post reply. Any alterations the software developers make to their product will alter the Checksum Values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step-By-Step Guide</p>
<p>1) Use Rufus to mount your ISO file. Obviously, this is done on a separate computer. Rufus will post a message that the .iso is a hybrid, and that it recommends keeping it as .iso, but also lets you know that it can mount it as a DD Image in the event that
 it does not boot correctly. In my experience, always choose to create your Bootable USB as a DD Image when Rufus.exe says that you have the opportunity to. It is much more stable.</p>
<p>2) Plug in an Ethernet cable for the best experience. The OS does not currently have the capacity to obtain your wireless adapter drivers automatically, so you will miss out on important updates upon boot if this is not prepared. However, RescueMe is more
 than capable even without it's updated definitions.</p>
<p>3) Insert the USB into your PC and turn the PC on. Please see how to get to your boot options, as I do not know which computer you have.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">--If you have a Lenovo device, as I do, use the small pinhole button they provide to easily get to the boot device menu.</p>
<p>4) Select the USB as the device you wish to boot from.</p>
<p>5) When the OS boots, select your language.</p>
<p>6) Simply click "Login" at the Login screen. There is no password.</p>
<p>7) And the rest is up to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this helps, and that you can get to another computer to create your Bootable USB. If not, and you own an Android device, an app known as DriveDroid can take the iso and mount it to your phone in order to boot from there. However, that requires your
 android device to be rooted. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if this solved your issue. I had the same exact problem 4 Hours ago and RescueMe CD fixed it right up. I also deleted all of the files I had recently downloaded from within it's OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't help, reply with your Model Number and we'll go from there!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>window xp in continuous reboot loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seeking_help  say:</h3>
<h2>            window xp in continuous reboot loop </h2>
                    Please help. The Windows XP computer won't go past&nbsp;the splash screen. It keeps on asking what mode to start the computer up. When pressing Normal Mode or Last Good known configuration, it goes to the splash screen then says No signal then loops back to
 the original start up mode screen. When selecting safe mode, it automatically loads of multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\Windows\system 32\drivers\*.sys errors. No recent changes have been done to the computer. It just came up that way during the boot up.
 How do you solve this issue please? Thank you much.

<p><span><span>hello Seeking help,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting your question. This is a Windows Vista support forum but I’ll be happy to offer some suggestions that might get you pointed in the right direction. If these suggestions do not assist I would recommend checking Windows XP specific resources:</span></span></p>

Chances are that your boot secter has become corrupted.&nbsp; This can happen when a virus infection occurs that targets the boot secter of your hard drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; The easiest and simpliest method to fix the issue is to reinstall.&nbsp; You can check the links I gave above
 for other possible alternatives to reinstalling.&nbsp; Most are advanced user steps and require a Microsoft Windows XP installation disc.<br />
<br />
Good luck

<h3> prosthotoothist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t change SATA storage setting from IDE to AHCI on ASUS P6T Deluxe MB in Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having problems trying to change the SATA storage setting in the BIOS from IDE to AHCI so that I can take advantage of the speed of my two Samsung EVO 850 1 TB SSDs.&nbsp; I originally had Win 7 and upgraded to Win 10 and have even eliminated all of the
 files pertaining to the Win 7 installation (after seeing that everything worked properly in Win 10).&nbsp; I hoped that this would allow me to make the change from IDE to AHCI, but it did not.&nbsp; I have searched the web for help with this but have not found anything
 related to Win 10, so I am hoping that someone will have experience in this area and can help me (and maybe others) get the change done successfully.&nbsp; I will be interested to know if there are any limitations related to the motherboard part of my system.&nbsp;
 I know that it is several years old, but since everything works, I really don't think that the MB is the issue.&nbsp; There must be something that I can't find that is causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Mohammad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a possibility that there is a issue with the app itself. Let us try to resolve this issue by repairing the app from the

<h2>            Why do I need to activate Windows&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have got a Thinkpad X1 Carbon Touch 3rd Gen running Windows 10 version 15063.608 - a private pc</p>
<p>I recently had my computer reimaged because it had some sort of virus which caused things to not work properly, and no anti-virus software could find it.</p>
<p>I am annoyed because so many settings are disabled, because apparently I have not activated Windows.</p>
<p>My previous image no longer exists, and that was a reimage case itself, but Windows did not need to be activated then.</p>
<p>However, I cannot activate Windows, and cannot get store either to get a genuine version.</p>
<p>Is there any way to get this sorted out?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/91420231-80ae-4c18-a2b0-6c2ac0e5b5e0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/91420231-80ae-4c18-a2b0-6c2ac0e5b5e0" /></a></p>
<p>Another problem is that when I tried to register with windows insider program, my computer didn't register that I had, even though the account that I used to sign in on it was the one I registered. it does say online that I have registered. is this problem

<p>Could this "internet filter" be your problem with activation? &nbsp;&nbsp; (See my, "communications issues" from earlier.&nbsp; Someone blocking the traffic via firewall, etc. would definitely be considered there.)
<br />
</p>
<p>As far as the one I think will likely work best for you (no knowing your Internet limitations): &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p>
<em>Note</em>&nbsp;<br />
Telephone activation involves calling a Microsoft Product Activation Center, providing your information and your 63-digit Installation ID, and then complete the activation with the confirmation ID provided by the Microsoft Product Activation Center.<br />
<br />
1. Press the Win+R keys to open Run, type SLUI 4, and click/tap on OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
2. Select your country or region, and click/tap on Next.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
3. Call one of the provided phone numbers for a Microsoft Product Activation Center. It would be best to call the toll free number. (see screenshot below)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
4. The automated phone system will ask you to enter your 63 digit installation ID (IID), and click/tap on Enter confirmation ID after successfully doing so.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
5. Enter the confirmation ID number given by the automated phone system, and click/tap on Activate Windows when finished. (see screenshot below)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
6. If Windows was successfully activated with your product key, then click/tap on Close.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
7. If activation failed, then stay on the line and wait to be transferred to an activation operator (human) that may be able to help.

            If you still experience problems installing it.
<br />
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

                    <p>Hi,</p><p><br /></p><p>My credit card expired last month and I forgot to update the&nbsp;payment method used in order to renew my Xbox live subscription. I received an e-mail saying that the renewal&nbsp;payment hasn't been processed&nbsp;as my card expired, so I added another payment method and tried&nbsp;to use it in order to pay. I hit the&nbsp;"pay now" button but nothing seemed&nbsp;to happen. When I check my past orders, I can see that the payment for my renewal is still pending with my old credit card. What should I do?</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks!</p>

                    The Display on my laptop doesn't stay on. At start up, it is on for a second and then goes dark. The display is still there. I can hook a secondary display to the laptop and it works fine. It does make a weird sound (like a boing sound) when the display
 goes dark. When you close the laptop and then open it again the display comes on again for a second and then goes dark. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the video drivers and that didn't work.

<p>This usually indicates that the backlamp(s) for the screen have failed. These lamps shine from the back of the screen and light it from behind, making it visible to you.&nbsp; When they fail this is often what they do - come on for a second or so and then go
 dark, you can still see the screen but only with extreme difficulty.</p>
<p>They are not something that can easily be replaced, you'll need to take your laptop to a repair center for assistance.</p>

<h2>            Bose QuietComfort 35 ii was working with Windows 10, now it&#39;s not</h2>
                    <p>My Bose bluetooth headphones were working perfectly with my computer for months except for not working as a microphone...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, one day, about a month ago, they just wouldn't connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried clearing the device list on the actual headphones and now it won't even recognise the name of them (Dave's Cans) on my PC. It just comes up as "headphones" but it refuses to connect. It offers me an "LE-Dave's Cans" in the bluetooth devices menu,
 but not as a headphones option - just an unknown device.</p>

<br />
<br />On the search bar type Computer Management. 
<br />Click on Device Manager, search the device or bluetooth devices. 
<br />Then do a right click on it, click on uninstall. 
<br />Restart the machine, to see if that works

    <title>Why is Windows 10 Anniversary update removing my Epson V500 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaroslav karvada  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Windows 10 Anniversary update removing my Epson V500 software&#47;drivers&#63;</h2>
                    Well, it is not possible to disable Windows 10 updates and the updates are modifying user GUI without user consent - unacceptable, but sad reality, but why is it now removing my software for the hardware I paid for? The Epson V500 scanner software is targeted
 to Windows 10, works correctly there, so why is Windows deleting it? This is totally unacceptable and I don't want any OS to remove my legally bought software anytime without any objective reason and what's the most important without my consent.

            <p>Yes, I installed the latest drivers from the Epson web site, they are marked as Windows 10 compatible. Windows update didn't complain about them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same problem happened during update from Windows 8, the update program also uninstalled the genuine Epson drivers and applications and replaced them with its generic WIA driver. Well, it's a bit useless with the advanced photo scanner in comparison with
 the Twain drivers and vendor software. I went over it as it was upgrade I manually initiated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it's absolutely unacceptable this is happening during stable product lifetime and without any user intervention. I don't want Microsoft to uninstall any software from my computer (e.g. CPU-Z was removed by some update before without my intervention)
 nor official software for commercial products I own. This must stop. Especially, if the updates cannot be disabled.</p>

            <p>I agree with all the above. I try to earn a living using my Epson V500. After the Anniversary update all related software - including the desktop icons and the icon in the start bar had disappeared. My only recourse was to reload &nbsp;everything from the (legal
 purchased and owner) installation disc.</p>
<p>Seems to be OK now - but some of the comments above worry me - will my scans still be the same quality.</p>

            And of course Windows Defender thinks the epson scanner driver is a virus unless you tell Defender that the driver software is valid each scan takes many times longer than it should because Defender soaks up 90% of your cpu trying to detect a virus. This
 was something I "fixed" years ago, but the anniversary update having removed the driver I had to start again

            I haven't encountered the false positive scan reports regarding the Epson drivers yet, but CPU heavy long scans and nonsense notifications about "Windows Defender needs to scan your computer" which is not possible to switch off are quite common and very
 annoying.

            <p>&nbsp;Via Windows 10 Settings/ Updates and Security button find the Windows Defender Exclusions area and add folder C:\Windows\twain_32\ESCNDV to the exclusions.
</p>
<p>Then you can scan without MsMpEng.exe (Defender) taking most of the cpu as it tries to "detect" a virus in the scanning software.</p>

    <title>Desktop blank blue screen after startup &#43; no start bar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> only4theweak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop blank blue screen after startup &#43; no start bar</h2>
                    I have seen quite a few questions that are similar to the troubles I am having.<br />
Although all steps I have tried have failed to get a result.<br />
<br />
Turn computer on, boots up fine but a tad slower than usual.<br />
I have only 1 account on this computer and no password so it always loads to desktop straight away.<br />
Desktop is blank, no icons, no background picture (background is blue), no taskbar/start button. Can still move the mouse cursor however.<br />
<br />
Task manager has no explorer.exe running. Create a new task (explorer.exe) and i get a loading symbol as my cursor however nothing happens.<br />
Sometimes these boxes come up and I have never seen it like this before so I was wondering if it is some sort of spyware?<br />
<br />

<br />
I have tried other ways to "fix" the problem but none have worked thus far. (starting in safemode, etc)<br />
<br />
I am currently using firefox on my computer which i opened up with command prompt<br />
<br />
<br />
Would appreciate any helpful suggestions.<br />
:)<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Home clean reinstall with the same code&#63;</h2>
                    So after a long time I want to reinstall my windows 10 home edition, but I don't want to lose the licence. I want to reinstall using the CD and with the same activation code, is that possible?

<p>Yes, you can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key
</span></span><span><span>you already own</span></span><span><span>to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
