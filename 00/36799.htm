<h2>            Skype Contacts gone after reactivating account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just had to reactivate my Skype account because it said it was suspended due to policy violation (really cannot imagine how and why).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... I followed the instructions, introduced my mobile phone number and reactivated my Skype (Microsoft) account successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then installed Skype on my new MAC and logged in to the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whit great surprise I found out ALL MY SKYPE CONTACTS I WAS USING SINCE AGES are gone, litterally disappeared, I can only see the 'Skype test' Sound and Translator in the list of my Skype contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you ask... Yes, I am sure this is the correct account I always used, the Skype contacts list is simply empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get back all of my Skype contacts ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks In Advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please be advised that the contacts will not be removed on the account because it got suspended. There is a possibility you are only signed in to a different account if you are not seeing your contacts.

                    <p>Windows 10 failed, not getting past the welcome screen, with failure to activate the cursor or mouse. With help from Microsoft support it was determined the system needed to be reset - losing non-native applications!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Windows 10 starts, but is sending me "xxx" not found.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This concern normally occurs when the .dll file does not automatically register during the process of download/installation of updates or external software. However, we're going to try to focus more on the fact that you are encountering different .dll error
 messages from time to time. For the meantime, we will be fixing the current .dll by refreshing it's registry key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Important: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,
 back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.
<br />
<br />
For more information about how to backup and restore the registry, refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article.<br />

    <title>slingboxplayer for desktop kaput after Kb4013429 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rboris  say:</h3>
<h2>            slingboxplayer for desktop kaput after Kb4013429</h2>
                    Successfully updated. A little slow but nothing I haven't seen before.<br />
Immediately afterwards tried to connect to a remote slingbox 500.<br />
While the "web part" of the plug-in worked fine the popup window that simulates a television with remote didn't appear.<br />
After uninstalling the plug in and reinstalling I had the same result.<br />
Finally I uninstalled the cumulative update.<br />
Bingo: slingbox is working again.<br />
Wonder if this is related to the WMP issues referred to above.<br />
Any thoughts.<br />
Thanks.:

<p>I contacted Sling Box support and miraculously was connected to "tier 2."</p>
<p>Why don't you call them <span>
at 877-467-5464&nbsp; and piggyback onto my </span><span>case number is 01093326.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>BTW, I am using a Sling 500, actually have two of them (one is remote and one is on my current network).</span></p>
<p><span>I and my wife access both when in Europe.&nbsp; Here I have FIOS (150/150), there Orange Fiber (950/325) and the results are spectacular (full HD, etc.).</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your reply.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks so much rboris for your reply as well as the case number and phone number!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, I was not so lucky:&nbsp; Couldn't get to Tier II and the agent I was dealing with simply could not understand looking up the case number for a solution.&nbsp; The agent finally did, however, and noted the solution provided was merely to uninstall the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that what you ended up doing, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too very much enjoy my M1 and numerous other "older" slingboxes which no longer will stream via the webplayer but will stream via the website.&nbsp; I am connected with 30 megs down and 10 megs up.&nbsp; When in remote destinations (islands in the middle of nowhere)
 I AM able to achieve HD streaming most of the time while my connection may be a mere 4megs down and .750 megs up.&nbsp; Port from the laptop to a LARGE HD tv.&nbsp; Luxury to an old guy!&nbsp; Please advise if so inclined.</p>

            <p>Encountered issues connecting with WebPlayer to Slingbox 500 after KB4013429 installed. &nbsp;Noticed however that I could still connect to an older Slingbox SOLO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As reported by others, when KB4013429 uninstalled, connections to Slingbox 500 resumed and viewing was once again possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS tightens security.......Slingbox needs to makes modifications. &nbsp;This pattern has happened before. &nbsp;Hope Slingbox releases patch soon as preventing those MS updates on Win10 Home is not a straight forward task.</p>

            <p>I did reinstall the update that started all this non-sense and attempted to watch via SlingPlayer for Desktop and also via slingbox.com.&nbsp; NO GOOD.&nbsp; I then
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>installed the update KB4015438</strong></span></em>, rebooted, and ....drum roll......The SlingPlayer for Desktop fired up just fine and so did slingbox.com and the SlingPlayer for Web both with EDGE and CHROME.&nbsp;
 https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4015438&nbsp;&nbsp; (You can use the update feature in Windows 10 if you so desire....)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back in the saddle again, although it sure would be nice if the children who do the coding for the updates REMEMBER to cover all of their bases.&nbsp; As an old man IT specialist.....there when the internet was not and soon to be...and also there when "smart
 phones" came into being (don't own one and won't use 'em....too many inquiring minds....), it is my experience that the children who do the coding do so on a discriminatory basis:&nbsp; Said discrimination being what THEY think WE should be using be it the operating
 system, the web browser; whatever.&nbsp; They have to remember to code for any and all scenarios and despite the fact most of 'em are given in excess of a six figure annual income, they consider themselves to bel omnipotent.&nbsp; They're not as we clearly saw with
 this coding error....and that's all it was.....a coding error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Too, Slingbox really isn't going to be supporting "US" in the not too distant future.&nbsp; They've other things in mind.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; When I phoned Slingbox tech support they couldn't even find the M1 I had just set up on February 10 and claimed all my gear was
 out of warranty.&nbsp; They could not see or find (so they said) the M1 I had added.&nbsp; Even after providing serial number and MAC address I was then compelled to provide proof of purchase as they really were not thrilled with the idea of providing tech support for
 the M1.&nbsp; "It" got a little better after I sent them proof of purchase in addition to the serial number of my M1 and it's MAC address.&nbsp; Further, the kid on the other end of the phone simply could not understand I do NOT use a cell phone!!!&nbsp; The kid kept saying
 he could view my slingbox on his iPhone!!!! (The kid compelled me to provide the email address the M1 is assigned to as well as the password to the account!!!&nbsp; I gave that data out reluctantly [...have since changed passwords....] and the "tech support" team
 member could not get it that he was able to view MY slingbox via his phone and what was the problem!!!&nbsp; Over and Over and Over I tried to calmly explain I viewed my slingbox via a PC (actually....a laptop PC that I in turn port to the hotel room HDMI in on
 the room's tv....and have 1080p HD streaming forever and a day....99 times out of 100 I am NOT in the USA when I am streaming.....that's the beauty of the slingbox....).&nbsp; I do not understand viewing video over a dinky "smart phone" (DUMB phone!!!) and never
 will.&nbsp; I want my 50"+ HDTV and a/c given I'm an old man who enjoys his creature comforts....); and I want it in actual HD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway....I'm going to be "burning in" these updates and shall report back any problems I run into.&nbsp; As for now....all is well.....this old guy has his 1080p streaming on his laptop following the install of the 2nd update.....and all is right....SO FAR.&nbsp;
 And...for those who want a direct download link for the "fixing" update here it is:&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Enjoy and report.&nbsp; We gotta stick together because Slingbox is gonna forget us.&nbsp; (I have MANY slingbox pro's and slingbox HD's that I still want to use....slingbox/slingmedia took away my ability to view these "older" devices via the Slingplayer for Desktop,
 compelling one to use the slingbox.com website...and who knows when they're going to end that party.....).&nbsp; What is the most incredible is the gross amount of support provided to people who have these "smart phones" (DUMB phones!!!) and the reality the bulk
 of the support staff....even "Tier II" simply can't understand using a laptop and porting via cable to a big, fat hotel room tv.&nbsp; I don't even know how to mirror cast and I'm not about to learn!!!&nbsp; Enjoy.....</p>

            <p>I was going to try the "38" update tomorrow since the "correction" list seems to target video errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a desktop user in NY and in France. In France I use a custom built PC and watch TV on a 24" monitor. Just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife uses a Sony 32" TV hooked up via HDMI to an Intel mini computer (which is a terrific device).&nbsp; That works fine too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am leaving for Paris in a few weeks.&nbsp; Let me know your experiences with the "38" update, please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And thanks for the big effort.</p>
<p>

<h2>            d3dx9_38.dll problem with Fallout 3</h2>
                    Hello, I have a problem when trying to run Fallout 3. It says that the file d3dx9_38.dll cannot be found, and to please locate or reinstall the application. I looked on the forum and found a similar problem, and I followed the prescribed steps to no avail.
 I tried finding the file in C:\Windows\System32, and it was not there. It skips from _34 to _39. When I tried downloading the file using the recommended one in the forum response, it did not work. Can you help me acquire this file? Thanks.

    <title>Weird crashes. Blue screens, Black screens, &#38; Frozen screen tears - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshelec  say:</h3>
<h2>            Weird crashes. Blue screens, Black screens, &#38; Frozen screen tears - even during blue screens</h2>
                    <p>A couple months ago was when this problem started. It started ocassionally with a blue screen, but mostly a frozen screen that looked like "screen tearing" (?) Basically a&nbsp;pause, and then the screen is filled with a specific section like the upper right
 corner of&nbsp; the window but all over the screen maybe diagonally. Waited 10 seconds to realize it was frozen&nbsp; Then hold power button to shut it down, also noticing the blinking light&nbsp;never blinks when it freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I&nbsp;rarely got the blue screen, by following instructions to open it up, it just pointed to AMD. But all cpu test never failed. Usually though I checked the event viewer&nbsp;log, since the freezes never gave me a blue screen. Nothing&nbsp; really shows up there
 either, only my force shutdown always pops up there.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I reinstalled windows but usually &nbsp;ignored this issue, since I couldnt get a new computer, this computer parts are quite old, and I picked up&nbsp;patterns of when it usually crashed and what not to do. (Use low res, wait 10 minutes after bootup to move the mouse,
 dont scroll down certain sites etc..) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier this week something different happened that concerned me. On that blinkinng line where you tap F8 to go into safe mode. I did that and it froze with that sceen type tear look. That line all over the screen. Then last night, which&nbsp;is why im posting
 here. It froze when it usually doesnt. After rebooting a new thing occured. I moved the mouse, click the start menu, and blue screen popped up. The unusual part was that it froze in the blue screen with that screen tear effect,&nbsp;a specifc section of the blue
 screen plastered horizonally across the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I havent use it since then, currently using library to post this. Little bit concerned not much can be done but any help definitely appreciated</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p />

            I followed the above steps (using the printer troubleshooter) and saw that I had 2 of the same printer listed. I had the wrong one listed as the default. As soon as I switched the default to the other (COPY 1), the printer started to work. Thank you.

    <title>How do I remedy this paging file error&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ozryel  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I remedy this paging file error&#63;</h2>
                    Message:
<div>"Windows created a temporary paging file on your computer because of a problem that occurred with your paging file configuration when you started your computer. The total paging file size for all disk drives may be somewhat larger than the size you specified."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I did some research I learned that the error was caused by a lack of Virtual Memory. However, the steps I was advised to take to increase my Virtual Memory (manually increasing the size of my default paging files) have proven fruitless because, due
 to the shortage of Virtual Memory, my computer coninually freezes and holds. I need a series of command prompts that I can use in safe mode in order to identify the drive containing my VM and increase it.</div>

            Sometimes page files become corrupt (because of crashes).&nbsp; If you reset yours to zero for all drives (it will complain) reboot, then set it to 1.5x your ram. Reboot again and it often fixes it.<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1.</b></p>
<p>Try these steps to set the file size to zero.</p>
<p>1-Open the "Control Panel" from the "Start" menu.</p>
<p>2-Open "Administrative Tools".</p>
<p>3-Open "Computer Management".</p>
<p>4-Right-click "Computer Management" in the left panel and select "Properties" from the available menu.</p>
<p>5-Click the "Advanced" tab.</p>
<p>6-Click "Performance Options".</p>
<p>7-Click "Change" in the "Virtual Memory" section.</p>
<p>8-Type a page file size in the "Initial" or "Maximum" size. If all parameters are set to zero, the operating system will never use its virtual memory.</p>
<p>9-Click "Set".</p>
<p>10-Close all window and restart the computer to allow these settings to take effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2.</b></p>
<p><span>a.Click Start, in the start search type cmd and press enter.</span></p>
<p>b. Right click on cmd.exe from the list and choose “Run as administrator”. This will open cmd in elevated mode.</p>
<p>c.Type this command “<em><u><span>sc config afs start= disabled</span></u></em><em><u><span>
 “ </span></u></em>and press enter. <i>
(</i><em><span>Note that there is no space after
<b>start</b> but there is space after <b>=</b>.)</span></em></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

            Yes, My OS is windows XP and now there isn't any sound. About a year ago the hard drive crashed and I had to replace it with out any backup CDs.I also had to replace the video card to use an HDMI cable for flat screen as monitor. I purchased an old windows
 XP disk from a friend that came with a validation code so it was all legit.ALL of the sudden no sound and no cd/DVD drive when I play dvd movies,however the windows XP cd does work.<br />

<h2>            My windows 8.1 &#40;64 bit&#41; runs very slow&#33; Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I have a HP laptop with Windows 8.1 (single lang) and a 64 bit operating system (X64 based processor). Till a few months back, my pc was smooth and fast. All applications whether windows based or ms-office, were lightning quick. Then came the problem.
 My updates was set to automatic and the command prompted me to install the new important updates. I did so..and that was a big mistake. I reckon, to have installed some stupid update which caused my pc to slow down immensely. I noticed that I was now getting
 all 32 bit based updates then..&nbsp;I guess that caused all the problems. Am i correct about this? Will someone help? Can I reverse the stupid update or anything like that??</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Savio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your computer could run slow due to various reasons like less disk space, corrupt Windows system files or security threat like virus and malware.
 performance:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 1: Run the System Maintenance troubleshooter</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows + W </strong>key on the keyboard.</li><li>Type <strong>troubleshooter</strong> in the search box and then press Enter.</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Click on <strong>View</strong> <strong>
all</strong> and select <strong>System</strong> <strong>Maintenance</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Delete programs you never use</strong></p>
<p>It's a good idea to uninstall all the programs you don't plan to use. Your PC might contain manufacturer-installed programs that you never noticed or have since forgotten about. It's never too late to remove these and get rid of the clutter and wasted system
 resources. Maybe you thought you might use the software someday, but never did. Uninstall it and see if your PC runs faster.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Check Memory Usage</strong></p>
<p>With memory, one of the first things to do is find out how much memory (RAM) you have and how much of it is currently being used. You can find out these things and much more in Task Manager.</p>
<p>If you find that much of your RAM is regularly being used, consider adding more RAM if possible especially if your PC only has 1 or 2 gigabytes (GB) of RAM. To learn more about what kind of RAM your PC model uses, first look at the memory info in Task Manager,
 and then visit the PC manufacturer’s website for more specific information. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Clean up your hard disk.</strong></p>
<p>Unnecessary files on your hard disk take up disk space and can slow down your computer.
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17421/windows-free-up-drive-space#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Disk Cleanup</a> removes temporary files, empties the Recycle Bin, and removes a variety of system files and other items that you no longer need.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4: Check for virus and malware.</strong></p>
<p>A common symptom of a virus is a much slower-than-normal computer performance. Other signs include unexpected messages that pop up on your PC, programs that start automatically, or the sound of your hard disk constantly working.<br />
<br />
The best way to deal with viruses is to prevent them in the first place. Always run antivirus software and keep it up to date. Even if you take such precautions, however, it's possible for your PC to become infected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 5: Add more storage. </strong></p>
<p><span>A longer-term strategy for expanding your PC's storage capacity is to add removable storage, including SD cards, USB flash drives, DVDs or CDs, or using cloud storage or network drives. For more information, see

<p>Hi Brad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restoring to factory settings is different from resetting Windows 10. Restoring to factory settings would restore your device to a state when you have first got it. Resetting Windows 10 would reset Windows 10, it would reinstall Windows 10 on your device,
 removing apps and drivers that you have installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a lighter note, you may follow the steps provided here in this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">

                    <p>I am trying to perform a clean install to switch from Windows 7 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Infinite Loading Screen Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>I bought PUBG upon release and it has worked fine up until&nbsp; a few days ago, After I finished a match the screen went white. I quit the game and restarted, then after pressing A on the title screen the game just goes to the same white screen. This has been going on for over 48 hours. Does anyone know how to fix it?</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible the previous owner just forgot to factory reset the Xbox and their account and content is still installed on the console and as mentioned previouslym the previous owner's account may still be set up as&nbsp;the Home Console. Every account can only
 have one Home Console, but one Xbox can have multiple accounts using it as a Home console. So yes, you are correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest giving the Xbox a factory reset and starting fresh with your own account and content. Go to Settings&gt;System&gt;Console Info&gt;Reset Console&gt;Reset and remove everything. The reset will start your console like it's brand new and you will have to re-add
 your account and connect to a network to download any updates. This guide should help you further:
