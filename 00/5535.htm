            Hmmm.. Can hotmail do POP3 or IMAP4? The e-mail app on the 6233 can only support these modes. I suppose you could install Opera Mini and access hotmail.com from there. =)

            With Microsoft, you can try going to Hotmail with the phone browser: <a href="http://mobile.msn.com/wml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://mobile.msn.com/wml</a><br />
<br />
Or you can find an intermediate service provider who allows standard Internet email access (POP3 or IMAP4 protocol for reading and SMTP for sending). Then you need to trust your Hotmail username and password with the intermediate service provider (pop2hot,
 or whatever there are).<br />
<br />
Or you can switch from Hotmail to some other free email provider like Google; they support both POP3/SMTP access, as well as their own Java based email client that might work on the 6233, too.

            @thirucumaran,<br />
<br />
What problems are you encountering with Opera? Can you describe the error messages you get? Can you browse the net using the built-in web browser of the phone?<br />
<br />
As suggested by Petrib, you could also use GMail instead. I have and use the Jave GMail client as well. Works ok so far.

            I don't know whether Hotmail supports POP, but switching to Gmail will be a good idea as it gives you over 5MB space totally free. What's your network? You need to get "internet" settings other than wap on some networks for using Opera Mini. And of course,
 remember that you can't use Opera, only Opera Mini, as 6233 supports Java only. You need to select a Preferred Access Point in order to use Socket access in Opera Mini. But if your network has a port other than 8080, setting up a Preferred APN will be a bit
 confusing. So tell us your network, I think us guys here will be able to assist you on configuring the phone to suit your network.

    <title>INCLUDETEXT and SharePoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alwphantom  say:</h3>
<h2>            INCLUDETEXT and SharePoint</h2>
                    <p>Hello, <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've looked around the web and the forums and I have found little to no information on this subject, so here goes...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have a Word document that has several INCLUDETEXT fields that point to source documents located in a SharePoint Online Library (Office 365 Enterprise). I built the target document in Word 2013; all of the source documents are based on this target document
 template. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In my Windows world (Office 2013 or 2010, Windows 7), I am able to make the various INCLUDETEXT fields update as I want and expect that they would. When I test the target document on a neighboring Windows machine (Word 2013/Windows 8), the fields work as
 anticipated and expected.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problem arises when I move to an Apple machine and try to make the fields update. When I open the file from SharePoint into Word for Mac 2011, everything looks fine.&nbsp; But if I go to update a field manually it shows that is is at least attempting to download
 the file and then I get a pop-up window error message that says "Not a valid address" and then the target document field I was attempting to update displays "Error! Not a valid filename". This is the same on two separate machines, two separate SharePoint users.
 Permissions for both users look fine, one of the users has identical permissions as myself (full control).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Currently this is what my code looks like: { INCLUDETEXT "https://*domain*.sharepoint.com/sites/**********tech/shared%20documents/templates/0.0_CoverPage.docx?Web=1" \*MERGEFORMAT }</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've tried adding a HYPERLINK code before the link within the INCLUDETEXT command, I've tried changing the file path minus the file name to a field, I've tried adding the sharepoint link from Word for Mac<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is my address too long (I removed our domain which is 19 characters plus an additional 10 before "tech" for a total of 29 characters missing from the URL above)? Is there another way to accomplish this task?
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
Brian

            I finally got it to work on both Mac and PC across multiple machines and permission levels. :-)<br />
<br />
Thank you Peter, Paul and Jim for your time in helping to solve this.&nbsp; Here is what the ultimate (incredibly simple) issue was:<br />
<br />
I cannot explain why it worked in your SharePoint environment Peter, but I did the same thing when I tested the URL without the "?web=1" and changed the "https" to "http" (which worked on a PC but not on a Mac).&nbsp; When I tried it again today I at the same time
 added a line with the {FILENAME \p} on it's own for some testing for Paul.&nbsp; I noticed that the file name that appeared was "https" without the "?web=1".&nbsp; Bingo, updated on a PC and Mac as "https://domain.sharepoint.com/[folders]/filename.docx".<br />
<br />
So to recap for anyone else down the road who may be reading this and trying the same thing, here is what worked for me:<br />
<br />
<b>Include Text Field Code:</b> { INCLUDETEXT "https://[domain].sharepoint.com/[folders]/[filename].docx" \*MERGEFORMAT }&nbsp; Where domain=your domain, folders=the path to the folder on SharePoint, and filename=your file name<br />
<br />
<b>Realtive(ish) Path:</b> To make it an easily adjusted file path where the file name remains the same but the rest of the URL changes.
<br />
- Create a column in the SharePoint library for the URL path (for instance IncludeTextPath)<br />
- Create your document in that Library either by dropping it there or saving a new document to the library<br />
- Define the data for that document in your "IncludeTextPath" as the path to the source documents excluding the file name<br />
- Change the code to: { INCLUDETEXT "[IncludeTextPath][filename].docx" \*MERGEFORMAT } where "IncludeTextPath" is inserted by going to Insert Tab&gt;Quick Parts&gt;Document Property&gt;InsertTextPath<br />
- Note that for this example i included the "/" before the file name in the IncludeTextPath<br />
<br />
<b>FILENAME Field:</b> This field does not appear with my testing to work with the relative fields, although I didn't spend a lot of time working on it. This is using the "\ ..\ method brought up earlier in the discussion that works for local files but appears
 not to play nicely with the SharePoint URL.<br />
<br />
<b>Permissions:</b> When I tested this with a person who did not have edit permission on SharePoint, the updating of fields was a little off as he was not at the access level to edit. He could update the target document fine, but he needed to know to do that
 and because he downloaded a copy of it I'm not sure how it would have handled it if he went to print (I assume it would have auto updated). So good practice may be to update the fields before saving or set them to auto update on open (which could be time consuming).&nbsp;
 We have a relatively small SharePoint environment here, maybe only 20 or 30 of us using it at the moment, so this isn't a huge issue for us, but I mention it as it could be if the files are reference regularly.
<br />
<br />
<b>Path Length: </b>Keeping it short seems to make Word happier. Using an underscore instead of a space is always better on SharePoint to save characters. :-)<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help guys, it is much appreciated!<br />
Brian<br />

            Glad it's sorted - just as an observation, you would almost certainly need "/../" for the { FILENAME \p } approach when an http URL is involved - if you actually used "\..\" I would guess it would fail in an http URL.

    <title>Why is my vlookup returning a &#34;0&#34; for the last 15 out 289 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why is my vlookup returning a &#34;0&#34; for the last 15 out 289 rows&#63;</h2>
                    I have a workbook that my office uses to create client payroll payment schedules. I have a list off the clients using the service(named range "CompanyList" on sheet "Companies"). Each company has an abbreviation (column 2 in the named range "CompanyAbbrev").
 On the "Numbers" sheet, I have a table consisting of columns for Company Name, Abbreviation &amp; ID #, Abbreviation, ID#, Employee Name, SSN, 12 columns of quarterly wage and withholding data.<br />
In this table, I use a vlookup formula (=vlookup(a2,CompanyAbbrev,2) to pull the Abbreviation from the "Companies" sheet. For rows 2 - 274, this formula works perfectly. For rows 275-289, it returns "0." Anywhere else in the workbook that uses a similar vlookup
 formula to pull the Abbreviation also gets a "0" result.<br />
I have verified that the named ranges "CompanyList" and "CompanyAbbrev" extend beyond the end of the list.&nbsp; The range "CompanyAbbrev" = A2:E300,while the list ends on row 277. (The range "CompanyList" = A2:E300.)<br />
<br />
This formula works for 95% of the rows. What's wrong with the other 5%?<br />

<p>=vlookup(a2,CompanyAbbrev,2,False)</p>

            I'm not sure how it did it, but when I removed the extra rows from the named ranges, it pulled the correct values. This is confusing, because I only extended the ranges after it started giving me the "0" result.<br />

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 520</h2>
                    &lt;p&gt;The problem with the Lumia 520 having problems is the technical preview isn't compatible with the 520 at present. If you would have just slowed down and read the website you would have known that the 520 isn't on the list of compatible phones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm
 not sure why it isn't at the very top of the list. If you think about it the Nokia Lumia 520 is the perfect device for this"shake down" and here's why. 1 The 520 is on the way out stock with most careers,so you can get it on the cheap in most cases around
 $34.00 and that means it's in hands of a vast number of users; 2 It's got the 8.1 version with the required 8 gig's of memory required; 3. Because the 520 is so inexpensive has the required software and memory on top of being really tough device. It's the
 perfect choice for Windows10 Technical Preview...so how come I'm being told that there isn't a build for the Nokia Lumia520 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll be waiting for preview to be ready for downlo

            <p>Yes, it is currently only for the Lumia 630&nbsp; 635&nbsp; 636&nbsp; 638&nbsp; 730&nbsp; 830, newest phones</p>
<p>WP10 is a preview, it is not for your daily phone. there are known issues. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
It is not for a vast number of users</span>&nbsp; Most that are using it are using a second phone.</p>

            <p>Thanks that makes sense,and I am aware that Wp10 is a preview or test to see what needs to be tweaked and I have a spare 520 that I was going to use. I wasn't implying that everybody should have the preview just that there are a lot of the 520's out there
 and I didn't get why Wp10 don't work on it but you answer</p>
<p>ed that </p>

            Hi SudMalhotra,
<br />Unfortunately, if you ignore the warning (screenshot below) and delete aliases, they are gone forever and cannot be restored. They are no longer allowing addresses to be recycled (reused), so you won't be able to create a new account using it.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e37c4225-0453-488d-bd5b-2af8c8ef5499?upload=true" />

<p>I never even tried deleting my alias and never have seen this image before.</p>
<p>i have escalated this matter because i did not have any information. i just got to know from my bank when they start getting deliverable messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need this account back because my bank account is associated with this.</p>

            Hi TerryPaine,<br />
<br />
I believe the LG Xenon from ATT is not running a version Windows Mobile (6.0 or 6.1) or Windows Phones (6.5) as its operating system.&nbsp; There's a limitation that Microsoft My Phone only works with those three device operating system.&nbsp; Unfortunately this means
 you will not be able to use the My Phone service to back up and restore your data.<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A possible reason why the image you're are inserting in Excel changes automatically is due to the settings configuration in Office. We recommend that you see the articles below:</p>

Insert pictures</a> and follow the on-screen instructions under <strong>Insert a picture into a cell in Excel</strong>.</p>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to gather a bit more information to better help you in resizing the picture in your Excel file. That being said, can you send us a screenshot of the issue you are experiencing? Make sure that you remove all personal information.</p>

<p>OK . So I'm in Windows 10 Pro in 100 % screen display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I take a picture with square resolution like this :</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5075b082-5d9b-4a74-b86d-f8c1a7e3e07a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5075b082-5d9b-4a74-b86d-f8c1a7e3e07a" /></a></p>
<p>- then , I "insert" it in an excel cell like and I see that the resolution is always square - I save my excel file.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7cd1d49f-cc98-4798-9b70-0c398c872cae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7cd1d49f-cc98-4798-9b70-0c398c872cae" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Then, I change my display&nbsp; of my screen and I pass in 125 % mode:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36336ef9-1e99-4190-a03e-557f11f3738a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36336ef9-1e99-4190-a03e-557f11f3738a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- To finish , I open again my excel file and my picture is no longer square:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/122c9d14-16e3-410d-8b7b-ff5324344511" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/122c9d14-16e3-410d-8b7b-ff5324344511" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and It's the same problem with a single object in excel like a text zone.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for the detailed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We performed the same steps that you did but did not experience the same issue when reopening Excel. Below are the possible reasons why you are experiencing this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Picture file is not compatible with your Excel</li><li>Corrupted Office application</li><li>This issue may have something to do with the components of the computer since after changing the Display to 125%, the picture on the file changes.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, we will be performing some troubleshooting steps to isolate the cause of this issue. First, we will check if the picture file is compatible with your Excel. We advise trying other pictures and check if you will still experience the same
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, we will check if you have a corrupted Office by performing an online repair via Control Panel. Here’s the
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> where you can find the methods on how to perform an online repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to add, we will be performing the rest of the troubleshooting steps once we get a result of the above troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the result for further assistance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Second : Same problem with another picture in jpg, in png ...</p>
<p>Third: I've the same problem with an object text zone like this :</p>
<p>In windows 100 % : I insert an objet text zone, I save excel file .</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/846543b7-1625-4513-ade1-60d135d4445a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/846543b7-1625-4513-ade1-60d135d4445a" /></a></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. But I've the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, My excel is OK with the last version :</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/29ce057e-4ae2-40d0-816f-7214eaa05e2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/29ce057e-4ae2-40d0-816f-7214eaa05e2d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, i've done another excel file in 100 % Windows scale like this :</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4790d651-1a8a-42cc-b505-5ab218290e6e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4790d651-1a8a-42cc-b505-5ab218290e6e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then, I set my Windows in 125 % scale and I re-open my excel file .&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac3335de-906e-4e5b-82ef-827013afcb2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac3335de-906e-4e5b-82ef-827013afcb2d" /></a></p>

                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get this Error message when I try and use Outlook, Word and Excel: <br />
"We're sorry, but Excel has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly. Excel will need to be closed as a result."</p>
<p>" Would you like us to repair now?"</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried Repair Now - it doesn't do anything and closes the program down&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to go to File - Accounts - Office updates - Update now. Installed updates and restarted my computer, but it haven't fixed my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see a lot of others have the same problem. This is for Word, Excel and Mail as far as I know.</p>

<h2>            Creating a formula in Access</h2>
                    We have payrolls that we enter for Pension Plans in our Access database. We have updated our 2nd Quarter with new employees for each company. Is it possible to create a formula that sums up various employees gross payroll amounts in one new line (employee
 table) instead of adding each individual employee amounts?

<p>Post example of raw data and what you want as a result. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; If plan on having a record in the employee table for the SUM that is a bad idea as when any employee is changed the data would be in error. &nbsp; It should be calculated when needed.</p>

            <p>I'm not at all clear what you are trying to do. You can sum any number of data elements in Access using a variety of methods. But without understanding your table structure&nbsp;<span>or how the "various employees" are defined&nbsp;</span><span>its
 hard to advise.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if you have a field in an employee record for GrossPay, you can create a query that groups by company, for example and sums the gross pay. This is called a Group By or Totals query. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT CompanyID, Sum(Grosspay) As TotalPay</p>
<p>FROM table</p>
<p>GROUP BY CompanyID;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will give you one line for each company with the Gross pay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can define better what you need we may be able to help further.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I expect that you need to update the printer driver from the manufacturer. Word and Windows use that driver to talk to the printer. It has to be specific to the Operating System.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards

<br />
<br />This does not mean that you do not need an updated printer driver. That the printer works on different computer does not mean that this computer does not need an updated driver, even with a new printer. That said, also check the Word settings mentioned by macropod.
<br />
<br />Does it print in color when you print a picture? A web page?

    <title>Switching between one and two columns within the same section due to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicholasd&#39;alonzo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Switching between one and two columns within the same section due to having end of section referencing.</h2>
                    This is both a word and an endnote issue. <br />
I was previously keeping my document chapters in separate files as such I had referencing for each chapter separately. However I am required to submit only the single file so I combined the chapters.
<br />
<br />
This worked well until I was asked to make edits to the now combined file.<br />
After completing my edits on chapter one I realised the references hadn't changed. They had all gone to the bottom of the document. I fixed this by changing the endnote settings so that references are now produced whenever I section break.<br />
<br />
However, one of my chapters switches between one and two columns throughout, back and forth. I achieved this with section breaks but now whenever I section break endnote produces a references list. So I need to be able to switch between one and two columns
 without a section break. (or get endnote to put the references exactly where I want them).

However, that option is greyed out and I can't select it.<br />

Oh! I just realised there is a difference between endnote... and the endnote program which is what I am referring to.

<h2>            latest Office Outlook patches stop DMARC reports</h2>
                    <p>On June 14, 2017 my computer [Windows 7] applied the latest MS Office 2010 Security patches.&nbsp; After this,&nbsp;DMARC reports from all sites that receive email from me hosted mail servers [Hotmail, google, etc. ] which are ZIPped files, are shown as "Outlook blocked
 access to the following potential unsafe attachments" followed by the name of the ZIP file containing the DMARC reports.&nbsp; Prior to this, DMARC reports were received perfectly.&nbsp; Event the reports received OK prior to June 14, are now shown as blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can send myself ZIP files with no problem so I know it isn't the ZIP extension causing the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did Microsoft really arbitrarily decide to prevent me from receiving DMARC reports?</p>

<p>What is the file name of the attachments? Does it perhaps have a double dot and an exclamation mark in the file name?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The June security updates is causing various issues with attachments which Microsoft is currently investigating.</p>

<p>Those file names have an exclamation mark (!) in them and are therefor blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is currently revising this security change as the usability impact was higher than anticipated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that you basically also have multiple extensions since you have dots in your file name. While this isn't the reason the files are blocked (that's because of the exclamation mark), this isn't recommended either. Dashes (-) are safe to use and are the
 recommended alternative.</p>

<p>I understand the problem with the ! and the 'multiple extensions' in the zipped filenames.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is these are DMARC reports create by Hotmail [Microsoft itself!] GMail [Googl]e, and other email servers.&nbsp; This is the standard report attachment naming convention they [including Microsoft in Hotmail]&nbsp;use.&nbsp; Recipients have no control over how
 they [and Microsoft in Hotmail] name these reports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will watch for&nbsp;Microsoft to fix this. Thank you for your assistance.</p>

<h2>            don&#39;t find the &#34;export chat log to csv&#34; function as in previous versions</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,<br />
Skype version 8.16.0.4<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Calling version 2018.07.01.5<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OS version: Windows7, 64 bit<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i looked up and down, can't find the "export chat log to csv" function as in previous versions, where is it? the only similar one is the Application Settings-&gt;Export chat history, but it definitely can not fulfill
 the demand after i tried it.<br />
Thanks for clarification.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; while it's nice to hear that "</span><span>In the new Skype, your chat history will be exported as HTML</span><span>". but what's the detailed steps/how
 to handle with it? as i said, i can't find it after looking up and down in the new skype.</span></p>

Hi Julie_S1,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; As i stated from the very beginning of this question session, i knew the profile photo &gt; Application settings &gt; Scroll down and look for Export chat history.&nbsp; function, and i stated it "the only similar one is the Application Settings-&gt;Export chat history,
 but it definitely can not fulfill the demand after i tried it."
<p>
</p><p>anyway, i upload the screenshot when i tried the function as you said as beneath, so as you can see, there's nothing i can do from this function, but only "Close" it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/480322c5-fc5d-49cc-ad4c-359f566e5527?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/480322c5-fc5d-49cc-ad4c-359f566e5527?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; i know what it stated here, while what i expect is export the CURRENT chat history, not the "previous" Skype installation chat history, so what can i do now to fulfill my expection here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So can you see my point now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for your investigation.</p>

<p>so what you implied is the current new&nbsp;skype can't export the chat log?</p>
<p>how can that happen? i mean, what can i do to export the chat log in my current version?</p>
<p>the scenario is: i just download the newest version of&nbsp;skype directly into my laptop, and generated some chat, and now i need to export it, what's the process to fulfill it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>the core point here is: why the system need the classic version to support this function?</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/9c07059c-ac97-42c7-913c-7da2ef5cdd3f" title="TonyGibon">
<p>
</p><p>The chat logs that you can extract using the New Skype are only the chat messages saved locally from the classic Skype.</p>
<p>Messages that was sent and received using the New Skype are saved on the cloud hence, there is no option to extract it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned above the screenshot that you have provide, it will only extract messages from version 7.xx which is the Classic Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have not installed Classic Skype from this computer, then there isn't any chat history to extract.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For you to get a copy of your conversation you will have to manually copy and paste it to either notepad or MS Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have other concerns.</p>

<p>Hi <span>Mark_N13</span>, </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; i see it now, thanks for the frank sentence.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;and as a feature suggestion for the New Skype, can the "chat export" function be added in the near future, since it's called the "New Skype", which lead/stand for the future?<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;thanks for consideration.</p>

            Many thanks for your valuable assistance!I did manage to get my msn home page back.Unfortunately,I can't tell you what did the trick,because I worked on it for hours,trying all kinds of things.<br />
Initially,a notice appeared that the page was changed,and instead of my usual msn.ca page,I kept getting the "Loop",which I want to have nothing to do.So I worked by trying IE browser,also on one of my other computer(one with Firefox 20.0,the other Firefox
 4.0),and so much more.In the end,I got my original homepage back and I bookmarked it in case this happens in the future.I know I system restored to several days back,which was probably what did the trick.All this happened as I had problems with my Outlook
 mail(I accidentally clicked on "basic"and there went my usual Outlook.com.I did have to ask your help to get it back.There too,it was hours of work,and I can't duplicate it now.NEVER A DULL MOMENT.Especially because major companies(Google g-mail recently for
 example),decide to fix what "a'int broke"and come up with new ideas(that are not so good sometimes:just new may not be better!).<br />
Thanks anyway.It is great to have people like you,who can and will help every time!!!!!Very grateful!!!<br />

<h2>            Disable Ruled View for new pages in One Note Mobile</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A recent update to OneNote has caused all new pages that I create on my Windows 10 Mobile to be ruled.&nbsp; There does not appear to be a 'View' menu on the mobile version of the app so how do I set it to create plain pages?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Good day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates provide new feature and/or to improve an apps performance. Let's work this out by providing the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the OS build currently installed? To check, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong> &gt; <strong>More </strong><strong>info</strong>.</li><li>Can you confirm if <strong>Enable </strong><strong>Beta</strong><strong> Preview</strong> is currently turned Off? To verify, launch
<strong>OneNote</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e9245aa-8324-4d81-b23c-716834218851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e9245aa-8324-4d81-b23c-716834218851" height="26" width="25" /></a><strong>
 Menu</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>OneNote </strong><strong>Preview</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If it's currently off, exit and reload OneNote app by holding the<strong> Back</strong> button, tapping
<strong>X</strong> button or swiping down to exit the app and load it again. Then, try creating a new page to see if it makes any difference.</p>

    <title>Creating Paragraph Breaks within Conditional Field Codes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomas-4543  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating Paragraph Breaks within Conditional Field Codes</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to create a sequential list using field codes and mail merge. My problem is that certain items do not need to appear on the list, depending on how the mail merge goes. This is confusing, so I will give an example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say I'm putting together a list of quantities for various fruits. I've got a mail merge document that tells me how many apples, oranges, and pears I have. So the list might look like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. There are 32 apples.</p>
<p>2. There are 27 oranges.</p>
<p>3. There are 3 pears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using field codes it looks more like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(SEQ list1) There are (MERGEFIELD "Apples") apples.</p>
<p>(SEQ list1) There are (MERGEFIELD "Oranges") oranges.</p>
<p>(SEQ list 1) There are (MERGEFIELD "Pears") pears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if there are no oranges, I don't want it to be on the list at all. I just want the list to look this this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. There are 32 apples.</p>
<p>2. There are 3 pears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this, I use if/then conditioning. (IF (MERGEFIELD Oranges) = 0 "" "(SEQ list1) There are (MERGEFIELD "Apples") apples. This is successful in removing the oranges from the list, but there remains a space:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. There are 32 apples.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. There are 3 pears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried every which way I can thing to get rid of that space, but I can't figure it out. Perhaps someone here could help me.</p>

<h2>            How to copy the attendee list with responses</h2>
                    <p>When using Outlook 2013 on the PC I'm able to easily copy the list of meeting attendees and their attendance status by selecting "Copy Status to Clipboard" in the Tracking button on the ribbon. However, I can't find a way to do the same thing on Outlook.com.
 Is there such a mechanism that I'm missing? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to easily copy out the meeting responses so I can create a quick list of expected attendees. Doing this manually for meetings of 5 is ok, but not having this functionality for meetings of 20+ gets annoying quickly.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Dicom Medical imaging system does not run</h2>
                    The medical community uses the Dicom Imaging System for many of its image handling needs. I got a PET Scan today and as usual I decided to look at it to see it it was OK. Dicom disks I have used have a self starter for image viewing. It would not run in
 Win 10, but was fine in Win 7. I cant tell you the version of 10, but it had a upgrade last week 2/22/15-2/28/15.&nbsp;
