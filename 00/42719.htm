    <title>Can Surface Dock be powered by 12 Volts&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can Surface Dock be powered by 12 Volts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Can the Surface Dock (Brick type for Surface Pro 3 and 4) be powered from 12 volts? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to use it on my boat and the installation would be in a dry location below decks. &nbsp;I recognize that I would need a cable to connect the 12V boat outlet to the power input on the side of the docking station instead of the AC power supply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the intended use:</p>
<p>Docking station connected to boat 12V power with docking station output connected to Surface Pro 4 (I5, 8gb memory, 256gb storage)</p>
<p>Docking station ethernet connected to router on boat for internet connectivity</p>
<p>Docking station USB port connected to RF dongle for keyboard and mouse</p>
<p>Docking station USB port connected to Garmin GND10 for boat navigation and sensor data</p>
<p>Docking station display port connected to external monitor via HDMI</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the docking station would be ideal because I can mount the Surface Pro 4 with a Ram Mount universal X grip so it is secure when the boat is in motion. &nbsp;The single cable to the Surface Pro 4 and the Ram mount would allow me to easily connect and disconnect
 the Surface Pro when I wanted to, but leave all the other cables connected.</p>

            <p>Answering my own question now that the Surface Dock has arrived. &nbsp;The dock has stamped on it the following information:</p>
<p>Input 15V 6A, Output to Surface 15V 4 A, USB 5V 1.5A max.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice if Microsoft would include this information in the Tech Specs on their
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/accessories/surface-dock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
website for the Surface Dock</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll get a small DC-DC buck converter to power the Surface Dock with 15V.</p>

<h2>            Can microsoft shut down laptop with counterfeit software&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hello All,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I sold an HP laptop to a girl via Ebay in december 2011. I have today (2/2/2012) received a dispute notice from ebay ref the purchase.</div>
<div>She is claiming the software (supplied by HP) is counterfeit and Microsoft are going to shut down the laptop!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The laptop OS, win 7 home premium 64 bit (supplied by HP) was clean re-installed to remove my personal data before posting, I thought it was sensible to do this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I think seeing as she has had it 6 weeks already she has damaged it and is looking for a refund by making bizarre threats.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, my question as per the title of this post, can Microsoft shut down a laptop running a counterfeit version of windows?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you all very much</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Mark</div>
                </div>

            <p><span>&nbsp;When Windows 7 fails validation, a message reminding you that Windows might not be genuine begins appearing on your desktop. You’ll also receive reminders when you log in and at intervals while you're using Windows, and your desktop wallpaper will
 change to a plain black background. You can reset your desktop background to a favorite wallpaper or different color, but it will reset to this plain black background every 60 minutes. In addition, you won't be able to receive optional (non-security) updates
 from Windows Update. This experience will continue until Windows is genuine.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If you reinstalled it using the product key on the COA, it is likely you failed to properly activate it as you would have had to activate it by phone. ( note: You have a 30 day grace period after install to do this. After 30 days windows will show
 as not genuine.)</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Have your customer go to the link provided above by Try*3. Read the announcements at the top of the page and post a MGA diagnostic report for analysis.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Also have her give you a link to the thread so you can follow it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>EDIT: It is quite common for sellers to install bogus windows on their product so she should be&nbsp;suspicious. &nbsp;You need to take responsibility to fix this unless she has installed a bogus windows. The MGA diagnostic analysis will tell you what is going
 on.</span></p>

<h3> charbelf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk Cleanup Issue &#34;Windows Update Cleanup&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, i'm pretty sure this has been asked many times before but i believe it has never been solved, anyway here it goes: upon running the Disk Cleanup Utility as administrator you get an option to delete Windows Update Cleanup files as well as Thumbnails,
 The problem is when i do press delete they are actually not removed because when i repeat the process again i still see 50 Mb of Windows Update Cleanup and 3 Mb of thumbnails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: i use CCleaner to delete the usual browser stuff and Tuneup Utilities 2014 for periodic registry scans
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is a minimum default amount of space for thumbnails... it will never go to zero...</p>
<p>3mb is about as low as you will get..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update Cleanup is a bit the same way... I think the update needs to be a certain minimum "age" before it will be cleared...</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply PA Bear yeah i do realise now that we should never mess with the registry even if there is false/missing entries and to answer your question i don't really know if Tuneup Utilities stores a backup registry file, and don't use CCleaner
 for registry cleanup. However i suppose Slance310 has a point as well because i read somewhere that thumbnails will never get to zero and i don't know of it actually applies to the update cleanup part.</p>
<p>Thanks guys</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a scheduled task does not run, ensure that the task is enabled and triggers are set correctly. You can also check the history of the task to see when the task was started and to check for errors. Some tasks will only run when a certain user is logged
 on, depending on a task's security options. If a scheduled task does not run when you expect it to run, ensure that the task's security options are set correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to emulate this issue on a different administrator account and see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Surface Laptop Dock Problems</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>We have 3 Surface laptops with each of them connected to dual Dell U2415 monitors through surface Dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Set Up:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 identical set up.<br />
Each consisting of a new Surface laptop, Surface Dock, and dual dell U2415 monitors</li><li>I connected the Dell monitors by daisy chaining them. I connected them with Display Port and display port mini (DP &amp; mDP).<br />
I have DP 1.2 enabled on the first monitor and disabled on the second monitor as specified by Dell.</li><li>I connected first monitor to the surface Dock</li><li>I plugged the surface dock to the Surface laptop</li></ul>
<p>During the set up processes, it successfully detected all 3 monitors including the laptop's monitor and I set it to extend to the two monitors with out the laptop monitor.&nbsp; Which worked perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
<p>After all systems have been powered down over night, the surface dock does not detect the monitors. I tried turning the monitors off and on and switching inputs but nothing. I also unplugged the dock from the laptop and plugged it back on and still nothing.
 I went through the laptop setting and it could not detect the dell monitors. I also updated the firmware and still nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: this happened on all 3 setups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it worked after I unplugged the power from the the Surface dock for about 30 seconds and plug it back in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this solution is not suitable to do every morning for all the setups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had a similar issue?</p>

<p>Hi ntsami, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Updating the your Surface Dock may help resolve the issue. Click <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023478" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> to learn how to update your dock.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If updating the dock didn't help, run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit. The diagnosis and repair takes about 15 minutes as it would check for both Windows and driver updates. It will automatically install any missing driver and firmware updates for your device<span>.
</span><span><span>Click&nbsp;<span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here&nbsp;</a></strong></span>to learn how to run the toolkit.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After running the toolkit, force shutdown and restart your device to ensure that all updates are applied.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button until the screen turns off (about 10 seconds), then release the power button.</li><li><span><span><span>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Microsoft logo.</span></span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If that doesn't work, use this shutdown process to make sure your Surface completely turns off. Here’s how:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Press and hold down the power button until your Surface restarts and you see the Windows logo screen (this takes about 20 seconds), then release the power button.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Here are other solutions that you can try: </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Change the refresh rate if your external displays</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span><span><span><span>Minimize all apps.</span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Right-click on the desktop background and choose<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Display Settings</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Select the external display.</span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Scroll to the bottom of the page and choose<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Display adaptor properties</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Monitor</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>tab.</span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Change the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Screen refresh rate</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>from the dropdown menu. Try a lower refresh rate.</span></span></span></span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If your Surface is not running Windows 10 S</strong>, clear the display cache.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Undock your Surface from the Surface Dock.</li><li><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/5/5/8554763F-DBF9-41B3-9F12-605FA0A99183/surface%20dock%20registry.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download the Surface Dock registry file</a>. Choose to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Open</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>the
 file.</li><li>Select and run<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>surface dock registry.reg</strong>.</li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Yes</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to allow changes to your Surface, select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Yes</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to confirm, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>OK</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to close.</li><li>Restart your Surface, reconnect it to the Surface Dock, and try your external display again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Change the Surface Connect plug orientation / flip the connection</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Turn the Surface connector 180 degrees and reseat it to the side of your Surface device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Try a different cable</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>It may be that the cable is having issues.</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>It is recommended to use the shortest cable length available. The shorter cable the stronger the signal between monitor and dock. Try a
 different adapter if you're using one. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>If none of the these solutions work, then you may need to get a replacement dock.
</span></p>
<p>Feel free to post back if you have any other concerns. </p>

<p>
</p><p>We have 3 Surface laptops with each of them connected to dual Dell U2415 monitors through surface Dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Set Up:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 identical set up.<br />
Each consisting of a new Surface laptop, Surface Dock, and dual dell U2415 monitors</li><li>I connected the Dell monitors by daisy chaining them. I connected them with Display Port and display port mini (DP &amp; mDP).<br />
I have DP 1.2 enabled on the first monitor and disabled on the second monitor as specified by Dell.</li><li>I connected first monitor to the surface Dock</li><li>I plugged the surface dock to the Surface laptop</li></ul>
<p>During the set up processes, it successfully detected all 3 monitors including the laptop's monitor and I set it to extend to the two monitors with out the laptop monitor.&nbsp; Which worked perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
<p>After all systems have been powered down over night, the surface dock does not detect the monitors. I tried turning the monitors off and on and switching inputs but nothing. I also unplugged the dock from the laptop and plugged it back on and still nothing.

</blockquote>
<p>We are a familybusiness in Sweden that have 2 identical setups plus our son have another setup. Same problem on all three.&nbsp;We got one of the docks exchanged in the beginning with the same problem on the new one.!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The connector on the side between the surface and the dock is probably&nbsp; the problem. It might work better with the new dock with a loose connector, but guess what. To fix the problem the price on the new is 2,5 times the faulty one..... and we just dont
 trust Microsoft anymore.&nbsp; Judging from this thread we are not alone, there are a lot of Microsoft customers out there to handle....</p>

            We appreciate the prompt response. Our next step is to confirm if the issue is caused by a conflicting software. To do this, we suggest that you perform a clean boot to start your device using a minimal set of drivers and programs. You can follow the steps
 provided on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="How to perform a clean boot in Windows">
link </a>under <strong>Windows 7 and Windows Vista</strong>. Click the drop-down arrow to view the steps.
<p>
</p><p>In addition, disable the anti-virus program that's installed on your device before performing the clean boot to prevent any software conflicts. Once you're on the clean boot environment, replicate the concern and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure to enable your anti-virus program after performing the clean boot.</em></p>

<h2>            BITS service problems-related to Norton Removal Tool&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have posted here twice recently regarding the BITS service not starting and therefore cannot get Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time I have had the problem, it has been just after running the Norton Removal Tool to remove Norton 360 as it is not compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 8.1 partition so I ran the tool on that and, sure enough, on re-booting the BITS service would not start.</p>
<p>I did a system restore and the service was running ok, so just to check that I was correct, I ran the NRT again, re-booted and the BITS service would not start again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching the net for solutions showed that over the years the failure of the BITS service to start has been on ongoing problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How many of the people with the problem had run the Norton Removal Tool prior to the problem occurring?</p>

            <p>Based on this and your previous posts, I'm pretty sure I had the same problem with BITS not starting after running the Norton Removal Tool. I managed to fix it with a system reset, but I'm not going to try to reproduce it to be sure.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, as of sometime in the last day or two, Norton 360 is now Windows 10 compatible.</p>

            <p>I am not 100% sure of when BITS stopped working, but it did stop and I did use the NRT to allow me to install NOD32.&nbsp; I have tried all the recommended fixers (sfc, dism, fixit, etc.) and while they are good at telling me I have a problem they are unable
 to fix it.&nbsp; Manually starting BITS fails.&nbsp; I can't do refresh because I don't have backup media but ordered media today from Toshiba for my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree, it seems like there are a fair number of issue with corrupt BITS environment on the various forums.&nbsp; Fixit or some other utility should be revised to at least allow a clean install of required components.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will followup with any successes.</p>

            <p>I had the same issue, Norton Removal Tool messes up BITS. &nbsp;Mostly the registry keys I believe. &nbsp;After I got burned the second time by the program, and I tried every BITS fix I found on the forums, I stumbled on a thread where the tech expert ended up recommending
 the guy run Tweaking.com's Windows Repair tool. &nbsp;Worked for him, I gave it a shot , and it worked for me. &nbsp;They have a specific repair just for Windows Installation fixes. &nbsp;Works on all recent version of Windows and is free. &nbsp;I leave this here in the hopes
 other people will stumble upon this post.</p>

            <p>I had read this too.&nbsp; However, I have had some very specific experience that refutes the theory that the Norton Removal Tool causes the BITS corruption problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the September patch Tuesday, I had 11 of my 150 client computer unable to do updates.&nbsp; It took a lot of time, but eventually I solved them all.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some important background information.&nbsp; Until a year ago or so, ALL of my clients' computers had Norton Antivirus.&nbsp; I have been removing Norton and installing Bitdefender Antivirus, as each subscription ran out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Six of the 11 were unable to do WU because BITS had been corrupted.&nbsp; The only way I could correct the situation was to restore them to a date about 2 months prior.&nbsp; In each case, the restore, restored Norton.&nbsp; I used the Norton Removal Tool
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/norton-removal-tool/dl/48/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/norton-removal-tool/dl/48/</a> , because Symantec's removal tool did not work at the time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In every one of the six cases I used that tool and it did NOT corrupt BITS.&nbsp; Windows Update then worked in a normal way.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>My conclusion is that the Norton Removal Tool did NOT cause the BITS corruption.</strong></em>&nbsp; I do not know what caused it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a recommendation for you that enables keeping a lot more restore points.&nbsp; The fact that I had made this change in most of my client computers made it possible for me to do restores 2 months back.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default restore point space allotment in Windows 7 is 3% of drive capacity.&nbsp; In almost all cases, the computer is using but a very small proportion of the space available.&nbsp; That makes it very practical to raise that 3% to say 8 to 10%.&nbsp; This strategy
 will yield far more restore points that will give you much more flexibility in recovering a bad situation.</p>

            Which version of Microsoft Office or Microsoft Word is it? 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.

<h2>            Upgrading to an SSD - Can I still upgrade my windows 8 to windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have a HDD installed but have bought a new SSD for my PC. I want to install windows on my SSD. However, I only have a physical windows 8 to install. If I install windows 8 onto my SSD can I still upgrade it to windows 10?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not changing any other parts of my PC(motherboard etc). I've found out about the digital license but I'm confused as to which part of the hardware this is connected to?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you :)&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Rebecca.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you've already Upgraded to Windows 10 then the PC has permanent Digital License to reinstall Windows as often as you want and it will reactivate unless you change the motherboard which requires special steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />But changing to an SSD will not matter so I'd create the bootable Windows 10 installation media to do the vastly superior Clean Install which  compiles the best possible install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given in this tutorial, and has zero reported problems from those who do so:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            If you're happy with the present install you could also save a System Image backup externally using the expert's choice free Macrium, swap the drives in and apply the image in 20 minutes using the bootable media it will create for you:

<h2>            USB MIDI Device Doesn&#8217;t Work on USB 3.0 Port</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I ask my question, I've had a chance to review: <strong>
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 8.1</span>: USB MIDI Device Works on USB 2.0 Port, Doesn’t Work on USB 3.0 Port&nbsp;</strong>https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/usbcoreblog/2014/01/21/windows-8-1-usb-midi-device-works-on-usb-2-0-port-doesnt-work-on-usb-3-0-port/&nbsp;
 &nbsp;I will be referencing this blog in my question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Education and I have a USB Midi device I'd like to connect to a DAW (FL Studio or Ableton) but I receive an error message when connecting the device: USB device not recognized. I've learned it's likely the Feature Descriptor request
 that's creating the error. I followed all of the steps in the above blog, but I'm unable to construct the registry key location from the<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;idVendor,
 idProduct, and bcdDevice values.&nbsp;</span>The values are all 0's. I am unable to complete those steps and my device cannot enumerate or be recognized. I have also installed previous driver software with compatibility settings to no avail. What are the steps
 necessary to get Windows 10 to recognize a USB 2.0 Midi device? Will a driver need to be created from scratch? I am happy to contribute to a solution, I just need to better understand the problem.&nbsp;</p>

You may be prompted to provide the path of the driver. Windows may have the driver built-in, or may still have the driver files installed from the last time that you set up the device. However, sometimes, it will open the New Hardware Wizard which may ask for
 the driver. If you are asked for the driver and you do not have it, you can try to download the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s Web site.

    <title>Amount of storage and Storage Sense - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robyn marie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Amount of storage and Storage Sense</h2>
                    I'm running version 1803 in Windows 10.&nbsp; I have 775 GB free and 144 GB being used.&nbsp; Several times a day I get a notification that Storage Sense wants to free up space as I'm running low.&nbsp; Every time I allow it to "clean up" my computer it tells me it couldn't
 free up any space.&nbsp; Looks to me like I have plenty of space but I"m wondering now if I'm missing something as that notification keeps appearing.&nbsp; Is there anything I can or should do?

            <pre>Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Storage &gt; Change how we free up space automatically 
Click in the list box for Storage Sense and choose a longer period. 
Press Windows key + X
Click Windows PowerShell (Admin)
At the prompt, type the following command or copy and paste it then hit Enter. Exit then restart.
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
Check if Storage Sense works again. 
Another option is, you can Disk Cleanup:
Problem 1: Lack of free space.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder.
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now
Wait while it scans for temporary files.
Check any location with large amounts of space.
Click Remove files.
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space. 
Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

To delete an existing connection, use notepad to open the above file, find the unwanted name, then find the next square bracket [, then delete everything in between. You have to log off to make the change stick.<br />

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>You can set the computer to prompt for the password when you install any program using the User Account Control (UAC) on the computer. However you will not be able to prompt Windows to prompt for password when you try to download and program.</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer the following link on changing the User Account control settings for more information.</span></p>

<h2>            taskmgr.exe unknown publisher</h2>
                    Hello.&nbsp; I am using windows 8.&nbsp; When I try to open task manager I get the window that pops up that asks do I want to allow this program to make changes, and it lists the name as taskmgr.exe&nbsp; publisher unknown.&nbsp; It seems odd that it doesn't list the publisher
 as microsoft, so I have yet to say yes.&nbsp; Any suggestions ?&nbsp; Thank you for your help =)

<h2>            &#34;Emerging Issue 67758&#34; identified by a troubleshooter</h2>
                    <p>During a troubleshoot scanning my laptop with the OS windows 10, it identified an issue 67758, but there is no solution for the issue yet (it stated there). Recently, I found my Start Menu, Action Center, and others default program on the task bar would
 delay or can't even open them! Does these problems related to the issue 67758? Any solution to fix it?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I was on with a support tech and she did the usual. She also said they could service it but it would cost because some how the problem Microsoft created is an issue NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY?!?!?!?!?!?!? And now I'm on with one that says to have 3 separate
 windows of CMD (Admin) open and do the following commands in them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>sfs /scannow</li><li>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</li><li>Third window
<ol>
<li>ipconfig /flushdns</li><li>netsh winsock reset</li></ol>
</li></ol>
<div>
<p>Then he said to restart after all of those commands complete. If that doesn't work he said reinstall the old os and upgrade to Windows 10 again........</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other support tech, she did the first two of those commands in one CMD admin window (after I had to open cmd for her cause she had no idea how not to open it in start menu when start menu isn't working because of the issue).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had run the troubleshooter to no avail. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say, automatic updates is going off and I feel sorry for those stuck with Windows 10 Home. It's so stupid they haven't really even properly addressed the issue yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: It's official, I will be doing a fresh install. FML</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 automatic repair loop...</h2>
                    I'm stuck in the infamous automatic repair loop on my tower. I have looked over every forum I can find, and cannot come up with an answer. I have backed up my HDD, so it is no issue to do a complete reset. The only problem, is that it didn't work. It said
 the reset failed. I also tried making a bootable installation DVD from my windows 10 laptop, and it didn't work either. No matter how many times i've searched, I cannot come across the srttrail.txt in any folder on the command prompt. The only 2 drives I have
 access to are D:/ and X:/. The C:/ is blank. The D:/ appears to have all of my data and files on it, including windows and program files and etc. I am ok with buying a new HDD, as this one is about 6 yrs old, and I'm thinking that that might be the problem,
 but my question for you all, is, will that fix the problem, or is it a possible BIOS/motherboard/CPU problem? Also, is there anything else I can do before buying a new HDD? The only recovery option I have available is the comma
