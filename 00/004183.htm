    <title>Office 2016 any open in Protected Mode fails with Corrupted File error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 2016 any open in Protected Mode fails with Corrupted File error</h2>
                    <p>I've had 32-bit Office 2016 installed on this Win 10 64-bit system for quite a few months with no issue. This behavior started recently. Possibly with the latest Windows or Office update? I'm unsure what the trigger was. But all updates are applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither Excel or Word will open a file in Protected or Read-Only mode. It's easiest to show this by shift-right-clicking a file and trying to open in that mode explicitly. For "Protected Mode" Excel says "The file is corrupt and cannot be opened." while
 Word says "Word experienced an error trying to open the file." "Read-Only" mode results in the files opening normally for editing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens to all Word/Excel files. Note that the files open as expected when opened normally for editing. And Excel/Word seem to behave as expected when open for normal editing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, the Outlook preview viewers for Word and Excel are broken. When trying to preview an Excel file it briefly says it's opening the Microsoft Excel previewer, then says that this file cannot be previewed because no previewer is installed for it.
 Curiously, the file previewer for Excel works in File Explorer when the preview pane is open. I'm pretty sure this is the same previewer as Outlook tries to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have repaired, and uninstalled/reinstalled Office. I have verified that DCOM is enabled and the default authentication and impersonation are correct. I have verified the registry entries for the previewers, and the previewers in Outlook are enabled and
 selected. Yes, I know how to bypass Protected/Read-only mode, but I'd like to have it work as designed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody have any ideas what might be going on?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;TinNickels,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing a detailed information about your concern. Since you're still experiencing the issue after performing troubleshooting steps for the Office application, there is a possibility that this issue is related to the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have another user profile on your PC, we suggest using it for the meantime and check if the same issue persists. On the other hand, i<span>f you only have one user account on your PC, you can try creating another local user or administrator account
 to check if the same issue persists. For the steps on how to do this, kindly check the article:&nbsp;</span><span><em><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Create
 a local user or administrator account in Windows 10</strong></span></a></span></em></span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you continue to have this issue even after performing the above steps, please reply to this thread. The system will notify us so we can get back to you and provide you more answers.</span></p>

<p>I tried this under a different local admin account and the results are the same. This was a virgin account, so this behavior doesn't seem specific to a single user profile or to any particular user profile settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas??.<br />

            I was finally able to resolve this. I had observed that on a working machine, Protected view launched an Excel child process which was the sandboxed Protected view window. On the problematic system, this child process never showed up.<br />
<br />
Using the SysInternals Process Monitor, I logged the launch of an Excel file in Protected view. Then filtered the log for Excel.exe entries with an "ACCESS DENIED" result. There's a ton of registry events in there, but these did not seem to be causing any issue.
 They were also present in a normal Excel launch. However, there were 2 create file events for different DLL files that were unique to the Protected view launch. The inability to access one or more DLL files could certainly prevent a process from launching.<br />
<br />
The two files were both in the C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ folder. Specifically, they were vcruntime140.dll and msvcp140.dll. I compared the file security permissions between a working system and my problematic system. The problem system was missing Read and Read/Execute
 privileges for the objects ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES and ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES. I manually added the ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES object to each file. It defaulted to the right access privs, and after Apply the ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES
 just showed up as added as well. (I'm not really sure why that happens, but in this case, it's just what you want.)<br />
<br />
This fixed it immediately. Just relaunch Excel in Protected view and it works. My Outlook Previewers for Office docs are now working again as well. Hopefully this helps someone else or at least provides some useful breadcrumbs.

    <title>Webrec.ocx for Windows 8 &#40;64-bit&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> norm farrington  say:</h3>
<h2>            Webrec.ocx for Windows 8 &#40;64-bit&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have an older MACE DVR56-MR Security camera system that MACE no longer supports.&nbsp; I recently replaced my 9-year-old HP PC (XP) with a new HP Slimline running Windows 8 64-bit.&nbsp; I now cannot access my security cams on the new machine.&nbsp; Specifically I cannot
 install (even manually with regsvr32) the webrec.ocx ActiveX control.&nbsp; It (Regsvr32) says it is incompatible with 64-bit systems when I run it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried setting force compatibility mode for my camera system URL, just for kicks, but that made no difference.&nbsp; I get the MACE webserver header and footer that the built-in webserver on the MACE recorder sends out, but no Visual or Control window,
 just a very small box icon in the upper left corner of the IE page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MACE cannot help and I am having a very hard time finding a source for webrec.ocx (or webrec.cab) to install.&nbsp; The DVR56-MR system uses MPG4 VBR encoding for its video streaming and files.&nbsp; I don't really want to try to set up a virtual machine on windows
 8 (if even possible).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find a 64-bit webrec.ocx?</p>
<p>Address whether I can try something different (like using regedit to try to force the registry to use the one I have - doubtful, but I am desperate)?</p>
<p>Provide me with a security systems company contact (other than MACE - I already got a decline from them) who might help?</p>
<p>Have any other hints to try?</p>
<p>Is it possible to run a 32-bit version of IE10 (IE12) under a 64-bit Windows 8 - that might help?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Norm</p>

<h2>            VBA does not work with combination of vlookup</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, i am new to VBA and can't solve a problem with my code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have two tabs, on second one, i have a vlookup linked to a first one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If on first tab, cell contains yes/no, on the second tab, some rows get&nbsp; unhidden/hidden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOwever, the code does not work untill i make some kind of change on second tab first.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
On the first tab:</p>
<p>Sub dropdown()</p>
<p>Sheets("Table of contents").Select</p>
<p>With Range(Cells(6, 3), Cells(46, 3)).Validation</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Delete</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; End With</p>

</p><p>Vlookup on the second tab:</p>

<p>What triggers the dropdown() macro? (I'm assuming you start on the first tab)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second macro will only run if something is changed in that tab due to the event you are using. could you just include that code in the first macro? if you wanted it to update as soon as dropdown() is run?</p>

            The first code is superfluous, run it once then delete it. There is no need to create the data validation more then one time in the same cell.
<br />
<br />The second code can be optimized, because the rows are shown/hidden only if 2 cells (H7 and H30) are changed.
<br />
<br /><pre><code>Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
  'Only if one cell changes
  If Target.Count &gt; 1 Then Exit Sub
  'Which cell?
  Select Case Target.Address(0, 0)
    Case "H7"
      If Target.Value = "No" Or Target.Value = "" Then
        Rows("8:29").EntireRow.Hidden = True
      ElseIf Target.Value = "Yes" Then
        Rows("8:29").EntireRow.Hidden = False
      End If
    Case "H30"
      If Target.Value = "No" Or Target.Value = "" Then
        Rows("31:56").EntireRow.Hidden = True
      ElseIf Target.Value = "Yes" Then
        Rows("31:56").EntireRow.Hidden = False
      End If
  End Select
End Sub</code></pre>
<br />
<br />And yes, the Change event runs only if you make a manual change in the sheet. The Calculate event runs if a formula changes. Unfortunately the Calculate event do not let you know which cell changes. So you maybe have to replace the Change event code with the code below.
<br />
<br />Andreas.
<br />
<br />
<br /><pre><code>Private Sub Worksheet_Calculate()
  Static H7, H30
  
  With Range("H7")
    If H7 &lt;&gt; .Value Then
      If .Value = "No" Or .Value = "" Then
        Rows("8:29").EntireRow.Hidden = True
      ElseIf Target.Value = "Yes" Then
        Rows("8:29").EntireRow.Hidden = False
      End If
      H7 = .Value
    End If

      If .Value = "No" Or .Value = "" Then

<p>So, basically i have several topics on the first tab for example1</p>
<p>R6C2 Animals</p>
<p>R7C2 Birds</p>
<p>R8C2 Flowers&nbsp;</p>
<p>quite a lot of those...</p>
<p>then on the cells next to them i have a drop-down to indicate yes/no (R6C3 Yes/No, R7C3 Yes/No, R8C3 Yes/No) basically to show if topic is applicable or not.</p>
<p>and on the second tab i have details of each topic (like, R7C1: R7C14 Animals, then in rows below it details until next topic, then R30C1: R7C14 Birds and so on, and the same Yes/No is in column 8, which is connected through vlookup to first tab dropdown
 menu) According to this yes/no this details rows should be either not hidden or hidden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope i explained well, what it should be doing.</p>
<p>Now, everything is working, only the code on the second tab, only works, when i press enter on some cell or put anything in any cell, it does not automatically start working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;could you just include that code in the first macro? if you wanted it to update as soon as dropdown() is run? - I honestly do not know how to do this :)&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The first code is superfluous, run it once then delete it. There is no need to create the data validation more then one time in the same cell.&nbsp; - Is this still the case, if during the work in the document the Yes/No
 can change? Like if someone at the initial stage decided it was not applicable, but then changed his/her mind and now it should be Yes?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Because i am expecting this to happen a lot.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The second code can be optimized, because the rows are shown/hidden only if 2 cells (H7 and H30) are changed.&nbsp; - this is not quite true, cause i only took part of the code. In reality i have above 30 topics and above
 30 static cells.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I could rewrite the code for all cells in the indicated way, but i am guessing, that will not make the code run automatically anyway? Is this right?</span></p>
<p>

<p>Well, remaining part of the code was similar, just multiple different targets and rows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took me some time to delete sensitive information in the workbook so that i could upload it, but it is finally done and i can share the document now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the link to the workbook.</p>
<p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/covakwsliwgl5px/V6.xlsm?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>To summarize what it should be done:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On tab Table of contents, there are topics, now alphabet, and Yes/No dropdown next to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On tab Checklist, the same topics, have details in rows below (now they are empty)</p>
<p>Based on the Yes/No in first page, second page, should automatically be hiding/unhiding rows, below the specific topics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Current code does not do it automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For short solution, i created refresh button, that users can press after first tab Yes/No is chosen, to make second tab code working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In addition i have another code written on sheet 1, which summarized everything i have there, which is not included yet and i don't know how to incorporate that one so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That one should be also hiding some other cells, based on other criteria, but for that one, target is only one cell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea is to run this code as a superior one of the one, that is already in the worksheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope i make sense :D&nbsp;</p>

            Please do as follows:
<br />
<br />Open the file
<br />Open the VBA editor
<br />Delete all code in the code module in sheet "Table of contents"
<br />Delete all code in the code module in sheet "Checklist"
<br />Copy the code below into the code module in sheet "Table of contents"

    <title>Mail For Exchange - Server Config Query - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> retrokid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail For Exchange - Server Config Query</h2>
                    Hi there.<br />
<br />
We are in the process of rolling out new Mobile Phones throughout the business - namely the Nokia E51.<br />
<br />
I am also the IT system admim, and we have a run into a problem.<br />
<br />
We have 6 back end Exchange servers containing the users mailboxes. We have 1 front end Exchange Server, which is primarily used to handle all Webmail requests.<br />
<br />
The problem I have is that some of the Exchange Servers do not seem to like MfE. All mailboxes on all servers work fine with Outlook Web Access.<br />
<br />
On The Nokia E51, if I put in the credentials of userA for instance, I get the message on the phone "Error In Exchange Server. Try Again Later" But userB on another server works fine. And if i move the mailbox of UserA onto say the same mail server as UserB,
 MfE works fine!<br />
<br />
I can eliminate SSL certificates, and the front end setup, as some servers work and some don't. So it must be an Exchange or IIS setting on one of the servers which don't work?<br />
<br />
All Exchange Servers are Exchange 2003 SP2.<br />
<br />
What settings would be different between the servers to cause this error? I've hunted and hunted for possible causes and keeping getting no-where.<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance,<br />
Colin.

            I get the same error as well. My phone will work for a while (E71), then I start getting errors. The "Error in Exchange server. Try again later" is a new one though.<br />
<br />
I really don't want to have to buy roadsync, that program has always worked just fine for me. I know it's not a configuration error because of that.

            Hi Waheed Gul,<br />
<br />
Generally, it takes 24 to 72 hours for the deactivation of Directory Sync to take effect. As you said you’ve been waiting for 3 days, I’d like to confirm if it has been 72 hours now.<br />
<br />
Moreover, you can run the following cmdlet in Azure Active Directory PowerShell to verify the current Directory Sync state:<br />
<strong>(Get-MsolCompanyInformation).DirectorySynchronizationEnabled</strong><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c34ce8d2-9b98-41c1-84b8-4b92431da816" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c34ce8d2-9b98-41c1-84b8-4b92431da816" /></a><br />
If the value is false already, you can run this cmdlet to enable Directory Sync then:<br />
<strong>Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled -EnableDirSync $true</strong><br />
NOTE: You should <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/jj151815%28v=azure.98%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
connect to Office 365 PowerShell</a> before running the cmdlet.<br />
<br />
If you encounter any problems during the process, just take a relevant screenshot of the PowerShell output and upload it for our further analysis.<br />
<br />
As for your last question, you can reactive Directory Sync instantly if it’s already deactivated and there is no need to shorten the activation time by selecting few OUs.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Sam<br />

    <title>N85 FM radio problem fixed on V30 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lotech---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N85 FM radio problem fixed on V30</h2>
                    I finally receive the V30 upgrade for my RM-333 via FOTA, everything seems ok but I did not see the improvement on the camera and photo apps as some mentioned, or it is too little to be noticed, but I quickly find something wrong with the FM radio. Once
 I tuned to a station it quickly turn into white noise, I thought it was the reception problem, but after few seconds it tuned into another station, and then few more second tune to another one never ends, then I delete all the station memory and download again,
 and the problem fixed. The other fix is the RDS auto tuning, on V11 the FM radio will mute for few seconds in about every 15 seconds or so when auto scan is on, even the original station has full strength, the phone still scan for alternate frequency, but
 now the problem no longer exist.

            I've to take back my comment on the RDS auto scan, the FM radio still mute occasionally even when the signal is perfect, I don't see the reason to scan for alternative frequency, but I no longer rely on this radio, it has weaker reception than average
 FM radio build in with the bluetooth handsfree set.

            <p>Hello BillBigham:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having getting your phone recognized by the Zune software.&nbsp; From your description, it sounds like there is an issue with the digital certificates.&nbsp; Below you will find a couple of different
 things to try and resolve this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First try some basic steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect the phone via multiple USB ports on your computer.</li><li>Try connecting the phone with multiple sync cables.</li><li>Try connecting your phone to another PC to verify that this is not a larger issue with your computer or phone.</li></ul>
<p>If you find that the phone is recognized by another computer but not yours, try the steps in this article,
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2468307?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2468307?wa=wsignin1.0</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TRUST THE ZUNE CERTIFICATE:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Close the Zune software and disconnect your phone from your computer.</li><li>Open <b>Certificate Manager</b>. To do this, click <b>Start</b>, type <b>certmgr.msc</b> in the Start search bar, and then press your
<b>Enter</b> key.<br />
<b><br />
Windows 8 users:</b> On the Start screen, type <b>Certificate</b>, tap or click <b>
Settings </b>in the right column, and then tap or click <b>Manage computer certificates</b>.</li><li>In the pop-up window, tap or click the <b>Personal</b> folder in the left column, and then double tap or double click the
<b>Certificates</b> folder in the right column.</li><li>Click the heading that says <b>Issued By</b> to sort the column, and then look for one or more certificates that read "zune-tuner://windowsphone/...".</li><li>Right-click the certificate file and click <b>Copy</b>. If there is more than one file, hold the Ctrl key, click each file, then right-click a file and click
<b>Copy</b>.</li><li>Tap or click the <b>Trusted Root Certification Authorities </b>folder in the left column, right-click the
<b>Certificates </b>folder, and then click <b>Paste</b>.</li><li>Click <b>Yes </b>to install this certificate.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Create a new certificate</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Close the Zune software and disconnect your phone from your computer.</li><li>Open <b>Certificate Manager</b>, if it is not already open. To do this, click
<b>Start</b>, type <b>certmgr.msc</b> in the Start search bar, and then press your
<b>Enter</b> key.<br />
<b><br />
Windows 8 users:</b> On the Start screen, type <b>Certificates</b>, tap or click <b>
Settings </b>in the right column, and then tap or click <b>Manage computer certificates</b>.</li><li>In the window, tap or click the <b>Personal</b> folder in the left column, and then double tap or double click the
<b>Certificates</b> folder in the right column.</li><li>Click the heading that says <b>Issued By</b> to sort the column, and then look for one or more certificates that read "zune-tuner://windowsphone/...".</li><li>Right-click each certificate file, click <b>Delete, </b>and then click <b>Yes</b>.</li><li>Tap or click <b>File </b>in the menu, then <b>Exit</b>.</li><li>Click <b>Start </b>and in the search box enter <b>%userprofile%\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA</b>, and then press
<b>Enter</b>.<br />
<b><br />
Windows 8 users:</b> Right-click in the lower left-hand corner of the screen and tap or click
<b>Run</b>, or type <b>Windows Key </b>+ <b>R</b>, and then type the string above.
<br />
<br />
<b>Note </b>For some enterprise customers, the string will be <b>%userprofile%</b><b>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Crypto
</b>instead.</li><li>Find the folder that begins with "S-1-5-21-".</li><li>Right-click the folder and then click <b>Rename</b>. Rename the folder so that it ends in .bak. This means you will likely be adding ".bak" to the end of the number.<br />
<br />
<b>Note </b>If there is more than one folder that begins with "S-1-5-21-", try this procedure with one folder at a time. If it does not work, rename the folder to the original name and try the next folder.</li><li>As soon as you're done, open your Zune software and connect your phone to your computer. This creates a new certificate and folder.</li></ol>
<p>Please let us know if you have any additional questions or concerns.</p>

            My suggestion after reading your other posting that maybe the Insiders/Preview is not your cup of tea, as others have posted that it has bugs and glitches and a lot of 3rd party software/apps may not work as it hasn't been released to the general public.
 also posting info about your system would help as there is some ongoing issues with settings that have been posted in the forums and Feedback Hub.

            Yes. I reset my password so everything works atm. Thats not my issue. My issue is when I try to log in sometime later, then it won't recognize my password and must reset. I literally have reset my password like 30 times.&nbsp;

<h2>            How do you use the phone keypad during a call to make selections&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Kin2m and I can't figure out how to use the keypad during a call to make selections. That option only pops up for me when I call my voicemail (to enter my password), but it is something you need to do for various phone calls. Is there a way to
 do this?<br />

<h3> rdougshelton  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE 9 install msg&#58; &#34;Setup can&#39;t continue because a more recent version of Internet Explorer is installed on your computer&#34;</h2>
                    I just upgraded my system from Win 7 Home Premium 64-bit to Win 7 Ultimate 64 Bit (SP1). &nbsp;When I did so, it appears that the IE installation got - shall we say - "changed".
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So rather than try and figure out why everything was coming up wrong, I decided just to start over and uninstall IE 9 and then download it again and reinstall it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, I not only uninstalled it from Control Panel / Programs and Features, but I also did an "everything" search to find all occurrences of it and deleted those, then went into CCleaner and deleted all remaining traces of it (those that CCleaner could
 detect, anyway) from my registry.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The ONLY thing remaining that I'm aware of is a file called ieproxy.dll, in my Internet Explorer folder under Program Files. &nbsp;Even though I "took ownership" of that file, and fixed security so my Admin userID has all rights to it, I still can't delete
 that one file (from either Windows or from a Command Prompt).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In any case, &nbsp;when I try and download the latest version of Internet Explorer that google points me to from Microsoft and then attempt to install it, I get the error msg reported in the subject line (namely: &nbsp;&nbsp;"Setup can't continue because a more recent
 version of Internet Explorer is installed on your computer").&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't figure out what the issue here is. &nbsp;But if someone can point me to the REAL latest version of IE 9 (with all the CURRRENT up to date patches, etc.) for Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, (if there is such an animal to download anywhere) &nbsp;I'll try and install
 that. &nbsp;Otherwise, would appreciate any suggestions from others of how to truly eliminate "all traces of" IE9 from my file system and registry so Windows doesn't think I have a later version installed - - -</div>

            <p>IE7 can't be used&nbsp;with Windows 7.</p>
<p>IE8 can't be downloaded and installed in Windows 7 as it comes as part of the o/s.&nbsp; That is, you did have IE8 but de-activated it by deleting large lumps of code and registry entries.</p>
<p>If you don't have backups then I believe re-installing Windows is your only option.</p>
<p>Using Chrome is fine but at some stage you will need to have&nbsp;a version of IE installed on your computer.&nbsp; It is an unavoidable requirement for using Windows.&nbsp; Good luck anyway.<br />

<h2>            Synaptics PS&#47;2 Port Touch Pad Scrolling Inconsistent</h2>
                    <p>Synaptics PS/2 Port Touch Pad scrolling function&nbsp;works properly&nbsp;in Internet Explorer, File Explorer, Microsoft Money, Office 2002, Notepad, Device Manager and Disk Management to name a few, but does not work in Edge, all Settings functions, Calendar, Weather
 to name a few. For the latter the scrolling icon appears but scrolling does not function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver is the one Windows 10 automatically installs. I don't believe it's a driver issue&nbsp;though.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the symptoms it appears that scrolling in legacy apps works but does not work in Windows 10's modern apps. This issue is the main reason I do not use Edge for all my browsing.</p>

            I have a HP Pavilion laptop uses the Synaptic drivers. Most frustrating and inconsistent. It seems to help to turn off mouse gestures, but generally I find it to be a pain. I believe it is the actual touchpad that HP uses rather than a driver issue.&nbsp;

<p>I'm using a HP ProBook 4520s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think the problem is the driver or touchpad, since all "legacy" apps and the administrative apps work fine. It appears it's only the "modern" apps that don't, You would think that the code that handles the scrolling would be the same for both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's interesting to note that some apps are found under<strong> Local Disk-&gt; Program Files</strong> and others are found under
<strong>Local Disk -&gt; Programs Files (x86).</strong> Perhaps because they use a different codebase? Internet Explorer is under the latter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried scrolling in any of the "legacy" apps?</p>

<p>Some. for example I use LibreOffice, and scrolling in the spreadsheet is poor. I still think it is a hardware issue though, I have to admit that I am totally enamored with my Apple MacBook pro's touchpad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another application that click and drag is simply awful is any browser's version of Google Maps. Dragging the Streetview thingy is very difficult, usually easier to drag the entire view down to the lower right corner, then drag the locator only a few inches
 rather than trying to drag it up to the middle of the page.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016  Can&#39;t edit subject line in incoming email</h2>
                    <p>I though that I had asked this here before but can't find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A feature I use everyday in Outlook 2010 and 2013 is the ability to edit the subject line of an incoming email. &nbsp;It doesn't work in this version even when I enable &nbsp;the "email edit" function. &nbsp;It works fine &nbsp; on reply and forward &nbsp; but I shouldn't have to
 forward and email to my self &nbsp;to get this function. &nbsp;Updated to version 16.0.4229.1023 yesterday &nbsp;but still the same..</p>

            <p>Thanx for the info. &nbsp;No this didn't work. &nbsp;Using Win 10 build 10532. &nbsp;When I double click on the subject line &nbsp;it just highlights the &nbsp;word &nbsp;or line but can't edit &nbsp;it.. &nbsp;Right click &nbsp;only brings up the &nbsp;the Copy &nbsp;, Select all &nbsp;box..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit. &nbsp;I was further trying this and accidentally hit the "Enter" key and suddenly I can edit the subject line on all emails even after rebooting the PC. &nbsp;Must try this at home tonite..</p>
<p>Not sure what happened..</p>

<h2>            A few questions</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just bought the Moto Q and use to have a Treo.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a search or find function? I have over 300 tasks (Phone Calls) and there must be a way to search for them.
</li><li>Under preferences in tasks on my Treo I could use “Show due dates” and only today’s due dates would show up. ON the Moto today’s dates are first but the other dates show
 up also. Can I change this?</li></ol>

<p>I have over 300 phone calls to make over the next month. Are you telling me I have to scroll through them to find something? My Treo/Palm had a find feature. I have 30 days

<p>Thanks for all the quick updates. I just want to make sure before I take my Moto back. There is no way to search my tasks or my notes in my contacts or search for
 anything? <span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            On the Smartphone there is no such function. However, I'm not sure, you might want to try Agenda One at www.developerone.com. I think it has a Search utility builtin. Before taking the Q back, test the search function on a Pocket PC first.

<p>Just bought the Moto Q and use to have a Treo.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a search or find function? I have over 300 tasks (Phone Calls) and there must be a way to search for them.
</li><li>Under preferences in tasks on my Treo I could use “Show due dates” and only today’s due dates would show up. ON the Moto today’s dates are first but the other dates show
 up also. Can I change this?</li></ol>

<p>If you are used to the Palm form factor I would tell you that the Palm version running Windows mobile is excellent.&nbsp; I am using the Palm 750 and am very happy with it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The search works very well as well as sorting tasks by due date (or other choices as well)</p>

<p>Please tell me more. I have a choice between the Treo 700 palm or&nbsp;windows. Are you saying the windows version has&nbsp;palm features for the fPDA&nbsp;and also runs windows?</p>
<p>If so, why not just get the palm version?

<p>Personal preference.&nbsp; I prefer the Windows Mobile operating system over that of the Palm OS.&nbsp; I think it is easier to use and integrates with whay I do on my PC seamlessly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used the Palm 680 ... it is nice, I just don't care for the OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check out the Palm 750 on Palm's website ... it is a pretty nice device.</p>

<h2>            Onedrive update for &#34;on demand&#34; not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I just joined the insiders specifically to test out the new Onedrive files on demand ability. Everything went fine including the update to Windows 10 Enterprise Build 15063.rs2_release.170317-1834, which I understand includes it. My Onedrive for Business
 did not change. I thought, OK, just d/l directly as posted <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/06/13/onedrive-files-demand-now-available-windows-insiders/#TKwkp6IfKJgA7Mq5.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. Again no change. I don't have the options or settings described in this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Learn-about-OneDrive-Files-On-Demand-0e6860d3-d9f3-4971-b321-7092438fb38e?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
post</a>. If I click on Settings/About it shows version 2016 Build 17.3.6944.0627. Help!</p>
