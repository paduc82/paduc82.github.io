    <title>Use extrerme caution with Build 10041 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Use extrerme caution with Build 10041</h2>
                    <p>First, had Build 9976 working nicely&nbsp; for several weeks that was installed on a Toshiba Laptop as an upgrade to&nbsp; Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; It was updated to 10041 through Windows Update last week. I had several problems and finally decided to try something
 using Safe Mode. Selected Safe Mode in msconfig and agreed to the needed Restart.&nbsp; That was the end of computer #1.&nbsp; It froze on Restart and I've never been able to recover since since machine will not restart in any form. It remains a brick or handy doorstop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I decided to install a 100041 iso as dual boot in another Toshiba Laptop running Windows 7 Pro using Andre's instructions found elsewhere on this Forum. I partitioned my HDD and expected to get an install screen where I choose where I wanted it installed.&nbsp;
 Unfortunately, I overlooked a very important step in Andre's instructions and the install wiped out my Windows 7.&nbsp; Fortunately, I did have a backup only a few days old but took several hours to get that to work and back to where i was originally.&nbsp; This machine
 is working but with some slow down and other anomalies not present before the 10041 installation attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I downloaded the fresh 100041 iso made available yesterday and decided to try again but following Andre's instructions for sure. The iso would produce a screen saying "Setup copying temporary files" which lasted maybe 30 seconds and then a screen saying
 "Setup is starting" for about 2 seconds and THAT was it!&nbsp; Nothing further ever happened and I tried multiple times including "Run as Administrator".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, since I now had experience partitioning a HDD and confidence in Andre's instructions (and being a stubborn 86 year old cuss), I decided i would try the iso on my Toshiba Laptop running Windows 8.1. Worked like a jewel I thought since everything went
 per instructions UNTIL about step 4 something like "Getting files ready to install" about 75% complete on the progress bar. Error box popped up and said something like, "an error has occurred and the installation can't continue.Please wait while we remove
 files from your system"&nbsp; In a few minutes, another more shocking box pops up saying " A problem has occurred and we couldn't restore your previous version."&nbsp; This was really a shocker because the installation wasn't supposed to do anything at all to my running
 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine was restarted and got this message "PC needs repair.&nbsp; The Boot Configuration Data is missing or contains errors". File:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\BCD. Press ESC for various recovery options.&nbsp; There were many.&nbsp; Since I had a Macrium Reflect Image back
 up made Sunday,&nbsp; I elected to try that first.&nbsp; Booted to their Rescue Disk and noticed there an option to just Repair boot files. I tried that and eventually got to my original desktop.&nbsp; Other missteps and problems along the way but do have a working computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, for those who have stayed with this long discourse (and especially Andre if he made it this far), I have a question. I still have a problem when I restart.&nbsp; I get a Blue screen with a message "Your computer can';t start because a file is missing&nbsp;
 File: \Windows\System32\Winload\EFI. Error Code:&nbsp; 0xc0000225". And a large number of recovery options are shown \below.&nbsp; I can't o through all that I tried but I can get back to my desktop eventually. One of the options of available OS's shows two OS's, W8.1
 on Volume 4 and W8.1 on Volume 9.&nbsp; I don't have either volume 4 or 9 but choosing 4 puts me back to my desktop so currently using that choice after a restart.&nbsp; I tried the Volume 9 one and seemed to be complete but I noticed a warning when using it "Windows
 is not activated".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is, can someone tell me where I can get that missing file mentioned in the previous paragraph and, hopefully, be able to restart without all these problems?&nbsp; I did, BTW, go back into Disk Management and deleted the partition hoping to get
 rid of whatever had been on there.</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for your response, John.&nbsp; I kept fiddling with various options many of which you mentioned and I have been able to fix my problems.&nbsp; Except one.&nbsp; At startup, I still have this odd selection to make between starting with W8.1 volume 4
 or W8.1 volume 9.&nbsp; AS I mentioned before, I have determined the volume 4 is my original windows.&nbsp; I have no idea where volume 9 came from but will try to find it somewhere to get rid of it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, for the time being I have selected volume 4 as default and set a available timer to 5 seconds (the minimum allowed darn it) for&nbsp; startup to wait before starting volume 4.&nbsp; So everything is working OK on restart now and costing me only 5 seconds extra
 to start volume 4 automatically. I can live with that since I never turn my machine off and rarely do a restart unless Windows requires one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My confidence in Build 10041, however, is irreparably damaged!!!</p>

            <p>During similar circumstances, I discovered a 3rd party free&nbsp;program called BootICE.&nbsp; It comes in both x32 and x64 versions&nbsp; I've used it since about 9860 when something crashed and I learned more about Boot, MBoot ( an archaic term), Multiboot and restoring
 a volume than I ever wanted to.&nbsp; Still fun.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not only does it allow you to save your Boot files.&nbsp; It also allows you to be creative.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0cac0e7-d535-4b1b-85a8-03ca30d062c0" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This may allow you to exclude the boot partitions you don't want to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use BootICE to save your settings; remember when it offers to save; you need to add ".bcd" extension to the filename.&nbsp; This is the only glitch I found.</p>

            I downloaded BootIce, Rusty and it won't even open for me. Seemed to want a program called Open Freely so I DL'd that also and Bootice does open in a Open Freely window but I've been unable to get it to do anything else.<br />

            Didn't work on my W7 Pro machine either. I use Firefox as a browser. I'll check compatibility later when I get a chance but highly doubt that is the problem.

<h2>            MS Excel 2013 &#34;31-10&#34; bug</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm not sure this really a bug or not, but it doesn't hurt to give it test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's how to repro:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open any excel file.</li><li>On one of the sheet, change the category of cell (any cell) we want to test to "Number", ie: B2.</li><li>In B2 (because I use B2 as example)&nbsp;cell, key in 31-10 (any number will do, as long as we use the #-# format, ie: 31-10 or 20-10).</li><li>Then it Enter.</li><li>The value change to "41578".</li><li>You can try enter other numbers, some may work, some may not.</li></ol>
<p>7-11 gives 41585</p>
<p>7-12 gives 41615</p>
<p>7-13 gives 41456</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it really a bug? At first I thought&nbsp;excel auto convert to Date, but after I test several others...it doesn't seems so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using Excel Pro Plus 2013 (15.0.4420.1017) on MS Win 8 Pro.</p>

            <p>Excel does convert entries such as 31-10 to a date. 31-10 is interpreted as 31 October in the current year. If the cell is formatted as General, Excel will change it to a date format, but since you formatted the cell explicitly as a number, Excel displays
 the numeric valie of the date (roughly the number of days&nbsp;from 31 December&nbsp;1899 to the date).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it's a matter of Excel being overly helpful - if you enter something that looks like a date, Excel will convert it to a date.</p>

            <p>Oh, I can understand that, however, why 7-13 gives 41456? We do not have 13th month aren't we?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, 7-14 gives 41821 and 7-15 gives 42186. Excel treat them as month-year?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7-12&nbsp;gives 41615, 7-13 gives 41456...the difference is 159.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If 7-12 is 7/12/2013 and 7-13 is 7/2013</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7/2013 to 7/12/2013 is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>31+31+30+31+30+7=160</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this means the day on 7/12/13 is excluded? or was is the 1st day of July 2013 that was excluded? Just curious.</p>

            <p>Because folks in the USA use the date format mm-dd-yyyy</p>
<p>So 7-13 is read by Excel as 13 of 7th month (July) </p>
<p>The serial number for 7 July 2013 is 41456</p>

            <p>But, as explained by <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f3db0141-453f-4468-8422-58efbe88bd6b">
<font color="#0072c6">HansV MVP</font></a>, "Excel does convert entries such as 31-10 to a date. 31-10 is interpreted as 31 October
<u>in the current year</u>."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7-13 gives 41456</p>
<p>13-7-2013 gives 41468</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, "7-13 is read by Excel as 13 of 7th month (July)", by right, both should give same result because 7-13 means 13-7-2013 and 13-7-2013 is...ermm as it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13-7-13 also yield 41468</p>
<p>13-7 also yield 41468</p>
<p>7-13-13 ......doesn't work</p>
<p>7-13-2013 ...also doesn't work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure is related, for information, in Date &amp; Time setting I use <strong>dd/MM/yy</strong> for
<strong>short date</strong>, and <strong>dddd, d MMMM, yyyy</strong> for <strong>
long date</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u><em>EDIT:</em></u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;I think I understand a bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7-13 is 1st day of July 2013 (contrary to your 13 of 7th month (July) )</p>
<p>13-7 OR 13-7-13 OR 13-7-2013 is 13th July 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That would explain why 41468 - 41456 = 12</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I right here?</p>

            <p>Yup I figured that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question is, why does Excel treat 7-13 and 7-12 differently? They aren't consistent and very confusing at times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That would spell troublesome since if I were to have July 2012, I would need to key in 7-2012 instead of 7-12 because 7-12 means 7/12/2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7-13 means July 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be much easier if it is</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6-14 is 14th&nbsp;June [current year]</p>
<p>7-13 is 13th July [current year]</p>
<p>07-12 is 12th July [current year]</p>
<p>07-8 is 8th July [current year]</p>
<p>7-8 is 8th July [current year]</p>
<p>7-08 is 8th July [current year]</p>
<p>07-08 is 8th July [current year]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13-7 or 7-32&nbsp;or 4-31 or 04-31&nbsp;will give error (excel read as MM-DD)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7-2014 is July 2014</p>
<p>7-1999 is July 1999</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, if the year aren't defined, Excel will treat input as MM-DD. Year, must be YYYY.</p>

<h2>            Outlook mail cannot open image files anymore</h2>
                    <p>I have standard jpg files in an e-mail and can no longer open/view or even save them.&nbsp; The message just says "we couldn't open the image file".&nbsp; This started about a week ago.&nbsp; It does it on multiple computers, and any browser...IE/Firefox/Chrome</p>
<p>Can't download an image, save it, view it.... nothing.</p>
<p>Windows 7 is the operating system.&nbsp; I can forward the e-mail to a different e-mal account and see the pictures though, just not in my hotmail/outlook account.</p>
<p>I can't be the only one who has this issue.&nbsp; Any clue as to how to remedy this apparent "upgrade" that Microsoft threw at me?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>This is so typical of Microsoft "help"--nothing at all.&nbsp; When I "upgraded" to Win 10, I could only view some images sometimes.&nbsp; Then it started working correctly.&nbsp; Then about a week ago I get the light blue square with two mountains and a moon (or sun) and
 when I clik on "view" I get the message "can't display the image".&nbsp; If we are lucky this function might start working again but I think all of my favorite saved images are lost for good.<br />

            <p>You're right. It started for me on April 14, 2016. I have multiple PC's with Win 7 Prof and it's doing it on all of them as well as other&nbsp;MSN email addresses. For 5 minutes yesterday it was working right until I tried to embed a picture in the email...then
 nothing again. "HTTP 500 error" messages and "We couldn't open the image file". I have a pc with Win XP (with IE8)&nbsp;and Outlook basic works fine on it and images show correctly. I also have Win 10 on a pc and it has the same problem that I'm having with Win
 7 Prof... it will not attach or display any embedded images or attached images. My guess is it's clearly am IE 11 and/or Outlook Mail issue. I've uninstalled IE11&nbsp;and tried IE 10 with the same problem. I then reinstalled IE11 and the problem remains. If I
 forward a message with an embedded image or attached image, they show up then but I still cannot download or view them. I also did a&nbsp;System Restore to a prior point before this all started and the problems remain.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">{=COUNTIF(B2:B5, "Yes") + COUNTIF(C2:C5, "Yes") - COUNTIFS(B2:B5, "Yes", C2:C5, "Yes")}</p>
<p>
</p><p>But surely this doesn't seem very efficient, especially if I'm working on more criteria, how should I get around this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>To clarify, the above formulas also return UNIQUE no. of Companies besides accounting for "Yes" in Either of the 2 columns B / C. So if column A mentions "<span>Microsoft" twice the above formulas will count this as one.</span></p>
<p>In case you only want to account for&nbsp;"Yes" in Either of the 2 columns B / C and there is NO possibility of duplicate companies in column A then you may use either of the shorter formulas:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Array formula (Ctrl+Shift+Enter):</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUM(IF(FREQUENCY(IF((B2:C5="Yes"),ROW(A2:A5)),ROW(A2:A5)-ROW(A2)+1),1))</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Array formula (Ctrl+Shift+Enter):</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUM(--(MMULT(--(B2:C5="yes"),TRANSPOSE(COLUMN(B2:C5))^0)&gt;0))</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would be similar to the formula already mentioned in this thread wherein the manual "{1;1}" is replaced by "TRANSPOSE(COLUMN(B2:C5))^0" which obviates the need to manually alter the formula if say the number of columns increases to 3 (from B:C to B:D).</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>akin81,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to the forum!&nbsp;:cathappy:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When did the issue start happening on your Asha 311? Do you get any error code when browsing the web using the Nokia Xpress browser? Try clearing the phone's browsing history by going to
<strong>Internet</strong> &gt; <strong>History</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Clear privacy data</strong>. After that, try navigating the web using Nokia Xpress browser and see if it'll work.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Nokia Xpress browser is preinstalled on the phone. If deleting the browsing history and rebooting the phone didn't help, try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Restore the original phone settings. Go to <strong>Menu</strong> &gt; <strong>
Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Restore factory settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings only</strong>. And then, type your lock code (default is 12345). This won't delete any of your phone files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Update or reinstall the phone's software using Nokia Suite. Just connect the phone to the PC via a compatible USB cable, and then launch Nokia Suite. Go to
<strong>SW Update</strong>, and then choose <strong>Device Software Update</strong>. If there's no update available, select
<strong>Reinstall</strong>. Get Nokia Suite from this link:&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support/nokia-suite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Suite download</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if this information helped you.&nbsp;:smileyhappy:</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish to the play&nbsp;music on my&nbsp;N900 through&nbsp;Blaupunkt Casablanca MP56. This has usb connectivity to pen drive or hdd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I connect my X6 via usb (in mass storage mode) and it&nbsp;&nbsp;reads, plays, displays track info, no problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I connect my&nbsp; N900, nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one's beyond me, can anyone help please? Even if it's just to learn no you can't do it.</p>

<p>It is recognizing the Mass storage drive, but not getting down to the audio folder......I don't know, how to solve this issue.</p>
<p>Although, the USB connection alone is ensuring that the mobile remains charged ( in the scenario where the car doesn't have a dedicated mobile charger).</p>

<p>I have posted this before and only got a response from another user who said his N97 worked fine, but no so with the N900, the very device with the memory capacity.</p>

<p>Well.........I guess, the <strong>FM Transmitter</strong> will come to the rescue.</p>
<p>Actually, I had no idea about this FM Transmitter.</p>
<p>Till yesterday, I was wondering, what use is this FM Transmitter for, unless you are transmitting your own songs across the ether waves( very unlikely)?</p>
<p>Today, I and my colleague, who too has a N900, found it's immediate use.</p>
<p>My FM Transmitter was switched on at 88.1 mhz(default)..................and he tuned in his mobile-radio at 88.1 mhz.</p>
<p>I played the stored music files in my mobile and they played in his machine.</p>
<p>Next, I have to do the same in my car.......................that is, tune in the car-radio at 88.1 mhz and play the songs from the mobile thru the FM Transmitter.</p>
<p>Hope this works!:smileyhappy:</p>

<p>thanks for mentioning the fm transmitter. i have used this in the past but understand hard wired quality and reliabilty is much better. out interest the transmitter at one time put the track info on the car head unit, then this stopped.</p>

<p><strong>How Maemo works with folders</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maemo / The N900 uses magic folder names..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you open the file manager on your phone, you'll see a list of folders. There are some magic ones:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audio Clips</p>
<p>Documents</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>are two examples..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These folders aren't really called this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Audio Clips" is called ".sounds"</p>
<p>"Documents" is called ".documents"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One reason it does this magic renaming is locale.. If you're phone is set to use the english language, you'll see them as above.. However, if you change them to a different language, the names of these folders changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In English, I can see "Documents"</p>
<p>In German I can see "Dokumente"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In both cases, this magic label points to ".documents"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for you?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strangely, in the world of Unix files and folders whose name starts with a . (ie .documents) are usually treated as "hidden". You're Blaupunkt may be honoring this tradition</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike your N900, it doesn't know that .sounds is not supposed to be hidden, and contains your music files so it's skipping over it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why does it work with the N97?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The N97 does a very similar thing to the N900.. It gives the folder containing the music a different, fake name:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My N97 shows a folder called "Sound Files" in the file manager app, but when I connect it to my PC using mass storage mode, I can see the folder is actually called "Sounds"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So regardless of what the folder looks like on the phone's file manager application, the real physical location is different:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the N97, the music is stored on e:\Sounds</p>
<p>On the N900, it is stored in e:\.sounds</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the .sounds folder is treated as hidden, the Sounds folder is not..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What can you do?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plug your phone into a PC using Mass-Storage mode..</p>
<p>Copy a single MP3 onto your phone and put it in the root folder of your N900 ( e.g e:\ )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you then try your phone on your Blaupunkt, does it see the single MP3 file as you would expect?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If yes, then I've probably identified the problem and we can look at a possible solution (its tricky)</p>
<p>If not, then its something else and I'll shut up :)</p>

<p>TBH, cpitchford, I was thinking along the same lines, maybe the Blaupunkt can't see the folders. But I thought I'd leave it to someone who knew a lot more about Linux, rather than make a complete doink of myself. :smileytongue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What if a new folder was created on the memory card, would it still give it a dot, or would it then solve the issue?</p>

<p>No, thankfully.. the SD card is a but more "freestyle!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a config file (don't edit it.. seriously.. if you change only this file it will break other things.. seriously)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>$ cat .config/user-dirs.dirs<br />
<font><font color="#ff0000">XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR="$HOME/MyDocs/.documents"<br />
XDG_MUSIC_DIR="$HOME/MyDocs/.sounds"<br />
XDG_PICTURES_DIR="$HOME/MyDocs/.images"<br />

</font></font></p>
<p>The red items refer to magic folders on the internal flash.. The blue item is the only magic item on the SD card..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So... if you put all your music on an SD card (maybe in a folder called Music) it may be seen by the Blaupunkt..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no guarantee the Blaupunkt supports TWO flash drives! Remember, if you plug your phone in using USB storage mode, it appears as a flash card reader with two slots.. the first is the internal flash storage, the second is the SD card.. The Blaupunkt
 may only use the first device.. it may not even see the SD card</p>

<p>I did what you had suggested......that is copy-paste a .mp3 file from the .sounds folder out in the main 'e' drive( that is the drive for my mobile's mass storage).................and now ofcourse the car-audio system ( JVC in my case) is recognizing the
 file and playing it.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sounds like this is in the process of solution?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not had chance to move&nbsp;an mp3 file and try as suggested yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pre-empting the Blaupunkt will read / play the file, wil this file situation&nbsp;be user friendly between in car and on the handset&nbsp;and 3.5mm output?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to add, in reading info elsewhere, I got the impression this was never going to work as Nokia used up the connections on the micro usb for battery charging, losing speaker outputs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was this just plausible&nbsp;web mumbo jumbo?</p>

<p><br />
A backend has no code (or shouldn't ) as it has tables only.&nbsp; So decompile should have no effect at all.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of questions - </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Is this a wired or wireless network?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Are you opening the backend database when others are using the frontend (connected to the backend)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Do you have offline folders enabled?&nbsp; If so, disable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Read the Access performance FAQ:</p>

            <p>1. It is a wired network.</p>
<p>2. When using Backend no one else use the Frontend or Backend</p>
<p>3. Just disable offline folders with same result. It freezes again.</p>
<p>4. I don't think that it is a performance matter. When I use the /decompile switch it runs ver fast.</p>

            <p>Are the OS' (server and PC)&nbsp;up-to-date?&nbsp; What OS are you running or are you running Access directly on the SBS?&nbsp; What is the Bitage (32 or 64) of your OS'?<br />
Is your installation of MS Access up-to-date?</p>
<p>How does&nbsp;a local&nbsp;copy of the&nbsp;front-end behave?&nbsp; Does it run fine or is it slow when connected to the back-end?</p>
<p>How does a local copy of the back-end behave?</p>
<p>Have you tried creating a new blank database and importing the database objects in the new one to see if that has any impact?&nbsp; Then ensure your db compiles and then compact and repair it.</p>
<p>A stab in the dark, but perhaps this might apply to your case, <a href="http://accessexperts.net/blog/2011/11/02/windows-7-64bit-slow-with-access-2007-solved/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>-All software are up-to-date.</p>
<p>-Client use Windows 7 32bit</p>
<p>-Server use SBS 2008 64 bit</p>
<p>-The Front-end opens normal. There is only one bound form that sometimes temporary freezes and shows Not Responding. It is bound to a small table (19 records with 5 fields). Otherwise the FE works normal.</p>
<p>- When open the Back-end locally it works normal and fast.</p>
<p>- This is a new database that I created from scratch in Access 2010. Only the bound table from above was imported from another database.</p>
<p>- I will try your suggestion: A stab in the dark.</p>
<p>- I monitored the processes and resources during opening of the Backend. Everything seems ok. Only when I get Not Responding the Access.exe process shows in red.</p>

            <p>By accident I discovered the solution for a similar problem: I was used to losing Access/connection and slow performance, I thought it was because of working not locally.
</p>
<p>After renewing a network switch because of malfunctioning, I noticed Access was doing great again in performance. Strangely enough, the problem switch had been functioning for x% all those years (no other problems), but Access apparently seems quite sensible
 for the (100-x)% not perfectly running switch. </p>
<p>My (2nd) shot in the dark would thus be to test with another switching path to the server.</p>

    <title>commandButton caption text gets smaller with use - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> songbear  say:</h3>
<h2>            commandButton caption text gets smaller with use</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>The caption text in some of&nbsp;the command buttons on this spreadsheet keeps getting smaller, a little at a time as the buttons&nbsp;are clicked, until it is unreadable. They are (supposed
 to be) using a size 8 Ariel font.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The property sheet for the buttons always shows the size the font should be, what it started at, like 8; but the size as viewed on the screen is 3 or 4 and, eventually, even&nbsp;smaller.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>CommandButtons’ response to attempts to fix the problem have been mixed. One button gave me about an 8 on the screen when I eventually bumped the button.Font.Name command to 30.
 I was trying to "remind" it what size it was supposed to use on screen by adding a line in the click event to make the font size the same as showed in the property sheet, and eventually bigger. When I got the command in the line up to 30, it finally showed
 up at about an 8 on screen, and 30 in the property sheet.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A different button changed its font and its property sheet both to 30 in response to the added VBA command in its click event. I returned that one to 8, and it is either doing ok
 or is changing slowly, again. I did have an additional added command, a <span>
&nbsp;</span>Application.ScreenUpdating=True line was added. I am not sure if that had any effect, that was just when I noticed that the tiny fuzzy dot that that caption had become had actually disappeared, instead of just getting smaller. I dragged that button
 larger in design mode and there was the size 30 caption. I changed that one back to 8 in the click event, and it is doing ok, so far, or the font is getting smaller very gradually.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I went back to the first button, which was showing 8 now, even though it had 30 for font size in the property box. After making sure it had a screen updating command, I tried changing
 the font style to see if that would ‘remind’ it what size to show. That did not help. It is back to showing a 3 font while an 8 shows on the property sheet and in the extra line in the click event. I returned it to 30 in the click event and it is now 30 there
 and on the property sheet, and about size 8 on screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are about 30 buttons and about 11 of them have this problem. These may just be the only buttons currently in use. Most of these buttons link to some pretty sophisticated macros
 in VBA.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I have tried screen updating, application.calculating, changing font and font size.<span>&nbsp;</span>Nothing is reliable, or should be necessary, really.<span>&nbsp;</span>It
 is probably something really simple, I just can’t think of it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Does anyone know the solution?</span></span></p>

            I had the same problem, took me a lot of searching for the answer, here it is:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/838006/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/838006/en-us</a><br />
<br />
The symptom description in that KB article is slightly different from the effect we observed and the trigger seems to be related to change of screen resolution. However, the solution works also for the change-of-font size-effect. Go there, ignore the RESOLUTION
 -you don't need any hot-fix-, scroll down and follow the steps in the MORE INFORMATION section. You can also just copy the snippet below to a .reg file and merge it to your registry.<br />
<br />
-- start code --<br />
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
<br />
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Common]<br />
"UpdateDeviceInfoForEmf"=dword:00000001<br />
-- end code --<br />
<br />
From the location of the registry key "HKEY_CURRENT_USER" you can see, that this fix only affects the current user account, and thus needs to be applied for each other user on the affected system separately.<br />
<br />
Please spread the word, many posts about this issue in other forums remained completely unanswered.

<h2>            Is there any reason to keep previous versions of Office for MAC on my computer</h2>
                    I just installed Office 2011 for MAC and also have the previous versions 2008 and 2004. &nbsp;I saw a previous answer that they co-exist just fine but is there any advantage to keeping the other two versions on and can they simply be uninstalled with the Removal
 Tool? &nbsp;I don't like having anything on my computer that I don't need. &nbsp;Thanks.

            If you have files that were made years ago that were saved in pre-1997/1998 format, open them and save them in the current format using office 2004. Some people prefer Entourage over Outlook. If you're one of them, then you can keep just Entourage. Otherwise
 I would say you can safely free-up that hard drive space and delete the old versions.<br />

    <title>Unexpectedly large file size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amyincharleston  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unexpectedly large file size</h2>
                    
<p>I am working on a manual where I'm using&nbsp;the "book" feature and saving each chapter as an individual file. One of my files is 379MB and I can't really understand why, but I think it's causing problems because linked graphics initially display as the blank
 box with the red X (sometimes it fixes itself, sometimes I have to manually refresh to get the images to display), and whenever the file autosaves, it crashes. I can manually save, but it takes several minutes to save.</p>
<p>The file is based on a template I created, but I don't think that's the problem, because I have files using that same template that are longer and/or more graphic intensive, and they're averaging 70K - 170K. The problem file is about 16 pages long with about
 15 different graphics inserted as links. I don't have any fonts or images embedded into the document. I copied the entire thing into a new document and it's still the same size.</p>
<p>For now I have reset my autosave preferences so it won't lock up and crash as often, and I'm just manually saving it very often to ensure it captures my changes. But I want to try to determine what's causing the abnormally large file size and correct that
 before I finalize the document.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>By "book" feature, do you mean the "Master / Sub document" feature. In theory it is a good idea, but I've never had any luck with it myself, it just seems to lead to document corruption. Good luck</p>
<p>OK, what file type are you using: DOC or DOCX?</p>
<p>As Yves suggests, but doesn't name, I too think you may be dealing with document corruption. It is more common with DOC files, but it does happen in DOCX files too.</p>
<p>This first article, actually comes in 4 parts, I think it suits your problem:</p>

    <title>Sending a web page to onenote right clicking.... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jima59  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sending a web page to onenote right clicking....</h2>
                    When I am searching the web for specific recipes and find one I right click on it and click the "send onenote".&nbsp; When it gets to Onenote another window opens up and it ask where I want to save it on onenote.&nbsp; My notebookds are various recipe notebooks
 depending on the type of food.&nbsp; When I try to send it to the specific notebook it won't let me.&nbsp; I have to click on one of the pages under the notebook.&nbsp; But if I do this it overrides what is on that page.&nbsp; I know that having a section open will solve this
 problem but it defeats the purpose of being able to go around the internet and quickly save something I have found.&nbsp; Has anyone had this problem?&nbsp; I've used onenote about a week and have done the turorial also but it doesn't really cover this.&nbsp; Thanks for
 any suggestions.

<p>Go to File--&gt; Options--&gt; Send to OneNote and change the Other Content settings to new page in current section or Set default location.</p>
<p>A second option is to go to the Review tab and click "Linked Notes". This will turn on a mini-view of the current page. You can send your content to that page and it will be linked to the original content.</p>
<p>A hint: When I am doing quite a bit of web research, I set up OneNote to send my web content and printouts to a section called "Working Space". Once all of the content is there, I use drag and drop to move the pages to where I really want them. I am trying
 to get myself into the habit of using LinkedNotes, but that habit is taking time to become second nature.</p>

            Actually, if you select a section within the notebook it will create a new page in that section - you don't have to select an existing&nbsp;page.

<h2>            Junk Mail going into Inbox Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've never had any problems with junk mail but the past week, they have been going into my inbox instead of the junk mail folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had to keep moving the offending junk into the junk mail folder but they keep coming back into the inbox the next day.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought once you move them into junk mail folder, it should be recognised as "junk" and not to download them into inbox?</p>

            Hi Tankim,<br />
<br />
The 440 Login Timeout error appears when the Exchange Powershell fails to open. This could be the reasons why you're getting the said error when downloading attachments from Outlook. We recommend that you perform the solution provided on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2629776/error-440-login-timeout-while-browsing-owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and check if this will allow you to download attachments again in your account.<br />
<br />
Let us know if that works for you.

    <title>How can I define new functions to be used in expression for Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dumbtongue  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I define new functions to be used in expression for Microsoft Access 2010&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>hi everybody</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This problem has been pestering me for several days. What I'm trying to do is to set up a set of tables and queries. With expressions embedded into them, the result can be&nbsp;calculated&nbsp;using&nbsp;records in tables.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I found that there are not
 enough built-in functions existing in Access 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have searched all over the help doc and the web, but I can't find any solution to this. Though I have found articles about how to add add-ins to access, they are all about menus, forms or wizards, and no functions, and only applied to pre 2003. So
 I tried writting VBA to see if I can call them from expression but find out that the functions in VBA can't be referenced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's told in help doc of Access 2010 that user defined functions can be used in expression. So&nbsp;is there anybody who knows how does this work and kindly tells me how to do it?</p>

<p>Thank you, Alberta and Graham.</p>
<p>As you both advised, I have tried to use my custom functions in Query and Form. It turned out to work, in sql, in query and in form. I can even select them from Expression Builder. However it's still impossible to insert a custom function into calculted
 field of table. I don't know if it's meant so&nbsp;but I decide not to hang on this problem anymore. I think what I have got is enough though not so&nbsp;flexible&nbsp;or elegant. Maybe it's just temporarily short of document explaining how to create add-ins which can be
 installed into another Access&nbsp;instance&nbsp;through Add-in Manager.</p>
<p>Anyway&nbsp;I appreciate your answers very much. They help a lot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is some controversy about the calculated field datatype new to 2010. As a general rule fields derived from a calculation violate normalization rules. However, since the new datatype actually stores the formula rather than the result it has some value.
 The data type was included in Access 2010 to provide compatibility with Sharepoint. Therefore it makes sense that you can't use VBA UDFs&nbsp; within the calculations.</p>
<p>So there should be no problems using them only in queries, forms and reports.</p>

<p><span><span>All you do is create a standard code module, and then inside of that code module you can add as many new "custom" functions. Those new functions can be a combination&nbsp;of
 existing functions cobbled together to build something that doesn't exist.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For example, let's say that we needed a function that returns the first Friday as a date value of current month.<span>&nbsp;</span>Inside of a code module, you would
 use the following code:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Public Function FirstFriday() As Date</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dim dtFirst<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As Date<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>' first day of month</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>dtFirst = DateSerial(Year(Date), Month(Date), 1)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>' dtfirst is now the first day of the month.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;' Use day of week 6 (friday)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>' less the starting day of week.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>' to offset this value to first friday</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>FirstFriday = dtFirst + (6 - Weekday(dtFirst))</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>End Function</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span><span>Now, in code, or even in a query, we could go:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Select firstName, LastName, firstFriday() as Friday from tblcustomers</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            renewing subscription</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a student and purchased Office 365 for University a few years ago. This seems to have run out today, 20/03/18. I can't seem to find out how to renew my university version and can only find renewal for personal or home. What is the process for me now?
</p>
<p>Do I have to pay the full amount or is there a university option? If I take out another subscription then I will have to go through reinstalling on all my devices which I don't want to do. I would rather just renew or reactivate but don't know how. This
 is the letter I received from you today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We're sending you this message to confirm that your Office 365 University subscription ended on Wednesday, 21 March 2018.</p>
<p>We’re sorry to see you go and would love to welcome you back anytime. If you change your mind, please go to&nbsp;<a href="https://office.com/renew/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.com/renew/</a>, and follow the steps
 to reactivate your subscription.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

    <title>Pivot Table drill down data is displated as a table - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Pivot Table drill down data is displated as a table</h2>
                    <p>I have a template that I use&nbsp; repeatedly by replacing the data.&nbsp; I have a pivot which I refresh when new data is supplied.&nbsp; Until now, whenever I drill down in the pivot to see specific details, I get the expected data displayed.&nbsp; Now, with no changes made
 to the file, I am getting the data displayed as a table.&nbsp; The macros I wrote to manipulate this drill-down data now won't work within the table.&nbsp; I can't make it not put the data in a table form.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From Excel 2007 on wards, the resultant drill down table always appears in Table format.&nbsp; So there are two things you can try</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Save the file in Compatibility mode and then check if the drill down table still appears in Table format; or</p>
<p>2. While on any cell in the Table, click on the Table Tools yellow button and under Table Styles, select Light.&nbsp; Also, in the Table Tools yellow button, select Convert to Range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Initially, Word inherits Paper Size from what is specified in System Preferences as the Default paper size for the Default Printer. Make certain that it is set correctly... IOW, you only should have to change the default in Word if it differs from what you
 prefer as the global default for all programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to set the default Paper Size in&nbsp; Word are you following the procedure described in Word Help?</p>
