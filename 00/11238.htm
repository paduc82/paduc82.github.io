<h2>            outlook 2013 unknown and lost folders</h2>
                    <p><span>Yesterday, something happened to the folders within my alias default mail account on my desktop Outlook app, as well as the PRIMARY mail Account accessed via Outlook on the web. On the desktop various
 new subfolders appeared (some duplicates of existing ending in [1] ) and a number of existing folders disappeared (including Inbox) and in some existing folders there were no longer any emails.&nbsp; Some new folders were named blocklist and Skype Contacts. On
 the Primary a/c on the web Inbox is still there but some subfolders are missing. I've created a new profile on my desktop Outlook and when choosing it on starting Outlook it built the web Outlook contents locally. So still the missing emails, folders and new
 duplicates [1] folders which are empty and can't be deleted. What a mess! Any answers?</span></p>

    <title>Excel 1900 Leap Year, DATE function, WEEKDAY function - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dwendl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 1900 Leap Year, DATE function, WEEKDAY function</h2>
                    It appears that Excel 2013 and Excel 2003 (the only two versions I've checked) incorrectly treat 1900 as a leap year.<br />
<br />
Realize that "If <b>day</b> is greater than the number of days in the month specified,
<b>day</b> adds that number of days to the first day in the month." (Excel help)<br />
<br />
Using month/day/year:<br />
<br />
=DATE(1900,2,28) returns 2/28/1900. Correct.<br />
=DATE(1900,2,29) returns 2/29/1900. Incorrect. It should return 3/1/1900.<br />
=DATE(1900,3,1) returns 3/1/1900. Correct<br />
<br />
Contrariwise, although 2100 is also not a leap year, Excel does handle it correctly:<br />
<br />
=DATE(2100,2,28) returns 2/28/2100. Correct.<br />
=DATE(2100,2,29) returns 3/1/2100. Correct.<br />
=DATE(2100,3,1) returns 3/1/1900. Correct<br />
<br />
Perhaps related to this problem, the WEEKDAY function for dates between 1/1/1900 and 2/28/1900 returns incorrect values.&nbsp; E.g.,<br />
=WEEKDAY(DATE(1900,1,1),1) returns 1, when it should return 2 (Monday).<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the question is here but you're correct that Excel does treat 1900 as a leap year. The explanation of why is here. This is for Excel 200 but applies equally to all versions.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            The reason why Excel considers 1900 as a leapyear is because Microsoft would keep compatibility with Lotus 123 and Lotus was condering 1900 as a leapyear.

<h2>            can&#39;t uninstall office home and student 2010 trial in add or remove programs and the fix-it tool does not work.</h2>
                    &nbsp;I looked through these Q+As and no solution was found. I tried to do it manually and was unsuccessful. What do I do? I need to install another free trial to do a powerpoint for school and it won't install correctly until I remove the previous version.
 As far as I can tell, I have removed everything associated with it but it is still in my program list. When i hit uninstall it does nothing. I have no buttons or anything to access Word, Powerpoint, etc. They don't exist anymore on my computer but it's still
 in the program list. PLEASE HELP! I have a huge project due monday and I didn't expect this Friday the 13th bad luck.

            You want to install the Home and Business trial. In theory it should work. In theory it could work. But we have seen problems where there is more than one version of office 2010 installed.&nbsp; The activation system can get confused which one is being activated.
 But the problems we have seen have had to do with a purchased full copy being mixed with a trial.&nbsp; Trial and trial is new territory. It's worth a try.<br />

<h2>            I accidentally zoomed out &#40;ctrl -&#41; my skype window for PC...</h2>
                    <p>Hi, as the title says, I accidentally zoomed out all the way with "CTRL - " on the entire Skype app and I cannot reverse it with CTRL +... The text is so tiny and unreadable now and I can't click or see anything anymore in the window. I cannot get it back
 to normal even after uninstalling and re-installing... It's very frustrating, is there a fix for this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I was using Skype version 8</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 2: It has been resolved in my reply below!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>You can intentionally/unintentionally zoom out causing all the controls and font size to appear smaller or disappear from view. If you want to resolve these types of issues with the new Skype for Windows Desktop (Skype 8.x), simply press&nbsp;<strong>Ctrl - 0</strong>&nbsp;(zero)
 on your keyboard. This will reset the display back to defaults. <strong>Ctrl - Shift - +</strong> (plus) can be used to incrementally zoom in, even beyond the default.</p>

<h3> joe patti  say:</h3>
<h2>            Yahoo Sent Items Folder vs Sent Folder</h2>
                    
<p>Emails sent thru Yahoo on WP7 will get saved in "Sent Items" folder, and not in "Sent" folder.&nbsp; Emails sent from Yahoo&nbsp;using my PC Internet browser will be saved in the&nbsp;"Sent" folder and not in "Sent Items" folder.&nbsp; Yet both folders, i.e., "Sent" and "Sent
 Items,"&nbsp;get synced.</p>
<p>If I delete the "Sent Items" folder using my PC Internet Browser, WP7 gets a certificate error when syncing.&nbsp; I guess this folder is required for WP7.&nbsp; Is that so?</p>
<p>Is there a way for all emails sent thru Yahoo on WP7 to be saved in same folder that Yahoo uses when saving emails thru PC browser access?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p><span>Hello Joe,</span></p>
<p><span>You are right - Windows Phone 7 uses "Sent Items" for storing the mails sent and&nbsp;you can't change the behavior (or rename the folder name) on the phone.&nbsp;WP7 uses IMAP protocol to
 access the folders on the server. If you select to synchronize the&nbsp;"Sent Items" folder on the phone this folder would be created on the server and the mails would be synchronized between those two folders. Unfortunately Yahoo is using different folder name
 "Sent" for the mails sent from web interface. </span></p>
<p><span>As far as I know Yahoo would not allow you to change the folder for sent emails (rename this folder to "Sent Items") and thus you will end up with two folders to sync with current
 IMAP access. </span></p>
<p><span>I know that it could be annoying sometimes but on the other side&nbsp;some email providers use just POP protocol for free mail service&nbsp;and&nbsp;then you can't synchronize folders at all.</span></p>
<p><span>Best Regards<br />
Martin V.</span></p>

            Yes, thanks. &nbsp;I did try these kinds things - and others. &nbsp;No cigar. unfortunately. &nbsp;To recover, I had to do a system"Reset", which re-installed the OS, and DELETED all my apps. &nbsp;This is a most annoying situation with MSFT OSes; they imbed so much app-related
 stuff into fundamental OS entities (registry, .dll lists, etc.) that they don't know how to separate it out, and have to nuke it. &nbsp;Linux does not have this problem (to this extent). &nbsp;Sigh...

<h2>            sharepoint office 365 site performance</h2>
                    
<p>I am new to sharepoint and struggling to find the solution for an issue.</p>
<p>We have developed an internal site using share-point office365 with bit complex structure. Home-&gt;subsite1(Offices)-&gt;subsite2(london)-&gt;subsite3(people)-&gt;subsite4-&gt;subsite5</p>
<p>Issue: Home page of the site is loading very slow as it is taking more than 40 sec's. Please find the observations below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Home page contains multiple webparts which are not contentquery. all are contenteditor webparts contains html code. Thought this one is causing the issue but removes some webparts and no change in result.
</li><li>We are using default navigation [structured navigation]. When i googled some one suggested to use managed navigation. is it possible to use managed navigation for this kind of website?how safe it is and how complex it is.
</li><li>Is there any other way to fix this issue. </li></ul>
<p>Someone please help me as i have already spent some much time on this. Thanks in advance, Amarnath.</p>

<p>You can also get a quick overview of what is slowing page load using a tool like pingdom. Keep in mind, SP pages are not optimized for performance and have to load an enormous amount of code that you probably don't need on a home page.</p>

    <title>Getting&#47;Setting table row height using VBA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonyfurnivall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting&#47;Setting table row height using VBA</h2>
                    <p>I am using VBA in Word 2010 to create a survey. For each question I am creating a table with one row for the question itself, and a set of rows for possible responses. I want to be able to set the response rows (which could all contain varying amounts of
 text) to the same height. So I cycle through the rows, finding out which row has the greatest height, then go back through them setting all the rows to that height.</p>
<p>The problem is that all the rows report the same height, even when it is visually obvious that they are not. Word must know, internally, how high the row is, because it actually draws it that height (!) What I’d like to do is find out the attribute that
 Word is using, not the attribute (.Height) that Microsoft suggest I use, which turns out to be pretty use-<b>less</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two factors that affect the height of a row. By default, rows automatically resize to fit the tallest value in a row. So, even when you set the value of the height property this may not be reflected in the user interface. To ensure that the changes
 are reflected in the UI you will want to set the value of the HeightRule property also. This property specifies the behavior for the row. I have included a code sample below that forces the height of each row in a table to 99 points, regardless of the content
 in the cells.&nbsp; Please let me know if this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub SetRowHeight()<br />
&nbsp; Dim tr As Row<br />
&nbsp; For Each tr In ActiveDocument.Tables(1).Rows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'HeightRule is an enumeration with three values. By specifying wdRowHeightExactly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'for the value, we are forcing an exact height for table rows.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You can also specify wdRowHeightAuto (the default, row height is adjusted to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'accomodate the tallest value in the row) or wdRowHeightAtLeast (specify a minimum<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'value. This option is selected if you manually adjust the height of a row.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tr.HeightRule = wdRowHeightExactly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Note that row height is in points, not inches (the Table Tools Layout tab in the UI<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'uses inches. There are 72 points per inch.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tr.Height = 99<br />
&nbsp; Next tr<br />
End Sub</p>

            Thanks for the feedback, Mike.<br />
<br />
The <i><b>real </b></i>issue, of course, given the various possibilities of HeightRule, is
<b>How do I determine the real height of the row</b>. Once that has been done, setting it is relatively easier (of course, you have to get the HeightRule right) - thanks for that.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the value that is readable for RowHeight is only "Wha tEver I Last Set It Too", and not "What The Distance From The Top Of The Row To The Bottom".&nbsp; Word is obviously capable of figuring out what this actually is, when the Heightrule is set to
 Auto (after all, it actually does it!), but somehow or other no-one at MS thought that this might be a useful value to be able to retrieve. ( Add to long list of such imponderables).<br />
<br />
What I actually ended up doing was adding a dummy row at the bottom of the table, and then using the GetInformation method to get the two vertical displacements of the top of each row from the top of the page. The distance between those two values then gives
 me a number that I can use to make all the rows the same height.<br />
<br />
If only someone at Microsoft gave that extra second thought to what people who really use the product would find useful.<br />
<br />
Sigh...<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
<br />

            I'd like a script that does the following:<br />
<br />
When x key combo, (or use a double click method?)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Row height to DEFAULT<br />
<br />
Next, I'd like to add that command to an icon or Button, that could be added to a toolbar.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to know which versions of Word this script would work with, or could be included.<br />
<br />
Next, I'd like some script to add it to Word for use with any spreadsheet, not just an XLSM.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm using 2010 right now.<br />
<br />
Rant --- It seems that since there is a "set Column width to default" button, there should also be one for height.&nbsp; I'd like to add this to my version of Word.&nbsp; But then also be able to add this to any version of Word by anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

            In Word, the "default" table row height, or rather the "auto" row height,&nbsp;is determined by the cell margins and the current font size. You could use the following code:<br />
<br />
Sub SetAutoRowHeight()<br />
If Selection.Information(wdWithInTable) Then<br />
Selection.Rows.HeightRule = wdRowHeightAuto<br />
End If<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Assign the macro to a toolbar button and/or a keyboard shortcut. For assistance, see

<h2>            Access outlook mobile from desktop computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Short version: On my netbook, trying to read a single mail on the full version of outlook.com is a multi-minute time investment. Is there any easy way to access the mobile version of the site, apart from setting up a custom user agent?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long version: A while back I could easily access the mobile version of outlook.com by typing the correct url (m.mail.live.com, I believe it was). Now, I get redirected to the full version no matter what I try. Until recently I had set up a custom user agent
 in my web browser, which sent me to the mobile version of outlook (which works beautifully), but due to recent changes in my country's largest judicial database (I'm a law student) I had to disable the user agent. Dedicating a separate browser to mobile outlook
 is not an option (the netbook is not powerful enough to run another browser alongside all the other things I run on it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone know of a way to access the mobile version of outlook.com on either google chrome or opera 12.x, which does not effect the browsing experience on other websites, I would really like to know :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>            Adjusting the timing of the Bounce End effect on a motion path</h2>
                    For some reason I can't figure out how to put a time duration of the bounce on a motion path. But if feels like I can go into Windows PPT, edit it, and in Mac it will go at that speed. Am I missing something - is there no way to do this on the mac?

            You're 'missing' nothing, Mac PPT is missing a lot :-/ The Windows version has a considerably more extensive feature set. Most of what's missing from the Mac version will perform as expected when played on a Mac but cannot be applied or adjusted.<br />

            Um yeah, I don't think so.&nbsp; The templates are the ones that come with the program, which by the way is Microsoft Office Home and Student 2010.&nbsp; There's no French written anywhere on the product key card or the box it came in.<br />

    <title>Insert Photo Into Cell - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patwatts13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insert Photo Into Cell</h2>
                    Please bear with me on this question.&nbsp; My mother-in-law recently died and had collected salt &amp; pepper shaker sets for well over 70 years.&nbsp; I am creating a spreadsheet to inventory approximately 5,500 sets of salt and pepper shakers.&nbsp; As I log each set
 with information I am taking a picture of the set.&nbsp; I want to insert matching picture into cell in spreadsheet for each set.&nbsp; I've tried inserting photo into cell, but of course, the picture covers half of the spreadsheet.&nbsp; I also tried a hyperlink to picture
 - which works - BUT if I want to send spreadsheet to someone my&nbsp;computer knowledge&nbsp;tells me that they wouldn't be able to access the hyperlink to a photo in the spreadsheet to a file &nbsp;on my computer.&nbsp; We would like to be able to send this spreadsheet to collectors
 worldwide to try and sell these items.&nbsp; <strong>Is there a way to reduce photo to a size that will fit in a cell - that the user viewing the spreadsheet on their computer could click on and pull up in whatever photo program they use and see the picture that
 was inserted?</strong>&nbsp;

            You can still use the insert picture function, but after you insert the picture, right click on the picture and click Format Picture &gt; Size, where you can set the height / width of the picture. Alternative, you can just directly resize the picture&nbsp;by clicking
 on the picture, holding the bottom right corner of the picture and drag to the appropriate size

            <p>You don't have to resize the cells before resizing photo, because the photo does not belong to a cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can resize all the photos quickly, click on one photo, and then press Ctrl+A, you will be able select all photos within a worksheet, afterwards resize all the photos in Format Picture &gt; Size</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if your photos are of the similar size, but you can also resize all column / row to the same size. Click on the upper left corner of the spreadsheet (left of column A, above row 1), then drag any row or column to resize all rows/ cloumns</p>

<p>
</p><p>When you insert a photo, it can be placed anywhere in a worksheet, it can be placed between two cells. When you move a cell, the photo would not move with it. When you resize a cell, the photo would not resize accordingly.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Sheet that contains a main tab (2017) and additional tabs which pull each report from web link each day.</p>
<p>I need the main tab to refresh data from each tab and fill in the appropriate column each day.</p>
<p>However the ties I have update the most recent values and does not store the previous data.</p>
<p>For example... 10/16/17 data pulls as 67.40.&nbsp; I need this recorded for today on 2017 tab in it's own column for that day.</p>
<p>So it will show 10/16/17 67.40 then tomorrow/next day 10/17/17 will record a value that report is refreshed as xx.00 and keep the previous data of 67.40.</p>

            Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/16605bb5-87f6-4156-9105-1ccabb998bd0" title="GarbetThyangathyanga">
GarbetThyangathyanga.</a>&nbsp;Are you using the default web browser? If yes,&nbsp;you may try performing a hardware reboot. It will not delete any personal data on the phone. To do this while the phone is turned off, press and hold the volume down and power button keys
 at the same time until it vibrates and it will restart. If the issue persists, proceed with phone reset. It will delete everything on the phone.&nbsp; Back up all personal data to avoid data loss. To reset the phone go to Settings&gt;About&gt;Reset your phone.

<h2>            Keep Rows together&#63;</h2>
                    So I'm wanting to set up a list that allows me to sort through grocery items in order of price. By this, I mean if I have a list where all of the food is in column A (Milk, Bread, Olives) and all of the prices are in column B (3.95, 1.95, 5.99), I want
 to be able to sort them by price and have the item name move with it. Is there some way to set this up? Thanks!

<p>You can create a table and then enter the data; if you already have the data entered, you can make it into a table (Use Ctrl+T for both). Having the data as a table simplifies sorting of the data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also just&nbsp;apply sorting to the cells which should be under Sort &amp; Filter on the Data tab of the ribbon. Just ensure that there are no blanks columns between the columns&nbsp;of data because this can cause sorting to not include the data to the&nbsp;right of
 the column. But you should be OK, as you are only sorting columns A and B.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no option to delete a conversation history in Skype for Windows 10. However, you can delete a message for a short time after it has been sent. To delete, right-click the message and select Remove Message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post. <br />

 flagging messages when I have not instructed it to do so.&nbsp; Every message appears as a task?
