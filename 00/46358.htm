<h2>            Why can&#39;t i Install ANY Versions of net framework on my computer&#63;</h2>
                    I'm not sure if this is in the right section, i just put where i figured it might go, as i haven't exactly read up specifically what each section is for, which i should have done earlier..<br />
<br />
<div>Okay. So here goes.<br />
<br />
For a while now i've been battling with issues related to .Net Framework, and i'd assume other issues with my system as well. One day my net Framework just seemed to have ceased to exist. This was about 2-5 months ago. One day it just wasn't in my programs
 list, and i couldn't play any games requiring net framework. I Understand that Net Framework is pre-installed as a Windows 7 component (i'm running windows 7 on an emachines laptop) but i don't know how this has come to happen. I Don't know what i could have
 possibly done to have this happen, and i'd never have removed NET Framework intentionally because i know it's necessary for many things, the main case being games.<br />
<br />
I've been battling with this for many months now and have only finally resorted to the forums. My computer has had problems before, with corrupt partitions on my hard drive (twice) And i dont have a windows disk to restore from, but i DO have a backup which
 i think may be clean and have none of the problems of late.<br />
now to the issue.<br />
I've searched around the net for so many fixes, for many things related to net framework as i've recieved so many errors. errors like 0xc000007b (the only one i can remember). From what i remember that has something to do with corruption or something of the
 like; i may be wrong, but one of the errors i had i read up on it and it was due to corruption somewhere. I'd tried fixes from all over the net, uninstalling and reinstalling, which only resulted in a download of net framework that was 0MB And would take 0Minutes
 to download, and also tried multiple microsoft fix it files, which in the beginning didn't work and also gave me an error.<br />
I Eventually stumbled across a forum which spoke of a command in command prompt which would launch a sort of in-built system scan/repair sort of thing that would detect and repair corrupt files, and leaves a CBS log file (Which i have saved to my desktop).
 This was after many many weeks of trying to fix this problem.&nbsp;
<div>So anyway, i ran this scan and in the end it said it detected and repaired multiple corruptions in my system, but some weren't able to be fixed, and that i should refer to the CBS log for details (And understood nothing within that log :P).</div>
<div>I Also found people saying to use windows update. problem. My windows update is also.. 'broken' i guess i'll say. Windows hasn't updated for a VERY Long time, and after finding that system scan thing, i tried to start an update, but it said the system
 wasn't running, which i attempted to change, which apparently succeeded, but in truth, really didn't, so the windows update is also a problem needing to be fixed.<br />
Back to the net framework.<br />
<br />
After running the system scan thing, i tried microsoft fix it files, which would actually run, but detect no problems. I Also tried the net framework verification tool, which said i had up to net framework 3.5, and later tried the net framework cleanup tool,
 desperate for any fix after having been jerked around for so long.<br />
After much effort, many forums and fixes later, i finally have net framework on my computer. yep,. Net framework 1.1. Still an issue&nbsp;<br />
I can't seem to install any later versions of net framework, because i think i read somewhere that later versions are the ones installed as system components, and that i should download 3.0 SP2, which also wouldnt work. It tells me to 'turn windows features
 on and off' which i tried with net framework, having it on, off, partially on, in as many combinations possible, but kept getting the same error.<br />
I've run across a problem slightly similar to this before. I had to update my net framework and the download size was 0mb and 0minutes to download, but it was a very different issue as i remember.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's all i can think of for now, so i'm desperate for any help to get this fixed. Any guidance is a lot of help. is there some sort of miraculous fix i can apply, or would it just be good to revert to my old backup and see if that's still all fine
 and dandy? Reverting to the old backup is only a problem because i have probably a new 30GB of files to transfer over, and it just takes so long to put on my portable hard drive. I Would be willing to leave my laptop on all night while things transfer, etc
 etc if it helps me get this fixed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm running windows 7 on an emachines laptop. I Don't know what else to put as for what i'm running, so let me know if i need to list anything else.<br />
</div>
<div><br />
Even though i'm sure there's stuff i've missed, thanks for any help in advance.</div>

            Hey,<br />
<br />
I've used methods 2 and 3 before, but as far as memory goes (and google chromes history, which is never deleted for me.) I haven't tried 1 and 4.<br />
I Wasnt able to previously do anything with windoes update; the fix it files would say the problem was fixed but it really had done nothing noticeable, so after much searching i found that resetting the update service to default (Thats how it was described
 where i found it) It was fixed and i could use windows update again.<br />
<br />
I had run many microsoft fix its so i'm not sure exactly which ones, but ive tried fix its for windows update multiple times, and they hadnt worked.<br />
<br />
Anyway i managed to resolve the situation on my own, miraculously.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I'll provide a brief recount from what i can gather with my history if it will give any indication as to what ive done haha<br />
<br />
-browsing microsoft answers for any help possible</div>
<div><br />
<div>-found a random unrelated article on svchost using too much memory</div>
<div><br />
<div>-tried to download net framework 3.0 (aware that 3.5 is installed as a system component, but thought it was worth a try seeing as it wasnt being detected, even with the .net framework verification tool)</div>
<div><br />
- tried to install all other versions of net framework to no avail</div>
<div><br />
<div>-was confused with the 'you must use'turn windows features on or off' " message when i couldnt install one of the net frameworks, so searched some stuff up on that</div>
<div><br />
<div>-tried net framework 3.5.1 recieving the error "HRESULT 0xc8000222"</div>
<div><br />
<div>- Google search on The afore mentioned error and led to articles on windows update troubleshooting</div>
<div><br />
<div>-downloaded DLL-Files fixer, which detected many errors on my system (whether this is reliable or not i dont know) And did some research on its reliability, and satisfied with what i had found, chose to use the free fix on 15 of those errors</div>
<div><br />
-Searched the error 0xc8000222 again, to find articles on resetting windows update components and backing up your registry before doing so</div>
<div><br />
<div>-Followed this guide:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a>&nbsp;- Until step 7 at which point i tried to install net framework 4 again, actually Having a size and estimated download time, so i gave it a
 go, resulting in the abortion of the installation due to another installation already running (Which was the error window which i recieved for net framework installation earlier, of 0xc8000222 - i hadnt closed it because i was searching up on it)</div>
<div><br />
<div>-google searched why the command 'winsock' was not recognized in 'netsh reset winsock' (later thinking it may have been netsh winsock reset)</div>
<div><br />
- and FINALLY, i lead myself to here:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_update/fresh-windows-7-installation-windows-update-error/16a05548-6f6c-4d86-b5cb-f8abae5afe58">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_update/fresh-windows-7-installation-windows-update-error/16a05548-6f6c-4d86-b5cb-f8abae5afe58</a><br />
This answer of stopping the update service and changing software distribution to SDold, then restarting the update service seemed to actually work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm still unaware as to what the problem actually was but that's exactly what i've done today in regards to attempting to fix it, and the last fix (I'd assume, but possible one earlier) Seemed to have fixed it.<br />
If you have any idea what it actually may have been, it would still be great to know for future reference<br />
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your time and response (:</div>

            <p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>

<h2>            how to solve 200&#37; dpi scaling results making address bar far smaller.</h2>
                    
<p>I installed clean copy of windows 7 ultimate 32bit final (trial) version.</p>
<p>Trial version doesn't mean you can't underestimate my windows.</p>
<p>Windows set my resolution to native 1680*1050 at installation.</p>
<p>You should know my resolution is 1680*1050 because I said Windows set it.</p>
<p>My only customization is I set dpi scaling to 200%. If you have heard of dpi scaling it is ok.</p>
<p>The problem is address bar of windows explorer is far smaller than before.</p>
<p>I am PRETTY SURE you don't understand me NOW. so please let me instruct you how to reproduce the problem.</p>
<p>Please set your resolution to max (it means maximum).</p>
<p>And set your dpi to 200% by clicking custom text size from the left side.</p>
<p>You can open windows explorer now and see the address bar.</p>
<p><strong>The address bar is much smaller and search bar is much bigger.</strong></p>
<p>I did the following.</p>
<p>My graphics hardware and driver software is OK and Updated so don't ask me about it please.</p>
<p>I already tried to drag n drop the arrows between the 2 bar so please don't tell about that method to me. It is<strong>NOT</strong> working.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Do
 you get any warning message when you change the DPI to 200%?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the warning says “Some items may not fit your screen if you choose this setting while your display is set to this resolution” then that is not the optimal resolution
 for your computer, you will have to decrease the resolution and check if that helps.</span></span></p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>I set my resolution to native 1680*1050.</p>
<p>then I set custom 200% dpi.</p>
<p>The above procedure results in much longer search box and too little address bar in the windows explorer.</p>
<p>Please please please see the picture:</p>
<p>http://i53.tinypic.com/k3wxe1.png</p>
<p>The arrow (between the two) solution is not working. Please report this problem to your senior staff.</p>

<p>Hello Iknowyoucnt,</p>
<p>First, lets try to clean boot to determine if there is another app that could be causing a issue by following the steps here:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>.</p>
<p>If clean booting your system does not resolve the issue, try creating a new user account by following the steps here:&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account</a></p>
<p>Hope&nbsp;this&nbsp;helps</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I can confirm what you are describing.</p>
<p>I set one of my systems to the maximum recommended resolution (1280x1024) and the DPI to 200%.
</p>
<p>Opened Windows Explorer and tried to resize the Address/Search bars and could not move them.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what may be causing this, or whether it is by design or a bug?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update &#34;Synaptics - Pointing Drawing - Synaptics Pointing Device&#34; breaks TouchPad on ThinkPad W540</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>after installing the Windows 10 Update "Synaptics - Pointing Drawing - Synaptics Pointing Device" the TouchPad on Lenovo ThinkPad W540 does not work anymore.
<strong>The update breaks the TouchPad</strong>! The Synaptics update comes automatically with Windows 10 and the update can not be cancelled while installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31735b4a-d2d1-47ba-a8a5-441bbf2976fe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31735b4a-d2d1-47ba-a8a5-441bbf2976fe" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When opening the Mouse properties in the control panel, the following message comes up:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4048f9b-a067-4623-b51e-fc16737e0d86" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4048f9b-a067-4623-b51e-fc16737e0d86" /></a></p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for the response, but it does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I uninstall the driver, then install the latest driver from the Lenovo Website, the Windows Update again tries to install the "Synaptics - Pointing Drawing - Synaptics Pointing Device" (see attached screenshot). The driver is not working and I do
 not want to have this driver. The driver appears since June 26 or so in the Windows Update list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advice what to do to get rid of this Windows update.</p>

<p><span>Hi riteshwalia,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Mscank&nbsp;</span></strong><span>is a system driver
 file which may be associated with any hardware device.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Open device manager to check which hardware device is not functioning properly on the computer and uninstall it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Device Manager by clicking the&nbsp; <strong>Start</strong> button.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Control
 Panel</strong>, click&nbsp; <strong>System and Security</strong>, and then, under&nbsp;<strong>System</strong>, click&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span><span>If you're prompted for an administrator
 password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Now
 check if any device has any yellow exclamation mark on it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once you find any device with any mark, right click on that device and later click on&nbsp;<strong>Uninstall</strong>option and restart
 the computer and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are unable to find any device with any marks then check by enabling hidden devices.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the device manager click on&nbsp; <strong>View </strong>and later click on&nbsp;<strong>show hidden devices</strong> and check if you find any device with exclamation mark and uninstall it</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails run Windows update to check and install recommended device driver update on the computer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></strong></p>

                    I was just wiping the pc for my dad because it was running a bit slow and I was going to use it after the wipe. The wipe got stuck after 78% and stayed like that for more than 12 hours. I had found another post with the same problem and it said to reboot
 and let it start again. I left it to try to boot for around 6 hours but to no avail. I created a surface recovery image and tried to recover from recovery drive but it kept on saying that there was a problem recovering the pc. I opened Command Prompt and tried
 sfc /scannow, it verified but then failed. I listed all drives using diskpart and the only drive there was the recovery USB. I tried reinstalling windows using a USB created with Windows Media Creation Tool but when it got to select the drive, it wasn't there.
 I Went into UEFI to boot off the recovery USB and to check if the Disk Error icon was there but I found 2 things. 1)The disk error icon was not there 2)Windows Boot Manager was gone from the boot list. I also found out that

 I also found out that the surface is no longer booting from a USB anymore(I waited 12 hours to figure this out). The Surface Pro 4 is out of warranty and I don't want to just chuck it out. Can you please advise me on how to diagnose and fix this problem.

<p>I managed to get my printer working using all Windows 10 drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My symptom was in Printers &amp; Scanners the printer was listed but with the error "Driver unavailable". Printing to the driver reported an error. This is on a brand new machine with a fresh Windows 10 install completely updated before attaching the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Windows Update to download a new driver and it tried to download but always with error 0x80240061.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I did:</p>
<p>1. Launched Device Manager</p>
<p>2. Found the HP LaserJet 1320</p>
<p>3. Right click Update Driver</p>
<p>4. Browse my Computer...</p>
<p>5. Let me pick from a list...</p>
<p>6. Uncheck Show compatible hardware</p>
<p>7. Choose Microsoft from the list of manufacturers</p>
<p>8. Choose USB Printing Support in the list of models</p>
<p>9. Next and then complete the process - see driver updated message (sorry I have to report this step from memory I don't want to mess up my working printer)</p>
<p>10. Unplug printer</p>
<p>11. Plug in printer. It now correctly installs the hp LaserJet 1320 PCL 5 driver.</p>

    <title>Votre version de Games for Windows Live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pierrotman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Votre version de Games for Windows Live n&#38;&#35;39&#59;&#38;&#35;39&#59;est pas compatible avec cette version de Windows</h2>
                    
<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Je rencontre une anomalie lors du lancement du jeu Batman Arkham Asylum Game of the Year Edition qui demande en configuration requise Games for Windows – Live</p>
<p>Après l’installation du dvd sans anomalie particulière un message d’erreur survient&nbsp;:«&nbsp;Installation logiciels supplémentaires nécessaire pour jouer à Batman Arkham&nbsp; sylum Game of the Year Edition...&nbsp;»</p>
<p>Une nouvelle fenêtre automatique s’ouvre&nbsp;: «&nbsp;Ce programme présente des problèmes de compatibilité (Games for Windows Live Microsoft)&nbsp;»</p>
<p>Je clique donc sur «&nbsp;Obtenir de l'aide en ligne&nbsp;» qui me renvoie immédiatement sur =&gt; Résolution d''un problème dans Games for Windows Live</p>
<p>:«&nbsp;Votre version de Games for Windows Live n''est pas compatible avec cette version de Windows.</p>
<p>Une nouvelle version de ce logiciel, qui résout ce problème, est disponible.</p>
<p>Tapez ou cliquez pour télécharger la mise à jour à partir du site Web de Microsoft&nbsp;»</p>
<p>Je me retrouve à présent sur xboxlive me proposant de telecharger «&nbsp;Games for Windows Marketplace Client&nbsp;»</p>
<p>L’installation se passe bien jusqu’au lancement client final où u nouveau message apparaît «&nbsp;Pour utiliser le logiciel Games for Windows, vous devez disposer de l'Assistant de connexion Windows Live ID&nbsp;»</p>
<p>Je clique donc sur le lien où ce nouveau logiciel est disponible «&nbsp;Windows Live ID Sign-in Assistant 6.5&nbsp;»</p>
<p>Le logiciel «&nbsp;wllogin_32.msi&nbsp;» (identique pour le wllogin_64.msi) s’exécute et est bel et bien enregistré dans&nbsp; les docs mais sans plus... pas de confirmation, pas de lancement…</p>
<p>Je relance donc une connexion à GFWL via l'accès à Batman Arkham Asylum Game of the Year Edition</p>
<p>Je m’identifie via mon ID Windows live *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;correspondant au gamertag «&nbsp;Pierrotman&nbsp;»</p>
<p>«&nbsp;Veuillez patienter&nbsp;…&nbsp;» pendant plus de 10min, à bout de patience, obligé de tout stopper via Ctrl+Alt+Suppr</p>
<p>Alors qu’avec une autre adresse mail (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) la vérif. se lance puis me demande confirmer la clé produit du jeu et enfin…<br />
bloque&nbsp;! M’avertissant que mon ID ou mot de passe est erroné</p>
<p>Je vous passe les détails des mots de passe réinitialisés et des reboot du PC, le jeu sinon peut très bien se lancer et est jouable à la seule condition près qu’aucune<br />
sauvegarde n’est disponible temps que la connexion n’est pas effective.</p>

<p>J’ai installé et désinstallé le jeu avec GFWL pour reprendre le tout à zéro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Le jeu se trouve hors de cause puisqu’il fonctionne seul</p>
<p>Le compte xboxlive / gameforwindowslive est valide puisque que le compte gamertag «&nbsp;Pierrotman&nbsp;» fonctionne</p>
<p>En revanche il me semble crucial de trouver une compatibilité de gameforwindowslive pour Windows 8 car à chaque relance de game for windows market place le téléchargement &nbsp;Windows Live ID Sign-in Assistant 6.5 est à nouveau reproposé.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Merci de me recontacter au plus vite&nbsp;si vous avez une quelconque solution ou piste à proposer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pierre</p>

</span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span>Reply with above information to help you better.</span></p>
<p><span>However, I’m glad to provide you with these steps which will help you to resolve issue with sound on apps.</span></p>

<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p><span>Uninstall and reinstall apps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Uninstall:</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to uninstall the app:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click the app that you want to uninstall.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Uninstall in the task bar.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Then click on Uninstall button.</span></p>
<p><span>Reinstall:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press “Windows key + W” and select “Store” option from the list.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Then type the app that you are looking.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You get list of application listed in the left panel.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the application and click “Install” and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p><span>For your reference have a look at the link:</span></p>
<p><span>“What to do if you have problems with an app”</span></p>

            Vaseem,<br />
This seems to be a fundamental problem with W8. Offering ineffective solutions does nothing but frustrate the customer. The first step to a solution is to understand why the problem exisits.<br />
Please preface your responses with a rationale for offering the solutions you do. There is no shame in admitting that there are many customers having the same problem. I have an external USB sound card running Microsoft drivers and it does not function in W8
 apps. I am looking forward to an update that rectifies this problem. Just maybe it would be better to simply state "we are aware of the problem and are working towards a solution"<br />

                    <p>Original Title: Windows 8.1:&nbsp; How can I "permanently" remove existing ## track numbers from the files ##filename.mp3?</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I successfully rename an MP3 filename Windows 8.1 will later restore the original filename and track number in the ID3 tag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I rename an existing MP3 filename so to remove the track number from the filename.mp3 prefix, after some time Windows 8.1 will automatically restore the original filename returning the unwanted track number. &nbsp;I've "seen" Windows automatically rename
 the files back to the original file names in the explorer window while I was watching and not interacting with the computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've renamed the files using explorer rename, explorer file properties rename, dos rename, and even dos copy to a new name without the track number. &nbsp;In each case, after some time, Windows 8.1 has returned all successful renames &amp; copies back to he original
 flename containing the unwanted track number prefix. &nbsp;I have even deleted the track number from the ID3 properties (using explorer to open the file properties) and Windows 8.1 also restores the track number back into the ID3 Track Tag as well as restore the
 original filename containing the track number prefix. &nbsp;I have no idea where Windows 8.1 is getting the track number information (since I deleted the number from the track tag) during it's periodically running restore/rename process.</p>

            <p>Hi Nella,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur due to virus or malware present on the computer. Also, another application could also cause such issues as the file name retains the original name even after editing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the issue specific for a particular folder or file on the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When there are infected files on the computer, duplicate files creation, file name getting renamed or files getting disappeared are common scenarios.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let’s verify if there are virus or malware present on the computer. Follow the methods suggested below:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>If you have a third party security software installed on the computer, you can run a security scan and find out if there is a virus or malware causing the issue. If you don’t have one, run Windows Defender or Microsoft Safety scanner to scan and fix infected
 files on Windows. Refer to the link to download and run the scanner:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss. This Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions,
 download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s verify if the same issue occurs in safe mode. Rename the file in safe mode, reboot the computer (back to safe mode) and check if the file name is retained. This should help us find out if there is a third party application that is causing the issue
 as they are disabled or not running in safe mode. Follow the steps accordingly:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Refer to the link to boot the laptop in safe mode:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart the computer and enter safe mode (from sign-in screen). Check if the file name stays intact. If yes, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,
 or Windows Vista. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the link to place the computer in a clean boot state and find the application:</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<strong>Windows 8</strong>”</p>
<p>You can refer to the section “<strong>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</strong>” to check for the application or program that is causing this issue:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Please refer to the section<strong>: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot
</strong>of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know the status of this issue. </p>

            <p>Hi Pinaki,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I located the "Malware" named "Windows Media Player" which was renaming several of my music files.&nbsp; After searching (Right Click on Start -&gt; Search) for "Turn Windows Features On or Off" and expanding "Media Features" then I unchecked "Windows Media Player"
 and pressing "Ok" I was prompted to restart my computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After which I renamed my music files to eliminate the track number prefix from the filename.mp3 and for several hours now all my MP3 files have kept the new name I have given them.&nbsp; Yea!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't think of Windows Media Player as being the Malware infecting my computer.&nbsp; My McAfee virus scanner which I keep up to date missed that one.&nbsp; Thanks for the laugh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I need to find and install another media player I can use since this resolution disables the Windows Media Player.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Are you referring to a file named Windows Media Player locally present under File Explorer or Windows Media Player application?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, corrupt application settings might cause such issues. If you are referring to Windows Media Player application, it may not be a virus. Turning off and turning on the feature for the application might fix the issue. I would suggest you to follow
 the same steps to turn on Windows Media Player under Windows Features and check if the issue still persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you need further assistance on the issue. </p>

            <p>Hi Pinaki,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only application running at the time of the MP3 auto&nbsp;rename was Windows File&nbsp;Explorer.&nbsp; To answer your first question, I was only looking at&nbsp;my&nbsp;MP3s&nbsp;using Explorer and was not&nbsp;looking at applications/programs. &nbsp;The function which was auto renaming my
 MP3s&nbsp;is therefore associated with a background task loaded at Windows startup. &nbsp;MP3 auto rename&nbsp;was successfully disabled by turning off the Windows Media Feature described above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I enable Windows Media Player and it renames a large number of my MP3s again (adding track numbers to the filename.mp3)&nbsp;it will&nbsp;take me a&nbsp;some amount of time to manually correct the filenames again.&nbsp; I do not wish to spend time isolating&nbsp;a problem&nbsp;that
 is not considered a problem by development.&nbsp; Please verify the MP3 auto rename&nbsp;is an "errant process" and not an expected result and considered&nbsp;to be a&nbsp;feature of Windows Media Player, or its associated background task, before we diagnose this further.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although it was a problem&nbsp;for me&nbsp;preventing my desired result.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a feature of Windows Media Player&nbsp;I would then ask for a user setting to only turn off the auto rename.&nbsp; I "suspect" the information being used to automatically rename&nbsp;my MP3 files is being derived from a CDDB music database.&nbsp; Perhaps development
 is interested in providing such&nbsp;a user&nbsp;option so that customers do not resort to disabling the entire Windows program and use a competitive product as I did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;suspect this is a known feature purposely designed and not a programming&nbsp;error.&nbsp; Although in my case not being able to turn off the auto rename 'feature' is a&nbsp;poor assumption&nbsp;by the program&nbsp;designers in my opinion.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The auto rename problem was resolved by disabling the Windows Media Player.&nbsp; I can live without the Windows Media Player application as there are other competitive players I can use.&nbsp; I do not need further assistance but am willing to help isolate&nbsp;only if
 development considers this an errant condition.</p>

<br />Usually, the second monitor should be detected automatically, but if not, you can try detecting it manually. Click on the Start button and then on the gear like a symbol to open the Settings app. Go to System and in the display tab, under the Multiple Displays column, click on “Detect.

<p>I have the same problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;for years my w10 system worked fine with two monitors, including both extend the monitor and duplicate the monitor.&nbsp; Now after an update from windows, the second monitor is saying in red Didn't detect another display.&nbsp; however
 the 2nd monitor can have a display on the attached tv via the hdmi connection from my computer.&nbsp; if I have things set to a single monitor (the tv)&nbsp; , I get sound and pic.&nbsp; If I have two monitors attached, as soon as I plug in the 2nd&nbsp; monitor (dvi) the sound
 on the tv goes off.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have six computers with same set up and all doing this bad thing.&nbsp; On one of them I notices a sound line that was at 100, but had an x over the sound symbol.&nbsp; Once I moved the line from 100 to less, the x went away and the sound came
 on.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure that the didnt detect another display message is not detecting the monitor due to some unknown flag and some unknown flag is turning off the sound.</p>
<p>OK microsoft, we need an updated driver that will make it go back to working be4 the update that removed the ability to run with two monitors with sound.</p>

<p>Hi Kathleen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your reply. that was one of the first thins I tries to no such luck. I have made sure that I have the most up to date drivers for both monitors as well and no such luck.
<br />
<br />
I feel that the hardware of my system is not enough to cope with 2 monitors with W10 although it worked perfectly on my W7 system. I have just had to downgrade my Laptop W7 as that had the exact same issue I am having with my desktop here and guess what its
 working perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that if I downgrade my desktop as well to W7 it will work perfectly but I want all my machines to be using W10. I got a feeling I may need a graphics card for both my Lappy and my desktop.<br />
<br />
Got any other suggestions?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

                    Got the Windows 10 Anniversary update automatically. I was surprised, no prior notification. Update caused my audio speakers and mic to stop working. Went to HP to get fresh drivers, figured they were corrupted. This actually happened when I upgraded to
 8.1, so I was confident it would be a quick fix. Now, I have gotten this screen when I restarted my computer. I need help to restore this, as I don't have a disc or USB with Windows 10.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55f85be6-8028-4892-bc96-4cc696b3087e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55f85be6-8028-4892-bc96-4cc696b3087e" /></a>

            Don't even ask me how, but I got my computer up and running. Even the mic and speakers are fine now. Combination of giving it solid rest for one whole day, and pressing every function key until it surrendered.<br />

<h2>            windows 10 and window media player 12 not finding song information</h2>
                    I am using window 10 and windows media player 12. WMP does not display the album information when I put the disk in or when I right click the album and select update. This works fine using Nero 2017. Microsoft help does not appear to have any answers and
 any articles are for pre windows 10.

<p>Hi Cristhian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying. I have tried to follow your directions but once in Device Manager there is no option to select expand screen adaptor. The only option is the monitor, I have checked to see if there are any updates for the monitor and Windows but there
 aren't any. Unfortunately I still can't find any settings for adaptive displays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            My brand new HP Pavilion HPE h8-1360t PC with 16 gig RAM and a SSD Win7 Pro system drive FREEZES without error or warning</h2>
                    I am running Win7 Pro on a brand new HP Pavilion HPE h8-1360t PC with 16 gig RAM and a SSD system drive.&nbsp; This machine flies, right up until the moment that it freezes!&nbsp; When it freezes, I get no error message, no BSOD, just everything stops, and only
 a cold boot restarts it.&nbsp; There is no .DMP file after this event, which happens about one a week.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Is there any application that can be installed and running in the background that keeps track of the last 10 seconds before a freeze (like a 10 second continuous loop recording of all system activities?) that I could examine after a freeze?&nbsp; I'd sure be grateful
 for your help!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Thanks, Airpilot.

<br />
I will also copy this response to the older thread:<br />
<br />
I wanted you to know that the SFC scan turned up NO system file issues.<br />
<br />
As for using Bing to find a third party application to track the freeze, can you please suggest a keyword or keywords that would result in finding such software?&nbsp; I have been unable to track any down so far.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <blockquote>Presumably you checked Event Viewer for any problems that occurred just prior to these freezes?
</blockquote>
<br />
I did, and there are no events at the exact time of the freeze.&nbsp; There were two obvious but unhelpful entries after the freeze:<br />
<br />
At 5:56:27pm:&nbsp; "The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly."<br />
<br />
and at 5:56:57pm:&nbsp; "The previous system shutdown at 4:20:47 PM on ‎3/‎16/‎2013 was unexpected."<br />
<br />
These both state the obvious, but don't shed any light on WHY the system froze.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, this information does not help, because the conditions it discusses is NOT the problem I'm encountering.&nbsp; The article presumes that the system is suddenly shutting down by itself, or that it is being shut down through lack of power or by holding
 the power button in.&nbsp; NONE of these conditions apply!!!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
In my case, as I have previously clearly explained, the system simply freezes.&nbsp; All on-screen activity stops, the video is active but frozen, no mouse control over the cursor,&nbsp; no response to keyboard input,&nbsp; no error messages are visible, no .dmp files are
 written, no entries are made into the Events Log (until I have to manually shut down and restart by holding in the power button, sometimes hours after the freeze, when I finally walk by the running computer and notice that it is frozen).
<br />
<br />
What I REALLY NEED is an applet running in the background that records every system/kernel activity for the last 5 - 10 seconds - like a continuous loop recorder, so that I can see what was happening at a low level when it freezes again.&nbsp; So far, on-line searches
 for such an applet have been fruitless.&nbsp; If you could suggest an app like this, THAT would be very helpful!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Hey, thanks!&nbsp; Can you tell me how Dependency Walker can be set up to "show me the module where the freeze occurs"?&nbsp; I looked at it, and it isn't clear to me how it could help me find out which module is causing the freeze - can you help, or know someone who
 can?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

I thought it would!&nbsp; I downloaded it (it's called Process Monitor) and configured it so it would track all PC activity for the last 1 million events, and log them real time to a Process Monitor Log (.PML) file on my hard drive.&nbsp; I really thought it was going
 to solve my problem, but when I simulated a freeze and subsequent cold boot (by disconnecting power to the PC), I found upon reboot that the log files were there, but Process Monitor claimed that they were corrupted because of the incomplete shut-down.&nbsp; So
 apparently I can't see the log file to know what was happening at the moment of freeze.&nbsp; Bummer.<br />
<br />
Any one know how to work around this problem with this Process Monitor, or another Process Monitor application that might track events at the moment of freeze, and write them continuously to a non-volatile log file?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<h2>            How do I remove the file name from movies I import from my camera&#63;</h2>
                    How do I remove the file name from movies I import from my camera - the movie shows the file name on screen then it slowly disappears?&nbsp; Using Win 7 Pro and Home premium 64 bit. &nbsp; Thank you.<br />
<br />
Edited - only shows up on one of the 2 computers I have/use.&nbsp; Any movie file I import has this whether from camera, animation or imported from youtube.&nbsp; All formats - slight differences in size, font and location.
<br />

            <blockquote>Hi and thanks...Videos off my camera I just drag and drop onto the desktop.&nbsp; They are avi - the cam is a Canon about a year old.&nbsp; Others are .mov from the 3D software i use - Cinema 4D. I save them from the software animation
 into the appropriate file folder.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vids from Youtube are done with YOutube Video Downloader and the files are mostly .flv but others come in too.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
All these files open when doubleclicked and the file name is in very large block letters at the bottom of the screen for maybe 4 sec. then fades away.&nbsp; I have not edited them in any way - they are the first "raw" videos from cam or from animation software.
<br />
<br />
It is not consistent but mostly it happens only on one machine - Win 7 Pro with all updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks. </blockquote>
========================================<br />
I suspect the media player you are using is displaying <br />
the filename. Check the properties/preferences of&nbsp;your <br />
media player to see if you can change a setting.<br />
<br />
For example VLC will display the filename...and you <br />
can go to...Tools / Preferences / All / Video...<br />
<br />
Scroll down to and uncheck...'Show Media Title On Video' / Save.<br />
<br />
The next time VLC is launched the video&nbsp;title should not be displayed.
