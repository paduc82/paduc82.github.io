<h2>            Receiving blank word documents in outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>Receiving blank word documents in outlook 2010<br />
</p>
<p>Users in my office are experiencing a strange, inconsistent problem: Word attachments from pre-2010 users sometimes open as blank documents.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This is happening when both the attachment is opened from within Outlook as well as if the attachment is saved and then opened from within Word itself.</p>
<p>If the same email as received simultaneously by a smartphone is then forwarded to the 2010 user, the document will open properly.</p>
<p>If the attachment as received by a pre-2010 user is copied to the 2010 pc via a flash drive, the document will open properly.</p>
<p>If the 2010 user forwards the failed attachment email from their pc to a new user the document will not open properly.</p>
<p>If the 2010 user bypasses their Outlook app and uses a webmail client to access the same email and attachment, the attachment will open properly.</p>
<p>When the document opens improperly, there is no error message, the document simply opens as collection of blank pages.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The size of the&nbsp;attachment is unaffected.</p>

    <title>Mobile Windows 10 Keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobby alan grissom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mobile Windows 10 Keyboard</h2>
                    <p>My last device (Lumia 640) had a problem that the keyboard covered the text box, so that I could not see what I was typing and couldn't see or correct mistakes. I reported the problem, many times over a year and ask for a fix which never occured. I finally
 bought an "Alcatel Idol S4" with Windows 10.&nbsp; In the beginning it was very nice and everything worked perfect then suddenly about 3 weeks after I had the phone the keyboard began covering the text box EXACTLY as it had an my Lumia 640. I did a factory reboot
 and it went back to normal and everything was fine for about 3 weeks. Then it went right back to the same'ol same'ol of covering the text box once again. Why did this problem follow me from my last phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have contacted Microsoft through the feedback hub and reported this problem multiple times to Microsoft customer service over the last couple of months to no avail.. I've gotten no answer at all just as over the last year with the Lumia 640. Can anybody
 tell me if there is a fix for this and how to go about doing it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;I've been using Microsoft Windows phones for over 5 years now but since Windows 10 Everything has gone crazy on those phones because of updates that do more damage than good and I am bout ready just to give it up since customer service no longer seems to
 care about us.</p>

<p><span>Microsoft has built in the ability to move around the onscreen keyboard so you can slide the keyboard up and down to reveal different parts the content on your screen.

<p>
</p><p>When the keyboard appears and you want to move it, just press and hold the spacebar with your thumb or whichever finger you prefer.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>As you hold it down, the keyboard will become highlighted with the accent color you've chosen, letting you know you can now slide the keyboard up and down the screen.</p>

</p><p>With your thumb or finger still pressing the keyboard, just slide it up or down. Once you have it in the desired position, just release your thumb or finger.</p>

<p>I do appreciate your answer but I feel that they should have to FIX this software along with the other problems I've got going on mainly the speech to text. Also my keyboard has been doing double letters whenever I touch it now so something new cropping
 up. All the problems seem to be rotating around my messaging system. The keyboard and everything to do with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;You see I blog A LOT. Have you ever tried to type while looking around your hand and down under your keyboard when for years you've been used to looking above it? You cannot type at normal speed because you automatically keep wanting to reach down at the
 bottom of the phone to hit the spacebar when there's nothing there because you have to have the keyboard up high enough to read a few lines Nothing is where it should be. You're constantly fighting a life long habit and its very confusing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm hoping this isn't your way of telling me that they are not going to fix my software. I want a phone that works&nbsp; properly, I paid full price for it, I should get what I'm supposed to get.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Different text boxes act differently.. This one isn't fixed so it's easy to type on above the keyboard but many of them are different so I would have to be moving back keyboard in different places for different boxes. It's nothing but a pure hassle for
 someone who types as much as I do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;While I've got you here do you know why the speech to text puts down different words than what I say? It will write down everything I say as I say it and then instantly change it to something else. Some of the words completely misspelled and maybe not even
 a language. I've noticed others complaining about this problem along with this text box problem also. Speech to text will also automatically put in some type of punctuation every 4 or 5 words whether it calls for it or not and you never know if it's going
 to be a period a comma or a question mark. I only use it when I'm writing something really long and my fingers are done. But I end up editing for. Almost as long as it would take me to type it by hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Anyway, I'm glad that after 2 years I heard from someone I hope they get this thing fixed, that's their job after all. Supposedly. 🙄&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;there's really so much wrong with mobile Windows 10 I don't know how they could ever get it all fixed. Strangely, I keep typing right down outside the bottom of this text box to the SUBMIT button and sometimes past it then after a couple of minutes it will
 pull back up inside the box were supposed to be. I took a screenshot of it, I wish I could send it to you and show you this mess. The software is really messed up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Well, I appreciate your time and trouble. Take care and have a good day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So I appreciate your well thought out reply Bobby. I do not think you will see a "fix" and my reason for saying that is because I believe they recognized that certain websites just do not behave nicely with mobile. It does not happen to me very often but
 it does happen. When I get on a site and need to complete a form etc, and if I cannot because it is hidden, I use this feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trust me, I understand what you are saying and it can be a pain but at least when you run into a site that does not behave nicely, then you have a way to deal with it.</p>

<p>Hey Jack,</p>
<p>&nbsp;My problem is that EVERY TEXT. BOX besides the ones unfixed like this give me problems. Facebook is worse of all and that's where my blog page is. The one on internet websites behave normally if I turn my phone sideways for some reason tho.</p>
<p>&nbsp;One thing I can't figure out is why this problem was passed on to this phone from my last but waited about 3 weeks to do so. If I do a factory reset it goes back to acting right but a couple weeks later it goes back to the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;All they've got to do is fix. It so that the text box will rise above the keyboard as normal, the rest of it, I can put up with for now. But they really need to do something about the speech to text it's horrible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Can you tell me why after TWO YEARS of complaining and negative feedback they never responded at all? That's very disturbing and has caused me and others to lose confidence in their Customer Support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks for your help, take care.</p>

<p>Bobby, do me a favor and reply with two or three links where you see this happening. I just want to test something.</p>

I Don't know if it was a FIX or what but it finally straightened out, my keyboard is now acting properly and the text box is rising above the keyboard as it is supposed to.&nbsp;
&nbsp;Now if only they would do something about this HORRIBLE Speach-To-Text I'd be totally overjoyed. It writes what I say then quickly changes most of it to something completely different. It even misspells words itself then calls attention to the misspellings.
 Crazy! Sometimes it combines more than one word into something really weird. I spend as much time editing as what I would just typing it out.
&nbsp;Then there are times when I use it that it will repeat what I say 100 times like does if I use it on here. Windows 10 Mobile speech to text is terrible. Actually even BEFORE Windows 10 it was just as bad. Any chance of it getting better?
&nbsp;Well, guess I'll go now. Thanks for everything and have a Great &amp; Merry Christmas.
&nbsp;Later. 😊 ���� ��&nbsp;

    <title>Copying hyperlinks from one presentation to another - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Copying hyperlinks from one presentation to another</h2>
                    <p>I have created hyperlinks in a presentation that jumps from one slide to another. When I copy these slides into a larger deck, it does not copy the links properly. I use Hyperlink to slide and then select the uniquely named slide (so it's not just saying
 slide 2 or whatever)?&nbsp; However, when I copy into the larger deck, it does not use the title but goes slide number.&nbsp; Does this mean I have to recreate all the links?&nbsp; Any thoughts on how these links can stay fixed when copying from one presentation to another?</p>

            The problem is hyperlinks don't really work by using slide titles they look at the SlideID. You have no control over the SlideID but every slide in a presentation will have a unique ID. The problem starts when you have another presentation because this
 presentation may (will) use the same IDs. Once you try to combine there's every chance the link will go to the wrong ID.<br />
<br />
The only solution is to use code to remake the links or manually remake them. I'm sure Shyam Pillai posted code here some time ago but I can't find it. Somewhere we have some code that can do this (in a different way) but you need to run the code before you
 combine. If you email me and mention "SuperGlue" I'll see if I can locate it!<br />

            <p>Hello Sunil,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate the additional information you've provided regarding this concern. I would like to gather more information from your end so we could provide you the appropriate resolution.</p>
<ul>
<li>You' ve mentioned that you can&nbsp;still send attachments within a certain program. Please verify if the program that you're using in Windows 8 is Microsoft Outlook 2007.</li><li>Where do you receive the error message? Is it within Windows Live Mail (installed via Essentials Installer) or Mail App (pre-installed when using Windows 8).</li></ul>
<p>We will be awaiting for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The program I use is Microsoft Outlook 2007.</p>
<p>The error message is through the Mail App(pre-installed using Windows 8)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The procedure I am following is that all my offline messages are stored in the Windows Mail App. I use Windows Mail primarily. However, whenever I need to send a attachment more than 0.5 gb, I do the same using Microsoft Outlook 2007.
</p>
<p>There is no issue so far in receiving large attachments through Windows Mail App.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not tried it with my Hotmail account since my primary account is the GMail one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks </p>

            <div>HI I am equally interested in your answer to this problem.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I use Windows 8 mail app (pre-installed) exclusively with a Gmail address. Receiving attachments immaterial of size is no problem, however when I try to send an email with an attachment of any size I receive the same error message in the app as Sunil (there
 is a problem sending messages from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** right now. Check with your provider for more info.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I find this utterly frustrating as each and every email containing an attachment now has to be sent from the Gmail account on my browser.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please post a reply to this as soon as is possible.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            <p>I can send any size attachment on any email by logging into my Gmail account via Google, any mail sent from there no probs.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any mail with an attachment &gt;0.5gb I try and send via the app I get the error message as shown above. All my mail, with any sized attachment comes in via the app, no problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have in the last week upgraded to Windows 8.1, made the situation&nbsp;worse. My name on all e-mails leaving my computer now via the app,&nbsp;is equivalent to a Picasso file of photos I had years ago - probably 2 years - suddenly all my ,mail leaves my computer
 under that name. I have looked in SETTINGS all is ok there, cannot change the name now either, and still cant send emails with attachments. You would think Microsoft would have fixed this for 8.1.</p>

            Activesync does not have the Backup/Restore feature anymore. Your only option is to sync your Outlook Mobile data to Outlook on your PC. You will need to reinstall your applications and re-configure your device.

            When a volume license version of Office Standard or Office Professional Plus is installed on a new computer, a Start screen may appear each time you start Office. This can occur if you do not uninstall the preinstalled version of Office on the new computer before you install a volume license version of Office.
<br />Check that your version of Office uses licenses by volume and take a screenshot, anyway I share how to validate.
<br />
<br />In case it is not a volume license version, I recommend updating the Registry to remove the activation request for Office 365.
<br />
<br />Close the activation window and all Office applications.
<br />
<br />Right-click on the Start button Windows Start button in Windows 8 and Windows 10 (in the lower left corner of the screen) and select Run.
<br />
<br />Type regedit and press Enter. Select Yes when asked to open the Registry Editor.
<br />
<br />On the left side of the Registry Editor, on PC, navigate to the following registry key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ Wow6432Node \ Microsoft \ Office \ 16.0 \ Common \ OEM
<br />
<br />Right-click on the OEM value and click File&gt; Export.
<br />
<br />Save the key.
<br />
<br />After backing up the key, select Edit&gt; Delete.
<br />
<br />Repeat steps 3 through 6 for the following key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ Microsoft \ Office \ 16.0 \ Common \ OEM
<br />
<br />Close the Registry Editor and restart Office.

<p>Maybe when the windows update that scrambled all my desktop icons - again - and moved thousands of my hyperlinks in excel to the appdata folder so that none of them work, and made excel formulas not work until you hit "save," or made my pivot tables revert

            My Nokia 311 works here with an original Nokia CA-157, just retested. Please, make sure to use the file system FAT32. Because of that, your are limited to 32 GB officially. Did that help? If not, do you see the USB icon flashing in the status bar? If not,
 the cable should be changed. If you see the USB icon, which error message do you get? We need that word for word, please.

            Yeah, I want to sort alphabetically, and wondering if I could also sort numerically. Like each folder had the option for two "names" essentially, if that makes sense - I could arrange folders numerically by number, or alphabetically by an actual name.

<h2>            Comparing 2 columns, in 2 worksheets for matches, and then returning third value.</h2>
                    Help! I am really entry level to Excel, and need to create an incredibly difficult formula (difficult to me that is).&nbsp; &nbsp;I have two separate workbooks saved, I need to tell Excel to look at two different columns on the workbooks, and if a match is found,
 to then bring in the value found in a different column. I have read online many threads regarding VLOOKUP, INDEX, etc....but it is all above my head. Can anyone walk me through this kind of formula. Thank&nbsp; you in advance!

<p><span>Hi </span><span>JenniferC84</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, I suggest you can try the following steps to compare 2 columns in 2 worksheets and get a returning value:</span></p>
<p><span>1)Open your different 2 workbooks, and select one click View&gt;click View side by side to know the different columns in 2 workbooks.(workbook1 and workbook2)</span></p>
<p><span>2)Switch to workbook1 and add a worksheet(Sheet2), and copy the workbook2 contents to workbook1 Sheet2.</span></p>
<p><span>3)Click a blank cell in workbook1 and type the below formula:</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>=IF(ISNA(VLOOKUP(D2,Sheet2!$A$2:$A$19,1,FALSE)), "No", "Yes")</span></p>
<p><span>D2:</span><span style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)"><span>Is the first cell of the worksheet that you want to compare</span></span></p>
<p><span>Sheet2: Is another worksheet name that you want to compare</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Yes</span></strong><span> indicates the corresponding name exists in both sheets, and
<strong>No</strong> indicates not exist.</span></p>
<p><span>4)After you input the formula, press
<strong>Enter </strong></span><span style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)"><span>to &nbsp;execute this formula.
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)"><span>5)Then you will get the result of the formula. And drop down the result to get other result of other cells under
 this column.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Watermark in Excel that prints on each page. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richb87  say:</h3>
<h2>            Watermark in Excel that prints on each page.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an Excel sheet that is multiple pages that I am added a watermark to.&nbsp; I can use either a text box or Word art to use as a water mark.&nbsp; The issue I have is that this only prints in the area of the sheet that I place it on.&nbsp; The sheet I am working
 with is eight pages and would like the watermark to print on each page.&nbsp; I can't use the header or footer.&nbsp; Is there a way to get the watermark to print on each page without the need to place it on each page?</p>
<p>

            <p>Are you sure you're takling about a watermark?</p>
<p>A watermark generally is a background for an entire sheet and will show on every page.</p>
<p>Sounds like you are just placing a logo or similar on the sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To print the logo on each sheet you can paste the picture(logo) into row 1 then<br />
File&gt;Page Setup&gt;Sheet "rows to repeat at top" and enter $1:$1 to have the logo<br />
repeated at the top of each page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adjust the height of row 1 so's the logo fits.</p>

            <p>Formatting a cell does not require a formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, to expand, if you are entering a numeric value, Excel is not rounding it unless you have some rarely used settings in your Excel options.&nbsp; But you may only see two decimals in the cell depending on the formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To see the value that Excel is really using, select the cell and examine the formula bar.&nbsp;</p>

We bought a nokia 6300 and we are looking for the kit cark. We bought the kit cark CK-20W but is not support. The seller said the only support they have is a for all the nokia. The problem is because the cable for the connexion is free in the car.<br />
<br />
Before we could buy a support like the "MBC-15S" I thing is false because how nokia can propose a so good kit car and let's a cable free in the car....<br />

            Sounds a bid starnge. The Nokia 6300 is a good modern phone and provides Bluetooth connection. So it is no problem at all to use a carkit like CK-7W. The CK-20W would also work, but as a high featured stereo carkit it is the more expensivwe approach without
 adding more value ...<br />
My recommendation is to buy a CK-7W and get it installed for wireless handsfree.<br />
Depending on your car and car radio some installation effort is needed to connect Mute (ignition maybe, but can also be started by pressing the button)and the audio.<br />
Don´t be afraid, that works without any problems.<br />

            At some point Microsoft realized that although they make the software, they don't use it the way their customers do. Rather than beat their heads against the wall, they came to the realization that books, training sites and YouTube videos were doing a
 much better job than they were, so they sensibly stopped wasting their time.

<p>
</p><p>i have Office 365 and SharedPoint Online, i'm planning to use&nbsp;mail-enabled security group to give permission to SPO but it doesn't work like that please see below scenario:</p>

<p>Members:</p>

<p>
</p><p>-------</p>
<p>
</p><p>what i want to achieved is every time i added a member on Distribution Group it will automatically give permission to SPO but it seems it doesn't work that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i want to avoid putting permission to a O365 Group then another permission group for SPO.</p>

<p><span>Hi Harold,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A distribution group can’t be synced to SharePoint Online, you can’t give site permissions to the members in the distribution group.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To meet your requirement, I suggest you use an Office 365 group instead of a mail-enabled security group and a distribution group. When an Office 365 group is created, a team site will be created and
 the group members will have access to the site automatically.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<h3> alessio633  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Subscription Language</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I recently subscribed to Office 365 Family Premium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As all&nbsp;software I've installed&nbsp;is in English (as well as OS), I just would like to run
<strong>Office On Demand</strong> in English too.</p>
<p>But I'm unable to run <strong>Office On Demand in English</strong> from Office.com Portal. Instead it let me run streamed apps in French only!</p>
<p>Within office.com/myaccount&nbsp;all is set according to the country where I live, billing infos too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue&nbsp;appears to be linked to the language of the purchase (language of the country, that has been unique choice =&nbsp;French).</p>
<p>But that's not best choice for all customers!</p>
<p>Please let always&nbsp;users choose the language of <strong>portal GUI and of the Software</strong>,
<strong>regardless&nbsp;of the country or billing informations</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I change that?<br />

    <title>How can I create a shortcut that will paste in Visio - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I create a shortcut that will paste in Visio &#8220;Unformatted Text&#8221; directly and by-pass the pop-up window&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello Microsoft Geniuses!!</span></p>
<p><span>I am using Visio and need to copy from Word a lot of text in several tabs and text boxes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Clicking “Paste Special” or even using the improved shortcut “<strong>Crtl+Alt+V</strong>" is not efficient enough. Both will bring up a window or dialog box that requires another click or keyboard command.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>So is there a more direct way (like a shortcut, keyboard command, macro..etc) to paste “<strong>Unformatted Text</strong>”
 that skips the “Paste Special” pop-up window?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is for Visio 2016 Professional (32-bit Version 1805) on Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to your post, you have removed your credit card from your Microsoft Account&nbsp;online but it still remains on your Wallet on your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=266424" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com</a> and sign in using the same Microsoft account you use on your phone. Click
<span>Payment options</span>, and then click the card you want to delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back to your phone. In Wallet, tap <span>More(...)</span>, and then tap
<span>Refresh</span>.&nbsp;This will sync your Wallet with your Microsoft account. Tap and hold the card you want to delete and select Delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Sheena M.&nbsp;</p>

 are there. &nbsp;At some point, I just resigned myself to the issue never getting solved. &nbsp;I'm glad that it has been worked out for me, but if say, I changed my main account again, would I have the same problem that I originally faced back in 2015? &nbsp;I guess we'll
 just have to cross that bridge when we come to it. &nbsp;I hope that you get this problem somehow solved for yourself soon as I feel your pain.

            <p>It's interesting that there are four different way's you can set the color in Access, below example on setting the Background of a Textfield to Blue.</p>
<p>1. Using the Hex code # (converted by HexColor function)</p>
<p>2. Using the RGB function (color code)</p>
<p>3. Using the build-in Access color code</p>
<p>4. Using the VBA color constant</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strColor As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strR As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strG As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strB As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim HexColor As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' set Hex code for blue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strHex = "#0000FF"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'strip the leading # if it exists<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Left(strHex, 1) = "#" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strHex = Right(strHex, Len(strHex) - 1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'reverse the first two and last two hex numbers of the R G B values<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strR = Left(strHex, 2)<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strColor = strB &amp; strG &amp; strR<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HexColor = CLng("&amp;H" &amp; strColor)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' 1. Set blue with Hex code converted by HexColor function<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.txtHEX.BackColor = HexColor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' 2. Set blue with RGB function<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.txtRGB.BackColor = RGB(0, 0, 255)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.txtAccess.BackColor = 16711680<br />

<h2>            After I convert my publisher to Adobe pdf some of my hyperlinks open in a new window and some do not. </h2>
                    I am using publisher to produce a newsletter.&nbsp; I convert the publisher doc to an Adobe pdf and email it.&nbsp; Within the newsletter are links to webpages and links to files on a network drive.&nbsp; Some of the files open in a new window (after a dialog box comes
 up and asks if you want to open).&nbsp; Other files just open the pdf and then the newsletter is gone and there's no back button.&nbsp; All of the files are pdf's created from Access Reports by 'printing to pdf'.&nbsp; All of the hyperlinks were created the same way at the
 same time.&nbsp; Why do they ope differently? and...how can I make them all open the same way? Preference is a separate window.

<p>I may have an answer that will help.&nbsp; I have a newsletter that I create in Publisher.&nbsp; It contains numerous hyperlinks to both files and web pages.&nbsp; I convert it to and Adobe pdf and email it.&nbsp; When I tested my links I found that some of them opened in a
 new window and some of them opened over the newsletter.&nbsp; When they opened over the newsletter there was no way to get back to the newsletter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read through all the posts regarding this issue here and also on Acrobat.&nbsp;(Thanks for the link Mary.)&nbsp;There were lots of answers regarding inserting code that were completely foreign to me...insert it where??</p>
<p>I have finally figured out that when I select the text in Publisher and 'insert hyperlink' if I navigate to the folder where the file is stored that link will open over the newsletter.&nbsp; If I open the file that I plan to link to first, then when I insert
 hyperlink I use the 'browsed pages' window, and select the file I just opened, the link will open in a new window.</p>
<p>I hope this helps...I'm relieved to have solved my own problem. :)</p>
<p>The files that I am linking to are pdfs that are stored on a network drive for use on an intranet site.</p>
<p>I have Adobe Acrobat 8 Standard and use Windows XP with Office 2003.</p>

<h2>            Word 2016 crashes when I open from an email attachment &#40;Outlook 2016&#41; or open from a network resource</h2>
                    <p>When I open a Word document from an email attachment or a network resource, Word 2016 crashes and fails to load. Word Version is 16.0.6741.2063, OS is Windows 7. When I quit the process (after several minutes) and restart, I get the following message:<br />
<br />
"Word has detected a problem with the existing Normal.dotm. Would you like to create a new Normal.dotm?"<br />
I then either click "yes" or "no", and resume working. This happens, again, nearly every time I open in these scenarios.&nbsp;<br />
I also check Event Viewer and find this event:<br />
The program WINWORD.EXE version 16.0.6741.2063 stopped interacting with Windows and was closed. To see if more information about the problem is available, check the problem history in the Action Center control panel.<br />

            Windows 8 comes with Windows Defender which is full anti-malware protection and you don't need any additional protection. You could install other Anti-Virus that replace by Windows Defender but you shouldn't never have both at the same time.

            Windows Defender will provide enough protection to you. For additional security you can use:<br />
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HitmanPro</a> <br />
(Strongly recommended by me)</li><li><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Malwarebytes</span></span><span>(</span>Free)</a>.<br />
Note: You must download <span>Free</span> version not the Pro one as it conflict with MSE. Also, Uncheck Trial version of 14 days after installing it.</span></li><li><span><a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>SUPERAntispyware</span>(Free)</a></span></li></ol>
<p>You should never use two Real Time Protection softwares like Malwarebytes Pro or Trial (but you can use Free version), SUPERAntiSpyware Professional (again, you can use Free version). Some more clarification here:</p>

            As I said, Windows Defender provides enough protection. But it is also true that nothing is perfect in this world, no antivirus can provide full security. Some threats may be there that Windows Defender can miss, some SUPERAntiSpyware (SAS) will miss.
 Weekly scanning with SAS decrease chances of threats a lot. But I trust HitmanPro more than SAS, HitmanPro uses multiple antivirus definition.<br />

Not exactly the same. Windows Defender antimalware engine uses heuristics to help detect threats that are not yet specifically defined in a manner similar to HitmanPro Alert. The main difference being that HitmanPro Alert is a browser based security program.
 Internet Explorer uses Smart Screen Filter in conjunction with Windows Defender to protect browsing integrity.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-defender#1TC=t1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Defender and Windows SmartScreen fight viruses and other malware</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malwarebytes AntiExploit<strong> </strong>also helps defend browser integrity but functions differently than HitmanPro Alert.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important to realize that both products are in Beta and conflicts and bugs may be present. That bieng said Windows Defender and the Win 8 operating system security are constantly being refined/developed to provide the best
<em>integrated </em>protection possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FWIW I've tried both and HitmanPro Alert is my preference at this time. Apparently Alert will soon be incorporated into HitmanPro Ma;ware Scanner. For updates check the support thread

            I personally use Microsoft Defender on my Windows 8 PC alone and it has provided me adequate cover as i have never had any virus attack or malware on my PC. Keep it updated always and it can be able to provide you with good cover.

Well this helped me better.. Actually i was asking this because I am bit confused..
<div>see i have&nbsp;<b>Windows Defender</b>&nbsp;and to above suggestions i have installed&nbsp;<b>HitmanPro</b>&nbsp;and i also have downloaded setups of&nbsp;<b>Anti Exploit</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>HMP alert</b>.. And what i need to know is that do i need any of these two (HMP Alert and Anti
 Exploit)? Or It is provided by the ones which i have installed on my PC?</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>If yes then which one should i prefer. That's all :p</div>
<div><br />
<div>And yes again as i told, i use google chrome, so i wont be using smart screen filter in IE10.</div>
