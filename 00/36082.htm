<h2>            SD card not working in Win 10</h2>
                    Since installing November update/upgrade on Win 10 - the SD card doesn't work. I've got the settings for autoplay at 'ask me every time' but no options are displayed when inserting the card into the reader.&nbsp; Everything worked fine before the update.&nbsp; Has
 anyone a solution please?

            Perhaps there's a media card reader driver that is not installed after the update. &nbsp;Might be worth going to the PC manufacturer's website, go to their support/drivers section and see if they have anything for your model related to the media card reader.

            <p>This page on Lenovo's website has the drivers for the H330 model series.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/products/desktops-and-all-in-ones/lenovo-h-series-desktops/lenovo-h330-desktop?c=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/products/desktops-and-all-in-ones/lenovo-h-series-desktops/lenovo-h330-desktop?c=1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After you visit that link, choose "Camera and card Reader" in the drop down here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b205061-1d24-44f2-9e13-b677809dc071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b205061-1d24-44f2-9e13-b677809dc071" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you will notice they haven't built a Windows 10 version of that driver. That's quite alright, just choose the newest one available.&nbsp; In almost all cases it will work the same as it did before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that being said, Lenovo keeps a list of every computer that they made that can get Windows 10, and I'm sorry to say that the H330 model series is not on their list:&nbsp;
<a href="https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/ht103535" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Lenovo Supported Systems for Windows 10</a>.&nbsp; In this situation, upgrading to Windows 10 will void you warranty because Lenovo does not approve of the upgrade.&nbsp; So depending on your expertise and willingness to waive your support, you may want to go back to
 the operating system that Lenovo officially supports on that PC.</p>

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and we will provide the assistance required to help you resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>Are you trying to build an image using 3D builder app from Windows Store? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are referring to the 3D builder available in Store, you can just download many kinds of 3D files and edit them using the 3D modeling space. Take a picture with your webcam and make it 3D. Personalize 3D files by embossing your name, or combine models
 and pieces to make something new.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using this app you can build and print 3D&nbsp;images, you will not be charged for the images as they will be downloaded by you. In a scenario where you do not have a 3D printer, you can order a professional-quality print of your model from inside the app and
 it’ll be sent to you by the 3D Systems Cubify service which you might be charged for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the article <strong>How to use 3D Builder and 3D Scan for Windows</strong> provided in the link below and check if it helps</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/how-to-use-3d-builder-and-3d-scan-for-windows#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/how-to-use-3d-builder-and-3d-scan-for-windows#v1h=tab01</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps&nbsp;</p>

<p>You bought a Lenovo.</p>
<p>Well, that wasn't the best idea. The good folks in China who make those things seem to have problems staying current with their drivers so that their system can work well with the latest version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing they REALLY don't like is Windows Antivirus Security Center. Mostly because of all the spyware their government insists they include with every computer they manufacture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have heard of Superfish, Lenovo Customer Feedback Program 64, Lenovo Service Engine, and others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that's another story and you can Bing or Google them when you have some free time.</p>

<p>Learn Ubuntu and ditch MS. Every update from MS that I have ever added has screwed up my computers. Ubuntu is a much more secure system and goes to the same internet as MS. I have ONE program I have found that does not work with Ubuntu, and that is High
 Creteria Total Recorder. I asked and they said they have no intention at this time to make it compatible for Linux systems. I hope they change there mind when they find that more and more people are FED UP with MS and are moving away from it.</p>
<p>Give it up, MS will never change, they just keep getting worse and worse!</p>
<p>By the way I'm using Ubuntu side of my HDD right now. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS good for 5 years. The next LTS upgrade will be in April 2018.</p>

            My issue is that I have a Dell XPS and I am forced to upgrade by Microsoft to upgrade. When I upgrade half my applications crash including Internet Explorer that get stuck trying to install. Support has no clue on how to fix it but to reinstall Windows
 from scratch. Can someone explain this? The present build I am on runs great, but twice a day I have to restore to my old build or stop the upgrade.

            just more problems. MS doesn't care for tis clients and makes getting help almost impossible.&nbsp; I wanted update features fixed so they update but MS won't even pay attention.&nbsp; Feature 1709 and others aren't updating and the MS company won't help or talk.&nbsp;
 it took 3 hours to get my password accepted and now it is been 45 days and hours of disappointment because th4e update that won't update makes all W10 updates stop and slow and not update in a reasonable period of time. if you ant costumers and clients start
 paying attention to them in a reasaonable length of time like minutes instead of days. and people to start with instead of dumb robot agents that can't understand even the serial number of the updates.

            I have had the same kind of problems with MS for years and I finally gave up. I'm in the process of changing 5 computers over to Ubuntu. I have been running Ubuntu 12.04LTS then upped to 16.04LTS since 2014 on an old HP Compaq Presario C302nr and it's
 still going strong.<br />
This computer I'm using right now I have just installed Ubuntu 16.04 and it is running fine.<br />
I was going to install along side Win 10 but could not get that to work, so I just replaced Win 10 completely.
<br />
I have been using Ubuntu since 2005 on old Dell computers and it worked fine.<br />
If you get FED UP enough with MS, then I trust someday you will bite the bullet and make the switch.<br />
I hate MS because the easy way for them to fix things is to say re-install the Windows system and start over from scratch. That is not an answer.<br />
Ubuntu also has a world of help at Ask Ubuntu, where thousands of questions have been answered and there is plenty of help at the site. Their first thought is to fix the issue, not re-install everything and start over.<br />
MS problems continue to increase with no solution in sight, but I have found the best one for me and the computers that I have to maintain is Ubuntu.<br />
By the way I use Ubuntu and it works for me but there many other flavors of Linux operating systems to choose from, just Google Linux operating systems and read what might work best for you.<br />
Here are just a few:<br />
<div>
<div>

<h2>            Windows 7 Anytime upgrade key not valid - but I know it is</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just bought a new Lenova ideapad with Windows 7 Home Premium on it. Bought from reputable supplier new (Dabs.com).&nbsp;I have activated Windows 7 and it's all genuine. I've done updates also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought from Amazon (so assume it's genuine) upgrade from Home Premium to Professional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've followed the instructions and entered the upgrade key from the card. The answer that I get is that the key is not valid. I've checked it many times and am sure that I've typed it in correctly. I've checked the product and it's definately upgrade from
 Home Premium to Professional. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do I do now?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope someone can help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
                </div>

<h2>            Xbox 360 charging cord not working&#47;acting bizarre&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I bought the charging kit about a year ago so I understand that it is a little "old" in electronics age. The cord is a nyko brand and it came with 2 replacement battery packs. So far I have had no issue with the charging cord, but recently it just stopped
 working altogether. When I plug the cord into either usb port on my xbox or into the charging dock (also nyko bought recently (last week I believe)), the cord flashes (either red or green but most of the time flashes green) and then proceeds to not work. It
 is as though the controller recognizes that the charger is there, but does not allow for the battery to be charged. This occurs in the three controllers I own. It also allows for the controller to be played with when the battery is removed completely, but
 if the battery is installed, the charger acts as though the controller is not connected and stops working again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The charger will not charge any of the 4 battery packs I own (the two bought recently and the two that are a little over a year old). I have owned the xbox for about 2 years now, but it was given to me as a gift from a friend who just bought a new xbox 360,
 and therefore I believe to be roughly 6+ years old. The behavior from the charging cord is quite bizarre in my opinion, but I figured I would ask the help of those more versed in the xbox world. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If any other information is necessary, please feel free to ask as well.</p>

            <p>It is entirely possible that the issue lays with the batteries. &nbsp;If you tried to charge them without waiting for them to be fully drained they would develop what is known as a "Charge Memory". &nbsp;This means that each time you try the batteries would charge a little less until finally they wouldn't charge at all.</p>
<p>The issue here though is that the Nyko system is a 3rd party system that Xbox does not support so not much is known about 3rd party items would normally interact with the console. &nbsp;I would recommend seeing if the cable would work on a friends console to rule out console issues.</p>

<h2>            Matshita DVD-Ram Uj8e1 not working&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a problem here where my Matshita DVD-RAm uj8e1 isn't working properly.</p>
<p>I was going to watch a movie so I popped in a disc, but it's not reading it.</p>
<p>I checked the Device Manager where it stated Code 19 "Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged."</p>
<p>I have tried uninstalling and it said the driver was up to date.</p>
<p>It was working probably two weeks ago until I updated my Windows recently.</p>
<p>Is there a driver I can install for it so it can work properly? Or something else?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h3> stevechapdelaine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Associated D&#58;&#92; to Music folder by mistake</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to transfer my Music folder to the D:\ but I thought it would create the folder automatically. &nbsp;So now my Music folder points to D:\ and I can't revert it back. &nbsp;Is there a fix for this? This is for Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>What I did:</p>
<p>Click on File Explorer on taskbar near Start button</p>
<p>Right click Music folder and select properties</p>
<p>Select Location tab and clicked on Move...</p>
<p>Browsed to the D:\ and clicked on Select Folder (somehow thinking Music folder would be created)</p>
<p>But instead now, the Music folder is like the D:\ drive</p>
<p>Tried to reverse it but when I try to move Music folder to a newly manually created Music folder created on D:\</p>
<p>It says "Can't redirect parent into a child" which makes sense.</p>
<p>So, how do I fix this mistake? &nbsp;Anyone?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You most likely need to do this from the folders original location, which should be in your USER folder, along with Videos and stuff...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should still be Music Folder there (hidden maybe), or most likely a folder named D:\...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on it and select Restore Default... When asked if you want to move your files back also, select NO... the process will fail if you select yes... You will need to copy them back manually, or just copy them&nbsp;to the NEW music folder you create later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to return the Music to it's original location before you try to Relocate it again..</p>

<h2>            HP ProDesk 600 GI SFF running slow on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: HP ProDesk 600 GI SFF</p>
<p>I understand that I have a small desktop and I do not know very much about computers. I would like to know if there is a way to make this computer a little faster, I hooked up a security camera and I can get a picture but there isn't enough power to zoom
 or pan left or right, when I try to pan it takes a few minutes to move what used to take seconds on my old computer. I use this computer for home use, basic surfing the web, email and a security camera. Is there anything that I could do to this desk top to
 give it more power? I can't afford to purchase a better computer right now. I didn't think it would hurt to ask. Please excuse my wording, I'm sure that I'm asking this wrong, like I said , I don't know very much about computers, I'm learning I would appreciate
 any help that I can get. Thank you very much. A person owed me some money and couldn't pay so he gave me this computer, I upgraded to windows 10 when I got it around three weeks ago, I had to take it into a repair shop when I got it and I was charged $145.00
 to have a used hard drive installed, before it wouldn't even turn on. Thanks again.</p>

<h3> skatfixit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 updates deletes my audio output device on HP laptop</h2>
                    <p>I have HP Spectre 64bit laptop that came with Windows 10 and is less than a year old.&nbsp; Every time windows installs a new update, my audio output device, which is Bang &amp; Olufsen speaker, disappears.&nbsp; I have to use HP Recovery Manager to reinstall Audio Driver,
 which is somehow deleted by Windows update.&nbsp; The driver name that is getting deleted is Conexant High-Definition (HD) Audio Driver version 9.0.69.0.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me, it looks like a defect in Windows 10 update software.&nbsp; It is extremely annoying and should not be happening.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way for me to prevent windows updates from deleting my audio output device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Microsoft, you need to fix this defect!&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Wrong keyboard layout in login page after update to 1607 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fr&#233;d&#233;ricbousquet&#40;&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong keyboard layout in login page after update to 1607</h2>
                    <p>There use to be a bug that was then fixed, but after I updated Windows 10 to 1607 this week, it's back :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two accounts on my desktop. One is mine and I use an AZERTY layout for the keyboard. The other account uses a QWERTY layout, since the person can touch type and knows only QWERTY. Before the update to 1607, changing the account in the login page
 would change the keyboard layout, meaning that I would type my password in AZERTY but if the other person wants to log in, she would be able to type her password in QWERTY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the login page is always defaulting to AZERTY, so she has to change it manually before she can enter her password. This leads to frustration since she is used to Windows changing the keyboard layout automatically when she types her password, so her password
 gets rejected and THEN she realises she has to change the layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once she's logged in, the layout changes to QWERTY since it's her account default keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how to report this to Microsoft :-(</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Mohan Babu ER,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I checked in Settings. I have French defined as my language. The other account has English.</p>
<p>&nbsp; As for the keyboard layouts, my account has, in this order: French (AZERTY), English (QWERTY), a third layout. The other account has English (QWERTY), the third layout, then French.</p>
<p>&nbsp; When I am logged in, my Windows is in French, and the French keyboard is selected: OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp; When the other account is logged in, Windows is in English, and the English keyboard is selected: OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; However, on the login screen, if my account is selected, the French keyboard is selected. If I click on the other account to select it instead, the keyboard layout does not switch to English, I have to select it manually (2 clicks, 1st on "FRA", then choose
 "ENG" in the list). Before the update, the layout on the login screen would match the one defined for the selected account, so it would change from AZERTY to QWERTY if I selected the second account, and would change back to AZERTY if I then selected my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frédéric</p>

            <p>I have a similar problem after updating to 1607. Normally I use Google Japanese Input to type in both English and Japanese with a keyboard layout called Colemak.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However after updating to Anniversary Edition if I try to type English in Cortana search or any 'Windows 10 app' style program it uses qwerty. If I type Japanese it still uses the colemak layout, but if I use Japanese Input's 'direct input' to type English
 it uses qwerty layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have done is add English (United States) with colemak layout as an additional language. I can use that to type English with colemak layout in Cortana search. But that's really not my preferred set up to have this extra IME loaded in my PC.

<p>
</p><p>2. Open Notifications panel (in the tray), select All settings, then follow:</p>

<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp;Welcome screen and new user accounts settings dialog will appear, showing your settings, Welcome screen settings and new user settings. Control the copy process with the checkboxes below the report (under "Copy your settings to:"). Press OK to copy the

                    <p>Posting as I was not able to find this reported before.</p>
<p>Using Win 10 (updated to fall creators update) and have since noticed issues with photo import from iPhone. While it worked reasonably well in the past, now, photos taken since the last import are not recognized by the App. All the old photos (already imported)
 are showing as available for import, though.</p>

<p>Hi, I tried the above steps without success. I also engaged Apple support that felt this was due to photos backing up in iCloud, though, this I have been doing for years and never had these issues. I also noted that the photos missing are those added to
 the iPhone library since the last time I used Windows Photo App to import the photos, and up to the point when I backed up my Phone in the iTunes. I have since taken 4 new photos and these are now showing in the Photo App as available for import.</p>

            Initially it did not, gave me the same issue as the App, but then it did. I cannot really point to anything I did to explain this difference, aside for maybe running the CCleaner app. Anyhow, I also tried to see if backing up iPhone on iTunes made a difference
 (as I could have linked not recognized photos to those taken between the last Photo app import and iTunes backup), but that did not replicate the issue. So, as of now, App is working. I will post back if issue arises again and I have more data on what might
 be able to fix it.

                    <p>I purchased a new Gateway laptop few weeks ago.&nbsp; When I first turned it on (and continues), a very high-pitched shrill comes through the speakers.&nbsp; It enables a microphone sound for a short time, at every place I go to in the computer. The sound is&nbsp;enhanced
 by&nbsp;just&nbsp;touching the moitor! &nbsp;I have tried adjusting all volume controls but not sure what else to try.&nbsp; It continues with or without anything playing or even in the CD/DVD port.&nbsp; Please guide me how to eliminate this high shrill sound.&nbsp; I have never played
 a cd/dvd yet because the volume must stayed turned way down or it is shrill!</p>

            <p>It could be a few things, but I suggest you just contact Gateway for replacement/repair - if it's new you should not have to put up a faulty system when you've paid good money for it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Фризит &#40;лагает&#41; Fable 3 на xbox360</h2>
                    
<p>купил через консоль в маркете &nbsp;Fable 3, загрузил, начал играть и началось: первый ролик, где посыпается принц: фигуры смазываются, то есть &nbsp;человек сделал движение, а за ним потянулся след предыдущего движения, ну думаю наверно ролики такие, но нет, дальше
 по ходу игры точно так же: переходишь на бег фигура смазывается, так же смазываются и текстуры зданий, комнат и других персов, не знаю так и должно быть?! играю через HDMI кабель</p>

<p>Эта технология называется "Blur" (блюр). Посмотрите видео на Youtube и сравните, как это должно выглядить и как это выглядит у вас (при поиске видео на ютубе, не забудьте добавить "Xbox 360", так как игра также доступна на PC)</p>

            <p><span>Hi Martin,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When did you get the blue screen error?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try to boot in safe mode and check what happens. To boot in safe mode follow the link given below.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to perform system restore if you are able to boot to the desktop in safe mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To perform a safe mode, follow the steps given below.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click Next.
</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click Finish.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state, programs and updates you installed are removed.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more information follow the link given below.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>System Restore: frequently asked questions</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you are not able to boot in safe mode then try to perform system restore in Windows Recovery Environment.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the Windows 7 DVD, restart the&nbsp;computer and boot from DVD.&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Install Now screen select Repair my computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select System Restore from the list given.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Follow the on-screen instruction and check if you are able to restore your computer to an earlier point.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>If you are able to boot to the desktop, you may also try to run a check disk for the drives and let it repair them.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.&nbsp; Click Start, type cmd in the Start Search box, right-click cmd.exe in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.&nbsp; At a command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Chkdsk /R X: </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note: In this command, X: is a placeholder that represents the drive letter of the volume that you want to check.&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.&nbsp; Press Y when you are prompted to check the disk the next time that the system restarts.&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.&nbsp; Close all applications, and then restart the computer. </span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note: During the restart process, Windows checks the disk for errors, and then Windows starts.&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.&nbsp; After the computer restarts, repeat steps 1 through 4 for the other volume, and then rerun the backup operation.&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>For more additional information follow the link given below.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Check a drive for errors</span></strong></span></span></p>

I am paying for 30 Mbps high speed internet but I don't reach anywhere close to that. I am an intermediate user of computers so I know the basics of figuring out problems on my laptop. My laptop has Windows 7 and is a Dell 1545 Inspiron. I was told I may have
 to purchase an N-Router card but when I checked the info about what is in the computer it says I have the capability to reach 54Mbps. I'm confused...please help....<br />

            Hello faerygyrl34,
<div><br />
<div>At home I have a 25meg connection down and I typically see download speed of 2-2.5mb when downloading files via either wired or wireless.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's been my normal rule that you divide the connection speed by 10 and that is normally your download speed in real world performance.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This has to do with the difference between megabytes and megabits. A megabit is roughly one tenth the information of a megabyte.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>You internet provider is advertising 30 megabits but you will only download at 3 megabytes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Does that make sense? It can be rather confusing.</div>

<h2>            OneDrive 18.44.301.6 crashes at offset 0x0003ec22</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive was indefinitely syncing some files (images) - in the report they were never progressing from 0 kB synced of x kB, so I thought I should restart OneDrive.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, this resulted in a fatal exception being thrown:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Faulting application name: OneDrive.exe, version: 18.44.301.6, time stamp: 0x5ab572b3<br />
Faulting module name: OneDrive.exe, version: 18.44.301.6, time stamp: 0x5ab572b3<br />
Exception code: 0xc0000409<br />
Fault offset: 0x0003ec22<br />
</p>
<p>Hopefully this is valuable data for the product team so that they can investigate why OneDrive was indefinitely syncing some files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some details of my setup:</p>
<p>- OS: 10.0.16299</p>
<p>- Office: Office 365 ProPlus version 1803 build 9126.2116 Click-to-Run</p>
<p>- Virus scanner: AVG 18.3.3051</p>
<p>- Backup software: Connected Backup PC</p>
<p>- OneDrive profile: 85 GB; 100,000+ JavaScript files; 30 GB+ of images</p>

            Hi Carlintveld,
<br />
<br />Can you confirm if there is any file syncrhonizing correclty to OneDrive online? If yes lets try to completely remove OneDrive client and re-install it back
<br />
<br />To completely uninstall OneDrive: 
<br />1. Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode: Right-click on the Windows icon in the taskbar and select Command Prompt (Admin). 
<br />2. Type in taskkill /f /im OneDrive.exe to terminate any OneDrive processes and hit Enter. 
<br />Then type in either %SystemRoot%\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 32-bit Windows 10 or %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 64-bit Windows 10 and hit Enter. 
<br />
<br />
<br />After that Go to RegEdit on this path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive 
<br />You can remove all folders that include One Drive version 
<br />Account folders also can be removed 
<br />After that restart the pc and install One Drive again
<br />
<br />
<br />Let know if works

            <p>Hi b79zan,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to “Converting wpl playlists to m3u playlists “in your favorite browser. This is not a feature offered natively in WMP12,if you want to convert the playlist,
 then you need to use your favorite search engine and search for the converter.

<h2>            Service info is unavailable</h2>
                    
<p>So I hadn't turned on my Xbox One in over 30days, I booted up and it received an update, which installed successfully.&nbsp; But after that I couldn't sign into Xbox Live.&nbsp; I Test my connection, and I get "It's all good" Your console is connected to the internet.&nbsp;
 I test the multiplayer connection, and I get "It's all good" There are no problems with your connection for multiplayer.&nbsp; I select Detailed Network Statistics, and I get Download Speed - 16.43 Mbps Upload Speed - 5.73 Mbps Packet Loss 0% MTU 1480 and Latency
 at 61 ms.&nbsp; I've Powercycled the Xbox One 3 times via the steps on the support page.&nbsp; I've rebooted my network twice (powercycled modem and router) but still get Service info is unavailable in the Xbox One network screen.&nbsp; I get no discernible error code, just
 that message.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Yup. I'm getting the same thing. I tried hard resetting, clearing cache, alternate mac address and my account, cant get my account so I did a factory reset and it wont update cause it's say it isn't connected to the internet and when I test my connection
 it says it's all good. This is very frustrating.</p>

<p>I have the same problem, it was working fine 3 hours ago, I go out, come back to play some Forza and it just says "Connect to Xbox Live" on the right hand side of "Home" even though I've got the "Everything is good" when I troubleshot my network ? I'd be
 ok with this if we got a notification about it ! This is not acceptable !</p>
