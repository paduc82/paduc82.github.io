<h2>            Route mail via Office 365 while MX ispointed to On Prem Exchange Servers in a Hybrid Scenario</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a Hybrid environment setup and currently the mail routing is done (MX records Pointed to On Prem Servers) via the&nbsp;On Prem&nbsp;Exchange Servers. However, we need to configure some application servers to route email directly via Office 365 and not route
 them via On Prem Servers.&nbsp; What is the best way of doing this while in Hybrid mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi Dileepa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your requirement "However, we need to configure some application servers to route email directly via Office 365 and not route them via On Prem Servers.", if you mean SMTP Relay and send emails from Office 365, you can use Client Submission or SMTP Relay
 no matter where your MX record is pointed.</p>
<p>Here are the detailed steps:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-to-set-up-a-multifunction-device-or-application-to-send-email-using-Office-365-69f58e99-c550-4274-ad18-c805d654b4c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-to-set-up-a-multifunction-device-or-application-to-send-email-using-Office-365-69f58e99-c550-4274-ad18-c805d654b4c4</a></p>
<p>If I misunderstood you, please tell me your detailed requirements and your meaning for "some application servers" and "to route email directly via Office 365", we will do further analysis for you.</p>
<p>

<h2>            VBA help to add standard text to notes view of current slide</h2>
                    <p>I am working with a PowerPoint template for use as an elearning storyboard. Through internet searching I almost have the code I need (I am a non-coder ... gleaning info through the generosity of others more brainy than me!) but there are two changes I need
 to get to where I want to.</p>
<ol>
<li>I need it to select the <em>current slide.</em> At the moment I don't know what I need to replace here:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Set Sl = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)</strong> to change it from always putting the notes on slide 1.<br />

    <title>Major issues with ALL my lumia phones on Windows 10 Mobile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moma7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Major issues with ALL my lumia phones on Windows 10 Mobile</h2>
                    <p>I currently am having major issues with my 3 windows phones. On a daily and constant basis, i.e. multiple times every times I use it, I am having Restarts, Resuming, Loading. Occasionally and daily, blank screen (just the top and bottom visible) and then
 a frozen phone with requires a battery take out, and occasionally SD card error after one of the&nbsp;restart. This happens when checking email, on websites, using an app, etc. A lot of lag when opening apps and sites and frequent frozen page which only scrolls
 after a wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Started with Lumia 830, and got a Lumia 640 to try the W10M OS. Then got the Lumia 640 XL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem really started just before the anniversary update and has progressively gone worse on the XL, which is my current daily phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking this was&nbsp;a bad device, I went back to the 640, but to my surprise had the same problem. Then tried 830 after ATT upgraded the firmware and OS to W10M. Again, surprisingly had the same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done soft resets, hard resets, device recovery, SD card replacement, SIM card replacement, deleted many apps, changed my MS account, with no change in the issues mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now at a stage where the phone is only useable for texting and calls (quaint idea). Any other activity results in the same problems mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the issue is happening across different devices, and given the replacement of SD card&nbsp;and SIM card, I am convinced that it is not a hardware defect. I am now for the first time considering&nbsp;giving up on the windows OS after being with it since the beginning.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My preference is not to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So any suggestions as to what may be happening and potential fix will be greatly appreciated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surprising and baffling is I have not seen anything online regarding similar issues all happening at the same time, unless those have already jumped ship. A family member is also having the same issue and is thinking of going to the fruit fone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is relatively urgent since I have been dealing with this for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS folks, you MUST jump in with a solution&nbsp;as this is very serious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for the suggestion. There is no location close by.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did call MS Support yesterday, and they were unable to help at all other than saying that the hardware needs to be replaced/repaired. Even suggested I take it to the local MS store. Having dealt with them, that is not an option as I am not impressed with
 their ability to diagnose and fix complex issues. Finally Support suggested that since there is no telephone support for Mobile, I should post on this Community for MS developers to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, I am trying another approach that came to mind today:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do a reset, install without my MS account, and connect via Wi-Fi. </p>
<p>Just started that a few hours ago on the secondary phone as a test. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not install my many email accounts, nor any apps other than the ones that came with the initial install.
</p>
<p>That seems to work without a hitch, given not as robust a test. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then added my primary email, to see what would happen, making sure not to include that email to sign into my MS account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That also lead to my contacts and calendar coming in. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So far as of right now no issue with usage, but again limited to just using my email, built in apps and one or two websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try out tonight or tomorrow to add&nbsp;my MS account to access the Store, OneDrive and Photos. Docs etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that survives, will add all my apps and configure as I have it set on&nbsp;my primary phone, to see if the issues crops up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, back to adding my other emails, one at a time and test each for a day and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that leads to either isolating the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions and help will be appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">UPDATE as of 9/15/16 9pmEST</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the approach outlined above. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Added my MS account, a new one vs the original one (the price is that I no longer have access to all apps purchased).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After no issues, added all free apps and site links that I use frequently or wish to have access to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did that without a recurrence of the problems I have been having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then started adding back my other email accounts (all of them MS emails) except my original MS account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately my problems started again. This led me to the conclusion that one of my email accounts is seriously impacting the workings of my phone. Why, I am not sure. Should not, but it appears to have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To determine which email account&nbsp;was the culprit, I went about deleting them one by one, until the phone stabilized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the phone stabilized, I added the emails that were not implicated back</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far so good. Will update if all goes OK or if I see same issues crop up in the next day or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The larger issue for MS developers to determine is why a live.com email, as I see it,&nbsp;is linked to the cause of the problems I have been dealing with and has lead to some significant downtime.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>UPDATE as of 9/16/16 at 7:45am EST</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the same issues have surfaced again this morning. 2 reboots in 15 minutes, one refresh&nbsp;and one Resuming that has frozen the phone, and required&nbsp;taking out of the battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to square one. It seems there may be some link to email/MS accounts and the number of them that can be added to the phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>UPDATE as of 9/21/16</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have continued trying out different approaches to solve my problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking it may be my MS account, or too many apps, or too many background apps being used and even maps on SD card contributing to this problem has proven wrong. Interestingly many of my problems happen when I am on the internet, though not solely, so I
 cannot pin it on that either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect this has to do with some background activity that is creating a problem, given that this is occurring on different devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Flirted with idea of trying out Lumia 950/950XL, thinking more RAM and better processor may help, though cannot justify additional investment given the uncertainty of fixing the issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have purchased an android phone, and am currently setting it up and testing and configuring to make it useable and as close to how I have become used to with W10M.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not yet officially moved on to android, but almost there, unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>UPDATE as of 9/28/16</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After trying my best to isolate the cause of my issues, I am now leaning towards the Edge browser as the culprit and its constant resume, refresh and even that it cannot load after one of the many resumes/reloads. That often leads to the black screen
 and a reboot. Given that I am a big user of the web and use it to pin many sites as a substitute for missing apps, it is a big deal.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It has to be related to either some setting or sites, but I have not been able to pin it down.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If anyone has any thoughts on this, I am happy to look into it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sadly, I am officially starting the transition to an Android phone today.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have just taken out the sim from my W10M and put it into the Android. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's see how it works out. </span></p>

    <title>Replaying Videos in powerpoint 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christophercooke9519  say:</h3>
<h2>            Replaying Videos in powerpoint 2016</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>quick question, can you automatically replay a video that has already been watched.</p>

<p>I have a looping presentation built for interaction. The viewer can choose which video to watch from a selection screen. ( this is a single video made up of many videos.) over the top are transparent shapes with hypelinks to different sections of the presentation.
 once the chosen video has been watched it moves to the next slide (Which is a splash screen that loops by its self until touched.) &nbsp;this then moves back to the selection screen video, but because it has already been seen it doesn't auto play :-( &nbsp; Is there
 away to make it auto play?&nbsp;</p>

<p>any help would be grateful.</p>

<p>thanks</p>
<p>Chris.</p>

    <title>My Notes have all vanished - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evangelist6589  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Notes have all vanished</h2>
                    For some strange out of the world reason Outlook has decided to delete and or hide all my Notes in Outlook as none are showing up on the screen. I never had this problem in Entourage 2004 and my notes are from that database. I did rebuild the identity
 database but the issue has not yet been resolved. Since Outlook is no longer causing problems where it won't quit (my former issue) and I am not having any other problems besides this one at this time, I may have to take this as a loss and a consequence for
 relying on MS for important information. MS is unreliable and I am using the Apple Notes app these days.&nbsp;

            <b>If you turn off iCloud sync in System Preferences for Contacts</b>, you can sync to Outlook. It's not always reliable and can result in duplicates or even deleted data. I would export contacts as .olm file in Outlook and export from Apple Contacts before

Open Outlook Preferences &gt; Sync Services and check to sync to Apple Contacts.<br />

            I'm assuming these notes are not Exchange but "On My Computer" notes.<br />
<br />
You can select to import just your notes again from Entourage so you'll have your old ones at least.<br />
<br />
If you look in Data Records folder &gt; Notes, drill down and see if you see your notes in the Identity prior to rebuilding. If you see the notes here it's possible they could be recovered. If you did Time Machine backups, we could see about recovered Notes from
 an Identity just prior to the rebuild date.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities/your identity/Data Records<br />
<br />
If you are still using Outlook, I suggest you move to a new Identity. I never trust a rebuilt Identity to not still have issues.
<a href="http://www.officeformachelp.com/2012/05/how-to-move-your-data-to-a-new-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to move your data to a new Identity</a><br />
<br />
<b>Rebuild Basics:<br />
</b><br />
<ul>
<li>Do Not Rebuild Identities with Exchange and IMAP accounts. Delete the accounts (this deletes the cache files in Outlook). Do the rebuild then add back accounts. Better yet start over in a new Identity. If the rebuild does not work then you could sync unwanted
 changes or deletions to your server and lose data.</li><li>No folder should have over 2GB of data. See tip below.</li><li>Make sure you have plenty of free space on your drive. Make sure that you have at least three times as much hard disk space available as the current size of your Outlook identity PLUS 10% free for virtual memory.</li><li>Rebuilding does not fix all issues. It can make some problems worse. Even though the Database Utility will make a backup, I advise making a copy in the Finder first.</li><li>You can delete the rebuild version after you are satisfied with the results. This copy will be named like this: Main Identity [Backed up 1-21-2012 13.35]&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<br />
Tip: If your Identity will open, before you rebuild, check "On My Computer"Inbox and Sent folders to be sure they are under the 2GB limit. Generally this is less than 10,000 messages but with large attachments could be less. Make subfolders e.g. Inbox 2011,
 Inbox 2010, Sent 2011, Sent 2010 etc to help reduce the number of messages in a folder. (Check for any large archive folders you might have in addition to Inbox and Sent).<br />

<h2>            Restricting users to see only their data after logging in&#47;registering on form</h2>
                    I have two forms (Login &amp; Registration). Whenever a new user registers I don't want them to have access to the other users' database. How would I go about creating an empty database for each new user and then allow them to save their information and it
 still be there when they log back on?

<h2>            Removing slide numbers from PowerPoint notes pages using VBA</h2>
                    <p>Using VBA in PowerPoint 2010 SP1, I am trying to remove the slide number from a notes page, something that is easily done from the Ribbon UI. A simplified version of my code looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ActivePresentation.Slides(i).NotesPage.HeadersFooters.Header.Visible = <span>False</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>where i is the slide I am working on.<br />
</p>
<p>and the result I get is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run-time error '-2147188160 (80048240)':</p>
<p>Slide (unknown member) : Invalid request. This action is not supported for notes pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide.<strong>NotesPage</strong> Property&nbsp;Returns a <strong>SlideRange</strong> object that represents the notes pages for the specified slide or range of slides (Read-only).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>The following properties and methods will fail if applied to a <strong>SlideRange</strong> object that represents a notes page:
<strong>Copy</strong> method, <strong>Cut</strong> method, <strong>Delete</strong> method,
<strong>Duplicate</strong> method, <strong>HeadersFooters</strong> property, <strong>
Hyperlinks</strong> property, <strong>Layout</strong> property, <strong>PrintSteps</strong> property,
<strong>SlideShowTransition</strong> property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And&nbsp;<strong>SlideRange</strong> object&nbsp;in PowerPoint is a collection&nbsp;that represents a notes page or a slide range, which is a set of slides that can contain as little as a single slide or as much as all the slides in a presentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is to say, <strong>SlideRange</strong> object contains <strong>Slide</strong>(s) object, so when you use:</p>
<p>ActivePresentation.<strong>Slides</strong>(i).NotesPage.HeadersFooters.Header.Visible =
<span>False</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You will get&nbsp;the error message (Invalid request. This action is not supported for notes pages.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you want to remove slide numbers form all slides in PPT,<span> please use the following code:</span></span></p>
<p><span>Sub RemoveHeadersFooters()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim sld As Slide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each sld In ActivePresentation.Slides<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sld.HeadersFooters.Clear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next<br />
End Sub</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>PS:</span></p>
<p><span>The macro <strong>RemoveHeadersFooters </strong>will remove all&nbsp;headers&nbsp;and footers&nbsp;including slide numbers after running.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Cheers,</span></p>
<p><span>Cristin</span></p>

            <p>Cristin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the explanation.But I'm really no closer to a solution. Your sample code deletes the headers &amp; footers from the slides themselves, not the notes pages. It seems that note page SlideRanges are quite limited and do not have much of the functionality
 available in the GUI, specifically the Header and Footers dialog. Moreover, using the NotesMaster does not allow me to manipulate what is happening on an individual note page.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;when I use NotesMaster like below:</p>
<p>/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p>
<p>ActivePresentation.NotesMaster.Delete</p>
<p>/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p>
<p>It gives me the same&nbsp;error you mentioned.</p>

    <title>Access - Reports - text is being cut off in report fields.....is there - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikeking63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access - Reports - text is being cut off in report fields.....is there a limit to &#35; of characters&#63;</h2>
                    I have a report set up in an Access 2003 database. A field in the report is pulling from a field in a table that is set up as memo.<br />
<br />
When the report is run, sometimes the data in this field is cut off, not displaying the full data.<br />
<br />
Is there a limit to the number of characters allowed in a field in a report?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

            <p>Mail profiles care about data files.&nbsp; Mail accounts less so, as long as its in the profile.&nbsp; By definition, if it's in the profile, it will appear in the Navigation Pane, unless it's an archive data file that you've told Outlok to hide.</p>
<p>If you create the new data file and copy the data from the Exchange account to it, it will be accessible from within Outlook.&nbsp; You will already have opened it when you created it and you won't need to add it to the profile again.&nbsp; You can then access the
 messages you copied after you delete the Exchange account.&nbsp; If you don't copy before deleting the Exchange account, you'll lose access to the OST and the data it contains.</p>
<p>You can specify the data file you add as the default data file and then when yo add the non-Exchange account, you can tell Outlook to allow you to configure the account manually, which will allow you to tell the account to use the data file you created as
 its delivery location.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can allow Outlook create a second new data file for the default delivery location and keep the one containing the Exchange data as a secondary data file.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the messages you've copied to the data file will still be tagged as having arrived via the Exchange account which you will no longer have and you will probably need to manually choose the sending account if you reply to any of the messages,
 since Outlook always replies or forwards using the account that received the original message.</p>
<p>It's quite common for people to delete an Exchange account because they no longer have access to the server and then discover they've lost all the mail they had.</p>

<p>Yes, the subfolders will be intact because you'll be copying all of the top level folders.</p>
<p>You could, as you say, export the Exchange folders to a PST as well, but I prefer copying.</p>

For WM6.1, can you check your Settings &gt; Sounds &amp; Notifications &gt; Notifications &gt;<br />
and see whether "Flash" has been selected for some of the notifications....<br />
<br />
Just a possibility...<br />

<h2>            Deleted video files still showing up on Nokia 920, used win7 explorer to delete files on phone</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I had some videos copied over to the phone and I deleted them from the phone via pc by using explorer and did not use the windows phone app.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here comes the problem, all the videos I deleted still show up in the phone's video list and in the windows phone app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selecting them again using the windows phone app for deletion does not work anymore since the files have already been deleted from the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas how to remove the file names of already deleted files that are still showing up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A soft restart doesn't help and copying files over to the phone again with the exact same names only creates duplicate filenames. After deleting them, the original ones with the problem still remain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any helpful reply.</p>

<p>I tried again after a couple of hours to delete the duplicated file names and it works if you delete them "ONE BY ONE" with your phone. Deleting these through the windows phone app still won't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For anyone planning on copying files directly over to your phone, "USE THE PHONE APP FOR DELETING VIDEO FILES" or else the file names of the files you erased will still be displayed in your playlist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope they get around to fix this issue and if possible, a better way to manage and sort music and video files.&nbsp;:thumbdown:</p>

<p>I have the same problem with my music files.&nbsp; I erased all my music files, but somehow all names are still registered as existing on the Xbox Music. It's not that albums or artists show up, it is the response to hitting quickplay.&nbsp; Then Xbox Music starts
 to scroll through the list of every song I've deleted to tell me it can't play them.&nbsp; Well... duh.&nbsp; I loaded the Nokia music player and get the same effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the even odder occurances was that even when I had erased every song, the system scrolled through for about 3 minutes of errors till it started to play a Neil Diamond song that I had erased.&nbsp; I looked again to be sure I had indeed erased every song...
 and there was no files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a screw loose in the "file allowation table" system or something.</p>

                    I'm using a Mac with Office 365 and have PowerPoint Version 15.26. &nbsp;I changed the units of measurement in Word from inches to mm as I've done in the past, but the ruler in PowerPoint still shows inches.

            <p>It certainly would be nice if it were possible to change units from within PPT.&nbsp; For occasional changes, it's handy to know that in *most* measurement input boxes you can type the units of measurement you want w/o having to make changes to the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>72pt (points)</p>
<p>100mm (millimeters)</p>
<p>10cm (centimeters)</p>
<p>96px (pixels)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And of course in for inches.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi Iry</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that with Microsoft Team Free we are unable to administer access through the admin center. Is it possible to use the free version of Microsoft Teams within my organisation? I have had a few issues trying to set this up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first tried creating an organisation outside of my domain using a gmail account and inviting my users from within the domain but they were unable to log in. Am I missing something? Or is the free version only available to companies who do not already have
 some users on Office 365?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would really like to test out the product before migrating away from Slack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Sqoz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Teams free is available for the Office 365 for Business account for logging in (except Accounts at schools or other academic institutions and Accounts at U.S. government institutions). If you sign up with gmail account and sign in Teams free, you can invite
 Office 365 users as guests to your team, and those Office 365 users should sign in Teams and they will receive a notification that they are guests of your team. Then users can click any account in the dropdownlist to switch between these accounts.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned they cannot log in Teams free for those Office 365 accounts, may I know what's your Office 365 subscription?</p>
<p>

</p><p>Purchased in Feb 2017. Installed on a desktop which had a hard drive fail shortly after. I purchased a laptop, installed the software and got a key error when trying to transfer the license. After several days battling with Tech support the issue was finally
 cleared up. (ref 138 7728117)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I need the written proof that the key is pirated so my bank can handle my dispute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>really hope you can help.</p>

<p>'Transfer the licence' what exactly do you mean by that?</p>
<p>Office 2016 versions when you first install using the Key in that process you use/create an MS Account and you log on to that MS Account should you need to re-install, the original key is not used, except in the first setup</p>
<p><a href="http://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.com/myaccount</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>A basic indicator as to whether its legit is to compare the price shown on the MS store, or even Amazon, for the same retail version, if substantially less its almost certainly not legit</p>

<p>Yes, thank you. I understand this. I was wanting to attach the license it to a new pc as the old one failed. Hope that makes sense. But this is not the issue any longer. MS Tech has resolved the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was sent to this forum after requesting written confirmation that the key I was given was pirated. MS Tech said someone here from their 'concerned department' would write to me with that written confirmation. But clearly this is not the case. So I withdraw
 my post.</p>

            I'm willing to bet money there is not one.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The only downloads that work on the RT come from the "Windows Store". That is the place you will have to search for it. But I strongly doubt MS has bothered to create one for the RT version of Office.<br />

    <title>SharePoint Online Correlation ID. Sorry, Something went wrong - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SharePoint Online Correlation ID. Sorry, Something went wrong</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recently started with our new SharePoint online site and we're in the process of moving documents into new libraries for our IMS department, but we've run into intermittent problems when uploading documents, editing properties of uploaded documents etc.
 It doesn't happen every time a document is uploaded or when properties needs to be edited, but it's been happening more and more often. It's frustrating since we don't know what the problem is and I can't do anything with the correlation ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried different browsers, different computers with the same account, different accounts etc, but I can't seem to find the root cause of the problem. The users have contribute access in the libraries, but they keep getting these errors:</p>
<p>Sorry, something went wrong. An unexpected error occured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Correlation ID: f34a749d-d06e-3000-09d2-3c5f037e5738 (When uploading a document - example)</p>
<p>Correlation ID: d46e719d-7035-3000-09d1-802dca4e2428 (When editing the properties of a file - example)</p>

<p>How can I fix this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. we haven't created a lot of libraries yet since we have only recently started to move over documents to the new sp site, but this library is giving me a way harder time than the first one i created. both libraries are on the same site though</p>
<p>3. we've mostly uploaded doc &amp; docx files, but there are a few ppt, xlsx files which haven't given us any problems as far as i can remember</p>
<p>4. i did as you asked in the pm and uploaded the file.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Dewald,</p>
<p>We have received the information.</p>
<p>I notice that you encounter the issue in both libraries on the same site, to identify if it is related to the site, please upload or edit properties of the documents&nbsp;to libraries in another site.</p>
<p>If the issue doesn't occur, there is something wrong with the site. Given the situation, you can move the data to another site and delete the problematic one.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open excel spreadsheets received via e-mail &#40;for last several weeks&#41;</h2>
                    For the&nbsp;past 2+ weeks, I can't open an excel attachment received via e-mail.&nbsp; If I create an excel spreadsheet locally and save it, I can open it, however, if I send that sheet to myself via e-mail I can't open it.&nbsp; I am able to open .pdf and .doc files
 sent via e-mail.

    <title>Powerpoint Autosave on Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Powerpoint Autosave on Mac</h2>
                    <p>I am using Powerpoint Version 16.9.1 (180125). Everything was running fine until last week, than I got an update which took off the autosave feature and now there is a lag when I type. I am in grad school and have my power points saved on my MBP (2017).
 Can anyone tell me a way to fix this?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Yes, If you try to save you PowerPoint out of&nbsp;</span></span><span>OneDrive, OneDrive for Business, or SharePoint Online, the autosave feature will be disabled.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>When AutoSave is off, AutoRecover still works.
