<h2>            Legends of Wrestling &#35;2 and Showdown </h2>
                    
<p>So I recently began trying my original xbox games on my 360. Yea Im an old guy that still plays games. LOL! And I&nbsp; wasnt aware they could play on it. But I have learned that every game I have played well WITH THE EXCEPTION of my Legends of Wrestling 2 and
 Showdown. I keep getting the error X: and B: code.</p>
<p>I saw on several other forums including wiki that people have said they got this game to work on their 360.</p>
<p>I havent been successful at all. Anyone here try it and get it to work?</p>

<h2>            PC Doesn&#39;t recognize my Android as MTP</h2>
                    <p>It has been working fine, but might be after one of the Windows Update, it does not automatically install the "device driver software" when my android mobile is connected to the PC. It starts to install the driver but just stops over there without any advancement.
 Hence PC is unable to recognize the device as MTP or any other modes. (PTP, USB Storage)</p>

</p><p>Yeah I tried using different USB ports (I have 3) and different cords (nearly 5).</p>
<p>I have tried connecting all my friends' android devices running on lollipop and above.</p>
<p>I have tried to update the driver automatically, but I get an error always. Not even succeeded trying it updating manually by downloading drivers from the third party sites or even Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            RNDIS &#43; Mass Storage &#40;This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. &#40;Code 31&#41;&#41;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We are making a composite device (RNDIS + Mass Storage). If we unplug the device while we are running an application from the Mass Storage, the device will report "This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this
 device. (Code 31)" the next time we plug it back. This would require rebooting the PC followed by uninstalling and reinstalling the device driver. Is there a faster way of solving this without uninstalling the device driver or rebooting the PC?

<p>Hi Marc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype and Skype for Business are totally two different products. They won't affect each other and you need to use two different type of accounts to login in the app. One is for Office 365 Business and one is for a personal account(like Hotmail.com).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I confirm do you use the personal Skype account to login to Skype and verify the result?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Lance</p>
<p>Thank you for helping the old and aged me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to login to Skype using my Gmail ID, which has been hijacked by MS (IMHO) despite the fact that I have a MS Partner Network account with a different ID.&nbsp; MS help pages are always wrong, generally worthless (unless you have a spare year).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest, I was a Mac user and I have wasted months on MS - so am seriously considering giving MS a refund request - it is so shamefully short of marketing promises - I wish I never started this process (problems from start Dec 2017 to now = not good
 for my income/business/time).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help because my clients all have similar problems with MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers from Jersey: the original &amp; independent from 1240, not the New Jersey = USA (we sold that to you a couple of hundred years ago, and we don't want it back)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi Marc Allenet,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the Skype and Office 365 for E3 are different products, and they use different type of accounts, when you install Office applications on your PC, it won’t do any affections on personal account accessing
 Skype.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you couldn’t access to personal Skype account, please check whether you have changed the logon alias.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, to further help you, since the issue is about Skype account, not Office 365 account, and we focus on Office 365 for Business issue, I will move this thread back to the right category, our dedicated
 team support will better help you. Sorry for the inconvenience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            32 bit browsers &#40;IE8, Firefox, Google Chrome, and Opera&#41; and Vista 64 bit</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I have an HP Pavilion dv2842se. I've had it for a little more than a year. IE 7 was originally installed, with a 32 bit and 64 bit version. Not long after I got it, the 32 bit version stopped functioning. Specifically, as soon as I open the program it would
 shut down and be completely unusable. I could not figure out the issue, so I installed Mozilla Firefox 32 bit, and just used that. When the IE 8 upgrade came out, I downloaded it and still experienced the same problem, so I continued to use Firefox.
<br />
<br />
Using Mozilla has worked well for me until about two weeks ago when Mozilla started becoming increasingly unreliable, and now completely unusable. Assuming it was a Mozilla specific problem, I downloaded 32 bit versions of Chrome and Opera, and ended up with
 all four 32 bit versions of the browsing programs doing the same.<br />
<br />
I realize that I can simply use the 64 bit version of IE8, as I have been doing since I have no choice. However, there is one big problem with this. IE8 does not support Adobe Flash Player, which is needed to run practically every website--including the main
 website I use for my college coursework. Considering the main reason I purchased this computer was for college,&nbsp; my computer as a whole is pretty worthless to me without a functioning browser that supports Adobe Flash Player.
<br />
<br />
Per the instruction of HP, I have tried disabling all add-ons, resetting all internet settings, and uninstalling and reinstalling Adobe Flash Player. I have even on my own tried a system restore, and scanned for viruses, spyware, and malware. Nothing has worked.
<br />
<br />
Please, Please, PLEASE if there is absolutely anything I can do to return my 32 bit browsers to a usable state, please help me. I really don't have the money to buy a new computer, and 64 bit operating systems are practically standard now--so there's no saying
 that if I did buy a new computer the same thing wouldn't happen all over again.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can provide! It's much appreciated!

<strong>STARTUP REPAIR</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a Windows Vista installation disc, you need to restart (boot) your computer using the installation disc. If you do not restart your computer from the disc, the option to repair
 your computer will not appear.</p>
<p>If you have a Windows Vista installation disc:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Insert the installation disc.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Restart your computer.</p>
<p>Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button , and then click Restart.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.</p>
<p>Note: If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For more information,
 see BIOS: frequently asked questions.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Choose your language settings, and then click Next.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>5.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click Repair your computer.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>6.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click Next.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>7.<span>&nbsp;
</span>On the System Recovery Options menu, click Startup Repair. Startup Repair might prompt you to make choices as it tries to fix the problem, and if necessary, it might restart your computer as it makes repairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;REPAIR INSTALLATION</p>
<p>&nbsp;You will need all your software media, Windows Vista disk and backup of your data to perform either one of the installation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOW TO PERFORM AN INPLACE UPGRADE OR REPAIR INSTALLATION</p>
<p>If you have the Windows Vista DVD, you can attempt a Inplace Upgrade (Repair) on Vista - this will not work if all you have is a Windows Recovery DVD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have the Windows Vista DVD and only have the Recovery Media, do you know someone who has the exact same Version of Vista as you that has the Vista DVD?&nbsp; If so, borrow their
 DVD but do "not" use their Product key, use yours if asked for a product key.&nbsp; If you do not have or cannot get a Vista DVD, the steps below will not work with the Recovery media and you may be forced to do a Clean install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Repair Installation:</span></p>
<p>You may reinstall your copy of Vista while keeping your files, settings, and programs by performing a
in-place </span>upgrade with the following steps: (<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Note</span>: &nbsp;This does not always resolve all issues, especially if the corruption was caused by a 3rd party program or service, you might need to
 do a clean installation if this is unsuccessful.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please make sure you

<p>Always make sure you have&nbsp;the means&nbsp;to reinstall your programs, either through an install disk or having access to the installation files.</p>
<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Insert the Windows installation disc into your computer's DVD or CD drive. You must start Windows installation while running your existing version of Windows.</p>

<p>I would suggest that you contact the Dell support to check if the printer is faulty or if the issue is with the printhead.</p>
<p><br />
Check with printer maker Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and their forums (if any) for known issues.

<h2>            Skype Recent Calls Do Not Delete</h2>
                    <p>So Ive been trying to clean up my skype contacts list (on iOS 10), mainly deleting old chats and contacts who are no longer active.</p>
<p>One of my contacts no longer uses the service, so i went to delete the chat, and signed off. We had a quick Skype call a few days prior.</p>
<p>A few days later, i sign in and this persons chat box reappears, showing the time of the last call. So i delete it and restart the app. The window reappears again, with the same time.
</p>
<p>It also appears in the calls section, and I just cant delete it or stop it from appearing.</p>
<p>Is there a way to fix this, or am i stuck with the ghost of my last phone call?</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;Brovahkiin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see why you're concerned. To help you resolve this issue, please try these steps:</p>
<p>1. Quit Skype.</p>
<p>2. Tap and hold the Skype application and tap the red X button to uninstall it.</p>
<p>3. Restart your phone.</p>
<p>4. Download and install Skype.</p>
<p>5. Sign in to your account and try to delete the chat again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have delete the chat, it should no longer appear and all conversations will be deleted and it includes the recent Skype call you made prior to deleting the chat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying the steps above, please let me know if the same issue persist.</p>

<p>I restarted windows, disable my Bitdefender but was getting the same error.</p>
<p>I downloaded mpass-fe.exe to manually update the defender. When it runs it doesn't give any messages. But when I look in About for Windows Defender I still see the only old definitians. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I even reset the entire Windows Updates:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">1. stop the "windows update" service (services.msc)&nbsp;</span><br />

<p>After I installed Bitdefender free antivirus it was working fine for months... However, to test your suggestion of a conflict I disabled Bitdefender. It gave me the same result.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>BTW, I tried to reply using my login but it looked like it was disabled or something weird as I was asking to sign-in to reply when I clicked to sign-in it brought me to this page but did not really signed me so I was clicking back between "Reply" and "sign
 in with Microsoft account". Finally I had to sign up with another ID to get through!</p>
<p>Was my original ID banned from forum?</p>
<p>Anyway, AVG is not currently installed but Bitdefender is. However, since Windows Updates worked fine with it before the specific update plus since I tried to disable Bitdefender and run update again and it did not help Bidefender support has nothing to
 say about it. I can uninstall Bitdefender completely and try again but I doubt it will change anything since what I said above.</p>

<h2>            Issues with printing on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: printing</p>
<p>
</p><p>My USB hp color laserjet 3550 printer is listed as an unspecified device and I cannot install a driver for it in windows 10.&nbsp; HP says, though they are never helpful, that it's a Microsoft problem.&nbsp; I've installed clj 3700 software since the original wouldn't
 work &amp; the dot4&nbsp;driver, to no avail.&nbsp; Everything worked well in windows 7 &amp; on a desktop instead of a laptop.&nbsp; It took HP quite a while to fix it before, but now they refuse to even consider the problem.&nbsp; I've downloaded the HP Printer Scanner Doctor, which
 they used before, but it's not working for me just like previously.&nbsp; Even then they couldn't understand why it was so hard &amp; said they were going to investigate.</p>

<p>I want to install 64-bit Windows 8.1 Pro on my PC which runs Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit since the time of purchase at a retail store. Will the Windows 7 product key work for the new version? I downloaded the Windows 8.1 iso file from Microsoft website.</p>

<p>Okay.. How about installing Windows 7 Ultimate x64 and activating it with the same one (swapping it for the x86 version I've always had)?</p>
<p>Anyway, I got the whole OS ready for install from a bootable drive I made myself, I was just wondering if the product key will work for that one too.</p>
<p>BTW, if you can't use the same product key, what even is the use of the Windows images we download for free?</p>

<p>You can install either&nbsp;Windows 7 x86 (32bit) or 64bit, but not have&nbsp;both installed&nbsp;at the same time.</p>

</p><p>People have actually paid for Windows 8.1 as preinstalled on their computer or bought a retail license&nbsp;and they want to reinstall it after the recovery partition has been damaged or the hard drive failed, or they want to refresh their already paid for Windows

    <title>Surface Pro 2 Overheating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clare 85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2 Overheating</h2>
                    I'm on my second device (got a refurbished replacement about a week ago). In both cases, the device gets very hot after about half an hour of internet/excel/word. &nbsp;Next time I turn it on, the Action Center informs me that my security software is turned
 off, but when I try to turn it back on, I'm unsuccessful. &nbsp;The friendly folks at Geek Squad are having me refresh the device, but the subsequent software reloading takes time, and the whole process has to be repeated whenever the problem recurs. &nbsp;I've gotten
 to the point where I seldom use the device because it's on its fourth occurrence on, as I mentioned, two separate devices. &nbsp;Is there any solution?

            <p>I appreciate the help. &nbsp;As an update, I also contacted Geek Squad tech support who diagnosed the problem as the version of Kaspersky they'd sold me, and the tech downloaded another version. &nbsp;Have used the SP2 very little since yesterday afternoon, but so
 far it seems fine, which is a good sign since it was pretty hot while the download was going on, and previously that seemed to trigger the problem on subsequent use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for the help. &nbsp;Let's see if this works.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the details. We suggest that you run a command to re-register the Windows Store apps by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right click on <strong>Start menu</strong> and choose <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</p>
<p>2. In the<strong> command prompt </strong>window, you can paste: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em><strong>powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore\AppxManifest.xml
</strong></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, try to search for the Windows Store apps and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

</p><p>The above didn't resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a new user account is not really the way I'd like to solve this.</p>

            <p>Apologies but please do not name and shame other players on the forums. File a complaint on the offending players via your console. Unfortunately this is an issue you must take up with Treyarch as they are the developers. There is very little support left on this game due to its age so it is unlikely your rank will be restored. Sorry.</p>

<p>Unfortunantly no. As stated above, "File a complaint on the offending players via your console. Unfortunately this is an issue you must take up with Treyarch as they are the developers. There is very little support left on this game due to its age so it
 is unlikely your rank will be restored. Sorry." Your only other option is to contact support on the phone or through twitter, @xboxsupport. However, going this route may get your account locked for up to 30 days, and you're still not guaranteed to get your
 rank back in MW. </p>

<p>I was infected in Modern WF4. When i got to the 41st level i was killed by someone who was infected with the hack. I was then promoted from 41st to 55th level as long as i didn't get killed. Once someone killed me they were infected and promoted to the max
 level. I watched just about everybody in the match get this infection. So i filed a complaint with alot of players out there not realizing what happened until now. &nbsp;Sorry !! &nbsp; &nbsp;1? &nbsp; &nbsp; Has Black Ops II been hacked before i go out and buy? &nbsp;thanks</p>

<p>Black Ops II is probably not hacked since it's the newest CoD. Call of Duty games usually only get hacked when they're about 2 or 3 CoD games old.

<h2>            How to delete mscoree.dll&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I'm looking for a way to delete the mscoree.dll file in the System32 folder in windows 7. At this point I don't mind if deleting this file is the worst thing I could do I just want to delete it and if it breaks everything I will just reformat my computer.</div>
<div>Now that that's over with how do I delete this file.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) I tried using my account (which is admin) and I was told I could not and that it required&nbsp;permission&nbsp;form Trustedinstaller.</div>
<div>2) I tried changing the&nbsp;permissions&nbsp;of the file but the 'add' button and other&nbsp;options&nbsp;are grayed out and unusable.</div>
<div>3) I tried&nbsp;unregistering the library and then deleting the file but I still could not delete the file.</div>
<div>4) I turned on the Built-in Elevated Administrator Account tried to delete the file or change it's&nbsp;permissions but this did not work and the options were still grayed out.</div>

<div>So how do I delete this file?<br />
Again I don't mind if it's a&nbsp;terrible&nbsp;idea, and I would prefer not to have questions asked about justifying my motives for deleting this file. I really just want this file gone. How do I delete it?<br />

<p>You need to file a complaint on this persons gamer tag via your console xbox support do not handle complaints of this nature. Then you will have to contact the game makers Treyarch and Activision you can email them and they usually respond within 3 days.
 They may be able to reset your stats and FYI don't accept invites to this game from people you don't know as it is modded to the point that more often then not the people inviting you are running infected lobbies and will pass it on to you.</p>

</p><p>I have quite a few of these with different offsets - they&nbsp;don't show up in WER, so I've no idea how to proceed. I can't tell you much about what I was doing,&nbsp;it's&nbsp;happened during WinRAR operations, copying to/from internal HDD drive, too/from external SD

<p>
</p><p>This is a fresh install, but I had&nbsp;very similar problems after the anniv update&nbsp;installed&nbsp;onto&nbsp;a previously faultless system. (i7, b85, 16gb,&nbsp;all drivers including intel rapidstore updated, Nvidia 369.09 drivers, no other&nbsp;non-ms driver-level&nbsp;software).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst I'm complaining, I'll mention the countless instances of&nbsp;edge hanging -&nbsp;it also&nbsp;doesn't play gifs, videos, doesn't remember favourites or completed form information. Sticky notes and NV software crashes also&nbsp;reporting 0xc0000005. Not to mention my
 mobile phone is no longer recognised as mass storage. That and I hate the new start menu (I think everyone does).</p>

</p><p>Consider capturing a user mode dump of the Explorer crash which has the potential to pinpoint the cause of the crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.<br />
<br />
If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file (save with the .reg extension and give it any name such as dump.reg), then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file&nbsp;at the time explorer.exe crashes&nbsp;should
 be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\explorer.exe]<br />

00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00<br />
</strong></em><br />
<br />
After Explorer (explorer.exe) crashes, can you then make the .dmp file&nbsp;available (provide link)&nbsp;via a public folder on&nbsp;OneDrive (SkyDrive) or similar site?</p>

<h2>            Product Key Not Working - Want to Create Windows 8.1 USB for New Hard Drive</h2>
                    Hi All, 



First some background.  I have a ThinkPad W700 from late-2009 (so I can have 2 hard drives...yay), which came with Windows 7 Professional x64, which I upgraded to Windows 8 Pro in December 2012 (bought through the Microsoft Store, but the seller of record is listed as "arvato digital services, llc").  Using the Windows Store, I upgraded to Windows 8.1 last month. 



I'm going to be buying a couple of new hard drives for my laptop, one of them being an SSD to run the OS and programs, and I would like to use my flash drive as the installation media to do a clean installation of Windows 8.1 on the new SSD once I get it.  Now, my Windows 8 Product Key (found in the upgrade purchase confirmation email I received in December 2012) and the Windows 8.1 Product Key (found via Belarc Advisor) are exactly the same.  When I paste the product key into the Windows 8.1 installer I downloaded from Microsoft, the key doesn't work.  Brick wall.  There is a link where I see I could download Wind

            Hi Geethu,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for helping me with this. &nbsp;Well, I've hit a roadblock on the setup, because I followed the instructions and when I select USB to create the installation media, it says "We can't find a USB flash drive. Insert one and try again." &nbsp;Inadvertently,
 on my first attempt, I had placed the drive in the only dead port on my computer, but when I moved the drive to a working port (and I saw the light go on and saw the drive mount in Explorer) and tried again, I'm given the same error. &nbsp;I went back to the "Choose
 which media to use" screen and to the "Install Windows 8" screen to see if that would refresh the installer's ability to recognize the drive, but no success. &nbsp;To I need to re-initiate the setup program all over again?</div>
        </p>

            I decided to try closing and re-opening the setup on my own. &nbsp;I was brought immediately to the install screen, since the files have been pre-downloaded by the installer. It still does not recognize the USB drive.
<div><br />
<div>I'm starting to get the sense that it might have something to do with my USB drive itself. &nbsp;I'm using a 16GB SanDisk Cruzer Glide, so it's a fairly new model, and when I examine the properties, it comes up as a Local Disk. &nbsp;Is my computer therefore treating
 it as a hard drive instead of a piece of removable media? &nbsp;What would you recommend as the best course of action to get the installer to properly recognize my drive. &nbsp;Would formatting it do the trick?</div>

            You cannot do what you want because of several factors--the upgrade from windows 7 to windows 8 requires windows 7 to be on the drive to upgrade to 8. All the win 8 downloads and iso files are upgrades. The next thing is you didn't create an installation
 dvd or flash drive for 8.1 since you used the downloaded version from the Store so you don't have a windows 8.1 key. You only get a key if you bought 8.1 or did not use the free download. You need a key is use the media you make.
<div><br />
<div>Easiest way to do what you want--but costs way too much--is to buy the retail version of 8.1 since that is a full version, not an upgrade. Otherwise, you are looking at first installing windows 7 and then upgrading to 8 again using your purchased key and
 then upgrading to 8.1 BUT this time don't use the store download. Select the other option to download the file and burn it to dvd or save it to make a flash drive. I would select that option every time you upgrade.</div>
<div>Here are some helpful pages--&nbsp;</div>

<div>On computers that came with win 8 this doesn't work. It does not work with OEM keys.&nbsp;</div>

            I was afraid of that possibility. &nbsp;That brings me to another problem. &nbsp;My computer is over 4 years old, came with an OEM Windows 7, and the computer has been used extensively. &nbsp;The sticker with the OEM Windows 7 key has long since lost its numbers (either
 rubbed or dissolved away), the CD/DVD drive on the computer is shot (which is why I'm putting in a second hard drive in its place), and my recovery disks were trashed in a flood.
<div><br />
<div>My ultimate goal is to start anew with a clean OS, without all the junk that has accumulated over the years, without having to incur any more costs (aside from the hard drives I'm getting).</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have access to another machine, try reformatting the Flash drive... NTFS...</p>
<p>You could try it on this one too, if it will let you...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worst case, since you are already at this point, save the download as an ISO Image...</p>
<p>This can be burned to a bootable DVD and probably to a bootable Flash later...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you Show Hidden Files and Folders, you should see a folder ESD on C:\... this is Win 8.1...</p>
<p>You might want to save a copy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can install this download of Win 8.1, but you will need to start With your Win 7... When you upgrade to Win 8, you can reformat the drive\partition using a Custom Install (Advanced), and basically do a clean install of Win 8..</p>
<p>It will save the info it needs from Win 7...&nbsp; All you will need to do then is&nbsp;a Disk Cleanup of System Files to get rid of Windows.old...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any upgrade to 8.1 at this point would be then basically be a clean install, but you can select KEEP NOTHING of Win 8... That would be about as clean as it gets...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use an Imaging program on a bootable CD to create an image of your current hard drive image, and Restore it to the SSD also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One potential problem... Your Win 7 may not reinstall to the SSD because of it's smaller size... Your OEM Recovery Media may not accept it... If this is the case, do it to a large enough hard drive, then image the HDD and Reload it to the SSD...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was one thing I missed... you don't have the Win 7 disks...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you checked to see if the partition is still intact that contains the image to either restore to factory, or create the disks...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could possibly buy the disks from Lenovo for maybe $20.00. Do still have the serial number of the machine?</p>

<h2>            How to reset&#47;change settings on Xbox One OneGuide</h2>
                    
<p>When I got my Xbox One I easily got it to connect to my tv to where it could turn the tv on and off when I turned my console off. For whatever reason it stopped doing this. According to the help pages on microsofts site to change settings you click on the
 TV icon. When I click on it it just does nothing for a bit, then an error pops up saying "For some reason TV took to long to start. (0x8027025a). It seems that I can't change/reset settings unless I can access this menu, but it won't load. Any help?</p>

<h2>            Clean installation of windows 10 - Can a hard drive infect the bootable usb&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be installing a clean installation of windows 10 for the first time on one of my computers.
</p>
<p>From looking at online tutorials/articles its been said to help eradicate malware and allows a clean copy of windows 10 to be installed.</p>
<p>After playing around with the computer I know which key is needed to enter the uefi when i start my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plan to reinstall by using the usb approach but noticed that my computer won't change the boot order for my usb unless the usb is inserted (when the usb is not inserted into the computer the uefi does not list any usbs as a boot option).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plan to do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Turn off computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Plug in usb</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Turn on computer then immedialetly spam the trigger key which will allow me&nbsp; to enter the uefi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What confuses me is when i start my computer to enter uefi couldn't malware infect the bootable usb since the computer is now turned on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried looking for answers online but could not find any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about the novice question I'm not knowledgeable with computers and not tech savy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A simple explanation and/or answer would be incredible and i would be so grateful.</p>

<br />
<br />Rest assured your method is correct and there is no chance of cross infection from UEFI or your hard drive to the USB Flash Drive
