<p>So all Office suites and related Office applications are uninstalled?<br />
No Activation Assistant, Proofing Tools, Outlook Connector, Outlook<br />
BCM and so on installed. Double check in Control Panel -&gt; Software....</p>
<p>Windows XP with SP3? Perform a clean boot and try again:<br />

    <title>Linked databse path changed - How to update&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmftech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Linked databse path changed - How to update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We use software called Sage Timberline. An Access database was written by an ex-I.T. person years ago. This Access database has linked ODBC tables.</p>
<p>The Timberline data folder has changed from "COMAPNYNAME" to "COMPANYNAME NEW".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The old Timberline data path is still accessible, but when we run the Access database, the queries show up as blank tables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After doing some research, I believe I need to change the PATH to these linked tables to the new Timberline DATA folder path.</p>
<p>If I am on the right track, then my question is ,"What is the easiest way to update the ODBC path to the new location?"</p>
<p>If I rename the old Timberline data path to "CAMPANYNAME\OLD", this should break the link when Access tries to find that linked table. - But, will it ask me for the new path?? DO I need to go into CONTROL PANEL/ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS\DATA SOURCES(ODBC) and
 find the connection there? If so, how do I update the path?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any insight on this...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Like I said this isn't an Access question. You don't need to change anything on the Access side. When there are ODBC links to to tables, those links are to a DSN name. So you just need to change the configuration of the DSN. If the DSN is named test, that's
 what you have to reconfigure.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>ODBC links will have a globe icon. When you hover over them it will show that it is ODBC and the DSN name and the table name. So by reconfiguring the DSN, you change where the tables are being pulled from.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The only time to use Linked Table Manager is if you are changing the DSN name to be linked to.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>I do not know whether the adhesive Avery use with their inkjet labels is different from that used with their laser labels, or whether the difference is in that the paper for the inkjet labels may be more resistant to ink bleed than other papers.&nbsp; If the
 adhesive was different to the point that the heat of the fusion process used in a laser printer was going to cause a problem, I would expect that Avery should put a very clear warning on the InkJet labels package advising that they should not be used in a
 laser printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to get a definite answer to that question would be to ask Avery themselves.</p>

            <p>You can change cell references in formulas from relative ('unlocked') to absolute ('locked) by addition of the $ symbol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A1 - row and column both change when copied/pasted</p>
<p>$A1 - row number will change but column does not</p>
<p>A$2 - column changes but row does not</p>
<p>$A$2 - neither the row nor column will change</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use a mixture in your formula according to your requirements.</p>

    <title>Nokia 521 Basic Shortcomings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> makeitbetter---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 521 Basic Shortcomings</h2>
                    
<p>I'm new to using the Nokia Lumia 521. My previous Nokia experience is with the N900. There are some very basic phone features missing from the Nokia 521 that need to be addressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, text messages don't cue up for instant resend on this phone when the cellular network is temporaily unavailable. One has to manually resend every text. Worse still, when using T-Mobile's Wi-Fi calling feature, you have to manually copy/paste or forward
 text messages that fail to go out because there isn't even a retry option. I'm sure Nokia phones have been capable of auto message resend for more than 10 years. Also, other verions of T-Mobile's Wi-Fi calling have the auto resend function on both smart phones
 and dumb phones (UMA). Adding this feature is a must!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, the included IE browser is not acceptable for many web sites that use desktop formats. The same applies to the Nokia Xpress browser. Three necessary features for a web browser on a small screen device are: single column view, text wrapping, and multiple
 text size options. If you want a good example of a mobile web browser, look no further than Opera Mobile. There is no need to reinvent the wheel (Xpress). License Opera's patents/technology for mobile browsers and the problem is solved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, direct home screen custom on/off soft buttons for Wi-Fi, bluetooth, high contrast, etc. are very useful on a mobile device. These are not included by default, which is a functional shortcoming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, seperate adjustment settings for the volume of ringtones, text tones, message tones, and media should also be included by default. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a very capable device with good build quality and features for the price. The OS is smooth and battery efficiency is great.&nbsp; Nokia needs a few small improvements to be be the leader once again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope Nokia employees read and address customer suggestions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your points have been made multiple times over here and answered as well, in general your issues are with the core OS which is Microsoft's responsibility. Things will change with Nokia Devices and Services being bought by MSFT but no where near what you
 seem to want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally I have no issue at all with IE10 and for me it works fine. It's a vastly more powerful browser than Opera mobile and has way better support for Javascript, HTML5 and touch in general.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of features you mention are expected to come in future updates, but not anytime soon. They are certainly not part of the upcoming GDR3/NokiaBlack update.</p>

<p>Hi many of your issues are easily solved &nbsp;or are simply &nbsp;not available on WP8. I don't use wifi messaging but ant normal text that fails to send asks me if I wish to try again and long hold any message gives choice to forward to ant number of contacts. Web
 browsing is subjective but the built in browser works extremely well for me and you have choice to set to desktop or mobile view. As for toggle switches for wifi, BT, flight mode etc, there are many apps that allow you to pin tiles to your homescreen, however
 I uae an app called Onsuder Pro which offers &nbsp;massive functionality and information from a single tile, inc , battery level, wifi toggle , Bt toggle etc. As for individual volume levels this is not part of WP , however it is again subjective and many like
 the simple overall control of the system wide volume buttons, also you do have flip to silence within the phone settings. Hope you can adapt your phone to suit you as it is a great little handset and a very stable , useable OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good Luck</p>

<p>So third party apps give home screen on/off buttons to Wi-Fi, bluetooth, high contrast mode, etc., or are we just talking about shortcuts to settings and informational live tiles?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm well aware of all the settings with IE on this phone. I challenge anyone using IE on the 521 to go to a standard desktop formatted website like howardforums dot com and quickly read content without extensive side scrolling and pinch zooming. Contrast
 this to Opera Mobile which has features designed to overcome such formatting limitations and do it very quickly. It also has the compression server option, which Nokia has deemed worthwile with it's rather weak Xpress browser. I have no problem with IE on
 mobile formatted websites, although it's still not as good as Opera Mobile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, many feel the answer to formatting is some useless app to render the desktop site properly and also spy on the user. Many of these apps are also cross site aware. I prefer a mobile browser where I can control the settings and access and save my
 batttery, bandwidth, and internal storage for better things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Javascript, really? It's a hinderance on mobile browsers with its wastful background network connections, ad spying, etc. I even turn off javascript on desktop browsers unless I really need it for some purpose, like commenting on this forum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Auto text resend is superior to manual text resend. It's been around for a long time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nokia, now part of Microsoft, can recognize weakness in the product and work to improve WP8 functionality. I'm glad that Nokia allows customers to express their concerns here.&nbsp;</p>

            I'll add my vote to getting an auto resend function - even my old BlackBerry could do that! Anyone who has to cope with a poor signal area will recognise that.

There is no "Compatibility" tab in Properties.&nbsp; I recently purchased a Gateway 8.1 and had 10P and Office 365 downloaded.

<h2>            internet explorer 8 changes post request to get request after the certification warning page</h2>
                    <p>I have one problem with IE8. When I tried to <strong>download</strong> something with the POST request by https from one website. The Certificate Error page displayed since the certification&nbsp;was not signed by root CA. After selecting "Contiue to this website",
 the error "HTTP Status 405 - HTTP method GET is not supported by this URL" raised. Then I captured the packages between IE8 and the website with wireshark, I found that after the certificate error page, IE8 changed the post request to get request, since the
 website just supported the post requestion, so the error happened. Could you please help to look into this issue? thanks a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, I have found one hotfix for the IE6 about this issue, the link is <span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824598</a>. I&nbsp;cannot make sure&nbsp;whether these two</span></p>

            <p>Hi Qingyiwang,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Does this happen when downloading any file from a secure connection? (HTTPS)</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you tried checking the security settings in Internet Explorer 8?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check the security settings in Internet Explorer and refer the following articles for more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Security and privacy features in Internet Explorer 8</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Security-and-privacy-features-in-Internet-Explorer-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Security-and-privacy-features-in-Internet-Explorer-8</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Imran,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate you response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, this error happens when I download file from a secure connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have added this site into the Trusted Sites, but the error also exists. However, if I install the certification of the website(the certification is not signed by root CA), and disabe the warnings&nbsp;of the certificate error,which will disabe the certificate
 error page during download, the error will disappear. So I guess the IE8 might change the POST request to GET request after the Certificate Error page(Without installing the certification).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, I used the wireshark to capture the packages between IE8 and the website. Without the error page, the request is POST, but with the error page and continue the page, the request is changed to GET.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Qingyi</p>

<h2>            Mac Outlook 2016 Not Responding on Startup</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I'm running Mac OS 13.2 on a 2015 MBP.&nbsp; All of the the latest updates are in order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week Outlook for Mac (v16.9) suddenly became unresponsive after downloading a series of new emails, showing an error message - "Microsoft Outlook isn't responding right now.&nbsp; Do you want to wait, or quit?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting didn't resolve the issue so I created a new Test Profile, and the application appears to work fine using the new profile.&nbsp; Which is great but I've lost all my data (appx 25,000 inbox and sent messages) across about 7 different email accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't export the data from the Main Profile because I cannot use the application.&nbsp; I've been told that uninstalling and reinstalling Office probably won't resolve the issue either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what steps can be taken to fix this issue, fix a corrupted profile and/or recover the missing data?</p>
<p />

<h2>            Form with table, need to use auto sum.</h2>
                    I have a form that has different sized columns in a table. IE first three&nbsp;rows have three cells, next one has nine cells and the next 20 have five cells. The table all lines up, just the cells don't. Is there a way to auto sum that last column of the 20
 cells? I sure hope I am explaining this correctly.

<p>e&nbsp;is th fifth column&nbsp; 13 - 32 are the row numbers from the start of the table.</p>

    <title>Linking Own Safety Camera Locations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aerodean  say:</h3>
<h2>            Linking Own Safety Camera Locations</h2>
                    
<p>I have the Nokia 6710 Navigator with Maps 3, however,&nbsp;there is no safety/speed camera information for South Africa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my previous 6110 with Route 66 nav software, I just imported the camera locations as POI, saved the audio files to the phone&nbsp;and from within the Route 66 software changed the Alarm settings for the POI category. Easy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've now imported the camera locations as POI to the 6710, but there is no feature in Map similar to the Alarm function in Route 66.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do I manually impute&nbsp;speed camera locations to automatically warn me when I go near?</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, it just so happened that I installed the new app last week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've imported the POI data as per their website, but I must still play with it. Seems like I'd have to have both Maps and piPOIAlert open at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully I can keep the Maps screen open and the piPOIAlert will alert me in the background.</p>

<p>Yes you can... that is exactly what i am doing.</p>
<p>With the N97 mini i do sometimes even run Sportstracker as 3rd app in parallel... but this is where the trouble then starts.</p>
<p>Everything works fine, except that the processor-load seems to be too high with 3 apps running, and so either maps or poialert does start to stumble in the voice or warning-ton.</p>
<p>But 2 apps in parallel, maps and alert, seems to work without prob...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So... not sure about your device specs, and if you have more or less processor-power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way... i have the data downloaded from somewhere else, and i am quiet happy with the data....</p>

<p>Internet sharing is a network service and some network operators do not allow internet sharing. Are you using a branded phone? And did you check with your network operator to see if they allow internet sharing?</p>

<h3> chris blue  say:</h3>
<h2>            Edit a macro button</h2>
                    I created a macro button, which I now cannot edit or even select by right-clicking.&nbsp;&nbsp;Would anyone have any suggestions?&nbsp; I changed the button to show "Hide columns", but I'm not sure that that's its name, as I can't view its properties!&nbsp; If nothing else,
 I would like to delete it and insert another one.&nbsp; I'm fairly sure it's a Form Control and not an ActiveX Control, if that makes any difference.&nbsp; Why is this so hard?

            If you created an ActiveX button, you need to be in <i>design mode</i> before you can right click and edit it.<br />
Go to <i>Developer tab &gt; Controls group &gt; Design Mode </i>and try editing it.

<p>Hi Alien,</p>
<p>By chance are you using an Alienware computer?</p>
<p>otherwise we need to know an example of the web sites where this is occurring.... it may be just a problem with those web sites.</p>
<p>The fist step in troubleshooting problems with Internet Explorer is to first try running IE in no-Addons mode to rule out an incompatible IE Addon.</p>
<p>Start&gt;Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;System Tools&gt;Internet Explorer (no Addons)</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have to MATCH in more than 1 column in sheetB, SheetC you can use the following formula for your Cond. Format. rule:</p>

            Unfortunately, this still has not corrected my issue. I download Outlook 2016 off of Office 365 for my desktop, however it still will not open. I have repaired each file, I have un-installed, re-installed. I have Window 7 Pro 64-Bit. It opens like it seems
 that it will open fully and in the send-receive update at the very last it hangs and givies me the same error message.&nbsp;

            <p>Unless it has been added in Excel 2013 [Windows] (which I seriously doubt) Gantt Charts are not directly supported in Excel. They're typically the province of programs specifically designed for Project Management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are methods which can be used to 'improvise' such as what is described here:

<p>Others are available if you search the web using the criteria <em>Excel 2011 gantt chart</em>. Most use a Windows version for illustration, but with a little translation of the User Interface most should be adaptable in Excel 2011. I've never attempted to
 use any of these approaches so I can't offer any recommendations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you search the web using the criteria <em>mac gantt chart</em> you'll also find a number programs which well may be easier to use for your purpose. The cost ranges from free on up :-)</p>

            <p>You will need something (a shape, object, text, etc.) to click to act as the trigger.</p>
<p>1. Go to your Animations tab (yes, even though you are working with sound), and click on Animation Pane to open the Animation Pane.
<br />
You should see your sound located in the animation pane.</p>
<p>2. Click Add Animation--&gt;Pause. This will add a pause animation in your animation pane. By default, the pause action will be set to On Click, meaning you will be able to pause the audio with a click of the mouse button; however, what I find especially useful
 is to trigger the animation on click of a particular slide object.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To set a trigger</p>
<p>1. click the drop arrow to the right of the pause animation (in the animation pane), and select Timing.</p>
<p>2. On the Timing tab for the Pause Audio animation, click the Triggers button at the bottom of the pane.</p>
<p>3. Select the option "Start effect on click of" and select an object from the drop menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That way, that one object will become your pause/play button for your presentation audio.</p>

                    <p>I'm on windows 10 build 10162 x64&nbsp;and I see the TH1 Professional 10240 update available on Windows Update. But downloading stays at 0% and data transfer speed on my internet connection becomes 0kB/s although internet works fine other apps.</p>
<p>Windows update troubleshooter says "Service registration missing or corrupt".</p>
<p>In services.msc Windows update, Background Intelligent Transfer Service and Cryptographic Services are running.</p>
