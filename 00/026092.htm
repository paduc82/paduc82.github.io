<h2>            Listing of on-line Skype contacts in Skype V 8&#63;</h2>
                    Is there any way to show a listing of on-line Skype contacts in Skype V8 similar to the tab on V 7?

</p><p>I understand that you want to filter your Skype contacts that who is only showing online for your Mac version. Just go to your contacts window where you can easily filter your Skype contacts by
<strong>All, Skype</strong> only contacts, and which of your contacts is <strong>
Active Now </strong>on Skype.</p>

<h2>            Full screen PPT video stutters, but same video in QT player is fine</h2>
                    We're working with a presentation that includes a video which is set to Play in Full Screen in PPT.&nbsp; If this video (30 seconds, h.264, 1280x720, 4.13 Mbit/s) is played full screen in QuickTime Player, it plays without any hesitations or stuttering.&nbsp; When
 inserted into PPT and played full screen, it stutters and jumps- skipping frames.<br />
<br />
I've monitored CPU use via top, and see that while PPT playback uses much more CPU than QuickTime does, we still end up with 20-30% idle- it's not using all capacity.<br />
<br />
Hardware is a Core2 Duo, 2.2ghz, 3gigs RAM and PPT 2011, 14.1.3.<br />
<br />
Any guidance on how to make playback of a full screen video within PPT 2011 match the quality of playback via QuickTime Player?<br />

            PowerPoint using QuickTime to play movies, and it does so in a layer. It does seem odd that you would have a noticeable difference when playing the movie in PowerPoint than when played with QuickTime alone. The number of things to try to rectify this problem
 is rather large.
<div><br />
<div>As you suggested, perhaps your hardware just isn't enough to handle everything that's going on. You might run the Activity Monitor application (it's in Applications &gt; Utilities) and make sure that your Mac isn't using the hard drive for swap space. Check
 the System Memory while your presentation runs. Ideally, Page Outs should be zero. If you're getting page outs, then more RAM will likely help.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If page outs are zero while PowerPoint is playing your movie in slide show mode, then saving the movie differently (smaller size, fewer pixels, different format) may help.</div>

    <title>N97 mini battery level drops suddenly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> _him  say:</h3>
<h2>            N97 mini battery level drops suddenly</h2>
                    I've observed my N97 mini's battery level dropping abruptly from 4 bars to 1 bar (with low battery alarm). The phone's slightly more than a month old and using the latest 11.x.x firmware. Did a bit of googling, and found several suggestions on how to save
 battery (turn off everything 'smart' on ur phone). That's not the point anyways. I need to find out why the battery level drops suddenly (like what happens when ur battery's dying out), and *not* why the battery lasts X hrs. I'm not sure about this, but I
 think this mostly happens when the battery level is slightly below max, and I use any app that needs the GPS functionality. But then, there doesn't seem to be any problem with the GPS hardware in the phone, 'coz it usually gets a GPS lock in less than a minute
 (mostly within seconds). Could it be related to the algo used to show the battery level, or is it that its my battery that's faulty? Any others out there having the same problem?

<p>How long does the batterylife last? - It might be what you're suggesting about the batterymeter. - Try to fully charge it (when phone turned off) - Let it rest without the carger for 15 min. Turn it on an charge it full again.</p>

<p>Battery indicator is not linear.&nbsp; Not sure if it is this way with&nbsp;all 97 minis. It will stay on max (7 "bars") and then once it drops one bar, it will drop quickly.&nbsp; The ratio is something like 6:2, that is if you get&nbsp;8 hrs total usage, it will stay at max
 for&nbsp;6 hrs, then drop to zero bars in 2 hrs.</p>

<p>There is another thread on this elsewhere.</p>

            It's understandable that the batterymeter is not linear (atleast the charge/discharge rates are not). But what bugs me are those sudden erratic drops within minutes (a couple of minutes at times). Anyone who has spent a few days with a dying (rechargeable)
 battery would know what I'm talking about. It's not a good feeling when u r away from a charge source, and you decide to use one of those power hungry things (like Wifi/GPS) thinking you still have sufficient juice left...and then bam! ... the low battery
 warning! you just switch off everything, and hope that it lasts till you reach the next oasis. I guess I'd have to analyze this a bit more to understand if its some specific app that causes such behaviour (as mentioned in my original post, i doubt the GPS
 apps currently). If it happens too often, and even with 'normal' voice+text kind of usage scenarios, its time see Nokia Care I guess. The reason for this post is to know if this behaviour is observed by other N97 mini users as well..then I

<p>Having the same problem.</p>
<p>I am usually out for the whole day from 7am to 10pm... and usually the 7th bar will blink out around 4-5pm... which in my mind is quite good! Considering that I have 6 more bars to go. However when I get home, if I am lucky, I will survive with just 1 bar
 left. If unlucky I will have a dead phone by the time I reach home, and sometimes had to do the hard reset to get life back in to my N97 Mini...</p>

<p>Mine has recently started dropping in power badly after around 6-7 hrs with very little use. However I have a gps icon in the comms box at the top of the screen which I'm sure I never use too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It says gps avaialable even though I'm not using gps at the time, can it be turned off as if gps is running in the back ground it must be using more power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ANy help turning gps icon off in the comms screen would be great &amp; save battery life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I have been away for a while and&nbsp;i might be a bit outdated, but I thought the gps would only get activated as long as you use a application/function which requires gps. Are you sure you don't have any gpsneeding programs running in the background like maps,
 camera with localisation/geotagging feature, the localization/navigation app with compass or somthing like that etc?</p>

            as far as i know the battery indicator is reletive to current use, so when its started to drop if you are using it a lot it will drop very quickly but if you stop using it the battery should look as though it has more life

<p>YES, IT IS VERY COMMON FOR THIS MODEL AND NO SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE IN NEW DELHI, INDIA EITHER TO REPAIR OR REPLACE THE BATTERY. WHEN I VISITED THE SO CALLED CARE CENTER IT IS NO HELP. YOU WOULD BE HECKLED AND PROVIDED WITH SOLUTIONS WHICH ARE OUT OF THIS
 WORLD. These INCLUDE 1) DO NOT USE BLUE TOOTH AT RED LIGHT CROSSINGS 2) YOUR PHONE BATTERY RECHARGE IS LOOSE AND NOW FIXED ETC ETC. i DO NOT KNOW TO LAUGH OR WEEP AT THE EXPETISE LEVELS OF "CARE CENTER". AND TH TELE CARE CENTRE IN INDIA IS NO HELP.</p>

<p>No - no apps are running in the background just menu &amp; home screen, i only have nokia maps &amp; garmin on the phone, but certainly not running. But the gps sat icon is always in the comms box on home scree, when I touch the icon it says gps available ? any
 ideas on how to shut it down as it eats battery life.</p>

<p>I see you have a retail license and the error code suggests there is no license present for the device.</p>
<p>I remember 17063 had a known issue with activation:</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/12/19/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17063-pc/#M1BqDJxcEz52t2JX.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/12/19/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17063-pc/#M1BqDJxcEz52t2JX.97</a></p>
<p><em>We are investigating reports that Windows shows that it “needs activation” and trying to activate fails after upgrading to Build 17063. UPDATE 1/4: To get back into an activated state, you’ll need to rollback to the previous build. If rollback is not
 an option – you’ll have to wait for the next build with the fix.</em></p>
<p>and 17074 corrected it:</p>
<p>https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/01/11/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17074-pc/</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>For Insiders who reported that Windows needs activation after upgrading to Build 17063, this build includes the fix that caused the issue however you will need to use the Activation Troubleshooter to get your activation back into a good state once you’re
 on this build.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the activation troubleshooter and see what it reports:</p>

<h3> janetcecchettini  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint auto-adds &#34;Title&#34; placeholder to Master slide</h2>
                    <p>I am updating PowerPoint themes and Master Slide sets and I have noticed a new behavior that I would like to overcome......&nbsp; I have updated these themes dozens of times over the past 2 years and I have never seen this happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made the required updates to the slide masters.&nbsp; The Master in question does not have any placeholders - I have verified this by selecting "Master Layout" and confirming that no boxes are checked.&nbsp; All three of the layouts associated with this Master
 DO have a Title placeholder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then select "Themes" &gt; "Save Current Theme" and suddenly a "Title" placeholder appears on the Master prior to saving.&nbsp; Clicking on the "Master Layout" dialogue again confirms that the "Title" placeholder has been added to the Master. &nbsp; There does not appear
 to be a way to get rid of this.&nbsp; Although it does not immediately effect the individual layouts associated with the Master, if, for example I were adjusting the Title block on one of the layouts and deleted it, upon re-adding it, it assumes the properties
 of the default title block added to the Master.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recorded a screen capture of this process and placed it <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/r2fvy1qh6fawtal/PPT%20Masters.mp4?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a>.&nbsp; Does anyone have any suggestions?&nbsp; Is this new behavior, or have I simply not noticed it before?&nbsp;

                    The option to change the settings to sign into new version of Skype automatically does not appear when I click on my profile picture and open the setting option that appears. &nbsp;How do I enable automatic sign in when starting up my computer?

<p>To be specific, if you're using Skype for Windows 10 you're signed in when the computer starts even if the app itself isn't running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype for Windows 10 has two parts: the visible app and in a background process called skypehost.exe. The background process keeps running even if you exit the app, so you can still get notifications about incoming messages or calls. And if you're on a call,
 the call will continue even if you exit the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you prefer not to be signed in automatically on Skype for Windows 10, you can sign out from within the app. We won't sign you in automatically after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>Jesper</p>

    <title>Update 2014-10-09&#58; Samsung Ativ S - error 8018830f - the update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Update 2014-10-09&#58; Samsung Ativ S - error 8018830f - the update was downloaded but could not be opened</h2>
                    <p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a short update on the situation. Disappointed I forbid to look automatically for updates. OK so far. As within the last reply from Pieterde Visser I am told that at least an update works fine for him, I gave it a re-try. -- and this works for me too.
 Update installed wirhout any problems; Firmware and OS are upgraded, a new App (Data Sense) added automatically. But what shall I say - it's not WP8.1. I guess all Fans of the Ativ S Hardware have still to be patient and wait for a release of the SAMSUNG WP8.1.
 Anyhow...I'm really happy with my WP8 phone and with the OS as it gives me a great user experience (smooth, responsible, no real flaws). Great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW (new):</p>
<p>OS:8.0.10517.150</p>
<p>FW: 2424.13.10.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- end of update --</p>
<p>
</p><p>a problem which at least for some lumia seems to be solved hit me this weekend. My Samsung ATIV S said that there' s an update available and I was hoping that Samsung finally did the WP8 to WP8.1 step.</p>
<p>The download was ok but the installing step was broken by giving the error message "Das Update wurde heruntergeladen, kann jedoch nicht geoeffnet werden (8018830f)" - and yes I'm using this phone in germany.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All postings I read by now were rather unclear in how to handle such error message, mostly just indicating too few main memory, do a soft or hard reset etc. Sound like from "the Office" - did you recently switch your system off and on again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the details:</p>
<p>Samsung ATIV S (GT I8750)</p>
<p>WP 8.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS 8.0.10327.77</p>
<p>FW 2424.13.5.1</p>
<p>HW 15.15.1.0</p>
<p>SOC 1.5.32</p>
<p>
</p><p>Free Main Memory = 10.7G plus 11.2 external SD Memory</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe anyone has a way to bring up the update...Thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>T.</p>

            <p>It's really a pity and a shame, that Samsung is not supporting it's great hardware in a decent way. I really like my Ativ S and especially it's camera and the possibility to replace the battery, but I suppose my next phone won't be any of Samsungs, as they
 have such a poor support not only for their Windows Phones but also for the Android ones...which I don't like because the Android UI is sooo slow and laggy.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok.: I did a soft reset and now it seems to be installing...but it's still a pity, that it seems only to be GDR3 finally one(!) year after public release.

<h2>            Charged twice for Office 365</h2>
                    I recently signed up for Office 365, but when I put my first payment through, it told me there was an error. So I signed up again. I have now been charged twice - once for a full year subscription (the one that I don't want) and once for a monthly subscription
 (the one that I do want). How do I cancel the year subscription and get a refund? I need to do this urgently as my bank is charging me as it has overdrawn my account.

<h2>            why is my flash player stuttering and in slow motion when in full screen&#63; IE10 win 8 pro</h2>
                    <p>I installed the latest update on my NVIDIA display driver from NVidia.com, latest audio driver from realtek.com website, then I reset my IE 10 settings to all default.&nbsp; My win 8 Pro is all latest up to date, no conflict in all drivers, but still, every time
 I view youtube, espn, and all flash video content from all websites, the video is stuttering, audio become screeching or sounds like a robot, and everything is in slow motion when the video is played in full screen mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's in small windows mode, it's OK, but in full screen mode, everything is stuttering, audio can not be heard, video becomes slower than normal vs the non full screen mode.</p>

            <p>What version of Flash Player do you have installed? (should be v 11.7.700.169&nbsp; on 4/12/2013).&nbsp; There was a Windows update to Flash Player (KB2833510 on 4/10/2013).&nbsp; See if you have the correct version installed......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your Flash Player is current, the problem may be with the graphics accelerator, particularly on Utube videos:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Internet Explorer on the<u> Desktop</u>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Load the site and click to start the video.</p>
<p>Right-click on the running video.</p>
<p>Click on "Settings"</p>
<p>You will see this box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.macromedia.com%2fsupport%2fdocumentation%2fen%2fflashplayer%2fhelp%2fimages%2fmic_en.gif" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on the "display" icon in the <strong>bottom left</strong> corner.&nbsp;(Looks like a monitor)</p>
<p>Another box will pop up</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.macromedia.com%2fsupport%2fdocumentation%2fen%2fflashplayer%2fhelp%2fimages%2fdisplay_en.gif" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that box,&nbsp;<strong>UNCHECK</strong> "Enable Hardware Acceleration" </p>
<p>Close the window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you dont &nbsp;see&nbsp;the hardware box, but instead there is&nbsp;different box with a request to access your cameras and sound,......... that will be utube controlling access to the video.&nbsp; (They claim its free, but you have to agree to their&nbsp;conditions first).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you cant get to the hardware accelerator button, you can disable it another way:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Disable Hardware Accelerator:</u></p>
<p>Tools</p>
<p>Internet Options</p>
<p>Advanced (tab)</p>
<p>&nbsp;under accelerated graphics,&nbsp;<strong>CHECK</strong> the box&nbsp;.........."Use Software Rendering Instead of GPU Rendering"</p>

            <p>Hi....mine keeps showing 99%&nbsp; but nothing happens....</p>
<p>I wonder if it was because I selected to stop&nbsp; new previews untill Feb .....</p>
<p>I turned that off...but it might be too late.</p>
<p>I stopped and restarted the Windows Updates in 'Services' &nbsp; &nbsp; and restarted the PC a few times but I'm left with the same 99% &nbsp; 'Downloading' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I know it's not doing anything at all.</p>
<p>I can only guess the new settings have put me back untill Feb</p>
<p>I wish I could paste a Picture but I hate Paint 3D</p>
<p>Here it is: to the best I can:</p>

            On the new builds all I had to do is hit the logo key and type in mspaint.exe to start the old one then pined it to the taskbar. Wonder why MS didn't put it back in the Windows Accessories Folder. Might as well list it in the Folder if it is OK to use.:)<br />

<h2>            Opt out from outlook premium</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the roll out of the new outlook premium, I can no longer check my email from outlook (Chrome using outlook.live.com). It keeps on asking me to upgrade to premium. I had office 365 before which i didnt renew as I no longer use most of the apps. Now,
 when i click on any email, outlook asks me to upgrade to premium. And i have to pay for the email services?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way for opting out from this premium service? I just want to check my email from chrome browser... I dont want to pay 99.99 dollars just to be able to read my mails from Chrome or other browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I can still check my emails from iOS mail app and Android. Just not in Chrome or other browsers.</p>

<h2>            Unable to log in to desktop after first log in - no log in UI, only blank color screen build 10041</h2>
                    <p>After setting up the new build, I was surprised to find out upon restarting that I am unable to log in. Windows will boot and instead of showing the lock screen it will show the color screen (which is "underneath" the lock screen when logging in) but nothing
 else. There is no UI, just a blank screen. Insider blog stated this was an issue, but the tips it provides as a workaround don't work for me. Only Ctrl-alt-delete does anything, and it only makes the corner buttons visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to boot into safe mode and get to the desktop, but no XAML programs (including the start menu and notification area) can run. This prevents me from changing any settings in the Settings app and prevents me from accessing the internet. I tried to
 debug by starting Windows with different boot settings, but it seemed like the only way I could get to the desktop would mean preventing XAML processes from starting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After refreshing the OS twice using the boot menu, I am still unable to access the desktop after the first log in. The next step I plan on taking is doing a clean install, as it appears all of my restore points were wiped and Windows is unable to roll back
 to 9926. Of course, I don't want to do this, so any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.<br />
<br />
As per the description, you are able to boot to the desktop in safe mode, the issue seems to be due to the compatibility of display drivers. I would suggest you to uninstall the display card drivers.<br />
<br />
1. Press Windows key + R.<br />
2. Type ‘devmgmt.msc’,<br />
3. Expand Display adaptors.<br />
4. Right click on Intel Display adaptor.<br />
5. Click on properties.<br />
6. Click on driver Tab.<br />
7. Click on “Uninstall drivers”.<br />
8. Re-start the computer.<br />
<br />
Once you restart the computer, The drivers for the display card will get installed automatically from Windows update.
<br />
<br />
Post us the results after you try the above steps.</span></span>

            <p>I figured it's the video drivers causing the problem. I'm using a Lenovo Thinkpad s431, and it's got a dual video chipset with an Intel 4200 and an AMD 8600m. However, when I uninstall the drivers for both graphics chipsets the problem still exists, blank
 screen, no sign in UI. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: It just occurred to me that it's possible the drivers Windows automatically downloads are incompatible with Windows. It's happened in the past with me where up-to-date drivers aren't supported by Windows and leave me locked out of the desktop, but
 this was back in 9860 or 9879 days. Perhaps there is a way to disable automatic driver downloads?</p>

b. Select View advanced system settings.<br />
c. Click on Hardware Tab in system properties.<br />

<p>Hi RuslanDimov,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I ask if you have any third party add-ins integrated with Outlook? If so, please update these add-ins to the latest version and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, it doesn't seems like a complete crash log. To collect it, please try to reproduce the issue again, when the crash happens, click

<p>Hi Leo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I don't have any add-ons for my Outlook for Mac. And yes, this wasn't the full crash log - I was hoping someone had seen the exception message before. The full crash log is too long to paste in here (limit is 60k characters, crash log is 90k+), so I
 can send it to you via email or some other way.&nbsp; Below are the stack traces.</p>

<p>Hi RuslanDimov,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will send you a <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
Private Message</a> and you can upload your log there as a saved file. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, you may use the web portal of your configured emails as a temporary workaround, for example OWA for Office 365.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Sports Tracker stops tracking after a while</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
whats wrong with my sports tracker on N82 ? I've cycled to work &amp; home now for a few weeks and at some point sports tracker just stopped tracking my route. Program stays on and time/speed is being calculated but distance amount has stopped completely. Phone
 also displays the gps marker as green so the satellite fix is active and good. Today i had to start program 3 times during my biking from work to home. At the first time it tracked 0.13km, second time was 0.59km but the third time was 2.87km and it never stopped
 tracking.<br />
<br />
I have also noticed something strange (maybe related) that began after latest update.. when i select new activity and press ok to enter the tracking screen, the menus are somehow corrupted but not always. I have to press ok twice to get to the tracking view.
 I have "formatted" (*#7370#) the phone and installed sports tracker 2 times now, into the phone's memory and into the memory card. No difference there.<br />
<br />
EDIT :<br />
<br />
I forgot to say that i also use nokia maps &amp; route 66 in N82 and there are no problems tracking me in those two.<br />
<br />

            Hi Feueri,<br />
<br />
<br />
Leaving Nokia Maps on in the background -&gt; same<br />
Changing settings and workouts -&gt; same<br />
<br />
The program runs but tracking stops after ~1Km and won't start again. I'm wondering if 'power saving' has something to do about it, but it can't be turned of (5 - 90 sec).

            Great to know that i'm not alone with this. Also on one another forum there's a guy with this exact same problem with N82 and latest firmware &amp; latest sports tracker.

            Hello everbody,<br />
<br />
I had the same problem all the time (sports tracker stops recording after several minutes, speed and distance display is stuck but time display still running on). Nothing helped until now (Firmware updates, hard reset ...)!<br />
<br />
As this was driving me nuts I yesterday replaced my old MicroSD-Memory Card (1 GB Sandisk) against a new one (2 GB Sandisk) and now it seems to work perfectly! For a realistic testing situation, I copied all files from the old card on the new card.<br />
And now: no more hanging! WOW :-)<br />
<br />
I believe the problem was that the old card was probably not fast enough to store the waypoint information because the problem occured more often the higher my speed was (especially when testing on the motorway).<br />
<br />
I hope this will help you, guys! Please give me a feedback about your experience!<br />
<br />
Yours Sebastian

            **bleep**, today Sportstracker was stuck again. So please forget about my advice. Sorry! I hope that Nokia will find a solution soon but they obviously don't seem to care...<br />

            Had the same issue with an N78 and SportsTracker - my thread is here (/discussions/board/message?board.id=smartphones&amp;thread.id=96232&amp;view=by_date_ascending&amp;page=1)
 which describes how to get round the problem.<br />
<br />
Hope this works for you.

            Yeah baby, it works.<br />
<br />
Just pressed the down button and program never quit recording distance. Now as i remember it had always stopped tracking at the very border of the route screen. So that must be whats causing the crash.

            Yes it works for me to.<br />
<br />
Skiped the position view and started a run for 14 km. and was able to stop it to, but now I'm unable to open the saved training for reviewing, uploading and saving as a route.<br />
<br />
Any ideas ?

            I had the same problem but pressing the down button that changes the view (so that you don´t see the map anymore) solved the problem for me, so thanks for that! :D

            finally i'm all set for my 60mile ride I was planning with friend without the fear of it doing the damn stopping trick! N95 8gb suffers the same problem, once again if i remember correctly its always at the edge of the map, hopefully they fix it soon.

            Am I understanding you correctly that despite the "down-button-trick" described above your sports tracker keeps stopping?

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides deleting a site via the URL directly mentioned above, &nbsp;to delete a group site including group conversations, email messages, Yammer messages, files, calendar events, and any other related information, you can go to Outlook on the web and delete the
 related Office 365 group. You can find detailed information in the article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Delete-a-group-ca7f5a9e-ae4f-4cbe-a4bc-89c469d1726f?ui=en-US&amp;&amp;rs=en-US&amp;&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Delete a group</a>. Also, please pay attention to the<strong> WARNING</strong> in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For <span>“</span>I suggest that until Microsoft pulls their heads out of their behinds and fixes this, continue to use the classic sites only. However, there is no clear way to do this by default.<span>”</span>
