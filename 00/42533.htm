    <title>Microsoft Comments On LulzSec Info Exposure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> highlandrainbow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Comments On LulzSec Info Exposure</h2>
                    
<p>Microsoft has commented on LulzSec's posting of emails and addresses, some of which may be associated with Xbox Live accounts.
</p>
<p>Microsoft has sent us this comment on the data, which is an info dump and not a hack.</p>
<p><i>"This group appears to have posted a list of thousands of potential email addresses and passwords, and encouraged users to try them across various online sites like Xbox LIVE in the event one of the users happens to use the same
 password and email address combination.&nbsp; At this time we do not have any evidence Xbox LIVE has been compromised. However we take the security of our service seriously and work on an ongoing basis to improve it against evolving threats."</i></p>
<p><i><br />
</i></p>
<p>[Original Story]: Hacker group LulzSec has released emails and passwords for some people's Xbox Live account info, among other sites and services.</p>
<p>The group dumped a list of 62,000 emails and passwords on a file sharing site (the list has been taken down multiple times) for accounts of sites and services like Xbox Live, PayPal, WOW, and much more (confirmed on
<a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/LulzSec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LulzSec's Twitter</a>, even). We've also had one poor reader tell us the credit card attached to his Xbox Live account has already been hit for $100 and the account's password changed.</p>
<p>LulzSec has also been involved in attacks on <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/06/05/nintendo-servers-hacked.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nintendo</a>, <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/06/14/996517.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Minecraft, EVE Online</a>, and (of course) <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/06/02/963860.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Sony</a>, among others. And for those of you keeping score out there, hactivists Anonymous deal more in denial of service attacks, while exposing user info is one of LulzSec's deals. Whatever the method or rationale, though, it's annoying.</p>
<p>Just to clarify: LulzSec hasn't hacked Xbox Live, they've simply released people's emails and passwords that may pertain to an Xbox Live or PayPal or WOW, etc. account.</p>

<p>[/quote]And if my Aunt had a willy she'd be my Uncle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simple fact is that Microsoft informed their customers of a security breach almost immediately, Sony did not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So whether they would have done so if they had been the first to be breached in such a manner is a hypothetical scenario I can't comment on. I can only comment on what has happened.</p>

<p>At least until I perfect my Sliding machine.</p>

<p>First thing to&nbsp;check is your keyboard, your Caps Lock seems to be stuck. :o)</p>
<p>There is no Control Panel applet for the remote control in any version of Media Center, only some settings withing the MC interface itself.</p>
<p>What type of remote is it?</p>
<p>When you plug the IR receiver into a USB port, did you get any notice that it was recognized (sound, popup on screen)?</p>
<p>Have you tried plugging the receiver into a different USB port?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you're experiencing may have something to do with your theme or application that you're using. For us to isolate your concern, we would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does the issue happen to all the texts on any browsers or applications?</li><li>If the issue only shows on the TV, have you tried disconnecting and reconnecting it from the computer?</li><li>Does it also happen to the computer that you're using to connect to the TV?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            It happens on everything I've tried opening. I have not tried disconnection the T.v. (duh should have tried that :/ ) and we don't have another monitor to test it on right now, so I'm unsure if it is only this T.v. or not. I'll try disconnecting/reconnecting
 and come back with any news.

<h2>            windows 10 print problems</h2>
                    <p>after the last update of Win10 all printers have disappeared from devices and printers</p>
<p>they show all in Word, Excel etc. but nothing prints, an error message is displayed that there is a problem with the printer installation of windows
</p>
<p>it is not dependent on the driver or printer, pdf printing also doesn't work, the problem solver does not find anything</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I look with powershell get-printer, they are all there, if I look with the device manager, nothing there ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>spooler service and the dependent services all run ... I'm helpless now ...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I tried all three ways to fix, it doesn't help. </p>
<p>I also tried to reset the system to the status before the update, didn't help either except that now I need to re-install some apps like ThinkCell because they probably lost valid license info.</p>
<p>The driver update is not possible because the devices do not appear in the device manager ... but when I did the troubleshooter on hardware, a bunch of errors appeared in the event protocol because the system tried to install printer drivers of printers
 I never used (some Canon, HP etc. which are probably just in the Win10 distribution).</p>
<p>When I look in the event protocol , there is regularly an Print Service error with JournalPrint, error code 126 module jnwppr.dll</p>
<p>I don't know what that means, maybe just another (hidden) printer not working?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>no, didn't work either. I did a repair upgrade, roll-back to the Win10 anniversary update, a clean boot without all stuff etc., nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I found out that the ports used for the printers were messed up, I have two HP printers, a Color Laserjet 3600 and a PageWide477dw. The CLJ3600 is connected via Ethernet to the router, the print server in the printer is named vigor10, this is used
 for the port so that the printer does not disappear if the IP changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When looking in the assignment of the port called vigor10, the printer assigned was no longer the CLJ3600 but the HPPW477dw, this cannot work ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went offline, restartet the PC, deleted the port for the CLJ3600, and voila, all printers there and working, except the CLJ3600, which I cannot install any more. This worked without problems under Win10 Anniversary Edition, but not with the new build.
 Even installing with Win7 compatibility settings does not work, there seems to be a dll no longer working with Win10 (the error message shows a file hpdiu.exe not working, sometimes another msg shows, saying the the communication with the printer settings
 does not work any longer ...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer drivers itself are fine, I now use the printer via a workgroup Win7 PC. The CLJ3600 is several years old, so probably neither HP nor Microsoft will work on this, let's close the issue.</p>

            Hi Zawin,<br />
<br />
Which operating system is installed on the computer?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1:</b>&nbsp; I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />

<br />
<br />

            Hello Vijay, thanks for the response:<br />
I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium.<br />
<br />
I did the two Methods advise by you and nothing was fixed.<br />
However, I was told that replacing the damage .dll would fix the issue, which I don't know if thats the best solution to the problem.&nbsp; I went ahead and did replace it, and backup my original .dll.&nbsp; My anti-virus Norton 360 says the file is safe and is use by
 millions of people.&nbsp; After replacing the .dll from this website: http://windowallos.com/bbs/board.php?bo_table=winvis_ul_eng_x64&amp;wr_id=1505&nbsp; everything now runs fine, the programs I had trouble launching can now be launch.<br />
<br />
Yet, i don't know if this is the best solution, since I do want to evade future problems with my computer.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can replace the damaged dll file. If SFC scan does not fix the issue , that is the next solution that i would have provided.
<br />

    <title>Slow opening JPEGs - why did it happen and how was it magically - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thanatica  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow opening JPEGs - why did it happen and how was it magically solved&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since today's updates something weird happened. It's resolved now, but magically, so I don't know why the problem went away. I still want to know what could've caused this problem to occur, so I can remedy it when it happens next time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using ACDSee Classic to view jpegs. Yes, it's a very old program, but it works and it's incredibly fast. Faster than anything I've ever tried and I've tried them all. So switching to a different application is not an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also using XnView to view other filetypes that ACDSee doesn't support. It's a much slower program. But hey, can't have it all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since today's update, opening a JPEG directly by just doubleclicking it, caused a 5-10 second delay before ACDSee was even started. ACDSee itself wasn't being slow,
<strong>the delay happened before ACDSee even got started</strong>. Just to be clear. To further prove that, I started ACDSee from the start menu, and it started in a fraction of a second. browsing jpegs was as lightning fast as ever. But again, clicking any
 jpeg anywhere on the filesystem, caused this weird delay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the delay, the CPU usage was about 0%. Memory usage is around 8% (of 32GB). Disk usage was around 0MBps. Network usage was 0%. It's like the computer was just... waiting. But what was it waiting for?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even disabled real-time protection in Defender, but that didn't fix it. I even rebooted, that didn't fix it either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then, 5 minutes in from the second reboot, it was suddenly fast again. I promise, I did nothing that fixed it. I just kept trying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'd like to know:</p>
<p>1) How does such a delay happen ONLY for directly opening a file and ONLY for one program to do it with?</p>
<p>2) What magic happened that solved it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for next time this happens:</p>
<p>1) How can I diagnose a magical delay? How can I see what Windows is "waiting" for when it does?</p>
<p>2) How can I best give diagnostic information to MS when I figure out more details?</p>
<p>

            Hello luigi,<br />
<br />
A good way to free up space from the c drive would be if you moved all of your documents, videos and pictures to the f drive.<br />
<br />
To do this, click start, My Documents.<br />
<br />
Press control + a <br />
on your keyboard to select everything.<br />
Press control + x<br />
on your keyboard to copy everything.<br />
<br />
Click start, My Computer.<br />
Open f drive<br />
Make new folder called "my documents"<br />
Double click the folder you made.<br />
Right click in the emptey space and click paste.<br />
All your files should start copying.<br />
When complete, My Documents on the start menu should be emptey, and all your files should be on F:\My Documents.<br />
<br />
Click start, right click My Documents, click properties.<br />
Change the target to F:\my documents<br />
Click OK<br />
Now when you open my documents it should open the one on your F: drive.<br />
<br />
If you need to free up more space, click this thread and follow the instructions I gave:

<h2>            New Local User Not Appearing on Logon Screen</h2>
                    <p>I am having an issue with trying to add new local users in windows 10. I went into accounts/other people and add someone else to this pc and created a new local administrator. However when i log out or attempt to switch user no others appear in the bottom
 left apart from a "Other User", which was there before I added the new account. Whenever I click on it it prompts me to "Sign into your school or work account" with an email and password. I tried entering my microsoft account but it wouldn't log me in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a bit of searching around and the nearest thing i could come to a solution was given by the youtube video:&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qobIM7rvJM. However it had no effect, I checked and the task had successfully changed the registry value upon
 startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also made sure that Interactive logon: don't display last user was disabled in Local Group Policy editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am completely stumped and would greatly appreciate some help, thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Automatic lzw compression to TIFF files when editing details - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Automatic lzw compression to TIFF files when editing details</h2>
                    <p>I am having issues when editing metadata using Windows. This seem to happen in Win7, 8 and 10. It happens with uncompressed TIFF files.&nbsp; When I use windows right click-&gt;properties-&gt;details and change or add information the file is automatically compressed
 using LZW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know LZW can be lossless and I could theoretically go back and resave as uncompressed TIFF - but why does it happen and is there a way to stop it?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Aileen,</p>
<p>thanks for answering. I'm new to the forums so don't have a clear understanding of how all of this works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I ask a simple question about the issue and how best to find help? </p>
<p>
</p><p>As this issue seems to happen on all Windows computers (I've tried 3 - one running 7, one running 8 and one running 10) I'd classify it as either</p>
<ul>
<li>a bug or </li><li>a feature </li></ul>
<p>(i.e its not my setup which needs troubleshooting)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft chat help didn't answer my question but pointed me at this forum and some Win10 documentation :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me this is Microsoft's problem to answer - I don't have the time, knowledge or skill for researching the issue.</p>
<p>But chat is useless for this - they are obviously there to help with much more obvious, regular issues....or...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>The addition of the System Environment variable works, after a reboot. &nbsp;But it will not uncompress any TIFF already compressed by LZH. &nbsp;I just tested it. &nbsp;And make sure that whatever software application you are using to save your TIFFs are set to save without
 compression. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This was on Windows 10, but the variable should work on 7, 8.1, and 10.</p>

<h2>            Stereo Headset warranty, replace</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I would like to know, if there is any way how to replace Stereo Headset?<br />
If I would go to Repair and service center, there is no option to choose stereoheadset, only headset.<br />
<a href="https://s11.postimg.org/64bz7yafl/stereo1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://s11.postimg.org/64bz7yafl/stereo1.png<br />

<br />
</a>Is this only mistake or is it on purpose?</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for answer<br />

<p>NeoGTI, your mic not working isn't the headset, I'd bet on it. A ton of us are having the exact same problem sonce microsoft's september update.</p>
<p>I've tried 3 different mics (one of them literally brand new in the box) on multiple different controllers, and the actual microphone doesn't work on any of them after that update.</p>
<p>The issue is on microsoft's end, not ours.</p>

<p>don't pay them they know about their controllers and problems with mic's. they just don't care. they will give u all sorts of stuff to do, but in the end it will be send in for repair or buy new one. just read these forums</p>

<h2>            I have to input my product key every time I restart my PC&#33;</h2>
                    I purchased an upgrade copy of Windows 7 via a student email offer.&nbsp; I upgraded my PC from XP Pro to Win 7 Pro.&nbsp; Almost every time I&nbsp;restart, a window pops up saying my copy of windows is invalid of not activated.&nbsp; After entering my product key the note
 at the bottom right of my desktop stating "this copy of windows is not valid" goes away and everything is fine.&nbsp; It's not like I am installing new hardware every time I shut my PC down, but it seems as though this is what windows is seeing.&nbsp; Any suggestions
 to resolve this issue?

            Sounds like a time out session is taking place on the Servers that handle product activation. Try doing a manual activation.<br />
<br />
1. Click Start, and in the Search box type :&nbsp; slui.exe 4<br />
<br />
2. Press ENTER on your Keyboard<br />
<br />
3. Select your Country.<br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, and hold on for a real person. <br />
<br />
You can re-enter your key by going to Start, type “slui.exe 3” in the search box and press enter.

<p>
When you create a backup using Windows Backup, you should use the Restore Files wizard to restore the files. If you can't use the Restore Files wizard (for example, when you're using a computer that’s not running Windows Vista or Windows&nbsp;7), you can manually
 extract files from a backup by following these steps:</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></span>Open the location where your backup is saved.</p>
<p>
The files in your backup are saved as zip files.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the backup file (a file with the Windows Backup icon and the name of your computer), and then click
<strong>Open</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>To manually extract files that are larger than 200 MBs</strong></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If a file is larger than 200 MBs, it will be split into multiple zip files. You will need to extract and then combine these files following these steps:</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></span>Open the location where your backup is saved.</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the zip files that contain the file you want to extract. For example, if you're trying to extract a video file named
<em>BirthdayParty</em>, you would find the zip files that contain files with that name.
</li><li>Create a folder on your desktop to extract the files to.
</li></ol>
<p>
Since the files all have the same name, you'll need to rename them as you extract them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Extract the first file into the folder you created on your desktop and then rename the file.
</li></ol>
<p>
Repeat this step until you have extracted all of the files, making sure that you name them similarly. For example, if you have four files for the BirthdayParty video, name them
<em>BirthdayParty1</em>, <em>BirthdayParty2</em>, <em>BirthdayParty3</em>, and <em>
BirthdayParty4</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Command Prompt window by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button. In the search box, type <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then, in the list of results, click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>. </li><li>Type the following command:
<strong>copy /b </strong><em>filename</em><strong>*.</strong><em>file_extension new_filename</em><strong>.</strong><em>file_extension</em>
</li></ol>
<p>
For example, <strong>copy /b BirthdayParty*.avi BirthdayPartyAll.avi</strong></p>

How we can rectify this?&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d13d21dc-89b3-4113-8623-e0e10eaeceb4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d13d21dc-89b3-4113-8623-e0e10eaeceb4" /></a></p>

<p>Are you trying to do all these updates at the same time?</p>
<p>Will your Internet handle that much traffic?</p>
<p>You might want to restart Windows Update</p>
<p>Go Task Manager (Ctrl+Alt+Delete) Services, Windows Update, right click and Restart.</p>
