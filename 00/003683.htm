<p>
</p><p>For&nbsp; along time now I see very slow sending times of those emails - today for example I sent one mail at 3:01 as test mail and I received it on 3:26.</p>

            Hello Ruben,<br />
<br />
Earlier, there had been an outage that affected our users in sending or receiving emails using Outlook.com. Our engineering team was able to resolve the outage as of September 19, 2017, at 1:25 AM UTC. Our engineers have confirmed that all emails are being
 sent and received as expected, and emails that were supposed to be sent or received during the outage are going to be delivered over the next few hours.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, we suggest that you perform the necessary troubleshooting for issues with sending emails. Here's an article that you can visit to see how to do it:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Outlook-com-won-t-let-me-send-an-email-62de1f9b-6552-4239-8578-078d292bb31a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook.com won't let me send an email</a>.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes and if you need further assistance feel free to post back.

<p>As I said, and I am so sad that people just don't read the posts - its not a problem of one day, this has been haunting me for more than 2 months - sending of an email using non outlook.com senderaddrress takes min 30 min to send the message - that's that
 not normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be able to use outlook.com and its features on my iphone and ipad</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got even more info - first mail, after enabling the account, works as it should, second and the rest is a mess. As if you guys activate a filter to hold those mails back, after the first mail appears<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like soemthing you guys know about</p>

<p>Hi Ruben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a few factors that could cause a delay in sending or receiving emails like a nearly full message capacity or a maintenance done on any servers. That being said, we would like to know if have you done the steps indicated
 on the link that was posted on the previous post?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first few steps on the article maybe basic, yet by performing these few checks, it would be able to determine the reason why you are getting that delay.<br />
<br />
First of would be checking if are there any maintenance on your area which would be a big key factor in getting emails. You could have this confirmed by checking the
<strong><a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">service status</a></strong> for your Outlook.com email, and the service status of your
<strong>Internet Service Provider (ISP)</strong>. By doing such, this would give us an idea if where is the end point of what's causing the delay.<br />
<br />
Another factor that could cause this is an <strong>Inbox</strong> nearing it's capacity or emails that are stuck on your
<strong>Outbox</strong>. Thus, a sweep as mentioned on the article is best advised to free up some space on your emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if the rest of the steps on the support site have been done, we suggest that you
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a new user profile</a></strong> named as
<strong>Test</strong> on your <strong>Windows</strong>, and then use a different browser in accessing your
<strong>Outlook.com</strong> email and test if the issue is re-occurring. If it does, then this mean that your current user profile's
<strong>PowerShell</strong> is corrupted which needs to be replaced with a new one as a broken
<strong>PowerShell</strong> affects the basic functionalities of programs and so as it's performance. If that would be the case it is best advised to have your personal files, bookmarks moved to new user profile.<br />
<br />
If this still occurs on a different user profile, we suggest that you uninstall and reinstall your other browsers and get the most update versions of your browsers, compatible to your
<strong>Windows</strong> as this could also be plausible to a browser issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, feel free to reply to this post so we can assist you further.</p>

            My suspiscion is that your exchange is exchange only on the receiving side and that sending is executed internally every 30 minutes - thats incredible. I am paying for Office 365 and can¨t get my mails sent in realtime - only MS can think of something
 like that

            Hello Gavin,<br />
<br />
In Outlook, you can retrieve and search all emails that you sent to a specific email address by using the
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Find-a-message-or-item-with-Instant-Search-69748862-5976-47b9-98e8-ed179f1b9e4d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Advanced Find feature</a></strong>. This will allow you to set up a criteria when searching
 emails in your email folders.&nbsp; May we know if you tried this feature in Outlook?

<h2>            Need to unblock an account</h2>
                    <p>My husband's email and outlook accounts have been blocked because Microsoft says they have been tampered with.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is traveling in the US (we live in Mexico) and needs access to his account.&nbsp; I am trying to help but I am not a Techie and did the wrong thing
 (several times) when instructed to request a new security code.&nbsp; Now Microsoft has told me I cannot get another security code because I've requested too many today.&nbsp; My bad !&nbsp; But that doesn't help my husband get his account unlocked.&nbsp; Is there any way anyone
 can help me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no interest in scamming or defrauding anyone.&nbsp; I just need for my husband to be able to access his own account.</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp; Mrs. Grant</p>

                    <span>i have a Cingular/ATT 8525 (HTC Hermes) and a HP ipaq 510<br />
the 8525 has WM5 and the HP has WM6<br />
I have 2 PC's, one with Windows XP SP2 and a laptop w/Vista<br />
<br />
I'd like to maintain 1 Outlook (contacts, calender etc) on all devices and computers<br />
I'd like to make changes to any of them and they sync with computers/devices based on what is the latest entry<br />
<br />
How/where to i specify what(PC) will sync with what(mobile device)<br />
<br />
How should i go about setting these items up?<br />
<br />
I seem to have the HP working w/both computers, and now i want to start using my ATT phone.<br />

Can this be done <br />

            dun worry bro... N85 is still consider as a new flagship in Nokia. so definately it would have many updates available in the coming days. just like the old flagship N95(8GB). imagine, N95 launched 2 years ago. even until today, they are releasing firmware
 for it. this tells us that, Nokia always care much on its flagship phones... so very very soon, u may meet the update for ur N85.

            could be, could not be. usually there are screenshots/videos of the new firmware circulating on internet sites a couple of weeks before the actual firmware gets released via NSU or FOTA. but according to recent device upgrade paths for other devices, such
 as N96/N78/N81/5800, v20/v21 should be out soon for N79/N85, i'd count on it.<br />

<p>If you have accepted the Outlook.com preview through your live.com address, then from you small settings icon in the upper right corner select "More mail settings." Once you are here, under the Managing Your Account heading select "Rename Your Email Address."
 From here you can create a new address at outlook.com. They say to give it around 48 hours until it fully updates in the system.</p>

            <p>When you rename your email address, your new ID works just like your old one. Your new mail will go to your inbox, and you can choose to keep your old mail in a separate folder. All of your other Microsoft account info—like contacts, photos and Office docs
 on SkyDrive—will also switch to your new address within a few days. </p>

<p><strong>PS : i did not get an dialog box asking where i want my old emails to go</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : there is no new folder in my new id where i can find my old emails
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hii am facing a three pronged problem</p>
<p>Here is what i did</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I renamed my <strong><em>(remove for security purposes)</em></strong>account to
<strong><em>(remove for security purposes)</em></strong>while i was doing this i was alco trying all the options and it seems that outlook first changed my @msn id to @hotmail.co.in but as the browser displayed "temporarily not available" i though even that
 id was not available so&nbsp; i tried the @line.in id and it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So i think i changed my account from <strong><em>(remove for security purposes)</em></strong>to
<strong><em>(remove for security purposes)</em></strong>&nbsp; to <strong><em>(remove for security purposes)
</em></strong>Though i am not sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is </p>
<p>The emails i send to my @msn.com id do not come in my @live.in account. i have tried it several times but it just doesn't show there.</p>
<p>(although it shows in my windows live email client where i have not yet updated the new email id as well the new password)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not able to see my old emails from my @msn.com in my @live.in account online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to know what will happen to the emails which i will recieve in my @msn.com account in future as it is very critical that i get my emails delivered.</p>
<p>I do not see @msn.com as any alias in my account settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot use my @msn account anymore and cannot access its mailbox online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly look into this and provide me a solution as how to be able to view my previous emails online as well recieve future emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS : i did not gte an dialog box asking where i want my old emails to go</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : there is no new folder in my new id where i can find my old emails </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

Rename your account to an @outlook.com account
<p>You can rename your account to an @outlook.com account, and when you do, your old account becomes an alias, so you'll still receive email sent to the old account.</p>
<p>Fair warning: Renaming is a big deal. It changes the primary name of your account, which means that you will have to immediately start signing in with the new name (same password) on all your devices, such as your phone, PC, Xbox, etc.</p>
<p>Renaming an account is not something that you can easily "undo"; in fact, there are some cases where it's impossible to undo. So, please be very sure of your decision before following the steps below.</p>
<p>Also, there are some limitations of rename that you should be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use a Windows Phone, you will need to <b>reset your Windows Phone</b> to factory settings, and then set it back up with the new account name. You will lose all personal data on the Windows Phone when you do this, so make sure you have that data backed
 up. You will need to re-install all your applications on your phone, although you will
<b>not</b> need to re-purchase them.</li><li>It is not easy (and in rare cases not possible) to "undo" a rename. For example, if you rename an MSN account, you can't rename it back, or if you created your account in one country and are renaming it in a different country, you won't be able to rename
 it back to your original account unless you travel back to your original country. Be very sure of your decision.</li><li>If your account has been blocked more than once because someone else was using your account, you will not be able to rename it. We're working to remove this limitation.</li><li>You can rename your account twice every 12 months. If you rename and then change your mind, renaming back into your old address doesn't count towards your yearly limit.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will escalate this thread.</p>

            That still doesn't solve my problem.<br />
<br />
I did not get nay new folder which contains my old emails<br />
<br />
I am not able to receive emails to my old @msn.com id.<br />
<br />
Why did microsoft create this new service ? How has thsi revolutionised Hotmail ?<br />
<br />
It has only cretaed problems for us who stayed with Hotmail even when the world was moving towards Gmail.<br />
<br />
I have been using this account for 9 years now, and now this is what i get , one click and all emails are lost ?<br />
<br />
This will only frustrate genuine customers.!<br />
<br />
Please restore my emails ASAP. Its a major part of my life. I have used this account everywhere, my bank accounts, my job, my everything !..<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now my problem is </p>
<p>1.) i am not able to view my emails from my @msn.com account anywhere.</p>
<p>2.) The emails that are sent to my @msn.com account are not reaching my new @live.in account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can please adress these two issues i will be grateful to you.</p>
<p><strong>PS: : i did not get an dialog box asking where i want my old emails to go</strong></p>

<h2>            add to safe sender&#39;s list not working every time</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I've got an intermittent (Outlook 2013 x64, on Windows 8.1), problem adding to the Safe Sender's List</p>
<p>I have several "regular" (non-spam) emails, which&nbsp;Outlook dutifully prevents downloading pictures "to protect my privacy".</p>
<p>I really do want to see the pictures, so, I click on the message, and select either "add the sender", or "add the domain" to the Safe Sender's list</p>
<p>Problem is that although I can now see the pictures in the email, if I then view the Junk mail options / Safe Sender's list, sometimes the sender / domain has been added, and sometimes it hasn't been added.</p>
<p>Any suggestions ?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>btw. this is a clean install, and I have two POP email accounts both delivering to the same .PST file&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes to the 2nd question, but the next time I start Outlook, and look at an email from the same person/domain, the pictures&nbsp;go back to being blocked&nbsp;(because the email account is not in the safe sender's list)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I currently only&nbsp;have about ten addresses/domains in the Safe Sender's list - there should be many&nbsp;more&nbsp;</p>

<p>Outlook 2016 on Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same problem</p>
<p>Ex: every time email from Audible.com is opened, pictures are blocked. The domain is already on whitelist. Seems whitelist/safe senders is being ignored for some domains.<br />
</p>
<p>Click "Add the domain..." will show the pics for current session, but close &amp; reopen Outlook and again the pics are blocked for any Audible.com emails.</p>

</p><p>In the new Skype application v.8 for iOS devices, you can check if a contact is online in the
<strong>chat window</strong>. If the contact is online, the status will show as <strong>
ACTIVE NOW</strong> meanwhile, when they signed out the status will show as <strong>
LAST SEEN </strong>and how long ago he/she was online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that users would want to see which contacts are online or not and our developers are currently working on this. Thank you for providing us feedbacks and please stay tuned for further updates!<br />

<p>why did you guys release a completely new version when it is not stable and with so many features missing compared to the old one?</p>
<p>please re-establish features like filtering who is on line/all/groups etc. and please remove that full screen button in the middle of the screen. With all the space available, you had to put it in the middle of the damn screen!</p>

<p>It is actually amazing.&nbsp; As if they tried to kill the product. To make this the final widescale release and not some limited beta to test was insane.&nbsp; I love "our developers are working on this" - when did this become a non-critical feature - how are we

<p>Yeah, mine just updated automatically and it is horrendous to put it nicely... What you described is exactly the first thing I've noticed. At a cursory glance with the previous version I knew exactly who was on with the simple green/yellow dots. While trying
 to find any settings to fix this I noticed it has been dumbed down and the layout for all the settings were unintuitive. The fact that this thread is so old and nothing has been done is even more disappointing. So I'll just uninstall and use discord I guess...
 Thanks for the update?</p>

            Former versions of Skype were much easier for the uneducated such as myself.&nbsp; Do not like this new version for at a glance one does not see who is online.&nbsp; It appears one must scroll the list.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know there are some online as I type this, but not readily
 seen.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have skype for Windows 10 and if Microsoft do not make this more user friendly I doubt myself or my friends will be using it.

<p>It is for me a mystery that software engineers can forget important aspects of the application. On the "old" skype, you could easily see who of the contact is online. Moreover I could select to see only the list with contacts that are online. The new version
 is missing those simple, obvious features. Such oversights should not slip through with a good project leader. I am disappointed to hear that now (after many complaints) action is taken.</p>

<h3> bezelbro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharepoint Group Calendar&#58; How to add people&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I created a link to a "Company Calendar" on our home page. &nbsp;I synced my Outlook calendar to this one, and my co-worker has done the same. &nbsp;While we can easily drag our events over to the "group" calendar I cannot view his events unless I select him from
 the Selector tab on the ribbon. &nbsp;When I try to add people or groups using this function, each group is empty except for this one:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I just want a calendar in which the managers can sync their events, and everyone else can view them. &nbsp;Can any help would be appreciated. &nbsp;<br />

            Hi BeaelBro,<br />
<br />
First, please make sure you have <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-a-Group-Calendar-7f559b2e-1f90-49b4-a0fe-2d235994945e#__toc246747821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">configured the calendar as
 a group calendar</a></span>. Then click Week Group under Calendar tab &gt; in the Add Person blank, type the name of the person or group whose calendar you want to view and then click the check names icon. You can also click the browse icon, and search for the
 person or group. Note: the group can be used must be an SharePoint group.<br />
<br />
E.g. There is a site named <strong>Test</strong>, and there is a SharePoint group named
<strong>Test Member </strong>in the site. Frank and Spike are the members in the Test Member group. When I add the Test Member group, there will show Frank and Spike separately as following:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36f73040-a634-4f57-8140-f5dd89e6431e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36f73040-a634-4f57-8140-f5dd89e6431e" /></a><br />
<br />
If it cannot work, I would like to confirm the following information:<br />
<br />
1. The detailed steps you did to sync Outlook calendar to SharePoint.<br />
2. What is the group you want to add?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<p>I followed the steps on Microsoft's page prior and when trying to add people via the box you've highlighted I can do so (even though I must enter their name before anything shows up at all). &nbsp;My problem is that if I create a Calendar View and set the filter
 set to this...</p>

<p>
</p><p>...where the blocked out section is "GroupName" (without quotes), not only does the group not show up when going back to the calendar, but adding people to the calendar that are in that group also do no show their events presumably because of the filter.
 &nbsp;I would just like to add a group to the filter and set that as default so that when the respective members visit their webpage they immediately see their team's events.</p>

            If I set the filter in the same manner it does not automatically add these people to the calendar. &nbsp;If I wanted to create a group calendar so that each member can see when each other is off/on vacation, etc. it does not seem feasible to add each person
 to this filter, nor them to have to enter the names of their department or their group name each time they'd like to view the calendar. &nbsp;Does SharePoint out-of-the-box support this function?

            Hi BeaelBro,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your clarification.<br />
<br />
There is no out-of-box feature to do this in SharePoint online. And I suggest you post a new thread in our
 forum</a></span> if there are any workaround for you.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your understanding.<br />

<h2>            Double booking a room mailbox</h2>
                    <p>I've set up several room calendars with the settings that I thought would allow it to be double booked. In Exchange Admin I've checked the box for allow conflicts and changed the allow up to this number and this percentage to 100.</p>
<p>I even ran the PS script equivalent of checking the allow conflicts box.</p>
<p>And yet when I try to book a room a 2nd time for the same date and time, the room disappears from the list when setting the location of the meeting. It appears when I select a
 different time but it won't allow me to double book it.</p>
<p>What other settings can I check/scripts I can run to allow the room calendars to allow double booking?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<a href="https://www.shapechef.com/blog/ripped-paper-effect-in-powerpoint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a>, the <strong>Merge Shapes&gt;Subtract</strong> command is only available in Powerpoint 2013 and 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, you could edit the bitmap in an image editor and create a torn page effect by adding a ragged transparent area to the image.</p>

<p>Thanks John - yeah I was playing around and came across the Shape Fill...Picture method myself. For the torn page effect, I created a rectangle shape, used a Free Form cookie cutter shape for the serrated edge and then Subtract from the merge shapes tool
 set (works Ok in PP2010). Then you just fill that shape with the picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NB. Filling a circle with a rectangular picture does work in the same way but you have less control over what appears in the circle ie. it appears to work from the centre of the bitmap to the centre of the circle.</p>

            Thank you very much for the reply. I checked the article and it seems to work for some and not others. Shame it's such a lengthy process too, the windows computers accept iPhones no problem. My contract ends in 10months, just need to hold out until I can
 start with an android phone.

            <p>I don't have a Mac to double-check the nerdy instructions on the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Transfer via the cloud is another option? Upload the files from the Mac to your Microsoft account at
<a href="http://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onedrive.live.com/</a> then download through the OneDrive app on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Files in \Music on OneDrive should appear automatically in the Xbox Music player on the phone and download when played. I haven't tried with aac files or other files types, only mp3, so YMMV. -&nbsp;In any case, make sure the files are properly tagged, so it
 can be indexed by artist, album and track name on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Default folders for other file types should be there already, and Windows phone may create other folders and sub-folders on the go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft have OneDrive and Office apps for both iPhone and Android in the respective app stores, so it should be relatively painless to shift later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you get it sorted out.</p>

            Hello BARRIEMELLOR1,
<br />
<br />I understand that you have accidentally triggered Magnifier by keyboard shortcuts by <code>Wins</code>+<code>+</code> shortcut. I know how annoying it can be and I will try my best to help you to resolve this.
<br />
<br />You can disable Windows Magnifier by the following keyboard shortcut: <code>Wins</code>+<code>Esc</code>
<br />
<br />Cheers!

    <title>A video chat enquiry - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harrishamilton  say:</h3>
<h2>            A video chat enquiry</h2>
                    Hey, I'm a writer and I've been having this issue about skype in a novel I'm writing and would like to ask you guys if you can help justify it. In a scene of mine, the situation is that the skype video chat was on but the caller had forgotten he'd it turned
 on so when he remembered, he turned it off but the issue is, can such video be recovered( the receiver also didn't receive it, t'was just the webcam on), talking about retrieving for a crime scene investigation and if so, could the audio feature of it also
 be retrieved or not. Thanks.

            It can be recovered only if recording facility of Skype was made ON to record the call. Otherwise, it can't be recovered. It can be recorded either by caller or by callee. This is not ON by default, hence has to be made ON for each and every call.

            Video recording would have to be manually activated from the (+) menu. Also, when its activated, both you and the person you are calling are made aware. 
<br />
<br />Here is how video calling works in Skype:

    <title>Insertion point on &#34;CTRL-N&#34; , new email or Reply&#47;Reply All - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Insertion point on &#34;CTRL-N&#34; , new email or Reply&#47;Reply All</h2>
                    <p>When I use any method above to create or respond to an email, the behavior has recently changed. The insertion bar focus is not in the body of the new screen; email or reply. When using New, the insertion bar blinks once in the To: filed then disappears.
 Same with Reply or Reply All. It is a small thing, but I am so accustomed to New, Type Name that the extra mouse click to return focus back the email is driving me crazy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is new issue with in the last 2 weeks or so. Most recent updates installed on 5/11/16. This is a new Surface so there were many updates in the first month.

            <p>Thank you for the reply and correction with respect to the behavior. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Stating Outlook in Safe mode does remove the problem; the insertion point and focus is as expected in all cases.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled all of the Add-ins and started Outlook again. Results are as expected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I enabled each Add-in one at time and tested. It appears that the Dynamics CRM, also Microsoft application, is the&nbsp;culprit. When it is enabled, the insertion point focus problem returns.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question now then, is this an Outlook issue? CRM issue? To whom do I turn for resolution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, </p>
