    <title>Outlook 2013 64bit not prompting to accept security certificate - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 64bit not prompting to accept security certificate</h2>
                    I just installed the Windows 8.1 preview as well as re-installed Microsoft Office through through Office 365 subscription, since doing this I am unable to connect to my IMAP mail server using SSL.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Previously this worked fine, upon starting Outlook - I would be prompted to accept a security warning as the the host I am connecting to does not match. I also have Outlook setup on another computer that is working fine and on an Android phone both using
 SSL on incoming and outgoing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since the update/re-install Outlook no longer prompts me to accept or deny the certificate warning instead it fails to connect almost immediately saying the encryption type is not supported.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Are there any settings I am overlooking either with Outlook or Windows 8 (8.1) that suppresses this security warning?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For additional details, I am also not running any other security software other then what comes with Windows 8 (Firewall &amp; Defender) which I have already attempted disabling. The other other devices mentioned are also running on the same network, so I
 know the ports are not being blocked on the router.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cheers,</div>
<div>Tim&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hello, <br />
I'm getting the same problem, SSL email connections worked without problems using win8 + outlook 2013 but after updating to win 8.1 they just will not connect.<br />
<br />
The same settings currently work on my phone and tablet so there is no problem with the SSL connection or the email account.<br />
<br />
I've tried both removing and re-adding the account and creating a new profile, both without success.<br />
<br />
I've also tried connecting under a "clean boot" and with no firewall/anti-virus enabled. I've done a quick repair and an online repair of office through program and features.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The error messages after trying to add an account are…</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Log onto incoming mail server (IMAP): A secure connection to the server cannot be established.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Send test e-mail message: Your server does not support the connection encryption type you have specified. Try changing the encryption method. Contact your mail server administrator or Internet service provider (ISP) for additional assistance.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are no items in office events logs that have anything to do with connection errors.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If there’s anything else I can send or try let me know.</p>
<p><br />

            Sorry for the late reply, I thought I had already!
<div><br />
<div>Attempting to communicate with the server results in a couple different error messages from time to time but the jist of it is</div>
<div>"Log onto incoming mail server (IMAP): A secure connection to the server cannot be established.".</div>
<div><br />
<div>prior to the original post, I had already preformed a clean boot as well as created a new mail profile under outlook with no change.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As my mail server is using a self-signed certificate, It still comes down to not being prompted with the security certificate to accept the connection which seems to be why it is being refused.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did not have this trouble prior to Upgrading to Windows 8.1 Preview and re-installing Office 365, I can't say with certainty but I believe it was working after the Windows 8.1 Preview upgrade, it wasn't until after I re-installed Office that it stopped
 prompting me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Connecting to the server without SSL works without an issue. As does connecting to the Server using SSL under Windows 8 on another machine, Gmail, and a couple applications on an Android device.</div>

<br />
Thank you replying.<br />
<br />
Let's uncheck SSL connection and then try performing Send/Receive an verify the result:<br />
<br />
1) Open Outlook &gt;&nbsp;go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Account Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Account Settings</strong>.<br />
2) Double click on the email account&nbsp;&gt; <strong>More Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong> &gt; click on the drop down option for
<strong>'Use the following type of encrypted connection</strong> and select&nbsp;<strong>None</strong>.<br />
3)&nbsp;Now&nbsp;click on <strong>OK</strong> &gt; <strong>Next</strong> and&nbsp;verify whether Outlook can connect to the incoming and outgoing mail server. If it connects, click on OK &gt; Finish and perform Send/Receive and check.<br />
<br />
Hope the above information helps. Reply with the result for further assistance.<br />

Hi Daniel,

<div>I have already verified that the connection to the mail server is working when not using SSL, it is only with SSL enabled that it fails to prompt me to accept the security certificate.</div>

Are you having issues with the Incoming server or Outgoing server. I was able to use 993 with SSL for incoming and outgoing 587 with TSL without any issues.
<br />
<br />
Try changing the outgoing server settings to use TSL and use port 587 with your gmail account verify the results.

            sorry but if you read the thread you'll see that i did not mention gmail, it is not a gamil account. 993 is the standard port for ssl and outlook uses it as default.<br />
This seems to be a problem with certificates not ports.<br />

<h2>            Link levels from more than one custom List Style to a Single style</h2>
                    <div><i>Note: My overall objective is to create an MS Word (2010) doc (template) with the following two characteristics:</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>#1 ability to easily toggle between Print Layout view and Outline view <u>
without any loss of outline structure or appearance</u> (i.e. indents, paragraph formatting, font formatting, etc., all preserved).</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>#2 ability to easily toggle between an outline with <u>predefined numbering/bullets</u> and one with
<u>no numbering/bullets</u></i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>I'm delighted to say that characteristic #1 has been achieved (thanks to <b>

<b><a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Shauna Kelly</a></b>). The following question relates to characteristic #2:</i></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hello,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>According to&nbsp;<i><b><a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Shauna Kelly</a></b></i>, it is critical, when creating a custom List Style, to link each level in the List Style to a style (from the Styles Panel):&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>Home menu &gt; Multilevel List &gt; Define New List Style &gt; Format &gt; Numbering &gt; [Modify Multilevel List box] &gt; Click level to modify &gt; Link level to style</i></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In the example provided in her instructions, she linked levels 1 thru 9 to the existing styles "Heading 1" thru "Heading 9" respectively. I did the same with my first custom List Style (the one
<i>without</i> numbering).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In creating the second custom List Style (<i>with</i> numbering), I again linked each of the nine levels to "Heading 1" thru "Heading 9" respectively. I assumed this was appropriate or even perhaps needed so that each level in one form (unnumbered List
 Style) would correctly "map" to the corresponding level in the other form (numbered List Style).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, much to my disappointment, I discovered that doing this, caused the un-linking of the "Heading...#" Styles in the first custom List Style. The message it seemed, is that within a single doc, a given Style can only be linked to a single List Style.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>One thing I attempted in hopes of getting around the problem was googling to find
<a href="http://www.extendoffice.com/documents/word/1004-word-import-styles.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
instructions for importing a custom List Style</a> from one MS Word doc to another. My hope was that if I imported each List Style from a separate source doc, I could get them to coexist peacefully (without pillaging already-created links from one another).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Unfortunately however, as I was importing the second List Style, a pop-up message...uh..."popped up" asking if I wanted to overwrite each of the "Heading #" links. That told me that Word was on to me and not about to put up with my back-door shenanigans.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And it was evident, once again, that I need suggestions rather than shenanigans. &nbsp;:P</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div><br />

            To see indents in Outline view you must assign "Outline levels" to the different styles (level 1 to the top level style, level 2 to the next lower level style, etc.). This has already been done for the built-in headings.<br />
<br />
In the Modify Style dialog box, click Format, Paragraph to find the "Outline level" setting.

    <title>6303i Classic keeps downloading packed data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kalotina---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            6303i Classic keeps downloading packed data</h2>
                    
<p>As i&nbsp;was not planning&nbsp;to use my new phone for regular internet connection&nbsp;i was surprised&nbsp; to find out that approximately once a day it was downloading -don't know what - and therefore charging me ...the quick fix before i found what application was trying
 to run -i haven't knowingly setup anything- was to bar GPRS until i figure something out...one obvious setting&nbsp;that i&nbsp;changed was&nbsp;"packed data connection" to "when needed" rather than "all the time"...so what happens now is that several times a day the phone
 is beeping because it tries to connect to GPRS and can't....any ideas welcome...any obvious applications that i could have turned on unintentionally ?</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>tina</p>

<p>I have exactly the same problem with this phone on Vodafone. It was downloading tiny amounts of data (0.16Kb) in the nighttime. I do not want internet/email. Many calls to 'customer service' later they say they have stopped internet access but the phone
 nows bleeps and says 'packet data not available' which wakes me up in the night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see others are having the same problem - any advice gratefully received!</p>

Select from following:<br />
When needed — Establish the packet data connection only when an application needs<br />
it. The connection is closed when the application is closed

<p>Thanks but staff in vodafone shop have already tried that - I guess it is some application on the phone trying to update itself, so the app. starts up and then finds it cannot now connect so it bleeps and gives the error message. I do not know how to find
 out what the app. may be (if that is what it is!).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems vodafone have no idea and are suggesting it is a Nokia thing. Have to turn phone off at night now.</p>

<h2>            How to open pst files without having to use Outlook to open them&#63;</h2>
                    I have thousands of Outlook messages as I have been using Outlook for decades.&nbsp; I have several PST files and would like to be able to open for searching, etc but am told I can open them only with Outlook. (I use Outlook 2016)&nbsp; I remember in the past I
 was able to open and read them directly on the PC without having to use Outlook.&nbsp;

<p>Many thanks.&nbsp; You're right.&nbsp; I checked two of them and find that while with these two utilities I will be able to open and view but not save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am trying to do is to save my entire PST files to the hard drive for me to review at a later date and delete if necessary, email by email or sender by sender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to ditch Outlook altogether because it is too difficult to transfer to another computer and a different&nbsp; email server. But I don't want to ditch any of my messages - yet.</p>

            There has never been a direct way to view and manipulate .PST files from the operating system without Outlook.&nbsp; You'll need Outlook or an email client like
<a href="https://www.emclient.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">eM Client</a> that will import .PST files to have the access you want to them.

<h2>            Msn live and texting on my T-Mobile wing &#40;windows mobile 6&#41;</h2>
                    Hi I'm having issues with msn live and normal sms texting. When I activate msn live everything works fine. Until I get a text message.... and my wing crashes. This happens every time I have msn up and running. Does anyone know a fix for this? Or has anyone
 had&nbsp;similar&nbsp;problems? Is it a&nbsp;sync&nbsp;problem? I'm confused and T-Mobile doesn't seem to have any&nbsp;answers. Thanks for any help.

            I have 22.34 mb main memory. Yes I have tried both soft and hard resets with the same thing happening. I think it has something to do with syncing contacts with messenger or displaying msn live on my home screen but I can't pinpoint it. I am convinced
 that it is msn that is&nbsp;conflicting&nbsp;with sms / mms texting on my wing. It's the only program that&nbsp;causes&nbsp;a crash when I receive a text... and only when I RECEIVE a text message.

<h2>            How to deactivate&#47;cancel a second outlook email account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have my hotmail and alias outlook emails.&nbsp; Today I tried creating a new email account all together for someone else, on my computer.&nbsp; It is complicated to do so because it asks for security codes that I was having sent to my original alias outlook address.&nbsp;
 It does not seem to let me get out of it so I decided to just close/cancel/deactivate this new email but all I find as help is how to cancel my microsoft account.&nbsp; I DON'T want to close my microsoft account, just the last outlook account that I just created
 to start over!!&nbsp; How do I do this please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try opening my email the window from the new email I created opens up and asks for security verification but once it is verified it asks me again the same process.&nbsp; I even got a long code with letters and numbers but I cannot even use that code because
 the codes for security verification are just 7 numbers!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I go back to just using my original hotmail and not have this verification screen come up from the new email?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, I am not very good with technology and thought it would be easy to just create a brand new email for someone else on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help,&nbsp;</p>

            If you don't complete the new account process, it will die on its own in 10 days. 
<br />
<br />If its interfering with your logging in to your own account, is there a sign out button? Can you log into your account ok using a private browser session?

            I'd suggest trying to repair the installation to see if that fixes it. 
<br />
<br />The instructions to follow to do this are here:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Try following one by one as check after every step whether it resolves the issue-
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.
<br />
<br />Now open Excel and see if the problem disappears or not. 
<br />
<br />Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
<br />Open Excel &gt; ALT+F11 &gt; If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window &gt; Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter &gt; You will have your path below.
<br />
<br />3. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />4. Try to login through another Windows profile. If there is some corruption in profile which is causing this problem, this would correct.
<br />
<br />5. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.
<br />
<br />6. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus  etc. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start Outlook. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this. 
<br />Refer to the section - How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot. 
<br />Don't forget to do - Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />7. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:
<br />Open Excel &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration' &gt; Click Ok and restart Excel.

            what version are you on now on the e71? (*#0000#)<br />
<br />
my understanding is that others are having issues with the most recent update on the e71, much like the e72.<br />
<br />
this may actually be a lucky issue for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
also, what version of computer are you using? is it a 64bit machine?<br />
<br />
i have found that ovi suite works better on a 32bit machine, though is still riddled with many issues.

<p>When i typed *#0000# it says request not completed.&nbsp; so don't know which version on the phone.&nbsp; computer i am using is 32bit windows xp, sp4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shall i drop the idea of updating the phone software?&nbsp; Because ovi suite does not work for update. Even phone software updater is also not working.</p>

            Once the letter document is associated with the Excel data source you insert
<em>fields</em> in the appropriate locations. See this support article on <strong>

            <p>Unfortunately, there is no one-step solution :-) The Recent Files list isn't automatically updated to reflect whether files have been moved or deleted... That isn't known by the software until you select one that isn't where it's supposed to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option is to clear them from the list one at a time by going to <strong>
File&gt; Open Recent - More</strong> or <strong>File&gt; Open - Recent</strong>, where you can right-click any file &amp; select the
<strong>Remove from Recent</strong> command.</p>

            HI<br />
<br />
I use OneNote on several different computers (all with Dropbox). I have several notebooks and it is just this one notebook that has issues syncing. My computer at work has all the right files on it, but when I try to open certain pages on other computers then
 I get a message saying that they are not yet available because another computer created them and it has not yet synchronised.
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the reply!</div>

            <p>Can you try leaving OneNote and Dropbox running on the computer where everything is working until both indicate that they've finished syncing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once that happens, sync Dropbox on your other computers then try to open OneNote there too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you considered using SkyDrive for your notes? OneNote has its own sync code that works best on SkyDrive. Dropbox serves as an extra layer so if Dropbox fails to sync, things could get weird.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can easily move your notebook to SkyDrive by going to File &gt; Share and selecting the Web as the location to share.</p>

            Thanks for the suggestions. I have left both running on my work computer and Dropbox indicates that it has finished syncing, but OneNote informs me that there was an error syncing (and spits out the above message).<br />
<br />
I'll give SkyDrive a go as I do have an account, but I shudder at the thought of everything that I would have to shift across as I don't want everything spread out!<br />
<br />
What does the above error code mean in any case?

<div>Go to the page that is having trouble on a PC where it shows up correctly. Make an edit to that page (just type some text at the bottom) and wait for it to sync.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persists,&nbsp;I&nbsp;would suggest you to check in program list that is there any other security software installed if yes then please try to uninstall it from your system then try to&nbsp;enable Windows Defender on your system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try the below mentioned methods and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Start the Windows Defender Service Manually</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press “Windows Logo” + “R” keys on the keyboard to open the “<strong><em>Run</em></strong>” command box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type “<strong><em>Services.msc</em></strong>” in the “<strong><em>Run</em></strong>” command box and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the “<strong><em>Services</em></strong>” window, search for the “<strong><em>Windows Defender</em></strong>” service from that list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Double-click on it to open its “<strong><em>Properties</em></strong>” window.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>From its “<strong><em>Properties</em></strong>” window, click on “<strong><em>Start</em></strong>” when the service is stopped and also change its “<strong><em>Startup Type</em></strong>” to “<strong><em>Automatic</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on “<strong><em>Apply</em></strong>” and “<strong><em>Ok</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Restart the computer and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, then try the next method.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run Windows Defender as Administrator</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>From the Windows 8 <strong>
<em>Start Screen</em></strong>, type “<strong><em>Defender</em></strong>”. Windows Defender should appear in the list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right click on the “<strong><em>Windows Defender</em></strong>” icon and select “<strong><em>Run as Administrator</em></strong>” from that menu.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Check if that launches <em>
<strong>Windows Defender</strong></em> on the computer and check if you are able to turn it
<strong><em>ON</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post </span>back with current status of your computer and result of proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
It is indeed strange that you are unable to connect to server if your device manages to browse the web.<br />
<br />
Can you perform a couple of validations:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;Try to enter any live site with the credentials that your are using in MyPhone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Check that your liveID credentials are correct<br />
<br />
Once it is done, can you try to connect again?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Cristiano Cunha.

    <title>Microsoft Word 2013 Lags and Freezes After Scrolling &#40;DOCX&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanhaire  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Word 2013 Lags and Freezes After Scrolling &#40;DOCX&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Word Document (DOCX) lags, freezes, becomes unresponsive after scrolling through multiple pages. The document launches fine, and the first page works as normal, but after scrolling through a few pages the whole program seems to get stuck in the mud. The
 lag affects scrolling, the ribbon bar controls, typing, highlighting. The program even hangs when minimized or closed.<br />
<br />
I am having this issue with multiple word documents. Of these problem documents, I have been experimenting with two in particular. One is long document (50 pages), the other is short document (4 pages). I created the short document after reading numerous articles
 on efficient word document creation. Both documents use custom created styles and custom bullet lists. I have spent upwards of a week looking for a fix online and I have tried countless recommendations. I am only posting now as I feel I have more than exhausted
 the general internet's ability to resolve my issue. Both the Office Suite and the documents in question are installed/stored on my local machine. No network or cloud services involved.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Steps already taken</strong></span>:<br />
- Ran word in safe mode: same exact symptoms in safe and normal mode<br />
- I have no add-ons installed<br />
- I have repaired Office via programs and features<br />
- I have disable graphics acceleration in Word options<br />
- I have manually disabled animations via the manual registry entry<br />
- Printer and video drivers are up-to-date<br />
- Accepted all changes on Review Tab<br />
- Saved the document as an HTML page, then saved back to DOCX format.<br />
- (probably other "fixes" that I can't remember right now)<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Design implementations of the new (4 page test document)</strong></span>:<br />
- No multi-level lists<br />
- No generic Lists (I do not use the bullet or number buttons)<br />
- Custom styles for headings<br />
- Limited font types: Trebuchet MS &amp; Consolas<br />
- Custom simplified table style (only 1 &nbsp;short table)<br />
- No images<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Observations</strong></span>:<br />
- Document scrolls and runs perfectly normal in "Read Mode" and "Web Layout". Problem only occurs in "Print Layout"<br />
- Document runs amazing from HTML page format<br />
- Saving to an older Word format, 97-2003 (.doc), seems to resolve the issue, but Word's features are limited in the older format.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">System Info</span></strong>:</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro 64bit, Dell Latitude E7450</p>

            <p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Update</strong></span>:</p>
<p>When scrolling through one of the problem documents with task manager open I notice my CPU usage spikes to 60% or greater. When scrolling through the same exact document saved in an older .doc format, there is not spike. Word's CPU usage remains between
 5% - 10%. The documents look identical, and are using the same styles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also uninstalled and reinstalled Word completely just for the heck of it. No change.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hello Ryan,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To resolve this issue let us know the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>What is the Anti-Virus/Security Software you have installed?
</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do you have any Spyware/Malware installed?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To find a resolution for this issue or find the actual cause of this issue let us follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We will try restarting the computer in Clean Boot mode and check if you are able to scroll through documents normally without Word 2013 lagging or freezing.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Refer the article below to restart the computer in clean boot mode:
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To restart in Clean Boot follow the steps as per the following Microsoft Article:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a><br />
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> The steps provided for Windows 8.1 in the above article applies for Windows 10 as well. After you have finished troubleshooting, follow steps
 under “<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>” in the article to boot to normal startup.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Clean Boot mode check if you are able to scroll through your Word .docx documents without the recurrence of the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it works fine in Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned under the heading ‘<strong>If you could not run a program before you performed the clean boot</strong>’ which is
 below the option <strong>What is next when I have a clean boot environment</strong>?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the above information helps.

<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.

<br />If your Outlook asked to repair it, I assume that you are using Office. If you tried repair and it did not solve the issue, please uninstall Office <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninst...</a> and install it again <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/download-and-install-or-reinstall-office-365-or-office-2019-on-a-pc-or-mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/downlo...</a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See if you need to turn on Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to Start&gt; Control Panel&gt; (Programs)&gt; Programs and features&gt; Turn Windows features on or off&gt; put a check by Internet Explorer and OK your way out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When IE is turned off, it's program files are hidden.</p>

            I checked and it does have a check by it, So the feature is turned on, but i still cannot find IE in any of my programs nor my control panel, nor my programs. It doesnt make any sense,

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in Turn Windows features on or off, uncheck IE and OK your way out then restart the computer. Go back and check IE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have either of these Program Files folders?</p>
<p>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer"&nbsp; (found on 64-bit systems)<br />
"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From Start&gt; Run (or Windows logo key + r) type in <em>iexplore.exe</em> and hit Enter. Does IE open?<br />
</p>
<p>From Start&gt; Default Programs&gt; Set program access and computer defaults&gt; (Custom section or Windows section) if IE is listed, enable access and set IE as the default browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I have done everything everyone has suggested, yet it my&nbsp;computer&nbsp;acts like internet explorer never existed. I need it for certain applications and this totally sucks that I can't find a file even close to IE at all on my computer anywhere! I used to have
 it and never deleted it to my knowledge, I have even ran a clean up, a disk optimizer and my virus program and nada!

<p><br />
How are you searching?&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. if you are using Windows Search I could easily believe not being able to find something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But first, please clarify your symptom by saying what you see if you try to Run... (e.g. press Win-R and enter:)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>iexplore.exe&nbsp; -nohome&nbsp; -extoff</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.e., just assume that Windows will find it for you even though you haven't been able to find it.&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens?&nbsp;&nbsp; Detailed symptoms please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise instead of using&nbsp; WE/WS, open an Administrator: Command Prompt&nbsp; (e.g. an elevated cmd.exe window) and enter:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cd /d&nbsp; %SystemDrive%\</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>dir/a/b/s&nbsp; iexplore.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does that find anything?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Is there a way to fix graphical lag on the most recent insider - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loganuh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to fix graphical lag on the most recent insider build&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Recently I have noticed that there is a graphics delay when doing even non- PC intensive tasks, and this issue becomes even more obvious when watching videos etc. The playback frame rate is usually around 10 frames per second when my graphics card should
 be able to run everything at 60 fps. This is not the case when I play games, which use my dedicated graphics card, so I am led to believe that there is a compatibility issue with this build and the graphics chip integrated into the CPU. I figured maybe I could
 avoid this issue entirely by simply rerouting everything through my dedicated card, but couldn't find a sufficient way to do this online. I have tried updating the driver for the integrated graphics chip, as well as disabling it entirely and re-enabling it.
 The only thing I have yet to try is uninstalling my integrated graphics driver, as I fear this may leave me unable to properly view anything on the display, so I am wary to try that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running OS build 14361.0</p>

<p>Hi...sorry with all the talk you did I thought&nbsp; more...I meant to '<strong>Un -install'</strong> the driver and restart the computer...there is a big difference..it still may not work but is the proper troubleshooting procedures..heh....I know....</p>
<p>What the heck will any firmware update do?....nothing...this is seems like a Windows system issue...but more manageable than having to deal with a 'Jelly bean' system on a tablet.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps provided below and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1: </b><span>Start Internet explorer with No add-ons mode and check.
</span></p>
<p><span>Click on Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools and click on Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If the issue does not persist in Internet Explorer (No Add-ons), then it is one of the add-ons causing this issue. Please follow the steps below to locate the problem add-on low:
</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart IE normally.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Tools.</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Manage Add-ons.</span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disable the add-ons by clicking them one at a time to highlight them&nbsp;and then&nbsp;click on disable button.</span></p>
<p><span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-enable the add-ons one by one and check with which Add-on you get this error message.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disable the Add-on causing the problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>For your reference: </b><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Internet-Explorer-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Internet-Explorer-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2: <br />
</b><span>You may try resetting the internet explorer settings and check. Refer to the below link for assistance on resetting the internet explorer settings.</span><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings-in-Internet-Explorer-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings-in-Internet-Explorer-9</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important: </b>Reset Internet Explorer to its default configuration. This step will also disable any add-ons, plug-ins, or toolbars that are installed. Although this solution is quick, it also means that, if you want to use any of those add-ons in the
 future, they must be reinstalled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Hope this information is helpful.</p>

            <p>It really doesn't matter what browser you use if and when you get a virus/ malware.......</p>

<p>What is your security suite ?</p>
<p>Why do you think your browser history is not being deleted properly ?</p>
<p>What boxes are checked when you delete your browser history ?</p>
