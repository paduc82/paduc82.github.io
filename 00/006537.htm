    <title>Space bar and down arrow problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Space bar and down arrow problem</h2>
                    I have started to have a problem with the space bar and the down arrow in Hotmail and google chrome. When I start typing in my login it pops up as saved text but when I press the down arrow to highlight it the arrow acts like the space bar. When I am signed
 into Hotmail and start a new message with a signature the space bar moves my down a line instead of giving me a space and the down arrow acts like a space bar. The down arrow also sometimes acts like a page down button. None of the making the keyboard easier
 to use boxes are checked. I just can't figure it out. &nbsp;On a side note, when I use google and start typing into the address bar the space bar acts like the down arrow and will highlight text below the box. Any fix?

</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Our apologies for the delayed response. I'd be glad to assist you with the issue that you have about navigating using the space bar and down arrow.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know more about your issue. Let me ask a few questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the issue where the down arrow acts like a space bar and the space bar acts likes the down arrow exists when you are navigating other websites?</li><li>Does the issue occur when you are using a different computer?</li><li>Do you remember any changes that has been made prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>This started to happen in MSN.com also. When I start to type, the suggested searches pop up below the text box. When I press space bar to make a space in my search inquiry it highlights and auto fills in the first search suggestion. Example at msn: I start
 typing &nbsp; &nbsp;where &nbsp; and the first suggested search is 'where's my tax refund.' I hit space bar to add another word after &nbsp; &nbsp;where &nbsp; and it drops down and auto fills &nbsp; &nbsp;where's my tax refund. &nbsp;Google is my homepage. &nbsp;When I open up a new window Google pops up.
 When I start to search in the box it pops the cursor up to the address bar and then when I press space it highlights the first suggested search ie where's my refund. BUT when I type in google.com and then search in the text box the space bar acts like a space
 bar. &nbsp;The down arrow causes the same problem. They will both finally give me spaces if I hold them down but the spaces start after the auto filled in suggested search.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 7 home premium on a Dell l502x. This only happens on the laptop keyboard. When I plug in a usb keyboard it works fine. The arrow keys do work for selecting stuff normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been no changes that I am aware of. All scans say the computer is fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Since you've mentioned that this issue only happens to your laptop and when you use a USB keyboard it works fine, it is possible that there is a problem with your laptop keyboard.
 I suggest that you contact the manufacturer of your laptop to fix your laptop keyboard.</span></p>

            <p>I already replaced the keyboard. Everything is up to date. About a year ago people posted in the chrome forums that they had the same problem with their space bars selecting the first suggested entries when they started to type. Also, it only happens on
 certain websites. When I type in google.com and do a search it is just fine. It is when it goes the the omnibox that it selects the stuff. Also, if I have a signature in Hotmail is will automatically move the cursor to the end of the message if I hit space
 bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens in msn also. I type in the box and then when the suggestions drop down the space bar automatically selects it. There is no way it is a computer hardware problem when it is a consistent repeatable problem.&nbsp;</p>

clown187,</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to us. I appreciate the additional information you've provided. Let me assist you with your concern regarding your spacebar acting as down arrow issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try to access your email account using Internet Explorer then let us know if the spacebar still acting as down arrow key. I also suggest that you clear your browsers cache and cookies to make sure that this is not causing this issue. You may refer
 to this <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>link</strong></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As what my colleague mentioned above, since this issue doesn't occur when you are using a USB keyboard, then it is not an account related concern.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your patience is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Win7 to Win10 and Edge worked fine.&nbsp; I created another user account and Edge works fine on that account but does not work properly on the original account (mine). It does not keep any history at all (I have unchecked the setting to Clear
 history).&nbsp; It does show Downloads but not History.</p>
<p>Apart from that one identifiable problem, it is generally slow and sometimes unresponsive.</p>
<p>Is there a repair tool for Edge? or can I uninstall and re-install.</p>
<p>I have already tried scannow /R and no problems have been found.</p>
<p>Another person had the exact same problem, but no satisfactory response so far.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I followed the instructions below and it had absolutely no effect.&nbsp; It did not work.<br />
Please bear in mind that Edge works ok when logged on as secondary user but not when logged on as primary user.&nbsp; Which leads me to believe that there is a connection between the particular user and the performance of Edge.&nbsp; This problem started when the secondary
 user account was added.<br />
Please note that Cortana is turned off.&nbsp; Would turning it on help?<br />

<h3> sheilaabcdefg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer &#38;quot&#59;Program Not Responding&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    Hello. Let me first say that I have very limited knowledge of computers.&nbsp; I know how to use them when they are working, but if they are not working properly....I have no idea why and no idea how to fix it.<br />
For quite a while now we have been having an issue with Explorer.&nbsp; When I try to get on to the internet, either by clicking on a desktop icon or using the start menu, 9 times out of 10 a window will pop up and explorer will try to run, but nothing will load.&nbsp;
 When I close the window I get another pop up saying that the program is not responding and asking if I want to send an error report.&nbsp; This happens all the time.&nbsp; Eventually, after a couple of tries explorer will run, usually without any problems.&nbsp; Sometimes
 it will freeze and run slow but it is really on the initial attempt that I have the trouble.&nbsp; I have Windows XP 2002 with Service Pack 2.&nbsp; I have tried to install updates but that seemed to only help temporarily.&nbsp; We only have 504MB RAM which I know is not
 much.&nbsp; I have tried to free up some memory, but again, I don't really know what I am doing.&nbsp; I was going to buy Uniblue's Registry Scanner, but I thought I'd get some opinions first.<br />
Any help or advice would be much appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks so much.

            <p>You need to do two things.&nbsp; First make sure the current record is saved or it might not be accurately reflected in the report; secondly filter the report by means of the WhereCondition argument.&nbsp; A macro to do this would be as below, using my contacts form
 and report as an example:<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2013 crashing after KB3114941 &#40;April 2016&#41;</h2>
                    <p>After a whole bunch of updates to my Windows Server 2008 R2 and Office 2013 Standard (MSI) installation on my Terminal Server, (including KB3114941 and KB3146706) Outlook is intermittently crashing.&nbsp; The symptoms are reminiscent of this bug:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3118497</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the version of OUTLOOK.EXE I am using is 15.0.4815.1000, and the version of NTDLL.DLL is 6.1.7601.23392, released 3/17/2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any known bugs on this yet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: KB3114941 was installed on April 12, and KB3146706 was installed on the 13th, so that would seem to indicate that 4941 is the problem, since on the 12th NTDLL.DLL was using 6.1.7601.23349.</p>

            <p>Works with Mail - You don't have to use Outlook unless you want to use the HTML option. The problem is that the
<strong>Share...</strong> submenu in the <strong>File</strong> menu currently is broken. Use the
<em><strong>Share with others </strong></em>icon in the upper right corner of the document window [just to the right of the Search field].</p>

            Hi Keith,
<div><br />
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I understand that you were not able to send and receive emails and you wanted to delete an email in your Outbox. I'm glad to assist you regarding this matter.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Firstly, we would like to ask if this issue occurs in an email client or through Outlook.com (web-based). If it is in an email client, is it on Windows Live Mail or Microsoft Office Outlook?</div>
<div><br />
<div>For the email stuck in your outbox, if you are using an email client, try to go offline first, delete the email in the outbox and go online again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>We also would like to know if you are encountering any error message when you delete the emails or when you try to send an email. If yes, please specify the exact error message.</div>
<div><br />
<div>We're looking forward to your response.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.</div>
        </p>

<h2>            Early Chat History</h2>
                    I use Skype on my iPhone and my MacBook. I scroll forever and ever trying to get to the beginning of a chat. When I search a word I can only get back so far, not to where I want without a ton more scrolling. Is there some faster way to jump to the very
 first message? I know there used to be, but Skype got rid of it in an "upgrade" right?

Makes no difference. The mobile operator's network decides which codec it will use/support and the phone has to comply, so the setting changes nothing,<br />

            If the query was last reviewed in SQL View when it was closed it will open in SQL View the next time. If the user can't go itno Design view, then there is a syntax error that does not allow it to be rendered in Design view.

<h2>            One graduated colour for a bar chart&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Can I format a bar chart to have increasing shades of one colour, say red, so that as the values increase the colour changes from light red to dark red. I don't think this is possible and I know you can use conditional formatting to make the bars different
 colours.</p>

    <title>Unable to group fields in Pivot Table that uses Data Model - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pauldeakin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to group fields in Pivot Table that uses Data Model</h2>
                    In Excel 2013 if I create a Pivot Table based on a table within my workbook and I
<b>don't</b> add the table to the data model I am able to group fields in the resultant pivot table. However, if I create exactly the same Pivot Table but
<b>do </b>add the source table to the data model, then I am unable to apply groupings to any fields. The "group" ribbon and menu items are all greyed out.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this expected behaviour. I can't think of a reason why grouping would not be possible when the data model is used.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks for any advice that anyone can offer.</div>

<p>For that you will need the PowerPivot.&nbsp; In the PowerPivot window, you will be able to extract the month from the data and then after creating a relationship between Person ID of the two different tables, you will be able to get your desired Pivot Table.</p>

<h2>            Still Seeing Deleted Emails in Inbox After Deleting</h2>
                    <p>I had to reinstall Outlook 2007 on a new User Account for Windows 7 because my account got corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, when I deleted emails from my inbox they would go to my Deleted Folder and disappear from my Inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the reinstalled version - when deleting the email I have to manually move it to my Deleted Folder but a Strike out version still remains in my Inbox. &nbsp;Very annoying.</p>

<p>

            <p>That's because you added the mail account as an IMAP account whereas previously the mail account was configured as a pop mail account.</p>

            <p>I do not find the Windows Phone App for dekstop to be better than Zune. Zune is being abandoned by Microsoft and is not used for syncing Windows Phone 8 devices which I do not agree with. Zune software&nbsp;was not bad in my opinion. I was not expecting to have
 to learn something new when I got my windows Phone 8 but I did. </p>

            That's what I'm thinking too. I looked at buying a used Zune HD and selling my Trophy. But it would be a money loser. And as a bonus, there are a few Xbox games I downloaded to the Trophy that aren't available any more or won't work on the Windows Phone
 8 device.

            If the Zune media software isn't working on your Windows 8 PC, you could still run it using compatability mode. After you install Zune, just right-click the launcher, open properties, and use the compatibility tab to run the software in Windows 7 mode.
 Works like a charm!&nbsp;

    <title>Outlook 2016 cannot connect to Outlook.com&#47;Hotmail account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 cannot connect to Outlook.com&#47;Hotmail account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Outlook 2016 (click-to-tun) installed on a Windows 10 Home PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For many months now I have had it set up with several email accounts including a default Hotmail account. Some time ago I applied the procedure to migrate that account to the new Outlook.com platform (or whatever was the actual migration about). Post-migration
 I have had no issue with this setup for quite some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, starting this morning, I have been unable to access my emails with Outlook. Whenever I open the app it will freeze when trying to synchronize my emails. Opening Outlook in safe mode gives the exact same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can successfully access my other non-Hotmail accounts after having created a dedicated Outlook profile for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to re-create my Hotmail account profile, to no avail. The setup wizard fails while searching for my account settings with a message stating that "an encrypted connection to my server is not available". Then I am offered to try and use an unencrypted
 connection but it fails just as miserably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jacques</p>

            Well, this is a Visual Studio related issue and this is the Windows 10 forums.
