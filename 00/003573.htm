<h2>            Help Reading Pane Reverts to ON when Outlook 2016 program is opened</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When relaunching Outlook reading pane gets switched back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Office 2016 as part of my Office 365 Subscription. First thing I notice is that reading pane has been switched on in Outlook, so I switch it to off on the inbox's of my two email accounts. All is well until I shut down and re launch Outlook,
 then my 1st Inbox has reading pane switched on again whist the 2nd Inbox doesnt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened consistenly since the upgrade, please can someone help to fix this as I dont want reading pane on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in anticipation</p>
<p>
</p><p>Barney</p>
<p>

            <p>Thankyou Parth Patel</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you trying to help me with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried outlook in safe mode and the behaviour persisted</p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried the Office Online Repair and the behaviour persists...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has only started since upgrading to Office 2016, could it be a bug in the software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took a look at the other thread you suggested but dont feel I could or should be trying the things suggested there. The OP's topic was not the same as my issue here.</p>

                    Hello Developers, I just want to say that why Microsoft is not using the os of Nokia X family. What I mean is that with the help of that os Microsoft can give tough competition to google or apple. Because their are many people's who want to use an os which
 is not made by google or apple. Please Microsoft upgrade that os and relaunch it with new features like adding cortana to it and many more. I hope that I am going to hear the good news from you.&nbsp;

</p><p>That OS is the non-Google AOSP version of Android - how would that be tough competition for the Google Android without having Google Play support? Do you see Amazon being tough competition for Google with their ? No, they released one mobile phone on Fire
 OS which crashed and burned.</p>

            That's why Microsoft need to work on it. They need to convince the big apps developer to make different version of their apps to be run on their devices which has Microsoft services. They can even ask google to help them by making apps like youtube to
 be run on Microsoft devices because Microsoft had released all It's apps like office, one drive etc. On play store.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>What devices running Microsoft services are you talking about ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft will not be developing an alternative OS to their own and will not release devices running (any version of) Android because there are plenty of others who are doing with great success and it makes absolutely no sense at all. Why don't you ask Google
 to start making Windows mobiles ? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft released Android versions of their apps because they wanted to, not because Google asked them for help.

    <title>Cutover migration with AADconnect integration - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tylerd13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cutover migration with AADconnect integration</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have some questions about a Cutover migration with AADconnect integration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your status before Cutover :</p>
<ul>
<li>The OnPremise UPN don't match the PrimarySMTP, and don't have routable domains.
</li><li>All mailboxes have SMTP addresses and a X400 address.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>After deleting the Cutover batch and before activating AADconnect synchronization :</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to delete all Exchange mailboxes and create mailenabled users for all Onpremise account that have an Office 365 mailbox?
</li><li>Attributes to set for mailenabled user, with the same value than Office 365 are only : ProxyEmailAddresses, PrimarySMTP, or LegacyExchangeDN and msExchMailboxGuid are also mandatory?
</li></ul>
<p>After activation of AADConnect :&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens for Office 365 mailboxes, when we sync the first time with AADconnect, after deleting the Cutover batch?&nbsp;
</li><li>Before, the Cutover synchronization do a matching with the PrimarySMTP, and create the UPN with the PrimatySMTP. Does ADDconnect correctly match with the PrimarySMTP? (Default process for AADconnect is GUID, and this don’t match if we do before a Cutover
 migration). I have read about a AADConnect soft match, based on the PrimarySMTPAddress, but not sure it’s work after a Cutover migration.
</li><li>X400 addresses are normally migrated with Cutover, but what happens with x400 addresses when we synch with AADconnect?
</li></ul>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Hi TylerD,</p>
<p><em>Question 1: We need to delete all Exchange mailboxes and create mailenabled users for all Onpremise account that have an Office 365 mailbox?</em></p>
<p>The answer is yes. You only need to convert on-premises mailboxes to mail-enabled users. Here is a reference:</p>
<p>Cutover Exchange Migration and Single Sign-On&nbsp; (if you don’t have SSO, please ignore the step 3.)</p>
<p><em>Question 2: Attributes to set for mailenabled user, with the same value than Office 365 are only : ProxyEmailAddresses, PrimarySMTP, or LegacyExchangeDN and msExchMailboxGuid are also mandatory?</em></p>
<p>The answer is yes. You need to collected from the cloud mailboxes. You can check the detailed steps in the link I provided above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Question 3: What happens for Office 365 mailboxes, when we sync the first time with AADconnect, after deleting the Cutover batch?</em></p>
<p>Office 365 accounts will be connected to AD users’ accounts. It will not affected Office 365 mailboxes.</p>
<p><em>Question 4: Before, the Cutover synchronization do a matching with the PrimarySMTP, and create the UPN with the PrimatySMTP. Does ADDconnect correctly match with the PrimarySMTP? (Default process for AADconnect is GUID, and this don’t match if we do
 before a Cutover migration). I have read about a AADConnect soft match, based on the PrimarySMTPAddress, but not sure it’s work after a Cutover migration.</em></p>
<p>If you do a soft match after migration, it will work.</p>
<p><em>Question 5: X400 addresses are normally migrated with Cutover, but what happens with x400 addresses when we synch with AADconnect?</em></p>
<p>Generally, if the X400 is under the proxy address, it will be synced to Office 365.</p>
<p>If anything is unclear, please feel free to let me know.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Erick</p>

<p>Hi Erick,</p>
<p>Thanks for your answers.</p>
<p>Your link is interesting and have scripts only for Exchange 2003/2007, but not Exchange 2010. Did you know a valid script for Exchange 2010?</p>
<p>To be sure, for a soft match : the mailuser only need the cloud ProxyEmailAddresses, PrimarySMTP?
</p>
<p>If i add the msExchMailboxGuid attribut from the Cloud to the Onpremise Mailuser, AADConnect will do a GUID matching?</p>
<p>What append with Non Routable UPN defined Onpremise, when we do a AADConnect Sync? (AADconnect will change the cloud UPN, or keep the UPN (equal to PrimarySMTP) migrated with Cutover?)</p>
<p>There is benefits to do a GUID match against a PrimarySMTP soft match?</p>
<p>Can we force ADDConnect to do a GUID or Soft match?</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>Hi TylerD,</p>
<p>If you use Exchange 2010, there are no official documents about converting mailboxes to mail users. Officially, we recommend Exchange 2010 users to set up hybrid. Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>About “To be sure, for a soft match : the mailuser only need the cloud ProxyEmailAddresses, PrimarySMTP?”, the answer is yes. You need to use SMTP addresses to match them. You can click the link below to follow the detailed steps:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2641663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to use SMTP matching to match on-premises user accounts to Office 365 user accounts for directory synchronization</a></p>
<p><br />
<em>Question 1: There is benefits to do a GUID match against a PrimarySMTP soft match?</em></p>
<p>Generally, Soft Match is easier and more widely-used. For Hard Match, it’s a little bit complicated. It requires the sync tool being disabled to change the Office 365 users ImmutableID. For example, after you finish some users' Hard Match and enable the
 sync tool, if you want to hard match other users, the DirSync needs to be disabled again. Moreover, converting the objectGUID to ImmutableID is complicated too.
<br />
However, Hard Match can be used in some specific scenarios. For example, the primary SMTP address cannot be set to the Office 365 users with special licenses, such as EOP standalone.</p>
<p><br />
<em>Question 2: If i add the msExchMailboxGuid attribut from the Cloud to the Onpremise Mailuser, AADConnect will do a GUID matching?</em></p>
<p>For the Hard match, users should use ObjectGUID. Therefore, your question’s answer is no.</p>
<p><br />
<em>Question 3: What append with Non Routable UPN defined Onpremise, when we do a AADConnect Sync? (AADconnect will change the cloud UPN, or keep the UPN (equal to PrimarySMTP) migrated with Cutover?)</em></p>
<p>Do you mean any local domain email addresses? If so, these domains will not be synced.</p>
<p><br />
<em>Question 4: Can we force ADDConnect to do a GUID or Soft match?</em></p>
<p>Hard match and Soft match are different. When you choose any one method and finish it, AAD connect will sync it automatically.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Erick</p>

            <p>Hi Erick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your explanations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q2: Before you answered Yes but for which question : Attributes to set for mailenabled user, with the same value than Office 365 are only : ProxyEmailAddresses, PrimarySMTP?&nbsp; LegacyExchangeDN and msExchMailboxGuid are also mandatory?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q3: I mean, for a Exchange mailbox (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) migrated with Cutover (Office 365 *** Email address is removed for privacy ***). What happend when we sync with AADConnect?</p>
<p>This mailuser will be synched with AADConnect?</p>
<p>If yes, the Office 365 UPN will be changed to XXX.onmicrosoft.com or keep with *** Email address is removed for privacy ***?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q4: Where can i set AADConnect to do a Soft Match?</p>
<p>In the Custom AADConnect Wizard, under "Uniquely identifying your users", I have to use the default settings : SourceAnchor:ObjectGUID ? (SMTP address is not allowed in SourceAnchor)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much,</p>

<p>So this is a Hotmail account?&nbsp;If so do you have the Outlook Connector installed or are you using POP3?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Do you have Service Pack 2 for Office 2007 installed?

<p>Hi Eduardo,</p>
<p><br />
No, we didn’t receive similar reports.<br />
To narrow down the root cause of the issue, could you provide the following information?<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Does the issue exist if you change to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Outlook-Web-App-Light-2aec8c2d-da48-4707-ba37-c800e1c284cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OWA light version</a>?<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Please contact the administrator and check if any others in your organization met the same issue.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Does the issue persist if you change to another network environment, such as home network or else?<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To make sure the root cause is not related to the computer or browser cache, I suggest you change to another machine and install a new browser like Google to check the result.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Your OWA version. Right click the blank area in your Outlook Web App, and click View Page Source. Let us know the version number.</p>
<p><br />
Best Regards,<br />
Toby<br />

<p>Hi Eduardo,</p>
<p>I received your screenshots and wonder if you received my private message. Does the test account meet the same issue?</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the issue is a little odd, I suggest you let the administrator of your organization re-assign the Office 365 licenses and check if the issue persists. If possible, please involve him in this thread for further investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: To avoid data loss, i suggest you back up the data of your mailbox.
</p>
<p>Thanks for your effort and time.</p>

 paid for some stuff &amp; then realised I was being scammed. &nbsp;Ended phone call &amp; got my card cancelled &amp; reported this scam. &nbsp;What I need to know is : has this infected my computer in some way &amp; how do I make sure it hasn't. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated.

            <p>It is possible it has been infected.</p>
<p>Run a reputable product such as MalwareBytes to see if there's anything. To be 100% sure a clean install of your O/S would be in order.</p>
<p>Also, be aware they may have gotten access to any account information that was on your machine. That could include bank, e-mail, social media, etc. websites and those could be compromised. Changing passwords might be advisable. Make the changes from a machine
 that you know is clean.</p>

<h2>            Restore files in Outlook 2003</h2>
                    I was having an issue with email web links being directed to local cache storage.&nbsp; Someone suggested I restore my Outlook settings to clear potential conflicts.&nbsp; I did this and learned (after the fact) that this actually deleted all my saved emails, contacts,
 etc.&nbsp; Outlook, and the associated files and records, are mission critical to me! &nbsp;Is there someway to retrieve and restore these??&nbsp; (Office 2003, Outlook 2003, Windows 8.1)

            <p>If by 'restore outlook settings' you mean you created a new outlook profile, this doesnt result in any loss of data.</p>
<p>Simply reconnect the old data file via the Mail applet in the control panel, and set that data file as the default msg store for the mail account.</p>
<p>This assumes you are/were using a pop mail account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then there are a couple of other things;</p>
<p>1) Office 2003 is now out of support, no more security updates</p>
<p>2) Data cannot be 'mission critical' if you have no backup, as, at some point you will lose your data</p>

<p>Have you tried a soft reset. If that doesn't work, I've used a program called Memmaid which works great at cleaning and fixing (deleting) messy uninstalls that leave issues like you have described. It is a commercial
 program, but it does come with a free trial of the full version of the program.</p>

<p>MIke,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The icons in the Start Menu are actually shortcuts to the acutal applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can remove them by heading to: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Windows</strong>-&gt;<strong>Start Menu</strong>-&gt;<strong>Programs</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here you can add, delete and organize your programs to your hearts content.</p>

            1. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
2. Reverting to July version of MS Office has also helped people. How to revert - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2770432<br />

5. Follow the instructions given on this page to make older programs compatible with Windows 10 - http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows&nbsp;<br />
<br />
6. For Ready Only Problems - Review the response of E. Harter at following link where sharing has solved the problem - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-excel/2010-office-docs-all-open-as-read-only-after/31a64e6b-60e1-4d51-a897-9f8958660859<br />

<br />
7. Install latest Windows 10 cumulative update KB3081438 (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3081438) which is released on 14-Aug-15. If you want to download standalone KB3081438 then you can download from http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Thanks.aspx?id=140.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
8. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
9. Right click on your Excel shortcut &gt; Properties, In Compatibility tab, uncheck all options. Start the Excel again.<br />
<br />
10. Right click on your Excel shortcut &gt; Run as Administrator<br />
<br />
11. Review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54<br />
<br />
12. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through1 Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.<br />
<br />
13. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
14. If above don't, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license keys ready before
 you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

            If you want to create a new Skype account - Your Microsoft account is your new Skype account. 
<br />
<br />If your Skype account was not linked to Microsoft account, use your Microsoft account.
<br />If it was linked to your Microsoft account, then unlinking can not be done. You will need to create a new Microsoft account, hence you will need a new mail ID.
<br />
<br />But why do you not want to use old account?

<p>Hi SMV_LK,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To identify what is causing this issue, I need to confirm some information. Please answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did you first encounter this issue?</li><li>How are you trying to do the move and size with cell feature? Is it the same as moving or copying cells and cell contents?</li><li>You mentioned that you have inserted an image, are you referring to moving the image/object within a specific cell or worksheet?</li><li>Are you receiving any error messages when performing the said feature?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate it if you can provide us a screenshot of what you are trying to do in Excel. This will help us to have a clear view of your issue.</p>

<h3> jim4815  say:</h3>
<h2>            OUTLOOK 2007 WITH BUSINESS CONTACT MANAGER</h2>
                    
<p>I have MS Windows Vista &gt; Ultra 32bit version with Office&nbsp;Professional 2007&nbsp;and MS Office Outlook 2007 with the Business Contact Manager.</p>
<p>I am a new bee in the wind so I will do my best to describe what has happened:</p>
<p>When I open my Outlook it opens fine, I go to the left hand pane where it shows Contacts &gt; Business Contact Manager. There are two sub-headings underneath that, they are Business Contacts in Buisness Contacts Manager and the next one Accounts in Business
 Contact Manager.</p>
<p>The first one opens fine I can add new entries into it, the problem comes when I click on the Accounts heading,&nbsp;it show all of the&nbsp;listings but when I try to add in a new one, a box labeled MICROSOFT FORMS OPENS&nbsp;and it&nbsp;says&nbsp;"CANNOT LOAD AN OBJECT BECAUSE
 IT IS NOT AVAILABLE ON THIS MACHINE"&nbsp;when I close this a second box opens BUSINESS CONTACT manager for outlook and it&nbsp;says "CANNOT OPEN THE FORM BECAUSE AN ERROR HAS OCCURED!"</p>
<p>I also tried to repair the program, tried reinstalling original MS disks that I got from Gateway Computers with the programs on it but they intalled fine again and the problem remained the same.</p>
<p>I did not want to go further fearing in my INEXPERIENCE damage or erase my files that work ok, except for the problem child.</p>
<p>If there is someone out there in the wonderfull world of&nbsp;MS wizards please try to explain and help me if possible.I tried my best with what I know so now I turn it over to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your help &amp; efforts in the above.</p>

            This setting is POP accounts only:
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;  is set to leave a copy on server for 14 days.
<br />You won't have it with an IMAP account. 
<br />
<br />But if you have the account set up on two or more computers or mobiles and one is set up as pop, deleting pop mail will move it to the deleted folder in an imap account.

                    Since a couple of Office 365 Word 2016 updates ago, some of my templates are now typing verrry slowwly. &nbsp;It is not related to the size of the doc, because some of the bigger byte docs are ok, while lesser byte docs aren't. &nbsp;I have created some of my own
 templates (dotx) as well as used a system letterhead template which I have made changes to and resaved as a template and some of these I also have problems with slowness. &nbsp;Why, what is happening, how can I fix it? &nbsp;

<p>It is a "<em>feature</em>" of Office 2016 (and 2013). </p>
<p>
</p><p>In 2013 MS made a major change in Word. The "<em>new &amp; improved</em>" &lt;deep sigh&gt; the program code used to display Word on screen. It did wonderful things like display borders around every paragraph.&nbsp; For me, the first time I tried Excel 2013 it was so slow
 I uninstalled it after a couple of hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible fixes is to turn off (or change a couple of settings in the options dialog:</p>
<div>
<strong><span>Combo of options must be disabled – Hardware Acceleration</span></strong>

<p>I systematically went through every single option disabling things that might effect it, and the dumbest solution and dumbest option for me was simple... . By “toggle”, I mean change current setting, for these 2 or 3 options (depending on version) try all
 of the combinations of the settings on and off. The specific options you see depend on the Office application and its year (2010/2013/2016).
</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> menu &gt; <strong>Options</strong> command &gt; <strong>
Advanced</strong> option</li><li>In the <strong>Display</strong> section:<br />
Toggle the check box for "Disable Hardware Acceleration" (2010 / 2013 / 2016)</li><li>Also try toggling the check box for “<strong>Use subpixel positioning to smooth fonts on screen</strong>” (2013 / 2016)
</li><li>In the <strong>General</strong> section &gt; <br />
Toggle the check box for “feedback animation” <span>&nbsp;</span>(2010 / 2013?)</li><li>Apply the changes by clicking on Ok button at bottom of the dialog box</li><li>Close Word normally</li><li>Restart Word</li></ol>

 (Screen Cap of 2016 Options Dialog with the options highlighted)</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>This issue is most noticeably on machine with dual video chip set, ie. video support built into the CPU plus an external graphics card.</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>It didn't have an immediate effect until I closed and re-opened Word, then it was fine. I unchecked the box and the screen flickered and it was sluggish again until I repeated the steps. The combination of the two options for whatever reason seems to have
 fixed for me.</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another option to try is this: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Try disabling display scalling on high DPI settings</span></strong></p>
<p>by following the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your<strong> Office installation folder</strong> and <strong>right-click on the Office app</strong> that has poor scaling issues and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Compatibility tab</strong> and put a <strong>check </strong>
on <strong>Disable display scaling on high DPI settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Launch that Office app</strong> and see if the issue still occurs.</li></ol>

    <title>slideshow playback issue in PowerPoint 2016. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brad horion  say:</h3>
<h2>            slideshow playback issue in PowerPoint 2016.</h2>
                    <p>I'm having an issue with the slideshow playback in PowerPoint 2016, but <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
only</span> in Presenter View. Each of my slides lead with an animation that pauses for a fraction of a second after I switch to the slide. After viewing this several times, I realized that it pauses when the preview of the next slide (located in the upper
 right hand window) transitions from what is now the current slide, to what will now be the next slide. I've only found one post ANYWHERE stating, what I believe to be, this same issue and the suggestion to disable the accelerated graphics did not work. I have
 a 35 slide presentation on Tuesday and would really like to be able to use the Presenter View, but if my audience has to view the same animation glitch 30+ times, it will inevitably distract from the content and ruin the presentation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried running this show on 2 different desktops and 1 laptop (all PC, Win 10, 4-16Gb RAM, updated graphics drivers, etc...) and the same problems persists on each of them. The slideshow just includes .png images (1 per slide, sizes anywhere from 5-9Mb)
 with no video or audio files. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping that this isn't a bug and that there's just some simple setting that I'm overlooking. Please help.</p>
