<h2>            Why can&#39;t Windows 8 find my ZyXEL modum-router connected by ethernet cable USB</h2>
                    I can set up wireless connections using the modem=router, but it doesn't list the modem in the system devices even though it is physically connected with a USB cable.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and for giving us this opportunity to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I see that the
<b>ZyXEL modem-router </b>isn't detected in the system devices and you aren’t able to set up wireless connection.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Let us work together to resolve this issue.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, we need more information on this issue. Please answer the following questions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are other devices able to connect to the modem?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error messages/code when this issue occurs?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the complete model of the modem/router?</span></p>

<p><b><span>Please follow all the steps and instruction given in the link and let us know the results.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Temporarily disable Windows Firewall and check if the issue occurs.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the following link to learn how to disable Windows Firewall.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Windows Firewall from start to finish</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important</span></b><span>: You should not turn off Windows Firewall unless
 you have another firewall enabled. Turning off Windows Firewall might make your computer (and your network, if you have one) more vulnerable to damage from worms or hackers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to a firewall, you also need an antivirus and anti-malware program to help protect your computer. Install
 Microsoft Security Essentials or another antivirus and anti-malware program, and keep it up to date. Many of these programs update automatically.</span></p>

<h2>            Matshita BD Drive will not read disk after single use after reboot.</h2>
                    <p>I currently have an Asus g750-JH with a BD/DVD drive that will only read a disk once. Then will either not realize that the disk has been ejected from the computer or will not read that a new disk has been inserted. I have tried numerous things to try to
 get it to work right. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an external BD player hooked up the computer that works fine. I've tried both BD disks as well as DVD disks with the same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the Fix problems with CD or DVD drives that can't read or write media option listed here</p>
<p>http://support2.microsoft.com/mats/cd_dvd_drive_problems/</p>
<p>with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also done the manual steps listed in another section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled the drive in the device manager then rebooted the machine. Tried a single DVD (playing the disk w/ an applicable software) then removed the disk then tried another one with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Manufacturer: MATSHITA<br />
Product: BD-CMB UJ160</p>
<p>Driver Date: 6/21/2006</p>
<p>Driver Version: 6.3.9600.16384</p>
<p>
</p><p>From everything I can find the drivers are up to date. I'm also not 100% sure but I believe that the firmware is version 1.00 I'm not to sure if ther is a newer version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is any more information that anybody willing to help me out is requiring of me please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Xbox app - Green blank screen when I try to launch it.</h2>
                    This just started happening tonight. I've been using it for a few hours today, and left for a while, came back and tried to launch the app, and all I get is a green blank screen. Rebooted my computer several times. What's going on? Is it a problem with
 Xbox Live? Is anyone else experiencing this? What can I do? This is the first time I have had a problem with the app launching. Thanks in advance for any help.

            After hours of chatting with Windows and Xbox support yesterday, I figured out a temporary fix that works for me. I had to make a new user account on my PC. Just go to settings, and create a new user account. You have to make a new Microsoft account, but
 you can use your same gamertag as long as you log into the Xbox app with the same Microsoft account as you do on your Xbox. Make sure the new user account you create on your PC is set as an administrator, and you are good to go. This was a real pain. I'd still
 like to fix the problem, and use my old account if I can, so anyone who has a real fix to this problem, please let us know. The fact that there are a couple people here who have experienced the same issue, makes me think it isn't some kind of corruption with
 the user account, but rather a problem with the app installation. I hope this works for you guys for now.

            Last night I installed the massive update for Windows 10 and all was back to normal. I had to do the manual check for updates to get it to go. It took almost an hour to complete, similar to the original upgrade from Win 7. Hope this works for all of you!

            <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem for me turned out to be a hidden "Lets Play" button in the Xbox App's opening screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I.E.&nbsp; Upon launching a game such as Microsoft's Solitare Collection, I can see something to the effect of "Welcome Back Brian!"&nbsp; I can also see options to login using a different account, etc.&nbsp; It appears to be logging in, but nothing else happens at this
 point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My tablet screen isn't big enough to show a button near the bottom of the dialog that says, "Let's Play!"&nbsp; I must tap 'tab' a few times until this button is highlighted, then tap 'return/enter'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Windows 10 tablet, to get to this button, I must pull up a touch-type keyboard on my tablet (tap the keyboard icon on my task-bar) and tap the tab key a few times.&nbsp; If you don't have such a 'keyboard'&nbsp;icon on your taskbar, then tap and hold the task
 bar for a moment and choose 'show "Show touch keyboard button'.&nbsp; At this point you should see a new keyboard icon in the lower right hand corner of your taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I can get to the 'Lets Play' button, and get that pushed, everything works again.&nbsp; My Xbox app is fully functional again, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So....the problem is....Microsoft needs to fix this dialog so people with smaller screens see this button right away!</p>

<strong>it would be best for the Surface to update while the Display is off.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I realized that the Surface will go sleep </strong><strong>and
</strong>turn off display if I:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Change the settings so that it "Turns off display" automatically (in the power settings).</p>
<p>2. Using this&nbsp;<a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Turn-off-screen-4d173e0a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">batch script</a>&nbsp;to
<strong>only </strong>turn off the display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Require-Sign is at "Never" but I have to Sign-in everytime. (As if it went to sleep).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like the Surface goes to sleep no matter what. What should I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Microsoft isn't adding any more old Xbox games to the Xbox 360. If you're getting the "this game isn't compatible" message. You won't be able to play it on the Xbox 360, I'm afraid.</p>

<p>Hi, Colin McRae&nbsp;rally 4 is on the list of supported Xbox original games as shown
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/xbox-games/play-original-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I have a feeling it may be the hard drive you are using, if the hard drive is not a genuine&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;hard drive then you will never get any&nbsp;original Xbox games working&nbsp;on your console. Are you using an S model console with an older model hard drive? If
 so there's your problem.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that using a hard drive from an older model console in an S model console is a breach of the terms of use and can&nbsp;lead to a console/account ban from the Live service as stated

<p>Turns out there are two versions of Skype installed simultaneously on my PC. The shortcut I was running was pointing to old version, which triggered notification window to appear every time.
</p>
<p>When I switched to using link to new version of Skype, the problem disappeared (obviously).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check if you have two versions of Skype installed. One is regular Skype and other is Skype that comes with Windows 10. One has blue icon with white background, the other has white icon with blue background.</p>
<p>Then pick the newer version and voila!<br />

            Hi there, I had the same problem. FIgured it out by uninstalling the Desktop version of Skype. The version from Microsoft Store remained and now you just have to create a new shortcut. Type search "Skype" on start menu, right click on the app icon and
 select Add to Start Menu or equivalent option.

            Yeah, but the "new" (i.e. built-in) Skype app is buggy - sometimes it doesn't even notify me that someone is calling me. I had uninstalled the "classic" one and tried to get used to the built-in one, but after fighting the bugs for a few months, I have
 now reinstalled Classic. I wish I could get the "try it now" window to leave me alone, but I guess that's not possible.<br />

            The "Try it now" pop-up should go away over time. If it does not, that may indicate there is something corrupt in your local profile/history stored in %appdata%/Skype. This could be actual file corruption or read-only attributes. One way to immediately
 stop that specific pop-up, regardless of the status of your local profile, is by setting the properties of the Skype.exe to Windows 8/7 compatibility mode.<br />

<p>I have followed every step and it never worked.</p>
<p>The only ever way i have got it to open </p>
<p>Turn router/modem off</p>
<p>turn console off</p>
<p>wait 30 secs turn router/modem on.then your console</p>
<p>check your network settings.if still strict</p>
<p>reset your router/modem turn console off</p>
<p>Took me 3/4 goes in the end it opened.but it has closed few times but i keep repeating the same steps.</p>
<p>Also on your hub page tick UPNP then reset router aswell.if it is ticked untick reset then tick again

<p>Looks like that is a WISP ("wireless ISP"), which means you do not need a modem but also means you are likely behind two NAT routers (your Belkin and a router at the WISP). &nbsp;If so, that creates a problematic double NAT situation that prevents you from getting
 open NAT unless you take special steps--steps that you probably can't take because they require control over both routers, and you have no control over the WISP's router.</p>
<p>To verify double NAT is the issue, please log in to the web interface of your Belkin router and note the WAN/Internet IP it reports (WAN IP, not the LAN IP!). &nbsp;If that IP differs from the one reported by
<a href="http://www.tracemyip.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tracemyip.org</a> or similar websites, then you have a double NAT situation. &nbsp;Again, there is probably not much you can do if so. You can try connecting the Xbox One directly to the ethernet cable
 from your antenna and hope that your WISP has UPnP enabled on whatever NAT router it is running, which is very unlikely. &nbsp;Otherwise, your options for getting open NAT are to (1) convince the WISP to forward the necessary ports for you (unlikely for various
 reasons) or enable UPnP (good luck), or (2) get a cable/DSL ISP that provides you a public IP.

<p>the only thing that irks me is that I never had this problem with my 360 I constantly had an open NAT on that and I never changed any settings and switch to my one and it said it was closed even when I switch back to the 360 it still says its open which
 makes no sense to me</p>

<p>Yes, and it probably does. The 360's NAT detection method is not as sophisticated as the One's, and the 360 has been known to erroneously report open NAT when behind multiple layers of NAT.</p>

<p>@ ZUES Gaming have you tried this go into your router go to Applications &amp; Gaming and put in these ports.</p>
<p>88 External port 88 Internal port UDP</p>
<p>3074 for both External and Internal select Both for Protocol</p>
<p>53 for both External and Internal ports select both for protocol</p>
<p>80 for both External and Internal select both for protocol</p>
<p>after all that &nbsp;go to Advanced settings on you xbox and look at your IP address put the last three number on your IP for xbox on the the IP address on your router and enable all of the ports you just entered then hit save settings
 and you should be set.</p>
<p>Hope this helps =)</p>

<h2>            Mouse pointer disappear while browsing internet on Google Chrome browser</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Pointer disappears</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I've found that my pointer disappears whenever I'm on my default internet browsing site (Google Chrome). I can see it when using Internet Explore though. I have a HP Pavilion x2. I can still use even when I can't see it, which can be useful, but
 hard to use. I can see it everywhere else. I've tried using the troubleshoot, but it never finds anything wrong.</p>

            <p>You won't get one specifically about rebooting. Rebooting is part of installing the patch. Until you reboot, it is not installed. That means whatever problem needs to be fixed is still broken. Or if its a security patch, you are unprotected until you reboot.</p>
<p>In other words , whatever justification you have for installing the patch in the first place, is also your justification to reboot -- because rebooting is part of that install.</p>

            <p>Hi Viknesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that after checking the settings still authentication tab is missing in LAN and I appreciate the effort made towards the fixes you have tried.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which security software is installed in the computer?</li><li>Do&nbsp;you remember making any specific change in the computer prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>In order to avoid any third party software conflict, please the computer in clean boot state and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place the computer in clean boot state</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:
<em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Disable the security software and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> <span><em>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Please refer to suggestions provided by Microsoft Help Support.</p>

            <p>Currently Symantec 12.1.6 is installed. The new changes we would like to make is to to enable the wired autoconfig and implement 802.1x but it seems the 1st step has failed. We have around 8-12 machines having the same issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>All steps has been completed except for disabling the SEP. We would try that. Any other help?</p>

<h2>            Virus Blocking Firewall&#47;Windows Defender</h2>
                    Hi, my stupid 50 year old mother got on ebay, and clicked on some supposed government site called&nbsp;
<span>
<span>
DCHS, and she got a virus. She knows almost nothing about computers, and at first it only affected her user account. Now, it is affecting mine!</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>What the virus has done:</span></div>
<div><span>1. "Re-directs" me from any website to a site called Newsfudge.com</span></div>
<div><span>2. Turned off Windows Firewall and won't let me start it</span></div>
<div><span>3. Turned off Windows Defender and won't let me start it</span></div>
<div><span>4. Kept my Anti-virus from deleting the infected files.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>What i Tried:</span></div>
<div><span>1. Deleting the files (didn't work)</span></div>
<div><span>2. Couldn't turn firewall back on</span></div>
<div><span>3. did System restore twice (not in safe mode, and said an unknown error caused it to not work)</span></div>
<div><span>4. tried removing the files in safe mode</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Should i try doing a System Restore in Safe Mode? Any other ideas?</span></div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>SR is not a good way to remove any type of Program; but you can try it.</p>
<p>Most Malware has written into its programming not to allow SR as a way to protect itself from being removed.</p>
<p>Malware will disable your Security Programs and&nbsp;your Firewall.</p>
<p>Scan for Malware in Safe Mode with Networking.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-start-windows-in-safe-mode/#vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-start-windows-in-safe-mode/#vista</a></p>
<p><strong><u>Windows Vista</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Using the F8 Method:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart your computer. </li><li>When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information start to gently tap the
<strong>F8</strong> key repeatedly until you are presented with the <strong>Windows Vista Advanced Boot Options</strong>.
</li><li>Select the <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>&nbsp;option using the arrow keys.
</li><li>Then press the <strong>enter</strong> key on your keyboard to boot into Vista Safe Mode.
</li><li>When Windows starts you will be at a typical logon screen. Logon to your computer and Vista will enter Safe mode.
</li><li>Do whatever tasks you require, and when you are done, reboot to go back into normal mode.
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once in Safe Mode with Networking, download and run RKill.</p>
<p>RKill does NOT remove Malware; it stops the Malware Process giving you a chance to remove it with your Security Programs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, download, install,&nbsp;update and scan your System with the free version of&nbsp;Malwarebytes AntiMalware in Safe Mode with Networking:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ab<em>out Defender being turned off.</em></strong></p>
<p>You are supposed to have an Antivirus, not just rely on Defender which is an AntiSpyware Program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using Norton, AVG, Avira, Microsoft Security Essentials, McAfee, etc the default action is for&nbsp;Windows Defender to be disabled, as those AntiVirus Programs have their own Antispyware Applications.</p>
<p>It is nothing to be worried about.</p>
<p>Using the two Programs at the same time can cause System conflicts, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not using one of the above AntiVirus Programs, this Information from
<strong><em>David O - Support Engineer</em></strong>&nbsp;shows you how to&nbsp;manually enable&nbsp;Windows Defender (<strong><em>disregard Uninstall Information; not possible in Vista</em></strong>):</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-security/how-do-i-manually-start-windows-defender-in-vista/dab845b2-9ba5-47f3-9518-c4c6781e7d5b">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-security/how-do-i-manually-start-windows-defender-in-vista/dab845b2-9ba5-47f3-9518-c4c6781e7d5b</a></p>
<p><span>"Go to Start, <strong>Control Panel</strong>, <strong>Administrative Tools</strong>,
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Services</strong>. Locate Windows Defender.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Right click and select <strong>Properties</strong> and ensure that the Start-Up Type is
<strong>Automatic. </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once changed, click on <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Exit and Restart your computer. Check back taking the same route to confirm Windows Defender has started"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>If you wish to have extra protection against&nbsp;Malware&nbsp;use the FREE version of Malwarebytes AntiMalware:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a></p>

<p><span>Hi Bobby,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums. I can definitely help you with this issue.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You have mentioned that you have recently downloaded and installed Windows 8 on your computer and you get the notification from Control Panel saying
 that the PCI Device on your computer doesn't have a driver.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It would be great if you can provide me with this information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the exact/complete error message that you get?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any other recent changes on your computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>How did you install Windows 8 on the computer? Was it a clean install or an upgrade?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>While installing Windows 8, did you get any message from the Windows Upgrade Assistant about the incompatibility of any devices with Windows 8?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>PCI is the short form of “Peripheral Component Interconnect”. It is a local computer bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer. Some PCI cards
 used in PCs include: network cards, sound cards, modems, additional ports such as USB or serial, TV tuner cards and disk controllers etc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems that the Chipset drivers of the computer are not up to date. So, let’s try that and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to go to the computer manufacturer’s website and check for the latest Windows 8 drivers available and make sure that you download
 and install them on your computer and check the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are unable to find an appropriate driver or if the issue persists even after installing the drivers, then I would suggest
 you to contact the PC manufacturer for further assistance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to get back to us for any further queries or issues related to Windows.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one, Installing games disc problems.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm not the only one having this issue! I've tried installing Dead Rising 3 onto my XB1 from the disc, but it won't move from 0% while connected online. I tried the offline trick (which I shouldn't have to do) and it installed.... signed into my profile
 and started playing Dead Rising 3. Like a big kid, I couldn't wait to start playing, but oh wait 'download patch needed'.... the game stops and goes back to the dashboard '80% installation complete'..... 20 minutes later '80%'.... Really?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is there anyway around this? Alls I want to do is play a game.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I have a Toshiba Satellite P50-C-12Z laptop - currently, every time I start it up it goes through a 30 minute update process, then fails the update, then undoes the update, then restarts a few times and then I can log on normally.<br />
<br />
I've run the Windows Update Troubleshooter several times and it hasn't helped at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted MS support and they told me to update the BIOS but would not tell me why they thought that, so I'm dubious until someone points me to a KB article or something where I can see evidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be hugely appreciated, since this has ruined my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I have done the following, which is the process outlined by MS support on their page:<br />
<br />
1. Tried installing 1809 - failed<br />
2. Ran Windows Update Troubleshooter - fixed errors. Re-ran update - failed<br />
3. Update SSU - already have latest version.<br />
4. Installing KB4493437 - failed<br />
5. Run DISM and SFC - completed without errors<br />
6. Run Windows Update - failed<br />
7. Run in place upgrade - failed<br />
</p>
<p>I need to know where to look for errors - I've checked the Application and Setup event logs but I don't know what I'm looking for.<br />
<br />
I've also looked in the C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log but again I don't know what I'm looking for.<br />
<br />
If I have to reinstall Windows from scratch I might as well get a new operating system so I'm hoping there is a fix for this.</p>

            Hi Hypercubic
<br />
<br />The last BIOS update for that model was released on 24/11/2016 so I doubt a BIOS update is the problem
<br />
<br />Do you know what update is trying and failing to install?
<br />
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what Version No. and build No. of Windows 10 are you running?
<br />
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Windows Updates
<br />
<br />What update(s) are showing as pending on your system?       
        </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the update process - it took several hours and I started it in the evening so I had to go to bed before it had completed, but it had actually started the update process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the morning there was a dialog box informing me that the update had failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking Winver, my OS version is unchanged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which event log would hold useful information? Do Windows updates output anything verbose to log files at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
        </p>

<p>I tried it a second time, exactly the same result, a dialog telling me the windows update has failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time a second dialog has appeared, offering me a link to contact MS support (not going to bother with that, useless last time) and an error code: 0x8007042b (in text that cannot be selected so I had to re-type it manually - nothing about Windows updates
 is useful any more).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be no agreement online as to the cause or cure for this error as far as I can see.</p>

<p>That's the page that I referred to - there it says it might be anti-virus, it might be a download issue, it might be corrupted files etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The truth is that this error has no one specific cause or cure - which is standard for MS error codes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's face it, without a specific error message in either a log file or an event log or something like that, I'm still in the dark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently trying the upgrade now using the media creation tool, but this is just a blind stab in the dark with no real evidence to back anything up.</p>

            Create ISO using Media Creation Tool. This way, you can use the ISO later on also if it doesn't work this time.

            How does that help if we do not know what the issue is?

<p>I did this, it failed exactly the same way as the normal update.</p>
