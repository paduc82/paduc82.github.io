<h2>            Can not view CCTV image using Team Viewer 6</h2>
                    <div>
<p>During office hours I want to monitor (using my 64bit Windows 7 Laptop) CCTV installed into my home. I came to know that Team viewer is best freeware solution for remote access. I accessed my home PC (installed XP on it) using Team Viewer 6. instead of displaying
 view a Gray window is displayed whenever I attempts to watch camera, but I could operate home PC perfectly except CCTV view</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uninstalled it and reinstalled and it still does not run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried running it as the administrator and it still will not run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The printer works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can press the scan icon on the xp760 and it will scan and email a copy to my PC.</p>

            Hi Roger.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />  Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Install the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC. 
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall any printer software.   
<br />
<br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers: 
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click printer to delete  Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.   
<br />
<br />5) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot.
<br />
<br />6) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.   
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />In some cases where software is too old or won't run, having a basic driver installed will enable the use of Windows Fax and Scan utility, so you can open that now to see if it will detect the scanner and if so use it instead.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
A month ago I started seeing my laptop was locking its keyboard and trackpad without me asking. I diagnosed the problem as the laptop going into tablet mode without my asking, so I went into the keyboard settings and adjusted the keyboard lock to "<strong>Never
 lock keyboard and touchpad.</strong>"&nbsp;<strong>*</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
That keyboard setting solved my problem until last night....</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
A Dell/Windows update went through last night and I came back this morning to see my keyboard and touchpad are once again locked. I went into the keyboard settings and the "<strong>Never lock keyboard and touchpad</strong>" radio button is still checked! When
 I tilt the laptop, it undoes the lock, but as soon as I put it back on a flat surface, it reverts to tablet mode.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
To be clear, this is what happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard locks (indicated by the notification "Autorotate On")</li><li>I pick the laptop up, tip it upwards or turn it sideways, keyboard unlocks</li><li>I place it back down, or I plug the power back in, and the keyboard locks ("Autorotate On")</li><li>Keyboard Lock setting reads "Never lock my keyboard and touchpad."</li><li>Tablet mode settings are set so that it uses "Desktop Mode" when I sign in, and "Don't Ask Me and Don't Switch" is my current setting for automatically switching to Tablet Mode.</li><li>Also, the "Temporarily unlock keyboard and touchpad" button does nothing in the system tray..</li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
This is what I want to happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want my keyboard to&nbsp;<strong>never lock under any circumstance, ever.&nbsp;</strong>It's a laptop and I use it as such. It sits on a table and doesn't move, and it never gets put into tablet configuration on purpose.</li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Please assist. PLEASE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>*</strong> (By the way that option took WAY too long to find, and that issue took way too long to diagnose. I ended up wiping the

<p>I'm fairly positive I've figured out what was causing this problem. We had two dell laptops in our office and since no one used them but me, I stacked them on top of one another and used whichever one was on top. I have a crazy theory that the accelerometers
 for each laptop were interacting with one another when they were on top of one another, causing it to misinterpret whether it was in tablet mode or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've since unstacked the laptops and they're behaving normally again. Still very strange and might want to caution people about this strange phenomenon.</p>

<h2>            Problem playing video files on large external hard drive using Media Player app</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>

<p>This is the first time posting something on here. The information here is lengthy, but I wanted to provide a comprehensive description at my problem. Thanks in advance for any constructive input. </p>



<p>First off, I have a large amount of home movies and photos. Somewhere in the area of 7-8 TB worth. And with my phone shooting in 4K, It's only going to get larger and larger. I’ve worked on cars a lot over the years, taking videos and photos with various cameras and phones for reference. Also, I'm a new homeowner who takes a lot of before and after video and pics of projects. Not to mention the old VHS family recordings I’ve converted to digital. Sorry about all that, just trying to set the stage. </p>



<p>PROBLEM: When trying to view videos via the Xbox One (X1) Media Player app, it gives an&nbsp;error:&nbsp;"Can't play&nbsp;0xc00d11cd (0x80070001)"</p>



<p>It’s not as simple as that though…</p>



<p>When I start to reach capacity on certain drives, the X1 will recognize all the files, but it will not show the cover art or play the file at all. But it plays some files. </p>



<p>For example, if the drive has 2,000 files, it plays 800 of them correctly, but the other 1,200 it gives an error and doesn’t display the cover art. But it I divide all 2,000 files onto smaller drives, then the X1 plays them without problem. </p>



<p>Format: The drives are all NTFS formatted. And the files are compatible. As I mentioned above, I use several 1TB and 2TB drives, and all these files play fine on the X1. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I borrowed and tested other drives and X1 consoles to rule out one piece of equipment being the issue. </p>



<p>Drives: Some drives are mine and others belong to family and friends (I’m not rich lol). Here’s the lineup: </p>



<p>One (1) Seagate Backup Plus 5TB Portable External Hard Drive USB 3.0, Silver (STDR5000101)</p>



<p>Four (4) Seagate Backup Plus Slim 2TB Portable External Hard Drive USB 3.0, Blue (STDR2000102)</p>



<p>Two (2) Seagate Backup Plus 5TB Desktop External Hard Drive USB 3.0 (STDT5000100)</p>



<p>Two (2) Seagate Backup Plus 8TB Desktop External Hard Drive USB 3.0 (STDT8000100)</p>

<p>---------------------</p>



<p>The External 5TB (STDT5000100) drives and the 2TB (STDR2000102) portables all operate fine. I also have a Western Digital 2TB portable that works fine. </p>



<p>I’m seeing the issue with the 8 TB (STDT8000100) external drives and the 5TB (STDR5000101) portable </p>



<p>-----------------</p>

<p>Here’s a couple scenarios: </p>



<ol><li><p>I add 25% capacity worth of files to the 8 TB (and portable 5TB) drive and the X1 displays all art and plays all files correctly (YAY!)</p></li><li><p>When I begin to fill the drive (somewhere over 50% full) then the X1 shows the file, but no art and gives an “unsupported format” error (BOO!)</p></li></ol>

<p>-----------------</p>



<p>I’ve chatted with 2-3 different Microsoft support reps in the past. They went through the typicals questions: “Did you try another drive of the same size, did you try another X1 console, what are the formats of the files, etc. ...”</p>



<p>The last conversion I had with a MS support rep ended with “Can you find a different brand 8TB to try?”</p>



<p>No. I haven’t. These drives aren’t cheap enough to go buy another and I trust that the drives are functioning correctly. Afterall, I can still view files on my PC via the 8TB when it’s near full. </p>



<p>One more thing to add, </p>



<p>In scenario 2, the files that the X1 will play are the files that were added first. For example, if adding files 1-1000, File 1-300 will play fine, but then 301-1000 will not play. But if I remove all files and add only files 301-500 to the drive, it will play them fine. My point is, it's not the file that the problem, is the X1 not able to retrieve them all when it's near capacity. </p>



<p>-----------------------------</p>



<p>Here’s my non-tech savvy theory: I believe that the X1 is timing out during its scan of the files. Any files not fully scanned after the “timeout” will be unplayable. Perhaps it’s not entirely the X1’s fault, I think the 5TB portable and the 8TB external drives are crammed to the max and the discs layered in such a way that maybe the X1 isn’t ready for it. Maybe it reads the first layer fine, but cannot access and play the next layer... idk. Again, I’m not tech savvy, so break me in gently. </p>



<p>Thank you</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The options are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Set it to 5GHz which will only connect to 5GHz network (this is fine until you're somewhere without 5GHz, then, extremely inconvenient).</p>
<p>2. Set it to Auto which will prefer 2.4GHz almost every time (even if you're a few metres from the router with full strength where 5GHz is optimal).</p>
<p>Both of these options fail to allow us to PREFER 5GHz, but still connect to 2.4GHz when a 5GHz network isn't available.</p>

<p>
</p><p>On January 15, 2015, Microsoft released a package of drivers to Windows Update that includes an updated Marvell WiFi driver for the Surface Pro 3. If you are one of the folks that has been trying to resolve issues of connecting to 2.4GHz instead of 5 GHz
 on your dual band router, this new driver includes settings to fine tune your connectivity preferences when both &nbsp;5GHz and 2.4 GHz networks are available.</p>

    <title>Surface PRO 2 will not boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martygriffinn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface PRO 2 will not boot</h2>
                    <p>It has Win10 for past several months with no problems.</p>
<p>On 7/1/2017 it hung, and after force stop (holding power key down) it will only reboot into diagnose mode.</p>
<p>I do not have a Restore Point or USB&nbsp; image and none of the other option do anything different.</p>
<p>Command Prompt shows part of my C:\ drive is present.&nbsp; I can access a USB stick using D:\.&nbsp; There is an X drive that appears to have Windows stuff. &nbsp; I have another working Surface 2 that does not have this X drive.</p>
<p>I took the Reset this PC option but it said it could not do the reset. &nbsp; Therefore I'm out of options.</p>
<p>I'll try to may a USB recovery on the working Surface 2 and see if it will work on the non working one. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw a similar forum post from 6/27/17 where another Surface 2 was hung.&nbsp; That was only 4 days before so perhaps it's a driver or virus issue, or perhaps the SSD's are all wearing out at the same time???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not figured out if MS will help or if this is under warranty.&nbsp; Mine was a refurbished unit from MS purchased last year, so hopefully they'll fix it if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on how to reset to new status is appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Marty, &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Since none of the recovery options worked, we would need additional information for us to provide you with accurate resolution. Please answer the questions below:
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Was your Surface upgraded to Windows 10? </li><li>Did you use the recovery image to reset your Surface to its factory condition?<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>In case you haven't used the recovery image, we suggest&nbsp; that you download the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
recovery image</a> for your Surface 2. Make sure that your USB drive should be at least 8 GB in size.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response. </p>
&nbsp; &nbsp;

</p><p>How did you determine "The SSD is ReadOnly and Write Protected" - what tool did you use?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still would be worth trying the downloadable recovery image. Use a 16GB USB 2.0 flash stick formatted FAT32.

<p>MS will not allow me to download the image (see post above). Perhaps because the surface was refurbished by MS? &nbsp;&nbsp; I have another identical surface pro 2 that I had bought new, and MS will allow me to download the image (win 8) for that.&nbsp; I might try it
 on the bad surface (since they are identical other than serial number).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used CHKDSK, which could not check the SSD, because it said it was Write Protected.&nbsp; Also the automatic diagnosis failed saying t hey could not run.&nbsp; Also I could not reset or clean the disk, and I can only see a few of the previous folders, so I'm confident
 the SSD is shot. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called MS and they offered&nbsp; to sell be a new surface 4 for $649 in trade, which is cheaper than buying a new Pro.</p>

<p>I tried multiple times and it would not allow me to download the image for my refurbished Surface Pro 2.&nbsp; However it allowed me to download for my working surface pro 2 that I purchased new.&nbsp; I'm going to try that image to see if I can boot from USB, etc.&nbsp;
 It might give me more confirmation that my SSD is dead.</p>
<p>Well, the $649 offer is for a refurbished surface pro 4 with one year warranty.&nbsp; My experience is the SSD's might last a year or so, so the one year warranty is useless unless it's a lemon from the go.&nbsp; Also I suspect refurbished does not mean the replaced
 the SSD so it's probably got a lot of wear and tear already and so is a ticking time bomb (SSD is the weak link on the surface).</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions.</p>

<p>See if you can remove the "read only" attributes of the hard drive. Please try the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open command prompt.</li><li>Type in <strong>Diskpart.</strong></li><li>Then type in <strong>list volume.</strong></li><li>Select the volume number of the local disk drive. (ex. disk 2)</li><li>Type in the command: <strong>attributes disk clear readonly</strong></li><li>Once done, close the command prompt<strong>.</strong></li></ol>
<p>Open the command prompt again and type the following commands and press <strong>
Enter</strong>: </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bootrec /RebuildBcd</strong><br />
<strong>bootrec /fixMbr</strong><br />
<strong>bootrec /fixboot</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>These commands will try to repair the Master Boot Record<strong>.</strong> After running the commands, see if you'll be able to boot the system in Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If still you're unable to boot the system in Windows, run<strong> chskdsk /r</strong>.&nbsp;This will check the entire disk surface for bad sectors and will attempt to repair it finds any.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case non of the troubleshooting steps worked, we suggest that you refer to this

            Hi, <br />
<br />
An alternative is to use Revo Uninstaller which I recommend even when you get this issue fixed.<br />

<br />
If needed :<br />
<br />
Try these generic Control Panel troubleshooting methods :<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on your machine? Include all you ever had including<br />
those you uninstalled. (These can leave remnants which can cause strange issues.)<br />
<br />
Do a search for all .cpl files most will be in "C:\Windows\System32" however you can have others. Click on<br />
each one at a time and see if one does not start - if so Right Click on it and rename it using cpZ as the extension so it is east to find. Retry Control Panel - if no joy keep trying all your .cpl files. (Note the others found under other Folders under C:\Windows
 should not be tried as they are not active.)<br />
<br />
<br />
A few of these are appwiz.cpl, firewall.cpl, desk.cpl, powercfg.cpl, inetcpl.cpl, timedate.cpl and others.<br />
<br />
Try these in case general corruption has a role :<br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Enter this at the prompt - sfc /scannow<br />

            Well I can see this was not helpful for him. I also have the same problem, no one seems to have a solution for this. Is it a Windows 8 problem? Games for Windows-Live program will not load up on my computer with Windows 8. I get the error code: 0x800710dd
 but no solution anywhere. Might be a nice project for an Microsoft employee to try and solve....

    <title>Skype call encryption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dan o&#39;brien2191  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype call encryption</h2>
                    I have been using Skype for a long time. Lately on 2 occasions, I have been told by other Skype users that they have overheard my conversations when I didn't even know that I was connected with them. Once a friend called while I was having lunch so I decided
 not to answer. He later informed me that he heard the table conversation between our family members and told me some details. On another occasion, I was on a Skype call with one of my Skype contacts and another call came in on my screen. I decided not to answer
 the third party at that moment. Later they told me that they could hear everything that was spoken about with my first caller. Why is this happening????? If this persists -- goodbye Skype.

    <title>Language switching hotkey setting not honoured at login screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> severin pota  say:</h3>
<h2>            Language switching hotkey setting not honoured at login screen</h2>
                    Windows 8 allows to change key sequence used to switch the input language either to Ctrl-Shift, Left Alt-Shift&nbsp;or Grave Accent. When I change this hotkey to Ctrl-Shift, this setting is NOT honoured at login screen while entering password (you must use
 Left Alt-Shift for switching). Why?

<div>That does not help at all, and it has nothing to do with the model of the computer. I have the same problem here (Lenovo W510 laptop + Windows 8.1 if you really need to know). The key combination set using the Advanced Key Setting dialogue will not work
 on the login screen, instead it will default to Alt-Shift or Windows-Space.</div>
</blockquote>
<br />
<div>I've just found the solution, and what a twisted solution that is!</div>
<div><br />
<div>You have to go to Control Panel =&gt; Languages =&gt; Advanced Settings, find the link in the middle of the dialogue page "Apply language settings to the welcome screen...", click it, then click "Copy settings", set the flag "Welcome screen and system accounts",
 and click "OK".</div>

<br />Looks like you are talking about Home Single Language. Unfortunately, you would have to reinstall again. Make sure to use the newest installation media.
<br />
<br />You would have to force the Installation Media to install Home SL. See for detailed steps.

            Hi Suji.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />OEM and retail Windows 10 installs both use the same Home media, and it should reactivate regardless of the Version.  
<br />
<br />How was Windows 10 originally Activated on the PC?  Did it come preinstalled from Factory, was it Upgraded with free or paid Upgrade, or was it a retail copy and license?  
<br />
<br />For Upgrade, when you first upgraded and it activated it assigned a permanent Digital License to the PC in Microsoft Activation Servers so you can reinstall any time and in any way you want as long as you reinstall the licensed version.  It should reactivate soon after going online.    More about Digital LIcenses vs. Product Keys here:  
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12440/windows-10-activation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12440/...</a>
<br />
<br />You can move the Digital License to new hardware following this procedure:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />Factory installs have the Product Key embedded in BIOS or UEFI firmware and should activate themselves, but you can check for the key by installing ProducKey and look for the OEM-BIOS key:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a>
<br />
<br />Retail keys must be reinserted for reinstalls during install or in Settings. 
<br />
<br />What is the Status and Edition shown at the top of the page at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?  
<br />
<br />Run the Activation Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation.  If it says you have a Digital License then no matter what method above only the Generic Version Key can be inserted to reactivate:  <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>
<br />
<br />If this fails you can contact Microsoft Support:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>

<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, my name is G.Paz, I am an Independent Advisor.

<br />OEM is a pre-installed Windows 10 that come from manufacturer. 
<br />OEM license can't be transfer. 
<br />At this point I suggest you to buy a Windows license and execute the Windows activation.

<h2>            Can I protect a USB portable drive and still use it with SyncToy&#63;</h2>
                    I am a teacher and have a portable hard drive that I use at home and in my various classrooms. At home I use Sync Toy to keep my files up to date with any changes I make to the files at school and visa versa. All computers are Win 7, although the work
 machines I do not have admin rights on and certain actions may well be restricted through the policies. At home I use Win 7 Home Premium. I have a separate drive used for backups - this is just for data portability.<br />
<br />
I have looked on-line at this and the solutions offered(True Crypt, or password protected zip folder or hiding folders and the like) would mean that I would not be able to do my daily sync with the portable drive and the mirror on my home computer.
<br />
<br />
Is there another way?<br />

<h2>            Installing a new Printer</h2>
                    Hi, I have just bought a new Xerox Phaser 7500DN but the software that came with it and the drivers on the Xerox website will not load because it says that I do not have the correct version of Windows. I am using Windows 10 Pro, version 1607.What version
 do I need to be able to use the printer to its full potential, please. It is connected via Ethernet cable. I have checked the compatibility list and the printer is listed as being compatible with Windows 10. Hoping that there is someone out there with more
 knowledge than me.

<p>You will get the same information on the left side of any folder or drive you open...</p>

            <span>Hi,</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft community and thank you for posting your query.</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you to fix the issue.
</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p><span>Let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps in resolving the issue. Follow the below method.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run maintenance troubleshooter and check if that helps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows + X</strong>&nbsp;keys on the keyboard and select&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</p>

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on&nbsp;Next&nbsp;and follow onscreen instruction complete the Hardware and devices troubleshooter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If the issue still persist, try the below method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to boot the system in <span>Clean boot state</span> and check if the issue still persist.
<span>Clean boot</span> process will help you determine which third party program/app that is causing this issue. It could be some other application or programs, which runs on the computer at the background, leading to this issue. Please visit the below link
 on how to perform <strong>Clean boot.</strong></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above method did not help to fix the issue, try the below method.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to boot in safe mode and check if you encounter the same issue. Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer with only basic service and functionality. If an existing problem doesn’t reappear when
 you start windows in safe mode, you can eliminate the defaults settings and basic device drivers as possible cause. Visit the below link on how to boot in safe mode:</span></p>

<h2>            Black screen issue with video playing apps</h2>
                    I have recently started experiencing this issue on my PC that seems to be affecting all of the video playing apps (Netflix, Vudu, etc.) from the Windows 10 store. This is what the issue is: I watch a movie or TV show on something like Netflix or Vudu,
 and it plays fine. But if I go to watch something on one of those apps after I booted up my PC from sleep, the entire screen goes black unless I close the app. I can still hear the video playing in the background, but nothing is visible on screen. And I don't
 mean just the video, I mean the entire PC monitor goes black. Restarting the PC fixes this issue, and I only experience the issues after the PC has went into and woken up from sleep mode. This issue does not seem to be affecting the browser versions of the
 softwares. And I have tried reinstalling all softwares I am having this trouble with, but nothing seems to help. I am sorry if anyone is confused by my explanation. This doesn't seem to be happening on the other Windows device in my

            So i found out that even though my display is updated, it is that version of the driver thats causing issues. I replaced the latest version with the “recommended” version through device manager and the problem disappeared. So it seems that there was either
 an incompatibility or corruption causing this.

<h2>            How to take screen shot in windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hope I am in the correct section for this question. How can a screen shot be done on windows 8.1 ?<br />
<br />
Instructions say press the windows key plus the prtsc key. Then it should be saved in the library printscan pictures folder.<br />
<br />
Firstly I don't have a dedicated folder by that name in that location. Do I have to creat one. Second pressing those keys achieves nothing thus far. The screen does not dim as advised.<br />
<br />
On my keyboard the prtsc key is also labelled with "END" upper part of the key.<br />
<br />
So when I press those two keys I keep going back to the start screen or to the end of a page. How do I engage the prtsc part of the key !
</p>
<p>

            <p>Ok. Solution found. I was making the mistake of not holding down the FN and windows keys together while pressing quickly the PRTSC key.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are having trouble figuring out if your roommate has swapped your power supply unit. Unfortunately there is no way to really determine which power supply unit your console had prior to this. The only way would have been if you had written
 down the serial number somewhere and then compared the two to see if you still have the original. I would advise you converse with your roommate in regards to this matter.
</p>
<p>

            <p>It sounds like the fairly useless shortcut keys to change keyboard layout have accidentally been pressed.</p>
<p>Go to Control panel, Region &amp; language, Keyboards &amp; languages, Change keyboards, General tab, select United Kingdom keyboard or click on Add... &amp; select it from the list first.</p>
<p>Afterwards, go to Control panel, Region &amp; language, Keyboards &amp; languages, Change keyboards, Language bar tab and, if you don't routinely need to change language settings, make the language bar hidden.</p>
<p>Then, go to Control panel, Region &amp; language, Keyboards &amp; languages, Change keyboards, Advanced key settings tab where you will see the shortcut key sequence that probably got you into this problem by accident. You'll also see the Change key sequence that
 you might wish to alter by clicking on the Change key sequence button and setting Switch input language &amp; Switch keyboard layout to Not assigned [when I changed these, I had to set Not assign for the Switch input language and accept the change then come back
 to the dialog to set Not assign for the Switch keyboard layout].</p>

<h2>            OEM license key not working for clean USB install of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I want to donate a computer that came OEM with Windows 7 so I downloaded Windows 10 to a flash drive and started to do a clean install and it will not accept the Windows 7 license.&nbsp;I requested for all data to be removed and now I am stuck and I can't remove
 forward.</p>
<p>I don't understand why the OEM license for windows 7 will not work</p>
