    <title>If number less than 5.5, report answer as less than result - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            If number less than 5.5, report answer as less than result</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to make an equation in excel that uses two varying numbers to give an answer. &nbsp;If the first number put into the equation is less than 5.5, the result needs to be reported as less than what would be given if the equation were solved with 5.5. &nbsp;I
 can't find a way to add the less than symbol without the entire equation screwing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if I'm doing the equation with the first number at 6, it will give me the answer of 0.1</p>
<p>If I use 5.5, I'd get 0.8</p>
<p>If I use 4, I want the answer to be &lt;0.8</p>
<p>Same goes for any number under 5.5. &nbsp;It should be reported as &lt;0.8. &nbsp;However, the way this equation works, I can't just use an IF statement to say 'if value &lt;5.5, give &lt;0.8', because the other number in the equation changes the answer each time.</p>
<p />

            Yes, I did get it to work. &nbsp;I didn't try using the CONCATENATE function, but instead used a simple "&lt;" &amp; (function). &nbsp;Since I didn't need the less than symbol to be used as a math function, but just as an image, it worked fine. &nbsp;I'm still testing my equation
 to make sure it's working fine, but it seems to be. &nbsp;I also had to double the length of my equation by having IF true, use "&lt;" &amp; equation, if false, use equation. &nbsp;Thank you for the help though.

<h2>            CSL - USB micro Bluetooth-Adapter V4.0 not working in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>hello there!</p>
<p>I upgraded to windows 10 from windows 8.1 and ever since, I have zero bluetooth functionality on my PC. Under Devices in PC settings, there appears both Toshiba Bluetooth and Toshiba RFBus Driver which I don't remember being present before the upgrade. Could
 this be the reason? Please help cause I really need my bluetooth mouse working again. Gosh I can't even use my BT speakers! Thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Battlefiend 4 a seconds black screen after toggling game messages</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hi everyone,</p>
&nbsp;<br />
I've installed Build 10166 and run Battlefield 4.<br />
Although I got some performance increase, faced an annoying problem.<br />
Battlefield has a lot of messages, like those helping you to get acquainted with the interface and so on. When I close them, the screen is black for a second, and game continues after. The same black screen is when you got revived or begin the match.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
First of all I was blaming my graphic card Radeon 280x, tried different drivers but no effect. What can be the root of the issue? On win7 it was fine.
<p />

<h2>            Unable to update Office using Microsoft AutoUpdater</h2>
                    <p>I was updating using the Office Insider Fast method through Microsoft AutoUpdate. &nbsp;From one of the last updates pushed out, my Microsoft AutoUpdater is unable to save my settings for the Office Insider Fast option and says there are no updates available.
 &nbsp;I know there are updates available for Skype for Business and Office 2016 as other team members are receiving these updates, and I'm on an older version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a complete clean uninstall of Office 2016 and Skype for Business. I'm now currently running version 15.31 and updated to the latest MAU to 3.8.2 (161209). &nbsp;I am currently running 15.31 which is not the latest stable release, and MAU continues to tell
 me there are no updates available. &nbsp;I try and select Office Insider Fast and it tells me the same thing. &nbsp;When I reopen MAU, none of my previous settings were saved. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else encountered this issue and know of a fix so I can continue to get updates? &nbsp;Thanks.<br />

<h2>            Office 365 Home &#40;5 user vs 1 user&#41; Skype Free minutes issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I purchased Office 365 Home. This is not a Skype issue but an Office 365 purchase/licensing issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please go and read this site&nbsp;https://products.office.com/en-nz/buy/office&nbsp;</p>
<p>specifically the skype 60 minute section and the file storage sections where is states "per user" and "per month per user" also section supplied below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c4ee626-ba29-4542-8ef2-dd8358703ec0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c4ee626-ba29-4542-8ef2-dd8358703ec0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and then the o365 card where you also see 5 users vs 1 user storage and skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc00b146-fece-404e-b4b7-e1b519c98221?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc00b146-fece-404e-b4b7-e1b519c98221?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So why is it that you cannot add 60 skype minutes per user to the other members/users you share the subscription with? And when you contact support you are told that this is not the case it is 60 minutes shared between the accounts, but this is not how it
 reads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion this is false advertising or someone at Microsoft has something horribly wrong. I would like to know how you are going to resolve this, can a Microsoft support representative contact me with a resolution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>##### This has now been resolved by Skype support - it had to be escalated to a Skype Specialist and took a couple of days #######</p>

<p>It's always been my understanding that the minutes are per users, not shared. You shouldnt need to 'add' the minutes - they should be added automatically. Have you tried stopping a share then addng it back?
<br />
<br />
Everybody gets : <br />
Office on up to 5 PCs/Macs, 5 tablets, and 5 phones <br />
1 TB of OneDrive cloud storage <br />
60 Skype minutes per month </p>
<p>
</p><p>We never use skype (want my minutes? &lt;g&gt;) so i don't know if the users had the minutes but when I clicked Stop Sharing the warning dialog said this:</p>
Stop sharing
<p>
If you stop sharing your Office subscription with [name], they'll be notified via email, and:</p>
<ul>
<li>They'll be able to view &amp; print their Office files but not create new ones.</li><li>They'll lose their 60 Skype minutes per month.</li><li>They won't be able to use Office Mobile</li><li>They'll lose their 1TB of OneDrive storage.</li></ul>

<p>Hi Diane</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried stopping the sharing and adding it back but no luck. Interesting enough I did see this message when stopping the sharing - which implies they do each get 60 minutes but I just can't link it to their skype account...</p>

            Yeah, I got that message too. I'm checking with the office 365 product team - they are the ones who promote this feature.  I recall back when office 365 came out, the minutes were originally only for the subscriber, I dont recall when they changed.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I previously had my family members setup so when I went into Services and Subscriptions -&gt; Office 365 Home -&gt; Sharing; each family member was listed and I could share with them. I did not share via email or link as did not need to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you saying the MS product team report that it should be working and in fact one does get minutes per account. Have they actually tested it themselves and it works as expected on the additional accounts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your effort :-)</p>

<p>The group I asked (my contacts are office, not skype) reported:</p>

<p>This is what my shared account sees - this is from my husband's account that I unshared and reshared yesterday. Clicking Get Skype Minutes got the 60 min added to his account.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I am trying to handle a situation which gives runtime error 3251.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a combobox (value list type) on which I have two events. One beforeUpdate and one AfterUpdate event.</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>Gentlemen, i am very much thankful for your excellent support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i set "Cancel=True" it keeps the value user select and msxbox keep popping and unable to click the combobox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In BeforeUpdate Event, i basically needs to tell user (if current status, beforeupdate is set as "Flight Records") then a msgbox saying "this flight's status is set as "Flight Records" so cannot change it" , &nbsp;then he/she cannot change it to another status
 and at sametime i need to return it back to the current value which in my case will be "Flight Records". When i use Me.Undo, it somehow does it.</p>

            How did you use it? If you apply it in the On Current event it should work fine. And I would use AllowEdits, not just Locked on the control.&nbsp;

            Scott, do you mean to say that i should use both locked control and allowedits? If i use allowedits, i should use IF condition and on which form event i should use allowedit?

            That's kinda up to you. From what I understood if the record is marked as Flight Records you don't want it changed. So just setting AllowEdits=False in the On current event after testing for the status may be enough. If you only want to lock that one control,
 then you have to use the Locked or Enabled property.

            <p><span>Hi Laura, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you performed a full computer virus scan on the computer?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is this issue specific to Internet Explorer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur if the Internet Explorer settings are incorrect.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us follow these methods and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1.</strong></p>
<p><span>Let us optimize Internet Explorer 9 and check the status.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps under the section”</span> <span>
To delete all or some of your browsing history” from this article.</span></p>
<p><strong>How to delete your browsing history in Internet Explorer 9</strong><span>:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/how-to-delete-your-browsing-history-in-internet-explorer-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/how-to-delete-your-browsing-history-in-internet-explorer-9</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, then open Internet Explorer in no add ons mode to check if this helps.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Start button.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click All Programs.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Accessories.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click System Tools, and then click Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2.</strong></p>
<p><span>By changing the security settings, you can customize how Internet Explorer helps protect your PC from potentially harmful or malicious web content. Internet Explorer automatically assigns all websites to a security zone: Internet,
 Local intranet, Trusted sites, or Restricted sites. Each zone has a different default security level that determines what kind of content might be blocked for that site.</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer to the section “<strong>Change your security zone settings</strong>” from this article to Reset all zones to default level and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie-security-privacy-settings#ie=ie-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie-security-privacy-settings#ie=ie-9</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3.</strong></p>
<p><span>You can use the “InPrivate Browsing” feature to check if the website opens clearly.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4.</strong></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to reset Internet Explorer settings to default.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press Windows key + R to get the run window.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “inetcpl.cpl” and press enter to open “Internet properties” window.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the “Advanced” tab and click “Reset” to reset Internet Explorer settings to default.</span></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong><span>: The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also
 reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.</span></p>

            is no call barring feature on the 920 or as part of WP8. i believe that Samsung has made apps for this, but as of yet there may not be any apps in the Store either for the function you desire. if you can't make calls, i would check the condition of your
 SIM card and also with your network carrier about signal / reception issues.

    <title>Outlook stuck processing hotmail account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r_siauciunas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook stuck processing hotmail account</h2>
                    <p>Outlook is stuck processing hotmail email account. It is processing the same email account twice in the Send/Receive window. It has been doing it since about two days ago. Before that it was stuck synchronising first one then another gmail account. It may
 be an attempt to damage one or more .pst files. It happened to me more than five times. Calendars disappear. Data files damaged. I use Outlook for business rather than for fun, therefore it is always a loss. In more than 10 years I failed to get any substantial
 help from anyone. In fact, even this time gmail synchronisation issue resolved itself after several pst files were damaged. Fortunately, I managed to repair them. Now I have hotmail processing issue. In addition web browser windows become "Not Responding"
 very often, One Note become "Not Responding" routinely.&nbsp;It's only a matter of time, until either my calendar or data files are damaged again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I would appreciate, if people who are not in a position to provide qualified advice, abstained from interfering.</p>

            These emails are from spammers. If blocking domain doesn't work, I would suggest you to activate safe sender list. You can come up a list of email domains that you wanted to block. Yet somehow tedious at some point cause it might be needing so much time

<p>This is not an ok support from Microsoft on these spam-emails. My Hotmail inbox is ruined because of these emails, on this emailaccount I have had for soon to be 20 years. Every account I have registered online the past 20 years are connected to this email...
 You need to fix this from your side on the back end.</p>
<p>I get about 15-20 of these different @anstrorysc.net email every day!!&nbsp;</p>

            Messages delivered to the Junk Email folder are already considered blocked and adding the sending address or domain to the Blocked Sender list is pointless because it doesn't apply to messages arriving in the Junk Email folder.

<p>The problem here is how the sender information is built up:</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***; on behalf of; Trygt, seriøst og uten kostnad &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have added both komplett.no and anstrorysc.net to my junk-filter, but your junk-filter doesn't seem to be able to handle the address when it looks as above.&nbsp; It is quite obvioius that you guys need to fix your filtering, as it doesn't help doing anything
 more from our side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, adding the individual *** Email address is removed for privacy *** would have been no use anyway, since the nnnn-part changes for every e-mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem with this is that blocking komplett.no blocks a legitimate sender (a Norwegian internet-store).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I sincerely hope that you guys will turn around and address this issue.</p>

    <title>Sync with ZUNE software and lose connectivity with accounts. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sugoi.dane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sync with ZUNE software and lose connectivity with accounts.</h2>
                    
<p>When I first bought my WP7 in December I decided to sync my phone with the ZUNE software after I had set it up with all of my contacts, connected it to my Facebook, and added my email accounts(Gmail and Live) (I hadn't downloaded any applications other than
 the YouTube application.)</p>
<p><span>I got the USB connector out of the box, and hooked up my phone and followed all of the on-screen instructions. Everything looked great, I synced a bunch of my music and some photos for backgrounds. I tried to eject my phone by using the "Safely remove
 hardware..." function like I do everything else, and it gave me a message that there was something using it and that I should close that application before&nbsp;disconnecting. So I closed the ZUNE software and safely disconnected the device.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Next I left for work and when I got to work I noticed that the icon for my YouTube application had changed to a black box with a white star in it. Confused, I figured it just needed a soft reset, so I did that, it booted up(very quickly I might add),
 and it was the same. I noticed then that my Facebook wouldn't update(Within the "Contacts" hub),&nbsp;neither&nbsp;would my email(either) sync, and generally anything having to do with an "Account" wouldn't work. So grudgingly I hard reset the device.</span></p>
<p>I went through the set up again, and later when I got home(After doing nothing other than re-setting up all the "Accounts" listed at the beginning) and tried to sync again. Again, it all looked fine, and again after doing the *exact* same process as above
 I disconnected it and went on my merry way only to find that my "Accounts" wouldn't sync again. Not over Wi-Fi and not over data(through AT&amp;T). So Once again I grudgingly&nbsp;hard-reset&nbsp;and went through the whole thing mentioned above again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This time though I wasn't going to be fooled into syncing through ZUNE so I just went without for the next month, downloaded applications, sent emails, texted, and called. The usual stuff, no problems.(And very happy I might add.)</p>
<p>Fast-forward to yesterday and I look at some WP7 news saying that there's an update for the ZUNE software. Thinking that they might have fixed my problem I updated, followed the on-screen instructions, and synced my phone after a month's worth of daily life.
 I disconnect and what do you know it happens all over again. No syncing, no updating, and all of my pictures, music covers, and my application's icons turned into those dark boxes with the white stars.</p>
<p>I'm kind of&nbsp;frustrated&nbsp;at this point because now it just makes the software in general buggy, so here I am for the forth time hard-reseting my device and setting it all up again. (Sorry for the novel-like story/explanation.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help, Please. Am I the only one with this problem? I searched but couldn't find anything.</p>
<p><span>Phone: Samsung Focus</span></p>
<p>Network: AT&amp;T</p>
<p>ZUNE Software build: 4.7.1404.0</p>

<p>You should never have imported the old Archive/pst you should simply have opened it in MS Outlook</p>
<p>You could try to repair the pst data file using the scanpst.exe repair utility, if it finds/fixes any errors run it again/again until it finds no more errors to fix.</p>
<p>If it doesnt help, as it is, if you only have the single mail account you should using the Control Panel mail applet add a new Profile, with prompt for profile ticked, then add that single mail account, if you wish to add it as pop, then you need to use
 'other setup' to manually add the mail account, and you will need the pop settings from your mail provider in order to do so.&nbsp; Then start OL under this new Profile and allow to sync before doing anything.</p>
<p>If you have multiple email accounts then in Account Settings, remove this problem, mail account, then restart OL and add the mail account back in.</p>
<p>After which you can consider opening the old pst data file - DO NOT IMPORT</p>

<p><span>Hi Pasutorn Rosing,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to post in community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Based on your description, <strong>Send/ Receive progress</strong> never ends in your Outlook. It might be some items are still unfinished in your Outlook, we may check this problem from following aspects:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Check your Outbox folder to see if any unfinished progress, and just click All Mailboxes then all the ongoing items will be displayed.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc136d16-f321-4422-b856-97819ffcb5ce?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc136d16-f321-4422-b856-97819ffcb5ce?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>Turn on the Work Offline mode and Turn off it again. It will let your email account disconnect with Exchange server and re-connect with it.
</span></p>
<p><span>Delete your problem email account and then re-add it to Outlook, restart Outlook to see if problem persists. It worked when I faced the similar issue as you last time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>At last, if it’s convenient please offer me the screenshot of your
<strong>Send/ Received Progress</strong>, I will better understand what type error you encountered from so I can provided your effective methods.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad244408-70d8-48bd-892e-05f23b28c107?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad244408-70d8-48bd-892e-05f23b28c107?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>And additional information below will help me make a further analysis on your issue:</span></p>
<p><span>a) The type of your account? IMAP /POP/ Exchange/ Others?</span></p>
<p><span>B) The version of your Outlook client? Just click File &gt; Office Account, and you can find the version number in About Outlook.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your cooperation and kind understanding.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Shawn</span></p>

    <title>Is this email from microsoft&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fred-s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is this email from microsoft&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recieved an email from microsoft, <span><span><span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>and oulook says it's from a trusted sender.&nbsp; Now I realize that emails can be spoofed, so even if outlook thinks it's from a trusted sender doesn't mean it is. It's also possible that it's not spoofed, but rather a fake adress (it does
 show @e.microsoft instead of @microsoft) but I may have accidentally marked something as trusted when it wasn't at some earlier time.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>However, something odd about it is that there's hotlinks showing twitter, facebook, pinerest, and youtube icons, but hovering over them doesn't show a twitter/facebook/youtube/pinerest address.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Hovering over any of them shows: e.microsoft.com/Key-..... some jumble.&nbsp; I did not click on the links, because I don't trust them.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>So, my questions are:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Is @e.microsoft.com a domain microsoft uses?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If a phishing email is spoofing a legit adress, do I still mark it as spam?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Is it normal for it not to show a youtube adress when hovering over a youtube icon? (same for facebook, etc)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Thanks</span></span></span></p>

    <title>uninstall office 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john tommy  say:</h3>
<h2>            uninstall office 2010</h2>
                    <p>I have an official copy of Microsoft Office Home and Student 2010 (purchased from PC World) and the three permitted copies are installed on a Desk Top Computer and two Lap Tops. I now need to replace the Desk Top PC so I can move to BT Infinity. I would
 like to uninstall the copy on the Desk Top PC back to the CD Rom so that I still have one unused copy on the official CD Rom that I can install to the new Desk Top computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that way I will still have just the 3 permitted copies in use and the old Desk Top computer won't have a copy of Office loaded on it, so there won't be a pirated version of Office around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One person says this simply cannot be done, another tells me just uninstall it, and a third has said uninstall but with the CD Rom in the drive.</p>
<p>It seems a simple request which will let me still use the 3 copies of Office that Microsft let me have originally, and 'Yes' I am trying to avoid having to buy a new copy of Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd be grateful for any assistance the Forum can give me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation.</p>

    <title>Office Shortcut Names after installing Language Pack - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcinsowik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Shortcut Names after installing Language Pack</h2>
                    <p>I have installed Office 2016 using my University Office 365 subscription. I defaulted to English (US), as that's my primary language when it comes to Human-PC interaction.</p>
<p>After a while, I installed a Polish Language Pack, using a link provided to me by Word, when I started writing a document in Polish. Soon I noticed, that all the Office shortcuts in my Start menu changed from English to Polish, i.e. "OneDrive for Business"
 changed into "OneDrive dla firm", "Skype for Business" into "Skype dla firm", "Telemetry Log (sth)" into "Dziennik telemetryczny dla pakietu office" etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a clean way to revert the change? Is the behavior intended? If so, then why? If now I were to install German LP, because I need German spellchecking, would the names change again? What if I were to install Japanese or Chinese?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. The "Language Preferences" (currently "Preferencje językowe pakietu Office") shortcut does not work, or rather does not start anything.</p>

            <p>Hi Marcin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to summarize this issue, so other community members who come across this thread will quickly find the answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Symptom:</strong></p>
<p>Office ProPlus with the English language is installed. When we install another language pack, such as Polish, Office shortcuts like OneDrive for Business, Skype for Business will become Polish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong>
</p>
<p>We don't need to uninstall and reinstall Office.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In this situation, we can install the English language pack again referring to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Language-Accessory-Pack-for-Office-2016-82ee1236-0f9a-45ee-9c72-05b026ee809f?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>. Then the language on Office shortcuts will change back to English.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sky Pei</p>

<br />
<br />When you right click in the first column of your pivot, you should choose Ungroup to show complete data. If you choose group and leave months selected, you would get months grouping.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<br />
<br />On the View Ribbon in Word, make sure your view is set to 'Print Layout'
<br />
<br />Then click Zoom - 100%

<br />Follow these steps to repair your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the online repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation . . .

            You must have gone into Side to Side mode. Just go to View tab &gt; Click Vertical and now it will allow you whatever you want to do.

            <p>There is no technical requirement to uninstall Office Starter 2010 from the computer before installing Office Professional 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you activated the preloaded Office 2010 Single Image as an Office 2010 Professional Trial, then you can directly convert the Trial into your paid-for license for Office 2010 Professional by following these instructions:</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/access-help/convert-a-trial-version-of-an-office-2010-suite-or-program-to-a-full-retail-version-HA101886436.aspx?CTT=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/access-help/convert-a-trial-version-of-an-office-2010-suite-or-program-to-a-full-retail-version-HA101886436.aspx?CTT=1</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you had Office 2007 on the computer and its Activation Assistant is still installed, then that should definitely be uninstalled and the computer restarted before installing Office 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before installing Office 2010, it's also a good idea to run Windows Update to make sure your sytem has all critical and recommended updates, to include anything for MSXML and .Net.</p>
