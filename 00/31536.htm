<h2>            I take several minutes to connect with anyone via skype or any other voice communication program.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have this issue for about a month now and I can't find nothing like it around the internet.</p>
<p>Whenever I try to make a call on skype (the other person can make the call too), it rings, the person answers and it just keeps on ringing for several other minutes before our voices actually connect. This does not happen in skype alone, I've also used discord
 (another voice communication program) and it also takes several minutes before the "Connecting voice" part finally connects.</p>
<p>This issue persists into other programas such as games. In some games from steam when I try to connect with a friend (or just create a private online lobby for the matter), it takes several minutes of trying to do so then it says my internet connection has
 dropped, my steam disconnects and reconnects immeadiatly and I can finally connect online or create the online lobby. If anyone have any solution I would really appreciate, I've looked all over the internet for an answer. This has only happened after I updated
 for windows 8.1, I did not have this problem with windows 8.0. </p>
<p>All my drivers and windows updates are up to date. I'm using a Dell Inspiron 7520.</p>

<h2>            Logitech G35 Headset Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Alright, first of all, let's get out of the way some things that I have tried.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reconnected my headset.</li><li>Setting my headset as my default playback/recording device.</li><li>Updated drivers.</li></ul>
<p>Alright, so I was just using my headset as usual, and I decided to take out the USB to listen to my laptop's built-in speakers. I am running Windows 7 Home Premium, Lenovo Z570. After using the speakers for a while, I decided to use my headphones again.
 My laptop detects the device, but <strong>does not&nbsp;</strong>play audio. It is set as the default device, and still, when I try to test it at the speaker icon, no green bar, or sound plays at all. This has happened many times before, but I forgot how I fixed
 it. Please help me.</p>

Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />First of all, eliminate all useless files on C:/ by using Disk Cleanup.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3012-open-use-disk-cleanup-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3012-open-u...</a>
<br />Make sure you have checked System files option after the first scan.
<br />Also, 
<br />Treesize should tell you which files and folders are taking up the space.
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />It is worth checking the Users folder and its subfolders with it.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

<p>Hi Sumit,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply&nbsp; , actually I'm using the C partition for system files only , it's 40 GB only for Windows 10&nbsp;</p>
<p>It asks me for and update with at least 8 GB free space&nbsp; , I can't update or find out how can I get the 8 GB&nbsp;</p>
<p>my windows version is and upgrade from Microsoft and I don't have a hard copy so I know I realized another problem , what happen if this version collapsed ? does it mean I lose it and I have to buy a new copy ??</p>

<h2>            Configuring form&#47;page size in MS Win10 Print to PDF</h2>
                    <p>I have Print to PDF "printer" installed on my Win10 system and, generally, it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installed page sizes are: A3, A4, A5, B4 (JIS), B5 (JIS), Executive, Legal, Letter, Statement, and Tabloid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I need to make larger format "prints": ARCH C (18"x24"), ARCH D (24"x36"), and ARCH E1 (30"x42").</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Devices and Printers</strong> &gt; <strong>
Printers</strong> &gt; <strong>Microsoft Print to PDF</strong> &gt; <strong>Print server properties</strong> (ribbon bar) &gt;
<strong>Forms</strong> (tab) lists a whole slew of available forms, including the three that I need. What it doesn't appear to allow is to add these pre-defined standard form/page sizes to those that can be selected when using the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to access or install these pre-defined form/page sizes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hello Nathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you experiencing this zoomed in issue when using the Windows Camera app? Or is it another camera application like Skype? Can you try walking through this troubleshooting document and see if it resolves your issue?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, you may need to reinstall a driver provided by Acer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail - User&#39;s Guide&#63;  Rules for sorting email&#63;</h2>
                    Is there a User's Guide for Windows Live Mail?&nbsp; I'm looking for more information on the storage of new emails.&nbsp; Some of my new emails are not displayed in my Inbox folder, but do show in the Quick view for Unread email.&nbsp; I thought this might be due to
 rules I had set up for sorting email, but when I go to Folders, Message Rules, there are no rules listed, and the emails in question aren't in any of the custom folders I've created.

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the description, I understand that your new emails are not displayed in your inbox folder. I will certainly help you with the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span><span>Open Windows Live Mail desktop client. Navigate
 to the </span><em><span>Folders</span></em><span> tab and click on
</span><em><span>Message rules</span></em><span> to begin with the setup.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span><span>Switch to
</span><em><span>New Rules</span></em><span> tab and click on the button reading
</span><em><span>New</span></em><span>. A dialog for
</span><strong><span>New Mail Rule</span></strong><span> will be launched.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong><span><span>Select and tick the conditions (check points) that
 you would like to apply to the incoming messages. Then select the actions that must be applied on the messages which match or pass the check points.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 4:</span></strong><span> While you select the conditions and
 actions you will notice that a rule gets defined (in words) on the third section of the pop-up. You must click on each of those links that appear and define more specifications as required.</span></p>
<p><span>You can add people from
<em>Contacts</em> or enter an address manually and hit on <em>Add</em>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Steps to Apply a Rule in Windows Live Mail</span></strong></p>
<p><span>When you save a message rule that you have just created you will be shown another window for activating the rules. Alternatively, you can
 bring it up by routing to <em>Folders -&gt; Message rules.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Select the rules that you want to apply to the system currently. Use the
</span><em><span>Move up</span></em><span> and
</span><em><span>Move down</span></em><span> buttons to change the order and preference of rule execution. Click on
</span><em><span>Apply Now</span></em><span> and exit the setup.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I apologize for being slow in acknowledging it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I follow the steps you outlined, the only place I can choose to store selected emails is in the Storage box, which physically resides on my hard drive - and this choice prevents me from being able to view my email on different computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to
 be able to see them in the Inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other advice to help me solve this problem?</p>

    <title>ASUS touchpad not working after update to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            ASUS touchpad not working after update to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an ASUS X571L laptop. After having upgraded it to Windows 10, some of the function keys stopped working, specifically the fn+f9 combo for turning the touchpad on/off. I updated the ATK package and the Smartgesture driver. fn+f9 worked for a short
 time, then the touchpad stopped working entirely. Now, not only that <strong>it doesn't work most of the time</strong>, it sometimes
<strong>disappears from Mouse and Touchpad settings altogether for no apparent reason</strong>. I've tried uninstalling, reinstalling, completely removing the SW and reinstalling, turning off auto updating of the driver and reinstalling an older version - nothing
 works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is even more frustrating is that I can't get any help from ASUS support through my ASUS account or otherwise. I don't understand how in over a year of countless reports of similar issues there still isn't a driver that would simply work. Is that too
 much too ask?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, please, if anyone has an idea how to approach this, I would really appreciate your help.</p>
<p />

<h2>            &#40;E&#58;&#41; drive doesn&#39;t optimize</h2>
                    Windows 10, desktop PC. Still repairing since last Windows 10 update. Am now in the Optimize Drives window. There are 2 lines. The first is (C:) Hard disc drive OK (0% fragmented). The second is System Reserved (E:) Hard disc drive Needs optimization (100%
 fragmented). When I click on the (E:) line, it hilites in blue. When I click Optimize the line flashes like its going to start optimizing but reverts to it's original state, Needs optimization (100% fragmented) and is now hilited light gray, all in about half
 a second. Is my system doing what it is sposed to do? Is (E:) drive (100% fragmented) normal? Is (E:) drive (100% fragmented) OK and that's why it doesn't optimize? All suggestions, ideas, comments any wish to offer will be greatly appreciated. Thanks, K.

            Hello kthr. There is no need to actually optimize that drive since it is "system reserved" Even Microsoft say you should just ignore it. It has no effect on performance
<br />
<br />Please refer to this answer here as well: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/can-system-reserved-be-defragmented/41801b81-af94-4616-80e4-4255964e2fc1?db=5">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

            Hi,  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That's the System partition which boots WIndows and should NOT have a drive letter. 
<br />
<br />See if you can remove it by right clicking the Start button to open Disk Management, right click the partition to remove drive letter.  
<br />
<br />If not Since the partition is to meant to be hidden it can't have drive letter removed in Disk Mgmt like other partitions.   Follow these steps: 
<br />
<br /> 1. Select the Start button, type cmd and then right-click Command Prompt in the search results and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />2. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type diskpart and press Enter.
<br />
<br />3. Type list volume and press Enter.
<br />
<br />4. Make note of the volume number for the drive letter you want to remove. For example, if the drive letter you want to remove is Drive “D”, note the volume number for Drive D.
<br />
<br />5. Type the following command, and press Enter.
<br />
<br />select volume &lt;volume number&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;volume number&gt;, substitute the volume number you made note of in Step 4. In the example above, if the volume number for drive G is 5, you would type: select volume 5
<br />
<br />6. Type the following command and press Enter.
<br />
<br />remove letter=&lt;drive letter&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;drive letter&gt;, substitute the drive letter you want to remove. In this example, you would type: remove letter=G
<br />
<br />7. Close the Command Prompt window.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thanks All for considering and responding to my post. Is (E:) showing in defrag causing any conflicts, trouble? If not, I'm OK with leaving it alone. I'm not comfortable with removing something I know nothing about especially if it involves many steps
 - each it's own individual opportunity to make an error. At the same time you all solved another issue for me. Something was said about (E:) shouldn't be showing. That jogged my memory about hidden folders. When I checked, I found Show hidden files, folders,
 and drives was selected. When I selected Don't show hidden files, folders, and drives, all the new desktop.ini's, shortcuts, and folders that showed up all over the place after the last Windows 10 update are now hidden again. The (E:) drive in defrag is still
 there but I'm OK with that, now that you all have straightened me out on that issue. Thanks All. I appreciate your help. K.

            Oh, and if the opportunity ever arises, feel free to cast my vote against the hidden scroll bar in the start menu. I'm old&nbsp; and grouchy and by the time I finally get the scroll bar unhidden AND my cursor locked onto it, I can be much more old and grouchy.
 I'm sure someone is really quite satisfied with themselves for that little tweak, and it is kinda cute, but I would guess that designer, and all that approved it, are still young and nimble. K.

<h2>            Windows Updater Service won&#39;t start</h2>
                    I'm going mad trying to figure this out. &nbsp;Windows update won't run because the Windows update service isn't started, but when I try to start the service I get error code 2: cannot find specified file. &nbsp;So I tried using my Windows 8 installation disk (clean
 install on a new HD) and it asks for a product code, and the code I got with the disk/computer doesn't work. &nbsp;I don't know why they have to print the codes so damn small - but I've tried every possible number/letter that they look like and still nothing. &nbsp;So
 basically I'm stuck. &nbsp;Oh, and yes I tried running the program to fix windows update but it just tells me that it can't fix it (no files, of course). &nbsp;Can anyone give me any suggestions on what to do? &nbsp;Is there any way I can get my correct product key from
 Microsoft? &nbsp;I really don't want to have to take my computer to the shop for something like this.

    <title>CPU Usage keeps high all the time on Windows 10 Creators - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> v&#245; b&#236;nh nguy&#234;n  say:</h3>
<h2>            CPU Usage keeps high all the time on Windows 10 Creators</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded to Windows 10 Creators from a scratch. When I look at Task Manager, the CPU is always at about 20%. I restart the PC a few times and do not open any application but it does not get down to 1-2% as usual. I left it for 3-4 hours but it still
 keeps the same high CPU usage.</p>
<p>In Task Manager, I see the "System" process takes this CPU Usage, right click on this process and select Go To Details, I see that process is "NT Kernel &amp; System". I select option "Open file location" and see that the location of file is "C:\Windows\System32\ntoskrnl.exe"</p>
<p>I've updated the Windows Defender and scan all the system but the issue is still there.</p>
<p>Could you please give me some advice to resolve this error?</p>

<p>Yes, it even happens on clean boot and safe mode that disable all the additional services and third-party apps.</p>
<p>I even try to resolve this issue using MediaCreationTool to fix the system files as guidelines from Microsoft support but no result. It is still there.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have no Bluetooth device connected at all. I have the same idea that the system driver causes this problem.</p>
<p>I had contacted the Microsoft support but after many troubleshooting, the issue has not been resolved yet. My fan is operating continuously and heavily,&nbsp;and this is not&nbsp;good indicator for the system that may lead to overheat. I think the Windows Creators
 update may be the cause. There is no way to workaround this annoying issue at the moment.</p>
<p>So I have to downgrade to Windows Anniversary and wait for the next update after Creators. Hope this issue is considered by Microsoft ASAP.</p>

            <p>For both high CPU and hard drive I recommend going over the install integrity to assure this - especially if you're running an inferior Upgrade or Factory install which no tech enthusiast would run in the first place.&nbsp; But long experience on this issue here
 has taught me that nothing is more important than waiting.&nbsp; There are initialization tasks for indexing, prefetch, etc that take awhile to calm down.&nbsp; I've never seen the issue not go away with time.&nbsp;

These were all caused by memory corruption (probably your Avast).&nbsp; I would remove avast and replace with MSE<br />
<br />

            I had run MemTest and it found at least 150 errors (I didn't even finished the test)<br />
Anytime I play a game, online or not, the system give me the "nv4display.dll" BSOD<br />
I had run a lot of antispyware and antimalware and nothing was found; I've downloaded Device Doctor and it showed me 13 drivers updates, and windows update have at least 100 updates to download. But before I format mine PC I had all those updates and the blue
 screen was persisting! I'm really desperate, I don't know what to do!

            If you had errors then you need to narrow it down to which memory stick is bad by re-running memtest with only one stick in.<br />
<br />
With that many errors it is probably the ram<br />

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. From where did you download the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 SP1 Redistributable Package?</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1.<br />
</strong>Download the package from the link below and then install the package and check.<br />
<strong>Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86) <br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2.<br />
</strong>If the issue persists start the computer in clean boot state and then attempt a re-install and check.<br />
Refer:<br />
