<p>From the reviews and specs I've seen on the C3, no it doesn't have a document viewer at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe you could get away with a web based doc viewer such as google docs?</p>

            <p>The symbol indicates that the box contains more than what is currently displayed, referred to as an Overset Type indicator or Overflow indicator. However, that symbol should not display in anything other than Publishing Layout View nor should it print...
 In fact, I don't know of any way to force it (or the boundary of the Text Box) to be printed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, they should disappear on their own if you either;</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the size of the text box, or</li><li>Reduce the size/volume or content in the box, or</li><li>Link the box to another to continue the text flow there.</li></ul>
<p>If the situation is as you say, something is not right on your Mac. Start by confirming that Office &amp; OS X are fully updated. Also, check the mfr's web site to see if there are any updates for your printer. Once all updates are applied run Disk Utility to
 repair disk permissions then restart your Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't correct the problem please provide as much additional descriptive details as possible. Indicate where the content came from as well as anything else about the creation of the document. Also, see if the behavior persists in a newly created
 document as well as whether it occurs in a new User Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: It's recommended that Pub documents not be switched to other views.</p>

<h2>            Why don&#39;t the folders under my inbox synchronize&#63;</h2>
                    This morning I was thinking: Let's&nbsp;organize my email inbox a little, so I organised my inbox into folders (One folder for each project&nbsp;I'm working on or worked on). I synced with my device. I saw the device&nbsp;created the folders, BUT the mails in the folders
 are not available. Does anybody know why? Or should I just put everything back into the root folder?<br />

    <title>Clean Install of Windows 10 &#40;Released&#41; Has HORRENDOUS OOBE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oreveredrist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Clean Install of Windows 10 &#40;Released&#41; Has HORRENDOUS OOBE</h2>
                    <p>Once I got my final Insider build for Windows 10, I used the Microsoft tool to download the ISO for the released version and clean installed it onto my system. &nbsp;That clean install process and the ensuing Out Of Box Experience (OOBE) was horrible:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation:</p>
<ul>
<li>I chose the Customize option under "Get Going Fast" (choosing default settings). &nbsp;On the first page, it defaults to sending Contacts and Calendar to Microsoft to personalize speech and typing. &nbsp;On the second page, it defaults to automatically connecting
 to hotspots and automatically connecting to networks shared by contacts. &nbsp;These should default to OFF, not ON. &nbsp;They're security and privacy related and should always default to the safest method.</li><li>Starting with the "Who Owns This PC" page, the screen no longer fit properly on the display. &nbsp;Worse, scroll bars (usually) didn't appear. &nbsp;The first time this happened, I chose the option ("I own it") and sat there for 10 minutes waiting for something to
 happen. &nbsp;Scrolling and paging down did nothing, so I assumed it was "working." &nbsp;Finally, I hit the TAB key and the screen moved down to where that hidden NEXT button was.</li></ul>
<p>OOBE:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the OS came up, it was in 640 x 480 resolution with no way to change it. &nbsp;I assume setup just failed to recognize my NVIDIA Geforce 970 (both it and an SM Bus were showing bad in Device Manager). &nbsp;I ran the latest .INF utility from ASUS (my motherboard
 manufacturer) and everything cleared up.</li><li>Updates still defaults to downloading from multiple sources across the internet. &nbsp;I'm probably overly sensitive about that, but for security/privacy/integrity reasons, it ought to default to just getting updates from Microsoft.</li><li>My Ethernet network connection came up (without asking me) as Public instead of Private. &nbsp;There's no obvious way to change the network type to Private. &nbsp;I finally got it changed by going to Settings | Network &amp; Internet | Ethernet and selecting the Ethernet
 Connected icon at the top right (I thought it was a status indicator, not a button) and changing the "find devices and content" option to ON from OFF. &nbsp;Yes, that fixed the issue, but that option is worded WAY wrong. &nbsp;The implication of the text is that turning
 that option ON will start sharing on my then-set-to Public connection. &nbsp;Instead, it switches the connection to Private and also allows sharing. &nbsp;Regardless, the setup should have asked whether I was on a public or private connection.</li></ul>
<p>Near OOBE:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup gave no option to name my computer, so after installation I looked at System and found it had named my system DESKTOP-[random stuff]. &nbsp;I changed everything there, but after rebooting, that old name for my system is still sitting in Network in the
 File Explorer (EDIT: &nbsp;this was a OneDrive artifact -- once I deleted the device from OneDrive, it disappeared on my computer).</li><li>Setup named my profile folder under Users as the 1st 5 characters in my Microsoft Account. &nbsp;I assume that this is non-changeable (as with previous OSes).</li></ul>

                    I do have developed a VBA Macro using excel in MS office 2003.This macro was working fine in both MS office 2003 and 2007.Since i moved to Windows 7 with MS office 2010,my macro stopped working.After googling i came to know that MSCOMCTL.OCX was not registered.The
 tool\macro starts working once i register the above said ActiveX control.But my problem is this,tool is deployed to the sales executives whom doesnot have administrative priviledge to register this .OCX file.Now i want the solution to register the MSCOMCTL.OCX
 in Windows 7 without admin rights.

            <span><span>This is</span>

<br />
I have tried this with the calendar control (MSCAL.ZIP) from your side<br />
http://www.gmayor.com/downloads.htm<br />
<br />
and this macro<br />
<br />
Sub RegisterCalendar()<br />
&nbsp; 'Register the Active-X control<br />

<br />
Copy the code below into a normal module and name it "modDLL".<br />
<br />
@Rajan_D: I was also able to register the MSCOMCT2.OCX<br />
<br />
Download the mscomct2.cab from<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/297381/de<br />

            Good catch - and it seems to work with the anticipated folder location for Windows 7 64 bit (though the code would not work without modification in 64 bit versions of Office - and of course this particular control would not work in that version anyway).<br />
<br />
I have modified it for use in Word also and changed the folder location to that where Windows expects it to be, and if you have no objections I will add it to my vba page with attribution.<br />

            mscal.ocx is not compatible with office 64 bit, though your modification should work for 64 bit object library files. My comment related to the general principle of this approach rather than the particular example.<br />
<br />
Some of the dll files that are not registered with Windows 7 64 bit are already present in the default folder, just not registered in Windows, which is why I suggested using it.
<br />
<br />
In the interest of experimentation, I unregistered and removed the MSCAL.OCX from the SysWOW64 folder and put it in the Microsoft Office folder. Your macro registered it (obviously with the path changed to reflect its new location) and showed it in the Tools
 &gt; References list, but against that entry it still showed the path as the SysWOW64 folder. Restarting Word caused error messages to be produced by a couple of add-ins that attempted to call upon it (as it was no longer present) but it was still shown as checked
 in the normal template (and still pointing to the SysWow64 folder. At that point I began to lose the will to live :)<br />
<br />
I also tried to register it from a different location on another drive (actually the Word startup folder) and it would not accept that location so clearly there are limitations from where it can be legitimately accessed.<br />
<br />
Frankly I was a tad confused by what is going on here so I am tempted to stick with my suggestion of ensuring that it is in the folder where Windows expects it to be.<br />

<span><span>I</span><span>'m</span>
<span>not 100%</span> <span>sure</span> <span>
how the system</span> <span>performs the</span> <span>
Registering</span><span>,</span> <span>but</span> <span>
definitely</span> <span>the OCX</span> <span>must</span>
<span>not be placed in the</span> <span>SysWow64</span>
<span>folder</span><span>. I have placed the OCX in a network folder and it works.<br />
<br />
If you like, try as follows:<br />
<br />
- Unregister the OCX<br />
- Delete the OCX file<br />
- Start Word (without any AddIn that uses that control)<br />
- Make a new file<br />
</span></span><span><span>- Insert a userform and try
</span></span><span><span>to add a calendar control</span></span> (this should not be possible)<br />
<span><span>- Remove the Icon from the Toolbox window<br />
- Close Word<br />
- Copy the OCX into any folder, except SysWow64 ;-)<br />
- Open Word </span></span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>without any AddIn that uses that control</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><br />
<span><span>- Make a new file<br />
- Run sub </span></span>RegisterCalendar<br />
- Insert a userform<br />
<span><span>- Add the Icon for the calendar control the Toolbox</span></span><br />
- Create a control on the form and run the from, it should work.<br />
<br />
After that all your AddIn's should use the new OCX.<br />
<br />
Once you have registered the OCX to the system, it seems that it's not possible to change the path to a different location.
<span><span>I</span><span>'ve</span>
<span>seen it</span> <span>when I</span> <span>
tried</span> <span>to</span> <span>register</span> <span>
INKED.DLL (for my FormelEditor AddIn), this DLL exists on my Win7</span></span> and my code runs but in fact the DllRegisterServer routine inside the DLL fails.<br />
<br />
BTW, <span><span>I test</span>
<span>these things</span> <span>always</span> <span>
in a</span> <span>Virtual</span> <span>PC, not with my real OS.</span></span><br />

            OK I have checked further and broadly concur with what you have said. the only additional comment I would make is that if you have any reference to the OCX file in the normal template, flagged as 'MISSING' then that reference must be unchecked or the macro
 fails.<br />
<br />
While this works for the normal template for the current session, if you then add back the add-ins with the references, the missing reference error returns - even for the normal template and the references are still pointing to SysWOW62. It seems that the process
 does not register the OCX file in Windows after all and so when you restart Word the changes you make with the macro are lost.<br />
<br />
I used regsvr32 to unregister the OCX before removing it from SysWOW64.<br />
<br />
This was tested on a live system and not in a virtual system.<br />

            What about an example with an other file? Can you find the OWC11.DLL (ChartSpace control) on your system?<br />
<br />
If not, try this:<br />
<br />
- Download the OWC11.EXE from<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22276<br />
<br />
DO NOT EXECUTE THAT FILE!!<br />
<br />
- Open that file with a ZIP tool (I use 7-zip for this)<br />
- Extract the OWC11.msi<br />
<br />
DO NOT EXECUTE THAT FILE!!<br />
<br />
- Open the OWC11.msi with a ZIP tool<br />

- Open Word<br />
- Make a new file<br />
- Insert a Userform<br />
- Add the code below<br />
- Save the file in the same directory as the OWC11.DLL<br />
- Run the Userform<br />

<h2>            Access Report Problem - All list values shown </h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I am having trouble getting a basic report to display as I had intended.</p>
<p>The report is based on a query that has a couple of fields in which the values are determined by a lookup/value list (in the underlying tables).</p>
<p>Problem is when I create the basic report, all of the values from the lookup display with the selected value highlighted. How do I tweak the report so only the selected value from the lookup displays? I am in the beginner category as far as Access goes so
 answers may need to dumbed down a bit.</p>

<p>Andy,</p>
<p>In the design of the report, see if you can replace this lisbox control with a textbox.&nbsp; Probably this will work... right-click the listbox, and select 'Change to' from the pop-up menu.&nbsp; Then select Textbox.</p>

<h2>            Cannot delete OneNote files from my phone.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just found out how to sync OneNote files with my skydrive today--however, I have several onenote files on my phone that i created before today. I cannot figure out how to delete them when I don't need them anymore and I can't find the answer on the web
 anywhere.</p>
<p>I saw one other issue in this forum where someone said you can delete while you are in Notebooks view, but the only thing i am shown in notebooks view is the Personal (web) file I just created today...which has nothing in it.</p>
<p>Anyway to delete the OneNote files? Should be simple, when I press on it, all i get is the option to Pin to start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Megan</p>

<p>Enter OneNote, then press the All. You'll now be in the all pages view. Hold your finger down on a page in this view and you'll get the delete option.</p>
<p>To delete an entire notebook from the phone, swipe left or right while in the page view to get the notebook view. then tap the Delete (trash can icon) at the bottom of the screen and choose the notebook you want to delete. This will not delete the copy of
 the notebook in your SkyDrive.</p>

<p>Are you sure that your 700 software is up to date via both SW update and Nokia Suite as found no issues installing upon my 700 Belle FP2. Have you checked that under applications that you haven't got "SmartInstaller" icon with a red star?</p>

    <title>Outlook.com folder tree expanding&#47;collapsing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> faceplant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com folder tree expanding&#47;collapsing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have access to a few different Outlook.com accounts. One of them takes 5+ minutes to load. It hangs on the 'Opening your mailbox...' load screen. This particular Outlook.com account has a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">significant</span> folder structure which is primarily right under the root of the mailbox. When the site does complete the logon and shows the email all folders are expanded. So that is the background.&nbsp;<span>I
 suspect the folders all being expanded is what is causing the extreme delay logging on to the site</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>My Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How can I make Outlook.com start with the folders collapsed?</li><li>What else could be causing the extreme logon delay?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>What I have tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>Relocated all folders under the Inbox</li><li>Looked everywhere for a setting to start Outlook.com with all folders collapsed</li><li>Tried IE, Edge, Chrome, and Firefox. All have the same problem.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>First I don't know why the view starts with all folders Expanded, it doesn't on other accounts I've seen. . I have been through the display settings and haven't found anything regarding expand/collapse &nbsp; folders.&nbsp;</p>

            Hello  faceplant !!
<br />
<br />To the best of my knowledge, the more complex the folder's structure , the longer it can take to open up the mailbox.
<br />'
<br />Please check also the Inbox substructure.  In my experience, when the inbox reaches around 4 gb  or 500 subfolders (or  both) you can have hard times managing your mailbox
<br />
<br />Maybe later another fellow advisor comes up with more (or better) info
<br />
<br />Hope it helps !!

            Are rules moving mail into subfolders? That can expand folders. 
<br />
<br />Has it always been slow or is this a ne thing over the last day or two? There are server issues being investigated.

<p>Hi Diane, thanks for your info. No rules. You make a good point, perhaps its a backend thing. I remember this account having extreme slowness when it was first created and all the email was dumped into it. I don't remember of the load times ever got better.
 The user uses the Desktop Outlook and doesn't have any trouble with that.&nbsp;</p>

            Hello faceplant  !!
<br />
<br />7.54 gb in a mailbox is a fair number. It shouldn't be an issue, nor the beta view
<br />
<br />
<br />However a large number of subfolders in the inbox structure might be an issue indeed.  I'd suggest you to reduce the number of folders . Keep the stricter as simple as possible. 
<br />
<br />Best regards !

            <p>Hi elduderoony,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community forum. Yes, there is an option to save your Hotmail emails in your computer for backup. To do this, you must first configure or set up your account in a mail client such as Windows Live Mail.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add your account in Windows Live Mail, please read on the article below for instructions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After doing the steps above, you may then export your emails from Live Mail to your PC. Kindly read on the article below for instructions:</p>

<h2>            Indexing Options - There is no email program associated to perform the requested action.</h2>
                    <p>I have Outloook 2016. Until recently I also had Office 2007 installed alongside Office 2016. Anyway, I uninstalled Office 2007. But I've been having problems searching emails in outlook. I've also been having them when I had Office 2007 installed alongside.
 I probably should have uninstalled Offfice 2007 before installing office 2016. I have an IMAP account. So I tried reindexing the outlook e-mails, but I get this error when I press "Modify" in the Index Options:</p>
<p>"There is no email program associated to perform the requested action. Please install an email program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook 2016 is already the default email program. So that's not the issue. Of course, if I ignore the error I can still tick or untick Microsoft Outlook in the index options, but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea where I can go from this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 10 x64.</p>

            I scanned Outlook 2016, but I'm not sure what you want me to do further. Am I supposed to upload the report, and if yes, what report exactly? Or should I paste here anything?

            <p>How am I not surprised that you work for Microsoft and you have basically no knowledge of how to deal with the extremely buggy combination of Windows 10 and Office 2016? I know this might sound shocking, but I've done that already. I did solve the search
 problem, even though I still get that nice error. Never mind. It's horrible how many people depend on this and every time they get the same idiotic responses that you can find ANYWHERE on the internet: sfc, check indexing options, uncheck, same crap every
 time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another horrible bug that I had to deal with was not getting any control panel/settings options when I searched for them in the taskbar/mentally challenged cortana. It kept saying the results might be incomplete... I had to copy a folder from a local user
 to the domain user in order to make it work. Manually. Really clever to have to to these Windows Millenium tricks to make something so basic work.</p>

<p>Sorry, I was really annoyed by the stupid, robotic answers I received from the Microsoft moderators who actually don't know how to properly tackle the problem, but I guess my attitude affects the community more than Microsoft itself, obviously (especially
 given that you were the only who reacted, not a Microsoft moderator). I've basically ignored the problem, because the search did start working after tinkering with windows indexing (checking/unchecking outlook, changing the index location and then reindexing
 again, stuff like that). To be honest, I don't remember in detail, but I do remember that I solved the search problem without actually directly addressing this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess this is a good point to start from. I'd suggest simply searching on the internet and finding ways to solve the search in Outlook, without focussing on the respective error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, there's also a way to changes index settings within Outlook 2016 itself (don't remember exactly how to access that either, but you should search for it too). It does use Windows Index too, but I think there might be an option within Outlook 2016
 that can help in a way. That's all I can remember.</p>

            This is caused when a rule changes a node value that at some point causes the rule to get run again (i.e. an infinite loop). However, it can also happen even if the loop is not infinite, but exceeds a small limit in number of times (about 15).
<div><br />
<div>You will need to examine your rules to locate such a loop and resolve it. You might use the Rules Inspector for this (click Rules Inspector on the Data tab).</div>

            <p>Can I amend the limit?&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am using a default value to look up next value on list and add it as a row of a repeating table.</p>
<p>It works fine but as you say runs out of steam at 15 (or&nbsp;6 in a slightly more complex form).</p>
<p>I don't want hundreds, 30 would be more than enough but 15 is too few.&nbsp; So if I could tweak the limit it would be great&nbsp;</p>

            If you are talking about the picture on the Me tile, tap it on the start screen to get into your Me Hub. Then tap and hold for a short bit, and Update Profile Picture will come up. Tap the pic and it will let uyou select a photo or take one. Note the Post

<p><span>Before checking the registry key, I’d like to confirm if you enable SharePoint Online sync on your computer. You can follow the steps in
<strong>Enable SharePoint Online sync for Windows</strong> section from the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enable-users-to-sync-SharePoint-files-with-the-new-OneDrive-sync-client-22e1f635-fb89-49e0-a176-edab26f69614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
same article</a> mentioned in my last post (the main step is to download and install the registry key).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After enabling this registry key, the Sync button should work in other browsers except IE.</span></p>

<p>We have regular reports we have to get to clients (.pfd). We can either upload them to the contact in Salesforce, or put them in a shared drive (approximately 200 reports for 150 families).</p>
<p>We want to create portals/logins for these clients to see the reports after we (hopefully) have mass uploaded them via some sort of batch that we created, and then update regularly.</p>
<p>I am fairly certain this can be done, but having trouble grasping the exact process (and who can do it at what $$$).</p>

<p>Hi GardnerCFP,</p>
<p>Based on the description, can you confirm if you want to upload a bunch of files to SharePoint Online, and when users login to the page, they can only see their own reports?</p>
<p>If so, I think the easiest way for the users to get their own contents is to share the files to the corresponding external users or internal users, so they will only have the permission on the corresponding files when they navigate to the same library. To
 manage external sharing on SharePoint Online, you can refer to the article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-sites-or-documents-with-people-outside-your-organization-80e49744-e30f-44db-8d51-16661b1d4232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Share sites or documents with people outside your organization</a>.</p>
<p>To manage permissions in SharePoint Online, here are some articles for your reference:<br />

<p>However, regarding “to create portals/logins for these clients to see the reports”, you may explore the possibility to this requirement by doing some customizations with codes on a page. To get further assistance for this kind of requirement, I suggest you
 post in our <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?category=sharepoint&amp;forum=sharepointadminlegacy%2Csharepointdevelopment%2Csharepointsearch%2Csharepointitpropreview%2Csharepointcustomizationprevious%2Csharepointcustomizationlegacy%2Cwflmgr%2Csharepointgeneral%2Csharepointdevpreview%2Csharepointadminprevious%2Csharepointdevelopmentlegacy%2Csharepointcustomization%2Csharepointsearchlegacy%2Csharepointdevelopmentprevious%2Csharepointadmin%2Cappsforsharepoint%2Csharepointgenerallegacy%2Csharepointgeneralprevious%2Csharepointsearchprevious&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;searchTerm=customize+page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
