    <title>Cannot get on my account and the support guy just disconnected - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot get on my account and the support guy just disconnected</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I got my error code and went on the xbox site here to see whats up. &nbsp;Put in the code went to tech support for help got a guy pretty quick but thought it would be pretty easy and the guys name was pararo or something I know stupid me for not writing
 the guys name down. This started at around 10 pm 11/11/2013 and we went through erasing my &nbsp;profile and my cache with my xbox 360 being in the other room I told him it would take a bit do go in there and do things he was telling me to do then come back and
 check with him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He seemed nice, patient, and knowing what he was doing so I did what he said with the cache and profile no big deal easy to find and do but I come back and there is like a 10 piece list of things to do and after telling him I did the first two I tell
 him Im looking and going to do the next few steps. &nbsp;I tried to read what to do but he keeps saying are you ok whats happening every minute so I keep losing my place on what to do next even though I tell him Im just trying to do the next step. &nbsp;I go to try
 and upload an account but now my xbox won't connect to my network and while Im checking to see if I missed something he says he's stepping away for 2 minutes so I go to double check while waiting for him. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I get back 3 minutes later he has disconnected and now Im stuck hoping he did not screw me god I love when you guys update the system and then I either do nothing and hope it works in a few days or the one time I go to get help which I dread
 and never did till now because I just knew that it would be a disaster. &nbsp;I am not a computer or technical person I just play games and want them to work not asking much since that is the primary function of the xbox 360 but for some reason you people seem
 to work against me every time. &nbsp;Luckily I cannot afford to get an xbox one because I would just be so furious to spend that kind of money and not be able to do anything but look at it while it tells me it can't do the only thing I bought it for which is to
 play a game.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The red ring of death claimed around 5 to 6 xbox's but this one I've had for around 2 to 3 years and runs fine but then your updates for some reason mess up my xbox live for days usually and now support just leaves me hanging like a cat on a wire.
 &nbsp;I have 40 plus games bought for your system so please clearly Im invested in you so could you please invest just a little time and effort into helping me? I'll try support again but now if it won't connect to the internet think Im just jumping hurdles to
 hit a brick wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span> </span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Would appreciate some help and if I just get fifty responses saying useless things and insults not unexpected thats why I can't stand playing call of duty games any<span>
</span>more heh. &nbsp; Thanks for at least&nbsp;<span>
</span>seeing what I had to say if someone does read this see ya.<span>

<p>I've started the back up programme which started quite quickly but has been stuck at 85% for 4 hours.</p>

<p><span>Hi lynetian,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It appears that the backup is not in progress or has failed for some reason. I would suggest you to stop the backup and restart the computer to
 start over the process.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: &nbsp;</span></strong><span>First, let`s check for any disk errors
 which might be one of the reasons for this to happen. Refer to the below mentioned link on how to perform this check.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check a drive for errors</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Place the computer in a clean boot state
 to perform backup.<span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a Clean Boot<strong>.</strong> A clean boot helps eliminate
 software conflicts. To do so, follow these steps.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start, type “msconfig.exe” (without quotes) in the Start Search box, and then press Enter to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On
 the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On
 the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note: &nbsp;</span></strong><span>Do not forget to put the computer back
 to Normal Startup once you are done. Refer to the below mentioned article for more information.</span></p>

<h2>            Battery Drains While Shutdown</h2>
                    <p>I have read many posts and made many attempts to correct this problem without any success.</p>
<p>I was traveling for 3 months and when I returned the battery was completely dead.</p>
<p>Also, each night since my return, the battery drains as much as 12% overnight while shutdown.</p>
<p>I have all MS updates but the problem continues.</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>
<p>THX! :)</p>

<p>Thank you Marby for assisting me.</p>
<p>I do not know when the problem originally began, I can say for certain that I noticed the problem back in August of 2017.&nbsp; I have performed the following but the problem still persists.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Updated all MS Windows updates&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;Downloaded and rand the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit on 14 Jan 2018.</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;Tried turning off WiFi before shutting down</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;Changed power settings to slow startup and shut down when closing lid or power button.</span></li></ol>

<p>Is Standby enabled?&nbsp; In any case if you check your event logs you may be surprised by what you find in there while your OS was "shut down" or "hibernated" or otherwise "sleeping".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also you can use powercfg to find out what is going on...</p>

            What is your definition of "massive"? With Connected Standby, on battery, I've seen 1-2% per hour at times depending..  Your sleep study shows all in the green with no "offenders".

            Within 24hrs I find that it drains by atleast 10%. Can I see the changes from battery report?

            10% over 24 hours is really pretty normal. Look at the sleep study. When you are in "sleep" - connected standby/instant go - your Surface goes through some state changes. It is in "sleep" mode for about 4 hours but can still be performing network functions, etc. before it goes into a deeper hibernate mode. There is a technical document at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/modern-standby" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardwa...</a> - background activity IS happening.

<p>Thanks for the reply. Just to be clear, so even "Shutdown" doesn't really mean turn off the SP4 completely anymore. It just goes into what is called "Connect Standby", right? If so is there a way I can off this without windows registry edit hack found on
 internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have been keeping "Turn on fast startup" unticked in&nbsp;Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Power Options\System Settings. Does this disable "Connected Standby" or this is a different function in itself? Moreover, does unticking this help to slow
 battery drain?</p>

            Your reports show Connected Standby is functioning so, it really isn't shutting down completely. I don't recommend this personally, but you DO need a reg edit to completely disable - <a href="http://toolofgod.com/problems-and-solutions/disabling-connected-standby-fixed-my-surface-pro-4-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://toolofgod.com/problems-and-solutions/dis...</a> 
<br />
<br />Unticking the fast startup alone isn't going to change much.
<br />
<br />I don't personally se 10% drain over 24 hours as excessive, but obviously you do.. I'd create a restore point manually (you may need to turn on System Restore if it isn't on now) and then try making the registry change (but again, this is not recommended). 
<br />
<br />I'm old school, and Connected Standby was a huge change for me and took me quite a while to "embrace" since I'd always had computers where "OFF meant OFF".
<br />
<br />Hope this helps (even if it isn't tied up in a bow nicely). Please DO mark as Answer if it was of assistance.

<p>So, I charged SP4 to 100% and shut it down. But when I on it after 24hrs its at 83%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>Surface Pro 2017 randomly shutting off at 30&#37; battery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vsunrider  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2017 randomly shutting off at 30&#37; battery</h2>
                    <p>I had more issues with this computer than it's worth the money - after six months of having it, I had to do a complete wipe and factory reset as it went completely haywire. Microsoft "support" wasn't of much help as they concluded that it is "by design".
 Now I am having the issue (of course it had to start happening two months after the one-year warranty period has expired) from the subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone come across a solution? The solutions for the issue reports posted back in 2017 probably won't work as I (again, probably) have all the updates recommended there. :(</p>

<p>I already did all that, still the same issue. It just croaked on 45%, without hibernating or anything, and each time I have to painstakingly restore all my tabs in browsers upon turning it back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for "going haywire" - I had to do a complete factory reset because started having all sorts of random errors, to the point where I couldn't use it at all anymore because it would either crash, or freeze, or show windows without any text at all. All this
 started happening, ironically, when I tried to install Office 2016 we bought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, "by design" I cannot tinker with the stuff I was able to on Win7 Ultimate - with a bloody admin account I cannot do admin stuff! I used to work in tech support so this is infuriating, as it puts me down on a level of a person that knows nothing about
 computers and needs a "nanny". And now this sh*t with battery. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I regret that my partner threw his money on this overpriced piece of junk, wanting to make me happy as I planned on getting back to artistry - if I knew how this is going to turn out, I'd have asked for a normal computer and a Wacom tablet :(&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh, I understand that, and I apologise if it seemed personal, because it truly wasn't - as you (correctly) guessed, the device has brought me nothing but frustration 😓
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must admit it's a very cunning move on their side to dismiss QA team and let "insiders" to their jobs for free; it seems that, since there are volunteers to do their CS for them, that department might go out, as well 😅</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in Canada and their store is near me, but from what I gathered so far, Canadian customer protection laws are not on the same level as US ones 😒 I will try, though.</p>

    <title>Windows 10- Automatic repair loop after update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josie gwynn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10- Automatic repair loop after update</h2>
                    <p>When switching on my Windows 10 computer it said "Diagnosing your computer" and kept telling me to restart the computer in order to resolve an issue that was apparently due to my computer having trouble starting up correctly. It then took me to a page that
 said I could either reset or go to further advanced options to resolve the issue. I tried some of the advanced options with the help of a friend until we eventually restarted the computer completely and reinstalled Windows 10. After doing this it was resolved
 and I could use my computer as normal until later that evening when it gave the option to update it and so I did as it was the only way to turn off the computer. This lead to me switching it back on and find it was back to the same automatic loop, which must
 have been due to the update as I had restarted it before and it had no impact. Does anyone know what to do as I do not want to reinstall everything again and have some files I do not want to loose?</p>

            <p>Hi Josie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try this. Disconnect all peripherals except the keyboard and mouse, if you are using a wireless keyboard substitute a wired keyboard in its place. If it was a wireless mouse and keyboard set try substituting both. I've seen the wireless keyboard(s)
 (some models, even MS branded) cause this problem on several occasions in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this applies to your issue I'm not sure but thought it to be worth mentioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck,</p>
<p>

<h2>            What Should I get</h2>
                    
<p>While I was in town earlier to to see if they're were any games I would like to get and Star Wars: The force unleashed 2 was there for £15, I was wondering if it was worth it as I've heard its quite short (How long is it) and Castlevania and Red Dead Redemption
 was also there for £15. Fallout new vagas and Alpha protocl was there for £10. Should I get anyone of these or shall I wait and get LA Noire.
</p>
<p>I've been coming to the idea of keeping most of my games (Apart from sports games) instead or trading in.&nbsp; Your opinions on these games will be much appreciated!</p>

<p>Star Wars: The Force Unleased II really isn't very good. In fact the best thing about it is the DLC set on Endor which costs a measly 80MSP (Some compensation for the poor game I guess).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Castlevania is great though. It's a very decent sized game which should take somewhere between 15-20 hours to complete. Combat is tight and there are some fresh takes on the hack/slash genre. This is far superior to Star Wars...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I played Red Dead but didn't really care for it, no criticism really, it just wasn't for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would either get Castlevania or get LA Noire tomorrow, that looks to be pretty good.</p>

<p>Red Dead Redemption is a cool, western sandbox game. Game of the year of 2010 IMO. L.A Noire will be a cool game too but it's not out yet for UKers. Stay out of the garbage called Star Wars Force Unleashed 2.

<p>Whats the ****ult****player like ****n Red dead redemption? </p>
<div>
<p>[****quote] </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Really ****ood, loads of people still play ****t. There's free roam where you can ****o around the ****ap with other people and do ****an**** hideouts, hunt animals etc and then there's the usual ****a****e ****odes (shootout, capture the bag, free for all)
</p>
<p>You can ****et a free DLC that adds co-op ********ss****ons to the ****a****e, or ****f you ****et bored there are a few DLCs that add new ****aps and weapons for a price. **** recommend the undead nightmare DLC- ****t has a nice single player story and
 lets you play a zombie ****ult****player ****a****e type. However ****t would be best ****f you ****et this AFTER you complete the story as ****t has some (********nor) spoilers</p>

<p>My problem is this: When I start my Sibelius 6 music program all other sounds go out, for example the sound from You Tube, Spotify, Windows Media Player and more... Only the sound in Sibelius works.</p>
<p>And I discovered another problem after that: When I input my headphones, the speaker still continues to sound. The same problem uccurs when I connect to an individual sterio.</p>
<p><br />
Do you have a solution to this?</p>
<p>Thanks in advise</p>

<p><span>Hi Andorbolt,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 Windows sounds work fine when using the program?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Check to see if there is any setting in the program
 (Sibelius) itself which causes this behavior. Refer the instructions/documentation for the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>You can adjust volume levels for different applications.
 Check if any changes occur when Sibelius is running and when it is not. Refer the below mentioned link to make changes in the volume mixer.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Adjust-the-sound-level-on-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Adjust the sound level on your computer</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Coming to your other problem, you can check if the headphones are correctly placed into the jack. Sometimes if the headphones are not properly
 connected, sound plays from both at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let`s set headphones to be default and check if it helps. Do this as mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start and Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Hardware and Sound and then Sound.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under
 the Playback tab, check if your headphones say Default Device.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 not, right click on headphones and select Set as default device.</span></p>

            No solution to this? I just installed Sibelius 6 and I have the same problem. All volumes are correct, but when I try to test my audio (while Sibelius is running), it says that "The device is being used by another application." What's up with that? Sibelius
 completely hi-jacks my audio, so while it's running, nothing else can produce sound?<br />

            Alright, I got it. The problem was a checkbox in the options of the audio driver used by Sibelius. Path is :<br />
Play -&gt; Playback Devices -&gt; Audio Engine Options -&gt; ASIO Setup -&gt; Uncheck the checkbox that says "Allow ASIO host application to take exclusive control of selected port configuration".<br />
<br />
Boom.<br />

            I went to Play &gt; Playback Devices &gt; Audio Engine Options - then in the box marked "Interface" it said "Realtek ASIO" - I changed it to "Speakers / Headphones (Realtek (MME))" and that completely solved it (for me!). I MUST listen to other scores on the
 web as I use Sibelius, so this was a life-save for me.

            Hi trollydolly,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!<br />
<br />
a. Do you get any error messages while installing the System Mechanic? <br />
b. What is the version of System Mechanic you’re trying to install? <br />
<br />
From the Iolo homepage I found that System Mechanic (version 9) is fully compatible with Windows 7.
<br />
<br />
I’d suggest you to download and install Windows Installer Cleanup Utility. You can use the utility to remove installation information for programs that were installed by using Windows Installer. Be aware that Windows Installer CleanUp Utility will not remove
 the actual program from your computer. However, it will remove the installation files so that you can start the installation, upgrade, or uninstall over.<br />
<br />
Refer the link below for more details:<br />

    <title>Windows 10 on HP desktop lost wifi capabilities - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dwaldrip  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 on HP desktop lost wifi capabilities</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday (6/21/16) my desktop installed updates for Windows 10. I did not upgrade from a previous version of Windows, I have had Windows 10 installed for months now and have done quite a few other updates. Never had an issue until now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway now Windows 10 will not recognize that the desktop had wireless capabilities less than 24 hours ago. I have tried installing new drivers, I have tried to manually delete the registry with "
<em>reg delete HKCR\CLSID\{988248f3-a1ad-49bf-9170-676cbbc36ba3} /va /f "</em> in the command prompt (with admin control) and it tells me there isn't a registry named that. I've even tried to download other programs to install new drivers and whatnot. Cannot
 seem to find a program to install drivers that I don't have to pay for. Considering the update caused this issue I don't feel as if I should pay to have it fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thank you</p>

            <p>Attempting to remove, reboot, and reinstall now. I haven't opened up the tower to move the hardware to a different spot. As for the instructions I've since lost the exact link but I've seen the same instructions on a forum post here as well as several websites
 I've trusted in the past. I'll try and Google it again and find the links. Computer is currently remote controlled by my dad. He works IT for a local hospital, so hopefully it between suggestions here and him working I can get it going.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Whenever I try to maximize a window, it doesn&#39;t fill the screen</h2>
                    I'm running a new Dell Laptop on Windows 7 and whenever I try to maximize a window (for a web browser, for a file folder, etc.) the display does not go to the top of the screen and there's a "gap" where I can see my desktop.&nbsp; Changing the resolution has
 not helped, nor has using the shrink/expand button in the top right of the browser. Any idea on how I can make this gap go away and have the display fill the entire screen?<br />

<h2>            how do i use built-in  webcam to take a picture on acer 5332 running windows 7</h2>
                    I have an ACER aspire 5332 laptop. It has a built-in camera, but I cannot use it. There seems to be no software or program to initialise the camera, I cannot turn it on, cannot see an image from it.<br />
<br />
This used to be simple in XP, but I cannot see it in Windows 7.<br />

            <p>That's because the software either comes from the manufacturer or doesn't.&nbsp; The operating system doesn't have the driver (nor the software) for every camera out there - so the manufacturer must supply one or both (some only supply a driver, the software
 you use is up to you.)</p>
<p>Example... If you have Skype installed, it probably can use your camera.&nbsp; Windows Live Messenger too.&nbsp; WebEx.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I found the web page where the drivers are listed for the various webcams that could be in that system:<br />

<p>Under the "Applications" tab - they have two "WebCam Applications" &lt;-- maybe if you downloaded and installed one of those (based off the actual manufacturer of the webcam you have in that system - what does it say in Device Manager?)</p>

<p><span><span>Please analyze the event viewer and give us the logs if you see any errors.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also, if shutting down computer takes more time than usual, it could be because it is taking time to end the processes running in the background.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you set your computer to clean boot and check if it makes the difference. You can follow the below steps to set your computer to clean
 boot. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Clean boot:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click

<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</span></span></p>

<h3> gemmawuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            DirectX Set Up Fail</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just downloaded Steam so that my son can play certain games available on there. We have paid for and downloaded Garry's Mod. When we click play, it advises that our version of DirectX is out of date and we need to download the latest version. We are
 directed to the Windows Download site&nbsp;and click on the download for the latest version of DirectX and go through the download and install processes. Within seconds of starting the install process the following error comes up "DirectX Set Up - An internal system
 error has occurred. Please refer to DXError.log and DirectX.log in your windows folder to determine the problem."</p>
<p>When I look in the suggested folder and find the logs, they are just text boxes full of script...no help to me at all as I am a mere PC user, not a technician!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? My little boy has spent his pocket money on a game he cannot use!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I don't know which DirectX installer program you are attempting to use, but there are two</p>
<p>versions.</p>
<p>- The <em>DirectX Web Installer</em> is best used on machines with a new Windows installation, or one</p>
<p>which has never had DirectX updated. There have not been any 'new' DX files since 2010, so</p>
<p>this generally is not useful if DX has been updated previously.</p>
<p>(Garry's Mod uses one of the last DX9 files - d3dx9_40.dll, which does not install with Win7)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Web Installer will install any 'missing' DirextX files, but does not overwrite any existing files.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer from Official Microsoft Download Center</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- The <em>DirectX Redist (June 2010)</em> installer package is the better option if there are any corrupt DirectX files, as this installed overwrites all DirectX files.</p>
<p>- This installer first 'unpacks' the DirectX files to a location of your choice (you can create a new</p>
<p>folder on the desktop and unpack to there, as this folder can be deleted after installing DX).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Once the files are unpacked you need to open the folder and find the <em>DXSETUP.exe</em>&nbsp; and</p>
<p>run the final installation from there.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; If you still get an error...</p>
<p>R/click on the DXSETUP.exe and go to <em>Properties</em>.</p>
<p>Click on the <em>Compatibility</em> tab and tick the box next to '<em>Run as Administrator</em>'</p>
<p>(this may happen if you are running Windows from a non-Administrator User account with limited 'permissions').</p>
<p>- Try installing from the DXSETUP.exe&nbsp; again.</p>
<p>- I suggest rebooting the machine after reinstalling DirectX.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Details - Microsoft Download Center - DirectX Redist (June 2010)</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you continue to get error messages when trying to install DirectX using the Redist (June 2010)
</p>
<p>you&nbsp; may need to&nbsp; try installing from <em>Safe Mode</em>.</p>
<p>Safe Mode is commonly accessed by tapping F8 while booting into Windows. </p>
<p>- If you have a problem accessing Safe Mode type - Safe Mode - into <em>Help and Support</em> on your</p>
<p><em>Start Menu</em> for more detailed instruction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It may also help to 'verify the game cache'. This is done from your Steam account.</p>
<p>- Go to your Steam<em> Library</em> and R/click on the games&nbsp; title. Then click on
<em>Properties</em>. </p>
<p>- Click on the <em>Local Files</em> tab and select <em>Verify Integrity of Game Cache</em>. It may take</p>
<p>a few minutes for Steam to verify the games files are not corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Also check the Steam&nbsp; support pages, if you have not already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw - You said 'little boy'. This game is more like a modding toolbox where you make your own fun than a 'scripted' game, and has a somewhat steep learning curve, so I hope not too little/young.</p>
<p>.</p>

<h2>            Windows Store not starting, related to DCOM timeout. Resetting PC does not help.</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hi, I am having troubles starting certain Windows 10 apps (but some work).</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Every time I try to start one of the failing applications, a message related to DCOM, like the one below, appears in the event log.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">The story:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I have been forced to use the "Reset this PC" option in Windows 10 in the past months several times.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Since then, I am having troubles starting many Windows 10 apps (aka UWP apps?).</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">After the PC reset is done (while preserving user data), the Windows Store App can be normally started.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">After some time (e.g. 30 minutes), the Windows Store App gets updated to a newer version (with a colourful icon).</p>
<p class="contentStandard">As of that moment, the Windows Store App, Feedback hub, and others always fail to start. Sometimes the border of the application window can be spotted for a very short fraction of second. Interestingly, other "Windows 10 apps" (e.g.
 Calc, Mail) work perfectly.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">None of the common windows 10 apps troubleshooting tips (clearing the app data, reinstalling store apps using the known power shell command that can be found on the Internet, ...) works.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The attached DMP file is of the <u><b>WDF_VIOLATION (10d) </b></u>bug check.<br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) detected that Windows found an error in a framework-based driver.</i><br />
<br />
BugCheck 10D, {<u><i><b>8</b></i></u>, 57ff455cfd8, 3, fffffa800953ee40}<br />
<br />
The 1st parameter of the bug check is 0x8 which indicates that an operation occurred on a DMA transaction object while it was not in the correct state. Likely a device driver causing corruption.<br />
<br />
1. AiCharger.sys is listed and loaded in your modules list, this is the Asus Charger software (generally paired with Asus' AI Suite). Remove the AI Suite software + another other Asus software installed, it's unnecessary buggy bloatware.<br />
<br />
2. Remove and replace avast! with Microsoft Security Essentials for temporary troubleshooting purposes:<br />
<br />
<b>avast! removal -</b> <a href="http://www.avast.com/uninstall-utility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avast.com/uninstall-utility</a><br />
<br />

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download</a><br />
<br />
3. If you're still crashing after both of the above, enable Driver Verifier:<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
8. Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
If your OS became corrupt or you cannot boot into Windows after disabling verifier via Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier. <br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />
Any other questions can most likely be answered by this article:<br />

            Hi Jean to get your PC to boot straight to the Desktop:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options 
<br />Choose to sign in with a local account 
<br />(in newer versions of Windows 10, this might be on the Your Info Settings Page) 
<br />Enter your old password and leave the new password box blank 
<br />Close the Settings App 
<br />
<br />That's It!

    <title>.NET v 4.0 updates &#47; v 4.5 install fail - MSISIP.DLL error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stewstews  say:</h3>
<h2>            .NET v 4.0 updates &#47; v 4.5 install fail - MSISIP.DLL error</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have researched a lot of potentially similar issues but yet to find anything that helps - thought I'd put this up, perhaps someone has had similar issues.&nbsp; Would welcome any and all assistance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem I believe is a corruption of the MSISIP.DLL file, preventing installation or updates of the .NET Framework 4.0 / 4.5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is beginning to cause issues with other software which require .NET.&nbsp; I either can't install them / use them / update them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The errors basically cover on any update or attempted install:</p>
<p>1) Pop-up: Setup.exe - Bad Image</p>
<p>"C:\Windows\system32\msisip.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. ..."</p>
<p>2) Failed installation</p>
<p>"Installation Did Not Succeed. &nbsp;.NET Framework 4.5.1 has not been installed because: &nbsp;The form specified for the subject is not one support or known by the specified trust provider." &nbsp;or with v 4.0 updates "Generic Trust Failure".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried numerous things to address and would welcome some advice on where to next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) SFC /Scannow. &nbsp;This reported that it could not fix MSISIP.DLL and that the 'store' version could also be corrupted:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Could not reproject corrupted file [ml:520{260},l:46{23}]"\??\C:\Windows\System32"\[l:20{10}]"msisip.dll"; source file in store is also corrupted."</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) CheckSUR.&nbsp; Ran successfully and reported no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) .NET standalone installers, cleanup tool etc.&nbsp; No luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to remove v 4.0 through the .NET Cleanup Tool; but cannot install it back in either v 4.0 or 4.5 forms.&nbsp; With a System Restore I can get back to an old installed status of v 4.0; but cannot install any updates beyond this.&nbsp; There is a Windows Update
 backlog of around 15 updates for v 4.0 alone I cannot install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Installing trust certificates associated with temporary Windows Update setup.exe file for each package - no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Replacing the offending DLL with another from a different install - no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am out of ideas, beyond a complete Windows reinstall or in-place upgrade.&nbsp; Both are a pain and I'm not 100% confident this will help given the Scannow comments about corruption of the 'store file'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, sincerely appreciate any pointers in the right direction.</p>
<p />

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let's double-check your lock screen setting to make sure that we are on the same page. Go to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Personalization </strong>&gt; <strong>Lock screen</strong> &gt;
<strong>Background</strong>. If <strong>Windows spotlight</strong> is selected from the list, change it to
<em><strong>Picture</strong></em>, restart your device, then change it back to Windows spotlight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, if you have a dedicated folder to use as your lock screen photos, click
<strong>Slideshow</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>I tried twice switching from Windows Spotlight to Picture and restarting.&nbsp; The lockscreen is still stuck on one picture in the Windows Spotlight setting.&nbsp; &nbsp;I found the Bing.com site where the pictures come from, so I can do it manually every day, but would

<p>Thanks for your reply John;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem started when I installed a newer version of Windows 10 a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; Also my computer has be running sluggish.&nbsp; So last night I uninstalled the new Windows 10, and it fixed the problem.&nbsp; My laptop is back to running like new again.&nbsp;
 I guess the new version just wasn't compatible with my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate your help though.</p>

            Windows 10 listed the Driver. There is a button for Windows Update the driver as well. Clicked on it. Still the same, print garbage.

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The concern you have encountered with your printer may be due to a corrupted file or a misconfigured setting.<br />
<br />
If the printer cannot print or doesn't print normally, we suggest you run the hardware troubleshooter or update the driver of the device. To do this, simply follow the methods provided below:<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click on search bar or Cortana next to the Start Menu.</li><li>Type Troubleshooting and click.</li><li>Click on View All on the left panel of the screen.</li><li>Click on Hardware and Devices.</li><li>Click Run the troubleshooter.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Update the scanner driver from the manufacturers website</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Simply visit the manufacturers website to get the latest software driver available for your device.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further information, don't hesitate to contact us.<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>- Troubleshooter replied "troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem".</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>- Panasonic KX-P1121 is an old dot matrix printer. I tried to look into Panasonic Website. It dint mentioned any driver for Window 10. Not sure if you can advice where to get it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take note, I am using a USB - Parallel Cable between the Dot Matrix Printer and Asus Window 10 Laptop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just to add on the print results:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Print a test page, the printer printed only 2 rolls with garbage and then stop.</p>
<p>2. Print using Microsoft Word, with wording on the left page, example below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>asdfghjkl</p>
<p>asdfghjkl</p>
<p>asdfghjkl</p>
<p>asdfghjkl</p>
<p>asdfghjkl</p>
<p>asdfghjkl</p>
<p>asdfghjkl </p>
<p>
</p><p>(all the way to the end of the page, this can be printed. All good. Clean and nice print out)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Print using Microsoft Word, with wording on the left page to the right, example below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>asdfghjkl</p>
<p>asdfghjkl</p>
<p>asdfghjkl</p>
<p>asdfghjkl</p>
<p>asdfghjkl</p>
<p>asdfghjkl (can print till here. The below just stop)</p>
<p>asdfghjklaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&nbsp;</p>
<p>asdfghjkl</p>
<p>asdfghjkl</p>
<p>asdfghjkl&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My findings:</p>
<p>- Wording that cut across the right side of the document, it will just stop. </p>
<p>- Wording just on the left can be printed without problem.<br />
</p>

<p>Hi Andy,</p>

<strong>Stop </strong>&gt; <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>%WINDIR%\system32\spool\printers</strong>, select the file folder in the search results, and then delete all files in the folder.</li><li>Search for and open <strong>Services</strong> again</li><li>In the <strong>Services</strong> list, double-tab (or double-click) <strong>Print Spooler</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Start</strong>, and in the <strong>Startup Type</strong> list, make sure that
<strong>Automatic</strong> is selected, and then select <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No issue on item 1 and 2. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As for item 3, there are no files and folder in the PRINTER folder. Meaning to say, the PRINTER folder is empty. With this said, nothing to delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Proceed. No issue item 4 to 6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried Printing again. Same results.</p>

<p>Thank you for the update. If that's the case, most probably, the printer driver is outdated. It's best to get in touch with your printer manufacturer for compatible drivers that needs to be installed for your Windows 10 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have other concerns.</p>
