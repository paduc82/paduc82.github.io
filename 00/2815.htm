<h2>            Will custom chart templates travel with .potx files&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<div>Do custom chart templates (.crtx files) need to travel with the document, say if other users were involved, or will they be "embedded" as an option within a .potx file?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance.</div>

            No, Chart templates are not 'embedded' into PowerPoint templates. They are separate files &amp; are not 'connected' to any specific PowerPoint template. A copy of the Chart template file (.crtx) needs to be put in the Chart Templates folder of each system
 using the PowerPoint template -- I'm not sure if a shared location could be created for multiple users.<br />
<br />
Note: I believe that if the PowerPoint template includes a slide having an actual chart based on the chart template the recipient could save their own copy of the .crtx file.<br />

<p>I've had mine work occasionally. One time though when i held the "press and Speak" button down as instructed. The screen went green and the phone shut down and rebooted.</p>
<p>I don't find the Voice recognition very accurate on Vlingo. A Bit like the Handwriting recognition on the old Apple Newton</p>

            Ive also had no luck with this app, i got so annoyed with the voice test i made it a challenge to keep doing it untill it finally worked. I started using different accents, and found weirdly enough that a female/higher pitched voice seemed to work. In
 practice this app is good on paper, but to actually use, its a no go. Miles and miles behind voice recognition on the iphone.

<p>So, would it be fair to summarize this as Nokia have added yet another application that we cannot get rid of, but which noone wants?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why, oh why does not Nokia do the sensible thing and place these applications on Ovi store, and those who really want them can install them, and the rest of us can be let to live our lives without the **bleep** filling up our telephones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's actually kindof telling the way Nokia seem to be willing to bend over for other companies, in order to cooperate, and yet not give a damn what their customers are thinking. I could almost go as far as saying they are trying to cache in on their reputation
 before it is shot...</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two users that are experiencing the same issues using Windows 7 and Excel 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After an undetermined amount of time, their screens go black and have white lines.

<p>They then have to reboot and loose any unsaved work.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rebuilt Laptops several times, these are Dell Latitude E7270 and even given users different Laptops but still the same thing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the users use older Dell Laptops, the Latitude E6230 for example, the issue never occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using a&nbsp;Microsoft Windows 7 Professional SP1 x64 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601</p>
<p>I have updated all drivers and BIOS to the Latest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens when the Laptops are on and off a docking station.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your comment, I did update the driver but this did not fix it in my case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been several hours now and my user has not reported any issues after I changed compatibility settings to Windows 7.</p>

</p><p>I will post back if this has indeed, resolved the issue along with all of the troubleshooting steps I took, maybe it also helps others having the same or similar issues.</p>

<h2>            &#42;.mpp file can only be opened on the PC it was created on&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm fairly new to MS Project, so the answer might be obvious! I'm using Project Professional 2010 at work and created a new file there. When working from home, I downloaded the trial version (Project Professional 2010) but could not open the document. I
 emailed the document to a colleague at work (also using 2010) but she could not open it either. The error message we both got said the file could not be opened using older version of project etc. Problem is, it was always 2010!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have returned to the office today and have no issues opening the file on the same PC it was created on. Is there some sort of 'sharing' option I need to activate in order that the file can be opened somewhere else?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Sarah</p>

<div>No, there is no "sharing" option. But you probably need to do a couple of things. First, make sure you have service pack SP1 installed. You can get it at,&nbsp;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/ee748587.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Second, go to File/Options/Save group and make sure the "save files in this format" selection is set for Project(*.mpp). It sounds like you may have it set to save to an older version by default.</div>

            <p>Thanks so much for your quick response John! I checked the Save group and I definitely have it defaulting to Project and not an older version.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How will I know if SP1 is installed? I will have to get our IT guys to install it if not there (I don't have administration rights on work pc).</p>

            Sarah_769,
<div>Are you sure you downloaded the trial for Project 2010 and not Project 2013? Files should be compatible between the two but I don't know that for sure. When Project 2010 was first released there were many issues working the files from older versions. In
 particular, if you, or your colleague, don't have the latest service pack installed, there will be version compatibility issues.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And to cover the bases, both you and your colleague should go to File/Options/Trust Center group/Trust center settings button. From there click on the Legacy Formats group. Check the option to allow loading of legacy formats.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As far as checking whether you have the SP1 service pack installed already, go to FIle/Help. Click the "Additional version and copyright information" line under About Microsoft Project on the middle right side of the screen. If SP1 is installed you will
 see it listed in the version data at the top of the About Microsoft Project window.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

<h3> mike300zxna  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conversations on Windows Mobile 10 misidentifies contact by using half of wrong phone number. How to correct&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A few weeks ago, my Nokia Lumia 1520 received the long awaited upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile. And, actually, I am generally pleasantly surprised. Definitely better - so far - than Windows Phone 8.1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered today that the Conversations (what used to be messaging) is misidentifying contacts. This is because I was sending SMS texts to a contact, he was receiving them and&nbsp;replying, I received the replies but they were displayed in the thread of a
 different contact. On further investigation, this is what is happening:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alice is contact 1 - she is correctly listed in People (and Outlook when it syncs to my PC) with Mobile Number 0xxxxx 123456 (and she also has Home and Work numbers)</p>
<p>This is correct and when I use Send Message in Alice's profile, she gets the text message on her phone. So far so good. She hits reply and sends me a text back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is received by my phone OK but is&nbsp;allocated by Windows Mobile 10 to Bob - who is contact 2. Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bob has a Mobile number, a Work number and a Work fax number. None of them are the same as any of Alice's numbers. Except for one part. Bob's Work fax number is (completely coincidentally) 0yyyy 123456. A different dialling code (landline instead of mobile)
 but the same last portion of the overall number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears, therefore, that Windows Mobile 10 matches messages in conversations to contacts by the second part of the phone number and not the whole thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result is that all of the texts I send Alice are listed in a Conversation with Alice. All of her replies to those texts are listed (wrongly) in a Conversation with Bob.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were to reply to Alice's text (misfiled in the conversation with Bob), it would send&nbsp;a text to Bob's Mobile phone and not Alice's</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is:</p>
<ol>
<li>wrong /&nbsp; inaccurate</li><li>a potential for people responding to the wrong contact - and that is not good for all sorts of reasons</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft - what is your fix for this? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, Mike</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you try to provide more information about your concern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it happening only to the said contacts?</li><li>Have you tried removing both of the contacts and adding them back.</li><li>If yes, have you check if the issue still persist whenever you send a message?</li></ul>
<p>Keep us posted for further assistance.</p>

            <p>I have a similar problem. It doesn't seem to be related to similar numbers however. The phone simply seems to merge accounts. I get a message seemingly from contact A and reply. However it will turn out that the message in fact came from contact B and he
 also gets my reply. However I am communicating with someone who is completely different from the contact I think I'm communicating with.</p>
<p>When I click on the name of contact A in Messaging it takes me to the contacts details and it will show multiple phone numbers and email addresses (contact A and B merged together). If I click on the "links" icon at the bottom of the screen it will show
 more than one account for contact A - contact A and contact B seemingly linked.</p>
<p>The result is I can no longer work out who I am communicating with and have lost all confidence in this phone</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is such a shame that big compnay as Microsoft is not able to fix this bug for a while.</p>
<p>I still face this bug. Could you, please, fix it in next Update?</p>
<p>I can give you hints how to reproduce it.</p>
<p>Choose any contact from your contact book. Then try to dial same number, but change any digit from first 3 digits in his number. Your phone WILL write, that you are diailing your contact, but actually you are calling another number.</p>
<p>This is all because you check only last 6 digits in Contacts App. In our country mobile numbers contain 7 digits, so if in family we have same last 6 digits, there are BIG mess. Which stresses me much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will you fix it? Please!</p>
        </p>

<h2>            office starter 2010 has stopped working, how do I reinstall&#63;</h2>
                    I had to recover my laptop to factory level( which I was informed that all original programs would still be installed) When I ran "office starter2010" I was asked by the laptop to run trouble shooter as the program was decayed. it then described that the
 trouble shooter was successful, and asked me to run office starter. I did and found out that I was on a loop, ie, it asked me to run "trouble shooter again" so on and so forth

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information?</p>
<p>1. The detailed version including building, such as 16.21.0 (19011500).</p>
<p>2. The screenshot of error message, as I couldn’t <span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've recently been getting this return (see below sample message) immediately after sending emails to certain recipients, most of the time AOL, but not always. I have noticed, if I go to the "To:" field&nbsp;and start to type the name and the name appears and
 I select that, I am able to send. If I click on the "To" and select a recipient from the contact list and send, it comes back with the below sample message. (One thing I have noticed is if the name has an underline ie.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">nameofrecipient_</span>
 and the underline&nbsp;extends further than the name, the email will not send, this is usually when I select from the contact list. If the&nbsp;email&nbsp;appears like this<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">nameofrecipient;</span> or like this
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">nameofrecipeint &lt;</span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&gt;;</span> it will send, I'm stumped! Does anyone know what's wrong?? Thanks for your
 help!!</p>

                    <p>After an automatic update earlier in the week, Word is continually freezing and operating extremely slow.&nbsp; It continually display Word (not responding) when simply typing in information.&nbsp; How can this be resolved quickly.&nbsp; My device is used for work and
 I am have been working off of the clock for the last two hours trying to finish a project, because I feel bad charging the company when it is something that should have been able to be taken care of quickly and I am still on the first page due to the lack
 of functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the last, automatic update on my other laptop 1 year ago, it caused me to have to go and purchase a new device, because Word will no longer work on it at all.&nbsp; What is the problem with these automatic update rendering the program inoperable?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            OneNote for Tablets - Shape Recognition ability and possibility of adding custom shapes to toolbar</h2>
                    <p>I am currently looking at possible drawing applications which support shape recognition features for Android/ Windows/ IOS Tablets. From my (quite brief) research, I have found that the OneNote app for all these platforms offers shape recognition features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is great, however, I have a few questions regarding the ability of this drawing software:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Can any drawings made be saved as a .jpg and emailed to someone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Is it possible to add custom shapes, created by the user (or downloaded from somewhere like a microsoft cloud),to the 'Insert Shapes' toolbar?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) If (2) is not possible, is anyone aware of a suitable cross platform application that would offer such versatility? (Or even an application limited to one platform).</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Carroll,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The option to save drawings as <strong>.JPG</strong> as well as adding custom shapes is currently not available in OneNote. But, this is a good suggestion, and we encourage you to post it to our
<strong><a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote UserVoice</a></strong>. In this way, our engineers and developers will be able to look further into this concern and might do some changes in the future. Posting your
 suggestions on the said website will not just help other users who have the same concern, but will also help us improve our products and services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround for your first query, you can screenshot your drawings, and from there, you can save it as
<strong>.JPG</strong>. That being said, you'll be able to email it using your email app. In addition, for your third question, you can look for a third party app that you can use to add custom shapes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also check this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/draw-and-sketch-notes-on-a-page-e34b425a-9431-4b73-b52d-63c44a67f67a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for additional information how to draw and sketch notes
 on a page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further inquiries, feel free to reply to this thread.</p>

<p>
</p><p>What I wanted to create is a form that record the entry and after submitting the form they will be redirect to onedrive or after submitting they will be prompt where to save the file/study that we publish online.</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get a summary of who downloaded the files in OneDrive, you may go to Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">search
 the audit log</a> (e.g. "Downloaded file" activity) to see if it helps.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your another requirement that redirecting to OneDrive after the users submitted the form, there isn't an out-of-the-box function to achieve it. As a workaround, you may insert a link of the file in the form directly. After that, when the user clicks
 the link in the form, they can be redirected to the file and choose whether to download it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Zixuan</p>

    <title>Outlook and word are not redirecting the https requests using Internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> labourer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook and word are not redirecting the https requests using Internet Explorer.</h2>
                    <p><em>Original title: IE11 is not following redirects for https requests when tabs are opened by direcltly clicking the links from external clients e.g. outlook, worddoc</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that &nbsp;if the browser tabs are opened by directly clicking the links from external clients (outlook emails/ worddoc), IE11 is intermittently does not follow the re-directs (http 302) in that particular tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, we have a typical workflow for "forgot password" feature where system send a temporary link to user's email address. And once user clicks the link in the email, the page lets user enter their new password. On successful submit, system is sending a 302
 redirect to application login page. When user directly clicks the link in the email (using outlook client), the page to reset the password opens but redirect to login is not working. After watching the network in the dev console, browser is not sending the
 request to the server although address bar shows the redirect URL. If refreshed, user see the login page. This all works fine if user instead of clicking the link, copies the link from email and paste in the address bar manually. &nbsp;Of course it works without
 any issue with other browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is pretty strange. Not sure if I need to set some header in response so that IE behaves properly or is it some browser settings I need to change?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will appreciate your response.</p>

                    <p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to install PowerPivot on my Excel. I downloaded the 64 bit first and as I was installing a message popped up saying a "prerequisite is required". I recently upgraded to windows 10. I'm not sure what else to do. I also downloaded the 32 bit thinking
 that was the prerequisite but I was wrong as the same message popped up.</p>

            <p>Power Pivot can not be installed for Excel 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power Pivot Add-in comes preloaded in Office 2013 Professional Plus / Office 365 Professional Plus / Excel 2013 standalone<br />
<br />
Can you please confirm if you have above version on your machine?</p>
<p>
Assuming that your version is above, try following -<br />
<br />
Fix it by going into Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features &gt; selecting Microsoft Office Pro Plus 2013 &gt; selecting Change &gt; Add or Remove Features &gt; Continue &gt; click the + next to Microsoft Excel + Add-ins &gt; drop down next to PowerPivot and select Run from My
 Computer &gt; Continue and then go back into Excel and it should be now available as an add-in under com add-ins. Looks like the default installation didnt install PowerPivot in your case.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If the above doesn't help you -&nbsp;<br />
<br />
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2805999/<br />
<br />
If none of the above work, you should reinstall MS Office again. Make sure that License Keys are available before you attemp reinstallation. (Do Complete installation not Typical installation so that all features of MS Office get installed)

            To use Power Pivot, you will have to buy a 2013 / 365 Professional Plus (or it was free for Excel 2010, so you can possibly look into this aspect also. You can install Power Pivot for Excel 2010 but for 2013 Pro Plus versions, it comes built-in)

<h2>            How Do I Eliminate Audio Reverb in 10525&#63;</h2>
                    <p>All of a sudden I'm getting reverb sound effects.&nbsp; Checked every sound setting without resolution. Drivers up-to-date.&nbsp; Can't positively blame 10525.&nbsp; Help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Before I posted the above question, I searched the MS Community section.&nbsp; I discovered this was a problem to many users, going back to W7, but found no solution!&nbsp; Anyway, I went to every audio and sound feature available in 10.&nbsp; Wherever possible, I reset
 to default settings; that solved the reverb problem.&nbsp; (Although I had never changed the settings!)&nbsp; What I deduced from this situation was there are too many darn audio/sound settings!&nbsp; Come on guys and gals of MS-10: simplify this!!!!</p>
