<h2>            Canon drivers</h2>
                    When I tried to set up my digital rebel (about 6 years old) on my new computer, I was given a msg to insert my Canon disc to extract the driver. I then got a msg saying there were no compatible drivers on my disc and directed to the Canon website to download
 a compatible driver for Windows Vista, 64 bit.&nbsp; That website said non compatibility problems existed.&nbsp; What do I doÉ

<br />
Above is the Vista Compatibility link to check Hardware and Software.<br />
<br />
Canon writes the Drivers for their Hardware, not Microsoft.<br />
<br />
If Canon has no vista 64bit Compatible Drivers, nothing can be done about it.<br />
<br />
Manufacturers reach a cut-off stage where they stop writing Drivers for later Operating Systems for&nbsp;their Products&nbsp;&gt; they&nbsp;make a new Product to meet growing needs&nbsp;&gt; and move on.<br />
<br />
All Hardware Manufacturers have the same attitude.<br />
<br />
Cheers.

    <title>Raid Controller was working in Windows 7, but not in Windows 10, tried - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gymputer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Raid Controller was working in Windows 7, but not in Windows 10, tried manually installing driver with no luck</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two days ago, I had a perfectly working RAID1 setup under Windows 7. Yesterday, I upgraded to Windows 10 and upon completion of the installation, I discovered that Windows 10 did not allow my Raid controller driver to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already checked the MFG's website and they do not have a driver for windows 10. This is a custom built computer from 2011 and the last driver they put out was for Windows 8. I tried that driver and I got this message...</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows encountered a problem installing the driver software for your device". Windows found driver software for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install it".</p>
<p>
</p><p>"JMicron JMB36X Controller"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The system cannot find the file specified"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is for a 5 year old "MSI" motherboard. I understand that I can just go out and get a new motherboard, but can't justify spending $200+ JUST to get a RAID controller driver to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the same token, I also installed "Intel Rapid Storage Technology". Every time I reboot my computer, I do get the reassuring message "Your system is protected from a hardware failure" just like I did when I had Windows 7. In the software, it also&nbsp;says
 "SATA_Array_000"&nbsp;Volume0 Type: RAID 1 and does show both hard drives&nbsp;(which I configured in the BIOS for RAID1)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that the RAID controller doesn't have drivers concerns me because it appears to me that the RAID&nbsp;controller is not&nbsp;working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also thought about updating the BIOS, but even doing that won't get me a driver newer than windows 8, which I have already tried with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Having said all that I don't know what to believe...</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is my RAID working without a RAID controller driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the RAID that the Intel software telling me is working, the software RAID?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I just ignore the fact that I don't have the driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I confirm that RAID is working despite the lack of a controller driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts or help on this would be hugely appreciative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much</p>

            I've noticed that it pops up when surface is in laptop mode and sitting on my lap if the lights are on , on the type cover the on screen keyboard will disappear, if the cover isn't sitting flat the pc might not be recognizing that the cover is plugged
 in therefore it will offer the popup keyboard. So make sure type cover lights are on to make popup keyboard disappear. This was my issue now the problem is fixed again if your type covers&nbsp;backlighting is on the pc recognizes that the cover is plugged in if
 the backlights are not on the pc offers the&nbsp;pop up keyboard as it should thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Microsoft 2 pin power cable for the slim version&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Erm after ripping out my room to fit a new carpet i lost my power cable which goes from the mains to the PSU (power supply unit) and I bought a used second hand cable off ebay and its been delivered today....</p>
<p>The question is is that the power cable delivered was stated as genuine but the plugs branding is "I-Sheng" and not microsoft and was wondering if this is the cable which is supplied with the slim xbox 360?? it must be as earlier i found an exact same power
 cable with the same branding in my room but after looking at the pc's they also are using the "I-Sheng" power cable??</p>
<p>Can anyone confirm its the right cable to use, (appreciate if you could look at yours if you have a 360 slim), as i don't fancy blowing it up ;)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>It's not going to be 'official' if it doesn't have any Microsoft or Xbox branding on it. Whether it'll work is an entirely different question. Some brands do and other don't, for various reasons.</p>

<p>The power cable won't matter at all if it fits and has the right fuse in because the power supply unit controls the output and you can't go above the mains input of 230-240 volts. &nbsp;Don't jam the cable and check that it's an exact fit, if it is it will work
 in the same way that any power cord does... &nbsp;that being it will allow electricity to travel through it and have a fuse that blows if the current is too great.</p>

    <title>Problem with my remote IP KVM - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem with my remote IP KVM</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: APC KVM 1116P&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading from Windows 8.1 Home to Windows 10 Home (and forcing all the updates), I find myself in front of a tiny-major problem with my remote IP KVM. I can no longer connect to the KVM using the manufacturer-provided Windows client software. The
 KVM is an APC KVM1116P model, about 8 months old, fresh out of the manufacturer box.</p>
<p>I've contacted the manufacturer (APC) and they seem more at a loss than me! Beyond the simple missing app certificates (which can be worked around on Home edition, and a bit harder on Pro edition), there seems to be a definite problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Analysing the network traffic everything looks good, until the packets return to my workstation, looks like Windows is closing the sockets forcefully before the application receives the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling of anti-virus, firewall, and work-arounds, all has been tried. Compatibility modes (all of them) have also been tried. Running in administrator mode as well has been tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After suspecting a compatibility issue at the network level, I've analysed and tried a number of Gamer tweaks, like disabling offloading features on the network card, packet reassembly and such, but still, can't connect to my remote KVM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I've spent more time than my boss wants to afford on the problem, APC is clueless (sounds like they weren't in the Win10 technical preview loop?), and remote-desktoping into a Windows 2003/2008/7/8 machine to use the KVM is a different problem
 entirely; keyboard input gets mangled up, key presses just repeat themselves, mouse cursor goes beserk, video screen refreshes are a nightmare, forget about accessing the BIOS. All of which feels like a "network" problem with Win10. (In the past I've used
 my KVM client through remote desktop without any problems whatsoever, from Win8, 8.1, Vista and so on...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now in the camp of people that believe this is a "serious" Microsoft problem. How many system administrators remotely manage server farms using APC equipment ? Certainly I'm not the only one with a Windows 10 problem ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... besides re-installing drivers or contacting the manufacturer and waiting a very long time for an update (the KVM expert at APC is on vacation...) ? Guess I'm left with downgrading back to Win8.1 ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will I loose my free Windows 10 upgrade license if I re-install or downgrade ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, I've also tried from local Windows 10 Pro workstations (ie; different machines entirely, manufacturer installed Win10-Pro), same thing, so it's definitely a Windows 10 problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Funny thing though, the Java client kind-of works temporarily... (with all the necessary work-arounds) but it just crashes without reporting any errors after 10-30 seconds of inactivity when it takes me around 2mins to get a screen refresh. So still useless
 to me. As for the lack of error reporting, mind you I'm using Windows 10 Home edition, maybe its just not there in the first place... ?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Games with gold games disappeared&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've been acquiring all of the games with gold since July 2013. I started getting all of the Xbox One games with gold when they came out as well.</p>
<p>However, when I checked my list of games on here, the first seven games are missing. I have the 360 games that were available at that time, and I purchased them at the same time as the Xbox One games.</p>
<p>Games that are missing are:</p>
<p>Chariot<br />
Strike force zero</p>
<p>Super time force</p>
<p>Halo spartan ****</p>
<p>Max the curse of brotherhood</p>
<p>Guacamelee!</p>
<p>and Crimson dragon</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated, thanks!</p>

<p>Have you ever changed the region of your account during the time you made the free purchases? Cross-region accounts can cause some trouble with things like this. Unfortunately if the games are not appearing on your profile there isn't a way to provide you them again as the Games with Gold offer ended. </p>

            <p>Me too -&nbsp;now that you mentioned it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Cortana's settings has it properly selected. I've turned it OFF/ON, but it was no cure. I see nothing in Event Viewer specific to it, (but there is plenty there on other stuff). There is someone asking about it at another site, but no answer was posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't do anything major to recover it, as all else appears well with Cortana that I've noticed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I'll wait a bit for MSFT to solve it with an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit 5:16 AM: </strong>The Windows Store Apps did find something for me. Too soon to know whether the problem is fixed for me.</p>

            <p>EVERY time I run that "app troubleshooter", I get the same remark:&nbsp; It shows as fixed - and nothing is every corrected.</p>
<p>I too am going to leave it alone.&nbsp; Obvious glitch from the Anniversary Update that they will hopefully fix.</p>

            <p>Huh. I see it found the same error for me again too &amp; applied the same fix. At least, nothing appears to get worse from it. I haven't seen Cortana pop up any helpful hint on&nbsp;her own. So, the fix won't cure that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Cortana is stellar other than that, far as I can see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So,&nbsp;I confirm our&nbsp;pact to do nothing rash &amp; just wait for MSFT to fix it. I hadn't even noticed it was gone till you piped up. OK, bye.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit 10:03 PM: </strong>OMG - it is working...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0790655a-44fb-4fb7-9a44-5b9d19c1b5c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0790655a-44fb-4fb7-9a44-5b9d19c1b5c5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And it's been working before I applied the questionable troubleshooter fix. I was just somehow thinking there would be activity at the Cortana icon when it spoke up. There is none: it's a pop-up at the bottom right&nbsp;&amp; a message inside Action Center. If you're
 not getting that, check the settings at...</p>

<p>
</p><p>And don't forget the setting within Cortana, itself, to turn Tidbits on. All of these were on by default for me.</p>

            <p>Hmm. Final thoughts...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) The pop-up at bottom right doesn't ID itself as Cortana. It's only IDed in Action Center.</p>
<p>(2) Here's another setting, at "START, Settings, Personalization, Start"...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=270d8fb1-142b-42d6-a941-9723773272e6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d270d8fb1-142b-42d6-a941-9723773272e6" /></a></p>
<p>(3) And, at "START, Settings, Privacy, Notifications"...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=84ca6e8a-f8ce-4880-abac-ec6776bf5d28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d84ca6e8a-f8ce-4880-abac-ec6776bf5d28" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there is nothing - not even Cortana - listed there as an app that needs permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

            <p>Yes.. I have all of those settings to "on".&nbsp; I do get Cortana reminders in the Action Center.&nbsp; What I noticed was gone was the Cortana search box (left on taskbar) no longer popping up at startup with "good morning", or "Happy Memorial Day", etc., etc.&nbsp;
 I think that is "Cortana Taskbar Tidbits".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the reminders in Action Center.. I created some today to test that after reading your last post.. and those do come through.&nbsp; But "Taskbar Tidbits"..????&nbsp; seem to be gone.</p>

            <p>OK. You've probably convinced me again that I've lost Tidbits too. I get no pop-up in the Cortana search box - at least not on its own. If I click the Cortana icon, its scrollable window opens with lots of items, including...</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Though I'm unsure whether <em>that's </em>the Tidbits - I'm really content as is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do remember Cortana's icon once could be stretched bigger - but I can't seem to find that setting anymore. But I'm very content. She's stellar otherwise! She does pipe up on the sign-in screen at boot. That's new.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I guess the tidbit greetings are gone.&nbsp; The "tips and tricks" within the scroll are nothing new.. if you click on "see more tips".. I think it takes you to notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well... I agree, Cortana is still useful and fairly interactive (especially with it's phone App)....&nbsp; bye bye "taskbar tidbits".. (until there's a fix, anyway).</p>

<ol>
<li>
<div>When exactly do you receive this error message?</div>
</li></ol>
<p>Try the methods provided below and check if they help in resolving the issue.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p><b>Perform Clean Boot.</b></p>
<p>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program
 manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</p>
<p>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</p>
<p><b>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
</span><b>Note: </b></p>
<p>After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Try performing SFC scan on the computer.</p>
<p>SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with the /scannow switch, the tool will scan all of
 the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as necessary. 
</p>
<p>Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues. Considering that, plus the fact that SFC /scannnow is completely
 automatic and very easy to use, the tool should usually be one of your first troubleshooting steps.</p>

    <title>Taskbar with pinned Icons - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Taskbar with pinned Icons</h2>
                    I awoke the other day to find my computer at the log in screen. Apparently there was an update overnight and the computer restarted. When I tried to type in my password I found that the computer was frozen. I restarted it and when it came back the task
 bar with my pinned programm icons was gone. I cannot figure out how to fix it. I tried a system rstore to a few days before but that did not bring back the pinned icons. I came up with a temp fix but would rather have it working like it should. It is a fresh
 install of Win7....

<p><strong><span>Hi comptech61,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:
</span></span></strong><span><br />
<span>Do one of the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the program is already running, right-click the program's button on the taskbar (or drag the button toward the desktop) to open the program’s
 Jump List, and then click Pin this program to taskbar.<br />
– OR –<br />
If the program isn't running, click Start, find the program’s icon, right-click the icon, and then click Pin to Taskbar.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also pin a program by dragging the program's shortcut from the desktop or Start menu to the taskbar. Additionally, if you drag the shortcut
 of a file, folder, or website to the taskbar, and the associated program isn't already pinned there, then that program is pinned to the taskbar and the item is pinned to the program’s Jump List.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the below mentioned link for a video presentation of the resolution of the issue and further queries:
<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Pin-a-program-to-the-taskbar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Pin-a-program-to-the-taskbar</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:
</span></span></strong><span><br />
<span>You may even check if you face the same issue in different user account or administrator account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You may even check if the issue persists in a new user account on your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer to the link - Create a new user account-<br />

<p><span><span>If you do not face the issue in new user account then you may fix the user profile having issues by referring to the link below -<br />

            <p>It's a good idea for the Windows paging file to be on a seperate drive than the one installed.</p>

    <title>Deleting Backup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crazyoreo999  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting Backup</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I recently backed up my hard drive to my usb drive using third party software. The operation did not complete successfully and now I'm stuck with a backup in my AppData\Temp folder taking up a lot of space. I've tried everything from changing the
 permissions to force deleting it in command prompt - all which come under errors like: Access is denied, You need permission from (My own username) to delete this file. If I try to move it, I get This file cannot be accessed by the system error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to delete it?</p>

<br />I know you say your are the owner but take ownership anyway to force it.

            Try removing it forcefully from powershell.
<br />Go to search and type powershell and then right click it and select run as administrator.
<br />Type the following. 
<br />
<br />Remove-Item -Path c:\users\yourusername\appdata...  -Force
<br />
<br />If that still does not work then you may need to create a new profile move your contents to that new profile and delete your old profile.

            I think at this point the only thing you can do is a clean install.
<br />Seems that software has messed things up for you and very sorry that this is happening.
<br />Below is a link by Greg on how to do a clean install.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />After the clean install use Macrium to do file backups and system images.
<br />They are a good and reliable software.

<h2>            OneDrive having an unreasonably high CPU usage probably only querying registry and writing logs</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I'm posting this as a new question because Google did not return any useful result on this, just as expected (please tell me if there do). OneDrive.exe is eating up my computing resource lately and sometimes causing serious freezing-ish lags. I peeked at what
 the hell is going on using Process Monitor by Sysinternals, and the result kind of looks like an endless loop of the following:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/68a69dee-9bef-4661-9d1d-7f5cb5c48944?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/68a69dee-9bef-4661-9d1d-7f5cb5c48944?upload=true" /></a><br />
No, I scrolled for like ten pages and this is it, nothing else. Default Procmon filters applied, only with an extra "if process name is OneDrive.exe then include". In the mean time OneDrive.exe is taking like 40% percent of my Intel Core i5. I have to pause
 OneDrive syncing like ten times a day because of this.<br />
Any suggestions except meaningless "try a clean boot", "reset OneDrive" or "run chkdsk/DISM" are welcome. Thanks in advance.

            Check if you have updated drivers installed, you can check for new drivers on Acer website.<br />
If still doesnt work use system restore, and scan with a good antivirus software.<br />

    <title>All browsers frequently freezing, can&#39;t play youtube videos - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noelle_grey  say:</h3>
<h2>            All browsers frequently freezing, can&#39;t play youtube videos anymore</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 the other day and I've been having trouble with my internet browsers ever since. I've tried Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Internet Explorer, and I've noticed that they're freezing on pages very frequently. None of them will play youtube
 anymore. I tried to watch a video in Chrome and not only did it not load, but I'm not able to close the tab. I'm a bit baffled by this. I disabled all my extensions to ensure they weren't causing any issues, and that didn't help. I tried a fresh install of
 Chrome Canary and it had the same issues the others did. I cleared my cache and that had no effect. I restarted my computer and that had no effect.</p>
<p>Any advice?</p>

<br />
My laptop is a Lenovo Y510p, model 20217.<br />
<br />
I checked for updates and it says my device is up to date.<br />
<br />
Method 1: I ran the troubleshooter and it couldn't identify any problems. <br />
<br />
Method 2: I followed the guide and tried everything it suggested. Still experiencing the same issues.<br />
<br />
Method 3: The resolution was already at it's recommended setting (1920 x 1080). I tried switching it to 1280 x 1024 and then switching it back. Neither resolution makes any difference with the issues I'm experiencing.<br />
<br />
Method 4: When I tried to update, it says "The best driver software for your device is already installed".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I got it to work again! I used System Restore to go back to my restore point for July 31 and videos are loading now in all browsers in Windows 10! It froze for about 20 seconds in one, but otherwise I seem to be back to normal and am not experiencing
 the constant freezing I was before. Now I'm just crossing my fingers that it stays this way. I still can't figure out why this happened.</p>

<p>========================================<br />
<br />
Disk issues can get serious very quickly so I would thoroughly check the drive now and be sure<br />
to keep redundant backups of your important data (use several methods).<br />
<br />
Inside Windows - Regular or Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot).<br />
<br />
Run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />

</span><br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
For even better and more efficient checking :<br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista/Windows<br />
7&nbsp;disk - if you do not have a&nbsp;Vista/Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friend's (it needs to be same<br />
32 or 64 bit and they are not copy protected) or make one. Also your System maker will sell the<br />
physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
Space after k and before /&nbsp; and after f and before /<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
<br />

<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Go into Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch screen as you startup. Set the<br />
boot order to CD/DVD to use Windows&nbsp;disks (Vista or Windows 7 whichever you have installed.)<br />
Remember to set back when done.<br />

                    <p>I recently reimaged and since cannot connect my mouse w/o borders - it continues to time out.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>
