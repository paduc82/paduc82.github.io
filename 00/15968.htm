<h2>            USB &#38; mixed reality portal issues</h2>
                    <p>Have been using 1803 for a little while now and have recently run into an issue that I was advised to share here,</p>
<p>
</p><p>my PC has been running in the current config for a few months relatively issue free until a few days ago<br />
<br />
B250 k4 Fatal1ty with latest bios and drivers<br />
Intel i5 7400</p>
<p>kingston HYPER-X 16GB&nbsp;<br />
evga 980gtx asx 2.0 latest drivers<br />
windows 10 home 1803&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Issue is my headset started disconnecting and reconnecting without errors, I tried to uninstall the mixed reality portal and now at the stage of setting it up again but it doesn't recognize my ports as being 3.0+<br />
<br />
if I unplug the headset it gives me green ticks and says everything is fine, plug the Dell Visor in and it gives me the "make sure its a superspeed port" error or if I do the system check again inside the portal it gives me a red X next to the USB.<br />
<br />
headset works fine on another PC<br />
<br />
Tried a powered pcie usb 3.1 add in card and get exactly the same issue<br />
<br />
halp!?</p>

<p>Hi jimsim1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that a software incompatibility is causing the issue. For us to isolate the issue, please answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What's the current build and version of the affected computer? You have mentioned that the issue doesn't occur in the other computer, what's the current build and version of it?</li><li>Do you recall any incident before the issue started?</li><li>Have you tried to reach out for the manufacturer's website of the headset and look for the latest drivers?</li></ul>
<p>We'll be waiting for you response.</p>

<p>Apologies for the delay in response. A new build (17134) was released last April 16 can you confirm if the issue still persists on the new build. Also I would like to know if the visor is detected in Device Manager when plugged on the computer?</p>

    <title>Printing labels - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darrend7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing labels</h2>
                    <p>I am having an issue printing labels from a query. When I do a print preview, I see a page that is about as wide as the label should be, but maybe 11 inches in length, so there are 6 labels on this page. When I click on print, the label prints fine, but
 it is only printing one label from that print preview screen and skipping all of the others. When the second label prints, it prints the first item on the second page, and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Darren</p>

            <p>Thank you for the link, but I don't think this solves my problem. I am not trying to skip labels. I am actually trying to print labels that should be printed but are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I designed the labels, I did a custom label size of 4 1/2" wide by 1 1/2" tall. When you click on print, everything fits&nbsp;perfect on this custom label, except a number of labels do not print. Example, the query currently shows I should get 72 lables.
 What actually prints is about 12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I&nbsp;do a print preview, I see a label that looks to be 4 1/2" wide by about 11" tall. On that screen, I can see about 6 or 7&nbsp;items from my query on this one sheet. The first&nbsp;item at the top of the print preview screen is what actually prints. All of the
 other&nbsp;items that are showing on that screen, do not print. If I advance to the next page on the print preview screen, I again see 6 or 7&nbsp;items and again, the first item on that screen is what actually prints, and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would think that when I do a print preview, I should only see the label as it is designed, not some long sheet of data.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Darren</p>

            <p>It sort of sounds like a problem with the report design? (you say that you designed these labels from a query, but I hope you meant a report based on a query)</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, you cannot have two 4.5" wide labels side-by-side on a standard 8.5" x 11" sheet. (4.5 x 2 =9), plus you have to allow for margins and gutter, etc.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the label wizard and select a label that is close to the size you need (Avery 5262 is 1.333 x 4)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact ... I would suggest that you go to a stationary store, buy a package of labels, and use them rather than attempting to use some kind of custom set-up if at all possible?</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">First thing, yes, it is a report based on a query. I would have thought that would be a given since I am talking about a label issue, which would be generated from the label wizard in reports.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Second, I don't recall saying anything about printing two columns. I am simpling printing a label that was designed in the system. I had this exact label working in Access 2003, but I have built a new database in 2007 and am now
 having issues with the way it is printing.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">As for custom label sizes, if I can't use custom label sizes, then it shouldn't be available in the design tool. We purchase Zebra printers for all of our small printing needs and the labels that are available for these printers
 are standard sizes for them. Avery labels, from what I have seen anyway, are not available in rolls of 500 or 1000. So we use what Zebra has available.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I have uploaded some screen shots to my one drive showing the design veiw and the print preview, so you can see what I see.

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">In the print preview screen, you will see there&nbsp;is a long list of data&nbsp;on one page that is about 11" tall, when that page should only be 1 1/2" tall. the&nbsp;data at the top&nbsp;on this page prints, all of the other data showing does not.
 As I mentioned earlier, you can advance to the second page in print preview. Again, the data at the top of the page prints and the data below on the print preview screen is lost.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I did go back and tried to design a new label from the label wizard, hoping that I just made a mistake, but I get the same results. I don't understand how this process worked perfectly in 2003 but in 2007, I am having issues.

<p>Your "Zebra" printer is one of these small thermal label printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dymo one at work, which they tell me can use a label list from Excel ... but I haven't attempted that yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the sounds of things ... I'm kind of assuming that it's the "paper size" that is causing the issue for you.</p>
<p>Did you choose "Sheet feed" or "Continuous" Label Type option?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a label wizard that *might* do the trick for you? </p>

            <p>I've had the same problem and like you I don't want to risk losing data by removing usb. &nbsp;I have found that running some software or playing music or something stored on my main hard drive, frees the usb from whatever the PC thinks is using it. &nbsp;An alternative
 solution is&nbsp;to restart the computer and remove the usb during the time when windows is not running.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default Mail App in Windows 8x and Windows 10 is a Cloud application. It works directly from the Website for your email account.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 5800 &#40;Backup Restore Problem&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday I made a Full phone backup with&nbsp; PC Suite.</p>
<p>After that I was going thru all my message (approx 940 of them) in PC Suite, its much eaiser to go thru all with that.</p>
<p>And suddenly all messages dissapeared, I tried to reload but no message showed up....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the inbox in my phone and everything was gone there to, even my GMAIL message and account information....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I tried to restore the recently created backup BUT it said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Unable to restore : <strong>Messages</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I unhooked the phone and clicked into the inbox and got this message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"The selected memory isnt avaible, new messages will be saved in the phone memory"&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I tried to restore an backup from 21st December... same **bleep**.. unable to restore messages....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had to go to a backup from 19th december, but now im missing several messages that I need..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why isnt the 2 recently created backups working, is there something I can do to fix it ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The difference was that on the 20th december I changed the message memory from phone to memory card.</p>
<p>And the phone moved everything to the memory card.. and it worked fine, I made an backup the day after.</p>
<p>and the 25th (today) and none of those 2 can be restored.... :( :( :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only the backups with the message on the phone memory.. (everything else on the memory card works, pictures, movies, music etc etc. so the card is working..)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So PLEASE help me, I really want my messages back again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards, Dan Norberg&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi again..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also noticed now, that when I get an new email (GMAIL) on the phone. Itshows the little icon on the top right corner,</p>
<p>"1 new message" even if I read all "new" messages it still shows there, This problem wasnt here before the problems with the restore of the messages etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to restart the phone to make the little Letter with an @ to dissapear..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas what todo ? I really want my messages back, and I dont wanna loose the stuff in the phone..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I have to factory reset it and reinstall everything or what ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me, my Nokia 5800 have been strange the last week, hanging, unable to open some old text messages, sometimes some programs dont start, and AccuWeather said, "No memory left, try closing some programs and try again"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I didnt have any programs running at that time, I have ~40mb free on phone memory and several GB on the memory card...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas what todo ? :( :( :(</p>

<p>Seems like its the Sandisk 16GB microSD card thats not working again.</p>
<p>Several pictureswont work, and when trying to copy them into my computer the phone hangs and connection is reset.</p>
<p>So im guessing its time to format the microSD again and reinstall everything....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that means my latest backup from 25th december is busted ? At that time all my messages was on the memory card, and thats maybe why it cant be re-installed....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas if its possible to fix an damaged backup file from PC Suite ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: also I noticed on christmas (24th) that 1 of my recent sms (text messages) didnt open, I read it replyed and when I got back to the inbox, I couldnt open it again, I just saw who it was from and the little preview, but The message after and before
 was I able to open ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So maybe its cause of an bad memory card ?!</p>

<p>Hi again :S (sorry for spamming)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just finnished up formatting memorycard and soft reset of phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have restored everything but my messages, The inbox says 974 messages.</p>
<p>But There is only arount half of that restored and in the inbox (only half showing in PC Suite)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried to restore the backup from yesterday with all my messages, but when I have done that (only messages/textmessages) and restart the phone it says: "<strong>The memory you are trying to use isnt avaible, messages will be saved in phone memory</strong>"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strange thing is that I have opened the .nbu file with ABC Amber NBU and in that program I can see all messages until the backup was made...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why are the PC Suite not restoring the messages correctly into the phone ?</p>
<p>I have the 8GB card that came with the phone inserted now instead of my 16GB Sandisk one.. (seems like the sandisk 16gb isnt good at all, 2nd time I had to format it....)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So any ideas what todo now to restore the messages inside the backup from yesterday ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cause if ABC Amner NBU program can read all messages then it should be possible to restore them to right ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ATM I have saved all messages on the phone instead of the memory card, I dont trust the cards anymore..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Please help me, I really want my text messages back into my phone..&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I cant get microsoft word or excel to work on my laptop, how do i fix it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I got a new laptop during the summer and I bought a Microsoft&nbsp; package (I think it was Microsoft office student and home) to go with it, I in installed it all with no problems but I cant get it working every time I open word or excel it says theres a problem
 which caused it to stop working and it needs to close.&nbsp; I have gone to control panel and repaired the product so now I'm stuck for ideas on what to do to fix the issue.&nbsp; it seams to open ok but when you click on blank document it comes&nbsp;up with that message.</p>
<p>any help would be much appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>(p.s. it lets me open and use &nbsp;powerpoint with out any issues it just seams to be word and excel)</p>

<h2>            Not able to update to new buids since a had to change my hard drive to a new one</h2>
                    This is a bit of a confusing scenario, my main drive had to be replaced due to mechanical failure, I made a mirror image of my old drive and installed it on 3 terabyte drive, everything has been working as it would be expected, but I'm continually getting
 messages to install new updates. I'm currently running build 14926_prerealease. 160910-1529. And in notifications I get the following: SETTINGS: restart required to finish update preview 14936 but it does not install and the same message appears again, other
 than that all is working as it should , any ideas? thank you

<h3> hollowcrown---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia N97 firmware update Hell</h2>
                    
<p>Hello! I am trying to update my N97 from V 12x to the latest V20x. I am running windows 7 and connecting my phone through USB cable to my laptop. When I try to update the phone through OVI suite it just crashes while looking for updates.. and when I use
 the software updater all goes well up to the poijtn where it's done downloading. when it finishes downloading the update it just tells me to connect my phone directly through USB cable...while it is already directly connected by usb cable... I also suffered
 from error 4 before. Please let me know if this is a known problem, and, if possible, how to fix it. :D</p>

<p>I am not sure whether this will solve your problem but you can try this.</p>
<p>1. Uninstall OviSuite, PC Connectivity solution and Nokia Connectivity cable drivers from Add/remove</p>
<p>2. Restart your pc<br />
3. Install latest&nbsp;Ovi Suite.</p>
<p>4. Restart your pc</p>
<p>5. Do restore factory settings of your phone</p>
<p>6. Disable firewall settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now connect your device and check</p>

<p>If the option to create the backup file was manually unchecked for some reason (it is checked by default), then no .bak file will be created. If it was checked, then the default location for the backup file would be in the same folder where the PST file
 existed but it can be optionally changed to another location. In short, if no changes were made to ScanPST after selecting the PST file to be scanned, a file with a .bak extension will be created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While unlikely, but just to cover all the bases, if you happened to run a disk clean-up program, it's quite possible that files with a .bak extension were deleted.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have no backup and there are no new folders in your PST file referencing "recovered items" then it's highly unlikely that the data is recoverable. You can always try a 3rd party PST recovery tool to see if it finds anything but it will be an expensive
 solution. Do a google search using the phrase "PST Recovery" (or anything similar). The "eval" of most programs will indentify the findings but will require the program to be purchased in order to actually recover anything. Be sure to do your due diligence
 before making any purchase.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t format text, insert tables pictures ect. i Outlook 2013 calender</h2>
                    I've tried the advanced settings, and can¬¥t find anything. When I create a new appointment the "Format text" tab i grayed out. The same when I go to the "Insert" Tab. I can't insert tables, pictures or even a hyperlink. The problem is the same when I try
 to plan a meeting.
<div>I had no problem with formatting text i earlier versions for Outlook. Is there some add-on I'm missing or is this function just not possible in Outlook anymore?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A secondary question. Can this be linked to the fact, that I can't view attached documents directly in received mails? When I try I get the message:&nbsp;</div>
<div>"The file can not be displayed, because there is not installed a viewer for it." (roughly translation from the message i danish: "Filen kan ikke visees, fordi der ikke er installeret en fremviser til den.").</div>
<div>And just i clarify. I can't find anything in the advanced settings tab or in security center.</div>

    <title>Template Background Colour Not Showing Up - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Template Background Colour Not Showing Up</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I'm having a problem with my custom templates- I save the template with the background colour set, and then when I try to create a new document from it, the background colour is gone!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw a previous question about this from 2014, which said that they fixed the problem by making sure that 'print background' was set in the print settings. I have done this, and if I go to 'print preview' the background colour shows up! But the actual working
 page is still white.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some screenshots to try and show the problem:</p>

<p><a href="https://ibb.co/kKWbN0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ibb.co/kKWbN0</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea how to fix this, but I have Irlen's Syndrome (like dyslexia) so having the background colour set to my very specific needs is important (and it's a PITA having to find and type in the RGB values every time!) so any suggestions would be very
 helpful!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer Doesn&#39;t Run</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I click on the Internet Explorer icon, link, or anything that opens it, it doesn't start up. Instead, it pretends that it's not an executable &nbsp;file and asks me what program I wanted yto use to open and view this "file". I just got rid of Win 7 Internet
 Explorer 2012 using Malwarebytes' Anti Malware application, and in order to run that I had to rename the installation app "internetexplorer.exe". So I wondered if it was confused, and deleted the installation app, but it still doesn't work. I really need to
 get on the web.</p>
<p>P.S. Not only Internet Explorer acts that way. In fact, every single executive on my computer does. I run a Windows 7.</p>

<h2>            In word 2003, my form fields default to Times New Roman, but I would like to change this to Arial</h2>
                    <p>I have never had a problem like this before. I was always able to select the form field gray box and change the font. This ALWAYS worked.</p>
<p>When I select a form field box It says Table Grid at the top in Styles. The table grid is set to Arial at 10 pts (which is what I want, however when I try to select the font to Arial, it is BLANK in the font drop down menu.)</p>
<p>When I protect the form and save as a .dot, the font goes back to Times New Roman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried selecting the gray form field box and adding a style under Styles and Formatting. I choose Arial and 10pt but nothing happens. I try to clear formatting and change it to Arial 10 pt, but nothing happens. Someone please lead me in the right direction,
 I would appreciate it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

                    <p>Hi -</p>
<p><br />
So I have recently noticed that Yahoo is apparently now taking over when I type an inquiry into my URL bar, when it usually connects to my Bing account so I can earn rewards for my account.&nbsp; Yet when I try to install the Bing search engine again, it says it
 is already installed yet my searches are still popping up with Yahoo.&nbsp; I have had this issue before and I had tried to re-install the Bing search engine and it worked just fine, but this time it didn't fix the problem.&nbsp; I even tried restarting my computer
 after trying to re-install and still no luck.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

            <p><span>Hi John</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Starting Office 2016 Power Query is available as part of Excel with no need to install an add-in separately.</span></p>
<p><span>It is also available on all SKUs including Home Edition.</span></p>
<p><span>The difference between the Pro and Pro + SKUs and the Home SKU is that on Home SKU you will not get some corporate data source and the corporate catalog, all other functionality is the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best Regards</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            mp4 video playback issue in IE10 - &#34;invalid source&#34;&#39;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm seeing the error message "invalid source" in one of the mp4 videos on my ASP.NET website.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The URL seems correct - if I right-click and copy-paste the video URL into a new tab, Windows Media Player loads and plays the video.</div>
<div>When I use the developer console, I see a 304 (Not modified) response for the video.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Would appreciate some help in clarifying why and how I can solve the issue.</div>
                </div>

    <title>Update Published InfoPath Form by Administrator Approved Form Template - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rajdeep1510  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update Published InfoPath Form by Administrator Approved Form Template</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an InfoPath form with just one textbox and&nbsp;submit button,&nbsp;and I deployed the same to a form library. I created few items using the form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I updated the form and used VSTA to write code in visual studio.&nbsp;While publishing this&nbsp;form with its solution it is forcing me to publish it as administrator approved form template as I want this to be browser enabled as well. When it is published as
 administrator approved form template; the template is added to the form library as a new content type. But I want to update the existing forms as well, which were created earlier and presently in the Form library.&nbsp; Is there any way to update the&nbsp;items present
 in the form library which has no custom code written; by the Administrator Approved Form Template which has custom code now.
</p>
<p>Any help on this will be highly appreaciable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Rajdeep</p>

            <p>Hello Rajdeep,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems you want to update the existing template of the form library not upload it as a new content type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this question, we‚Äôd better post on our TechNet SharePoint forum here:
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/sharepoint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/sharepoint/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure of your SharePoint edition and cannot provide the detailed steps, you may try to find View All Site Content, find the form library, on the Settings menu, click
 Document Library Settings &gt; Under General Settings &gt; Advanced settings, In the Document Template section, under the Template URL box, click Edit Template, Make the changes that you want, and then save the template.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>
