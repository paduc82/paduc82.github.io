<h2>            The next generation of Windows&#58; Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Delivering Windows as a Service and a Free Upgrade to Windows 10</p>
<p>(From Terry Myerson's presentation on January 21st, 2015)</p>
<p><br />
Today was a monumental day for us on the Windows team because we shared our desire to redefine the relationship we have with you ‚Äì our customers. We announced that a free upgrade for Windows 10 will be made available to customers running Windows 7, Windows
 8.1, and Windows Phone 8.1 who upgrade in the first year after launch.*</p>
<p><br />
This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device ‚Äì at no cost. With Windows 10, the experience will evolve and get even better over time. We‚Äôll
 deliver new features when they‚Äôre ready, not waiting for the next major release. We think of Windows as a Service ‚Äì in fact, one could reasonably think of Windows in the next couple of years as one of the largest Internet services on the planet.</p>

            <p>I&nbsp;notice something in&nbsp;these comments which is troubling to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the following comment meant to suggest Windows 10 will not be transferable to&nbsp;upgraded or replacement equipment?&nbsp; I suppose someone might also wonder what
<em><strong>supported</strong> lifetime </em>might mean.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose such details will be in the EULA for the OS, just wanted to see what the current thinking is.</p>

who determines the "Lifetime" of the device, <br />
I still use <br />
80486 systems,<br />
P-III systems, <br />
P-IV systems, <br />
with the OS that runs best on them,<br />
no I do not attempt to run vista, 7 or windows ape on any of them, <br />
<br />
but as far as I'm concerned, <br />
they are not EOL or EOS as long as they are booting up and running, <br />
End of Life or End of Service only occurs when a system has suffered a catastrophic unrecoverable unrepairable hardware failure.

<p>That's an interesting point. I don't know the answer but what comes to mind as the "Supported Lifetime" would be the manufacture of the device and their specific support policies. If this is true then it would be a supported lifetime&nbsp;nightmare as no one
 company has the same support / warrantee polices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you the useful life of a device as a guide then Computers are by far and away the longest lived. Phones / Mobil devices come and go every year or two as users want the latest and greatest.</p>

            <p>Lifetime of the device is what it says, throughout the devices lifetime. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember, hardware pretty much caught up with software over the years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 uses similar mimum system requirements as Windows Vista which was&nbsp;released 8 years ago. The only difference between Vista and Windows 10 is memory, Vista had a minimum requirement of 512 MBs, Windows 7 and later requires 1 GB for 32 bit and 2
 GBs for 64 bit. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So to put it gently, Microsoft will continue to service the device or PC with Windows 10 til it eventually croaks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you might say, how is Microsoft going to determine this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, Microsoft supported a version of Windows called Windows XP for nearly 13 years. Sure enough, I know that the IBM Aptiva I used from 1999 that originally ran Windows 98 and was upgraded to Windows XP in 2002 is not here with us any more, since it croaked
 in 2004. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The average life span of a PC is 3 to 5 years by industry standards. Even if you went up to 10 years unofficially, it wouldn't be a big deal either way. Since most persons refresh their PCs every 2 to 3 years. I was shocked when Intel released a report saying
 4 year old PCs are due for a refresh right now and this will boost sales of their new Broadwells. I am saying to myself, you are saying my HP Z210 Workstation is obselete? Surely doesn't feel like it. Yet its running Windows 10 like a champ!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, as advances are developed in processor technology, security, web standards, your device might not be able to run the revision of Windows 10 or all of its features that will be available 5 or 10 years from now. Case in point, PAE, NX, SSE2. Some
 current PC's that support the minimum requirements of Windows 8.1 but not support certain technical requirements have been left behind. It might be a similar case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then again, it might not support some newer technologies but can run the fundamentals of the software. For instance, the latest version of OS X has a feature called Continuity, although OS 10.10 supports Macs as far back 2007, not all have the necessary
 Bluetooth support for Continuity. </p>

            <p>But what constitutes a PC as a device? I'd hate to think adding RAM or an HD would mean it's a "new" device...<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My best guess would be,&nbsp;it's going to be tied to&nbsp;the CPU and/or MoBo as far as PCs go.</p>

<p>Thanks Andre,&nbsp;but I do not agree with your first comment, since the referenced quote does not actually say what you assert.&nbsp;

<p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>Folks who purchase OEM devices will be in a different situation since they are used to buying a new license with the new device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h3> nagimov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blocking top level and second level domains in Outlook</h2>
                    <p><strong>Intro.&nbsp;</strong>Starting a new thread with the same question asked many times.</p>
<p>Microsoft is protecting many top level domains and even second level domains from being completely blocked.</p>
<p>Microsoft is therefore acting as spammers supporter, forcing users to use their useless spam filter (which is also not defeat-able, by the way).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question. </strong>How can I block ANY domain without getting a `You can't add this item to this list because it will impact a large number of messages or important notifications.` error?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To moderators:&nbsp;</strong>Before trying to post another useless answer (e.g. point me at the options&gt;mail&gt;junk-email&gt;blocked-senders), please double check if your solution works for gmail.com, for example.</p>

<p>That error message will come especially if the server detects that the said domain has a big impact on your emails, if the server sees those email address you usually encounter has other users who use the same domain email address.. I'm just a volunteer

<h2>            Spreadsheet protection is causing Excel to freeze and not respond</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am working with a spreadsheet with multiple tabs. I need to protect each tab for update but would like users to be able to sort and filter. I have done this by locking cells and then protecting each sheet ticking all options except sort and filter. After
 I save the spreadsheet and exit, then reopen the spreadsheet, Excel freezes and does not respond.</div>
<div>Would appreciate any help from people that have experienced the same with the standard Excel protection feature.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div>Lou</div>

            <p>Hi Louise,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft community. As I understand Excel stops responding while you are opening the protected file. Let me help you with the issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I need more information:</p>
<p>Does this issue occur with specific file or all protected files with exception set for sort and filter?</p>
<p>If the issue is with specific file then what is the format of the Excel file (.xls or.xlsx) and size of the file?</p>
<p>Where is the Excel file saved, is it locally on the hard drive or over the network?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Provide more information on the issue so that we can assist you further.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            Hi Deepa,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the response.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The freeze seems to only happen when I save the file on a network, not when I save it on my local hard drive. Unfortunately, I need the file on the network. Additionally, the file uses the freeze pane function, not sure if this is causing the freeze, thought
 I read somewhere that this can cause problems.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Happens with a few different files.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Have tested at home with file extension (Excel 2007 - Windows 7, .xlsx files, file size = 137kb)) and I have another problem in that even though when I protect a worksheet, I specifically do not tick against sort and filter, when I open the protected sheet
 it does not allow me to sort or filter (this button is not active).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your help</div>

            Hi Deepa,
<div>After more research, I have decide that the best way to solve my problem is not use the Excel sheet protection at all.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have decided to use "Save As" to save the file, and using the general options to put in a password for modifications. This will mean I can control any updates by being the only one knowing the modify password, and everyone else can only open the file
 as read only where they can view and sort and filter to their hearts content.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Out of interest, I am still unclear how the protect sheet feature is meant to work.</div>
<div>If I have a sheet with 2 columns that I want to protect from updates I need to lock cells and then use protect sheet. Then when protecting I want to protect for everything except for sort and filter, however I believe I read that in a protected sheet,
 the sort and filter will only work for unlocked cells. This appears to me to be impossible for it ever to work. What am I missing ?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

If you want to add the exception then you need to uncheck 'Locked' option, right click on the cell, format cells and then protection sheet and uncheck 'Locked'.<br />

<p>Does anybody know how to upgrade Single Image 2010 to x64, remove it, or a workaround? I assume this was installed by the Office 2010 x64 installer by the title.</p>

<h2>            How to properly delete a OneNote Class Notebook&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been playing with the OneNote Class Notebook that rolls out to our tenant recently. The problem I came across is that I can't completely delete the class notebooks and make them vanish from "Get notebook links" section in the app. I've deleted the actual
 notebooks from the Class Notebooks folder in&nbsp;OneDrive for Business, I've even removed them from recycle bin but the notebook links are still there. The links&nbsp;are not working apparently because the notebooks were deleted, but their presense is just annoying.</p>

<p>Hi Thomas, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The message you're getting is due to an expired Office subscription. To continue using Office, we suggest you to renew it through this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/renew-office-365-for-home-58f3d0f8-15c4-4ad8-8c5f-16d682e8b545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. We also recommend you to turn on auto renew so once it expires, it will renew Office automatically and you can continue using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to get back to us if you need further assistance. </p>

            Is the account setup in outlook and needs updated? Is so, get to the dialog via send and receive settings - ctrl+alt+s. Click edit, select the account then click account properties.<br /><br />If you need to add the account, do it thru control panel, mail or use the command line switch /manageprofiles - open the run command and type or paste:<br />Outlook.exe /manageprofiles

<br />
<br />What you're encountering is the new "simplified" account settings UI. There are several ways to change the account settings, one of which is 
<br />
<br />From within Outlook
<br />- Press CTRL+ALT+S (this brings up the Send/Receive Settings window)
<br />- Select the group you want to edit and click on the &lt;Edit&gt; button
<br />- Select the email account you want to modify --&gt; click on &lt;Account Properties&gt;

<p>Hello Iris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had checked your account details and found you would not be able to access Yammer using legacy credentials. Hence, request you kindly use your office 365 credentials to access yammer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:-Please try to access yammer&nbsp;using&nbsp;browser on your desktop with&nbsp;office 365 credentials. Once, you are able to access yammer on desktop, kindly use same credentials to access Yammer mobile app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also please let me know, if you have more queries and concern.</p>

Thank you for choosing Microsoft.</p>

    <title>Endnote Cross-reference list not updating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karencnm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Endnote Cross-reference list not updating</h2>
                    I am using endnotes in a large document. After reorganizing the whole thing with a lot of cutting and pasting, several of my endnotes disappeared, leaving "Error! Bookmark not defined" instead of the superscript numbers in the text. I went back to one
 of them to re-add the endnote, and was able to do so successfully. But now when I go to others and click "Insert Cross-reference" only 10 of my 18 endnotes appear on the list of cross-references. I am unable to make this newly added reference appear on the
 cross-reference list. How do I force the list to update?

    <title>Access Cannot find Identifier &#91;example&#93; In Table leaving table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shido151  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access Cannot find Identifier &#91;example&#93; In Table leaving table uneditable.</h2>
                    <p>I'm working with the Template called "Desktop Product Inventory Database" found under the small business folder in Access 2010. All I'm trying to do is change some of the column headings to fit my needs.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I open the "Products" Table and try to change the column "Supplier" to "Vendor" it'll pop an error reading "The Identifier [SupplierID] could not be found" after I enter a value.&nbsp;It won't let me edit anything else on the table, or save it. This happens
 with every column I try to rename.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also amazed that access doesn't update the name change and everything dependent&nbsp;on the name&nbsp;through out the database. If anyone could please show me how to find these identifiers I would greatley apperciate it.</p>

            <p>This is because you did more than what you wrote. Your symptoms are consistent with:</p>
<p>Open Products table &gt; Select Vendor column &gt; On Fields ribbon select "Name &amp; Caption" and then change both the Name&nbsp; to VendorID and the Caption to Vendor. This actually renames the field in the table.</p>
<p>What you don't realize is that there are forms that expect fields by a certain name. Access will try to fix up those "identifiers" (it's called Name AutoCorrect in Options &gt; Current Database) but it's a tough job.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One more important point: the name of this database is deceiving. It says it's a Desktop database. To most of us that means it's a classic Access database that runs on the desktop, with all the features we have known for years. Not so. This is actually a
 web database set up to be published to SharePoint (see File &gt; Save and Publish &gt; Publish to Access Services). If you can live with the limitations, more power to you, but I for one would want a "real" client database with all the features.</p>

<h2>            Access Runtime not running VBA code</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have a Win Vista Business (SP2) notebook on which I am trying to run a .accde database using the 2010 Runtime - both 64 bit.</p>
<p>I note that on the Microsoft download site, the system requirements for 2010 runtime on Vista is SP1.</p>
<p>Does this preclude it from running on SP2?</p>
<p>The .accdb was created on Win7 Office 2010 SP2 machine. The accde was created on the same machine.</p>
<p>The .accde is in a trusted folder. (Trusted using AddPath2010.exe)</p>
<p>The .accdb runs fine, loads the opening form, and the VBA code behind the Command Buttons works a treat. (Basic stuff, open another form).</p>
<p>The .accde runs, loads the opening form, but there is no response from the Command Buttons -&nbsp;it seems&nbsp;that the VBA code is blocked/removed/disabled??</p>
<p>I have changed the sandbox mode as described in other answers - no joy.</p>
<p>There are no 'missing references'. (Four references 'ticked' VBA, MS Access 14 Object Library, OLE Automation, MS office 14 Access database engine Object library).</p>
<p>can anyone shed any light as I am completely in the dark.</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation.</p>

<p><span>Hi Krconatser,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your data has text values that‚Äôs the reason the chart does not show the correct result. If data rows contain number, you‚Äôll get expected chart.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get around the issue, I‚Äôll suggest you use Pivot Chart. The Pivot chart will show all the three values, as shown below.</p>

    <title>IE9 Download Manager pops up instead of web pages or files. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            IE9 Download Manager pops up instead of web pages or files.</h2>
                    <p>A couple of games call IE9&nbsp;for them to log into the online multiplayer games. The problem is that something has changed on IE9&nbsp; where it now only tries to download webpages via the Download Manager instead of opening them, and it asks to "save" the htm as
 a file.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you use IE9&nbsp;by itself, it works fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also while using NetBeans to create Java programs, there seems to be&nbsp;some sort of association to IE9 because when you open a file, multiple Download Manager popups appear and prompts you to "save" the htm as a file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done the following to try and fix this issue:<br />
<br />
1) I've run both Microsoft Security Essentials and Malwarebytes and the system shows up
<br />
clean.<br />
<br />
2) I've ran inetcpl.cpl and reset IE9 to factory settings.<br />
<br />
3) I've gone into Control Panel-&gt;Programs and Features-&gt;turn windows features on or off,<br />
then turned off IE9, rebooted, and reverted to IE8.&nbsp; IE8 does the same download of<br />
webpages via Download Manager as IE9.<br />
<br />
4) Turned IE9 back on and rebooted. Was able to get to the tools/internet options on initial<br />
startup if IE9. I deleted cookies, files, offline content. I deleted all temporary
<br />
files, objects, cleared forms and passwords. I went to the advanced tab and reset to
<br />
factory defaults. I was thinking that "Working offline" was selected but it wasn't. Right<br />
as I finished the setup for IE9, it immediately went to downloading a webpage <br />
as a file (the webpage is <a href="http://www.msn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#22229c">www.msn.com</font></a>).<br />
<br />
5) I've done the Start-&gt;All Programs-&gt;Accessories-&gt;System Tools-&gt;Internet Explorer
<br />
without add-ons, still tries to download the webpage.<br />
<br />
6) I uninstalled IE9, reinstalled IE8, still same problem with IE8. Then I reinstalled IE9,<br />
same issue.<br />
</p>
<p>7)&nbsp;I then browsed to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\ there are no .htm, .html, etc.<br />
There is just a .pref and a .WIN32.<br />
<br />
8) Under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\ all the .htm, html, etc. and everything appears to be set correctly.<br />
<br />
9) I also checked under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and everything&nbsp;appears to be&nbsp;set correctly there as well.<br />
</p>
<p>10)&nbsp; I tried IE 10, and the problem exists for this version as well. So, now I'm going back to IE 9.
<br />
</p>
<p>What is strange is that it recognizes msn_com.htm as an HTML Document but it prompts me to save this file.
<br />
<br />

                    <p>I'm a VBS novice... </p>
<p>I am have a script that opens a CSV file in Excel. The next step is to save the file as a Xlsm.</p>
<p>Here is my code but the file format number field shows in Red indicating something is wrong. I have tried FileFormatNum and with out the Num.</p>
<p>This is Excel 2013</p>

</p><p>Set objExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application")<br />
Set objWorkbook = objExcel.Workbooks.Open("C:\1datadump\datadump.csv")<br />
<br />
objExcel.Application.Visible = True<br />
<br />
<br />
objExcel.ActiveWorkbook.Save "C:\1datadump\datadump.xls", FileFormatNum:= 51<br />
<br />
objExcel.ActiveWorkbook.Close</p>
<p>
</p><p>The VBS syntax is killing me. Every page I read is slightly different.</p>

</p><p>i have one user on our DB that went to lunch and came back to 'access has stopped working' this was 2 days ago. &nbsp;its split with SQL backend &nbsp;everything i have tried has not fixed this. &nbsp;they can open other DBs and even a very old copy of this DB. &nbsp;recently
 i started getting message "there was a problem sending the command to the program.' &nbsp;the DB compiles on their computer and no references are missing. have also tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>repairing Office. &nbsp;initially this failed.</li><li>uninstalled office and reinstalled.</li><li>repair office - it went through.</li><li>changing user to Administrator - this fixed the issue for about 4 hours, this morning the issue was on us again. &nbsp;the user is still listed as an Administrator.</li><li>adding trusted locations including&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ACCWIZ folder</span></li><li>deleting the VBA folder.</li><li>removing files from&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ACCWIZ folder.</span></li></ul>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>This points to troubles with your Office/Access installation. Access should not auto-load a database when you open Access ONLY, without doubleclicking on a database (or something along those lines).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What exact process do you follow when you get this error? Do you actually open Access (i.e. from the Start - Programs menu), or are you using a shortcut of some sort to do this? If you're using a shortcut, examine the properties of the shortcut to insure
 it is configured as it should be.<br />
</p>
<p>Regarding the AutoUpdater error:<br />
</p>
<p>Is the G: drive a mapped drive? Or is it a local drive on the machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, make sure that your Windows and Office installations are fully up to date.</p>

            <p>If this happens anytime you open a database by any method, then almost certainly your installation of Office is bad (and possibly your installation of Windows). Only thing I can say at this point is that you should do a full uninstall of Office, and then
 reinstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A full uninstall is not something you do with Add/Remove Programs only. See this for more information:</p>

<h2>            nokia asha 210 problems</h2>
                    Hii!! I have nokia 210.. It is 4 or 5 months since I bought it. It was ok until I update mail app and I think from the time of it things were starting getting bad I must worse for everyday. First if I try to open mail app it says conflicting app its ok
 but every app I open it says conflicting app. Then after some days official browser doesnot work and if I mistakenly open it the phone get hanged and I must have to restart it or nothing works. If facebook works fine on it then wtsapp not working if wtsapp
 working then facebook didnt. And from last couple of days if lets say I want to dawnload a song of 3.3mb which is 3:34m in length every time the downloading failed in between yes 'every time' and then you know what lets say it failed on 1.1mb ok so what I
 resume it yeah and it downloaded the whole song whole 3.3mb. But its interesting I play that song and it only played till 1:20m equivalent to 1.1mb means if download failed you resume it or not it will only work from starting to where

            <p>This is also giving me trouble. I am trying to import data from a website without using a web query.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click on the <strong>"Import HTML"</strong> button on the <strong>External Data Sources</strong> section on the toolbar under Data tab. This brings me to my Finder. When I go to the file I want (a saved .htm file) it only gives me the option to
<strong>Open</strong> file, instead of Get Data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click the <strong>File</strong> drop down, then select <strong>Import</strong> I get the Import box selector. I choose the radio button for
<strong>HTML file</strong>. <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e4b013d-a144-475d-a404-0cbf42b07e93" /></p>
<p>Then, again, my Finder opens with a document selection screen. Again, my only option is
<strong>Open.&nbsp;</strong>I do not have the option to Get Data.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27bfcdf1-1aa1-409b-92e8-122981257cbe" /></p>
<p>I cannot find any other instructions anywhere regarding either of these pathways. Is this a bug? All instructions I can find, seem to indicate that there should be a Get Data button instead of Open.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The steps you are following bring the entire saved html file into Excel. Excel will attempt to render the text and tables contained within the html.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you only want the tabular data you can use the web query methods already mentioned. Or, you can open the saved html file in a web browser. In the web browser choose the View HTML code option. Look for the table tags &lt;table&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/table&gt; and highlight the
 entire table including the beginning and ending table tags. Copy the table code, switch to excel, and in any cell use Paste. Excel will render the table.</p>

            Calling the DLookup function in that way is certainly very inefficient.&nbsp; Apart from the multiple function calls, domain functions are per se notoriously slow.&nbsp; A query in which the necessary Boolean logic is contained in the WHERE clause to return the
 row or rows which meet the criteria on the multiple columns is a single set operation and consequently far more efficient on both counts.&nbsp; The query would not necessarily be a saved querydef object, but could be an SQL statement built in code.&nbsp; What you then
 do depends on how you wish to return the data.&nbsp; It could be shown in a report or form, and in the latter case this could be updatable if required, though this would affect the design of the query as not all queries are updatable.&nbsp; If you wish to refer to individual
 column's values from the returned row(s) then, as John points out, a recordset object could be established on the basis of the SQL statement and its individual columns examined in code.<br />
<br />
If you can describe in more detail what you are attempting to achieve in terms of the functionality of the database, we can probably be more categorical in our advice.<br />
