<h2>            Windows 10 update version 1803</h2>
                    <p>I have just updated to Windows 10 version 1803 and as a result:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; The Windows Start button does not work. (Left Click)</p>
<p>2&nbsp; The Notifications Icon does not work.&nbsp;(Left Click)</p>
<p>3&nbsp; Right clicking on a Task Bar icon results in nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried various web suggestions, but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix, please. Why do I dread MS Updates?</p>

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            Hi John.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Run the Start Menu troubleshooter:   <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/2/F22D5FDB-59CD-4275-8C95-1BE17BF70B21/startmenu.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/2/F2...</a>
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />You can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>Hello Everybody. It is me again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After posting my comment above I went to my old computer and looked in Control Panel/Add Remove Programs and saw Magic Jack installed in my old PC. So I went to the Program Files and made a copy of the entire folder that contains the Magic Jack files and
 installed it in the Programs Files in my new PC running 8.1 - After installing the folder I rebooted the new PC and went back to the folder containing the Magic Jack files and by instinct i double clicked the MagicJackLoader [it has a small telephone icon]
 and then it installed the necessary files, after a couple of minutes [do not get impatient] the old familiar menu came up and I dialed up my cell phone and everything is fine on this side of the fence. If you still have your old Magic Jack files you can do
 the same - if you got rid of your old computer and do not have the files any longer then ask Magic Jack to send you the Uploader program. Good luck.<br />

<h2>            Missing square root key on Windows 7 calculator - scientific view</h2>
                    There is a 5x5 grid of buttons, one of which is blank and unused. Why not add a square root? There is a cubic root function button and a generic "x" root button, neither of which I imagine are used more frequently then the good old square root.

            <p>Hi <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/82b90f1b-18c0-456c-8693-adc9471cc06a">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you receive any error?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, you may try the Printer troubleshooter, which will attempt to automatically diagnose and fix your problem.<br />
</p>
<p>Open the Printer troubleshooter by clicking the Start button , and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Hardware and Sound, click Use a printer.<br />
<br />
If Windows can't detect a printer that you want to use, follow these steps to find and add the printer manually:<br />
<br />
1. Open Devices and Printers by clicking the Start button , and then, on the Start menu, clicking Devices and Printers.<br />
2. Click Add a printer.<br />
3. In the Add Printer wizard, select Add a network, wireless or Bluetooth printer.<br />
4. On the Searching for available printers page, click The printer that I want isn't listed.<br />
5. On the Find a printer by name or TCP/IP address page, choose how to find the printer that you want to use, based on the type or location of the printer, and then click Next.<br />
6. Complete the additional steps in the wizard, and then click Finish.<br />
<br />
To make sure that printers on the network are being displayed, check to see if the network is working correctly. For more information, see View the status of your network.<br />
<br />
I’d also suggest you to refer the link below and follow the steps mentioned in the article to troubleshoot network printer problems:<br />

<h3> sumi cool  say:</h3>
<h2>            Graphic Card problem &#40;ATI HD 7670M 2GB&#41;-Laptop is pavilion g6 series</h2>
                    When I had bought this laptop the performance from the graphic card was awesome. After 6 months I started encountering problems the graphic card was not working properly!!!. The games like FIFA 13 which can run on Intel graphics now started lagging and
 not only this but games like Call of duty ghost was posing a <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">GREAT</span></strong> problem even on the lowest settings.NFS Rivals was also lagging on the lowest possible settings. Heating won't be a problem because
 when I start the game it starts lagging from there onwards.Although I run every game on high performance then also lagg problems prevail.I dont know what to do.. pls help<br />
<br />
The things which can cause problem according to me:<br />
1) The clogged exhaust.<br />
2)Upgrading to Windows 8.1 .<br />
<br />
The dxdiag is also not showing the Ati graphic card and the app. total memory is also different from what I had seen in the brand new laptop.<br />
I tried updating the drivers.I downloaded the auto-detect from AMD site but it said that the drivers were up to date.<br />
<br />
IMP- There was a game which I downloaded from the windows store when I switched the games performance into High Performance the game didn't started and showed some message and then I switched its performance to power saver then it started running fluently!!!<br />

</p><p>I have run Netplwiz and told it that a password is not required, but every 42 days it asks me to reset the password, and it is a pain. I cannot find these settings anywhere.</p>

<p>You must now tell Windows that the blank password should not expire. The advanced feature of netplwiz will let you do it for the higher versions of Windows 10. For the lower versions you must do it like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log on under an admin account.</li><li>Create a desktop shortcut for cmd.exe.</li><li>Right-click this shortcut, then left-click "Run as administrator".</li><li>Accept the challenge.</li><li>Type this command and press Enter:<br />
<em>net&nbsp; accounts&nbsp; /MaxPWAge:unlimited</em></li></ol>

            Actually, I would not follow that advice from the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" who has probably never see this problem before, never fixed it and has not bothered to recreate it and then see if those Methods work (or don't).<br />
<br />
If you do not have a genuine bootable XP installation CD, you will not be implementing KB307545 and if you do have one and it is not the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack, you will not be doing a Repair Install either.<br />
<br />
I have fixed this a few times and never using KB30745 or a Repair Install and I will never even suggest those options, but of course you can do what you want...<br />
<br />
You need to answer a few questions to get replies that make sense and not more Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert"
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild-goose_chase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">wild goose chases</a>.<br />
<br />
If you are seeing a message similar to these:<br />
<br />
STOP: c0000218 {Registry File Failure}<br />
The registry cannot load the hive (file): \SystemRoot\System32\Config\SECURITY or its log or alternate. It is corrupt, absent, or not writeable.<br />
<br />
STOP: c0000218 {Registry File Failure}<br />
The registry cannot load the hive (file): \SystemRoot\System32\Config\SOFTWARE or its log or alternate. It is corrupt, absent, or not writeable.<br />
<br />
STOP: c0000218 {Registry File Failure}<br />
The registry cannot load the hive (file): \SystemRoot\System32\Config\SYSTEM or its log or alternate. It is corrupt, absent, or not writeable.<br />
<br />
The problem is most likely that your NT File System (NTFS) has gotten corrupted and XP just can't "find" the file or it could be some fallout from older versions of Norton/Symantec products that will corrupt the file system after an update.<br />
<br />
Do you now or have you ever had any Norton or Symantec products installed and if so, what versions?<br />
<br />
You need to start by booting into the XP Recovery Console and running a chkdsk /r&nbsp; from there to be sure your file system is intact.<br />
<br />
If you do not have a genuine bootable XP installation CD from which you can boot into the XP Recovery Console (many people don't)&nbsp; you can create a bootable XP Recovery Console D (no XP media required).&nbsp; Let's see if the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert"
 can tell you how to do that.<br />
<br />
While we are waiting for that, please answer these questions as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
<br />

            Hi,
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that AVG scan reports that a files is infected and you are unable to remove it.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>In this scenario I would suggest you to boot the computer in Safe mode and remove the files manually.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>In the normal mode this file might be used by other programs and you will not able to remove it.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Please refer to this article below to boot the computer in safe mode:</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>As all the third party programs will be disabled in this mode you can easily go to the location and remove the file.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>You can also try to uninstall MOKAFIVE player and reinstall it and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Additional Information:</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to contact AVG Forum as only AVG is detecting it as a Threat. It would be better if you can contact them and get a clarity on this problem.</p>

            Hi Oaksavannah,
<br />
<br />In the current versions (CC) of Illustrator, there is no way to clear the clipboard - the old versions used to have Edit - Purge, but that was removed . . .
<br />
<br />Illustrator will automatically clear the clipboard when is closes
<br />
<br />You can minimize the size of the clipboard by adjusting the settings in Edit - Preferences - File Handling and Clipboard
<br />
<br />That's about all the control Adobe provids at the moment . . .

<h2>            Windows 10 update killed MS-Office, Firefox, and a lot of other stuff&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I restarted my laptop yesterday and noticed when it re-booted that the background image was a standard Windows image, not my pre-selected image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmm, okay.&nbsp; I don't remember seeing any notification about a Win 10 update, it just re-booted as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a couple of minutes browsing around the laptop I was astonished to find a lot of other changes that I really didn't want, and wasn't prepared for the amount of grief it would cause me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found another article on this site that discussed the removal of MS-Office, and like it said I just re-installed it fairly quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In doing that I found that the update had killed Firefox (my default browser), and forced Edge in.&nbsp; Without the decency to import the old bookmarks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>No problem, I'l just copy in the backup I saved to my desktop..........GUESS WHAT, that's gone too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, now I plug my phone in, and am now forced to used a different picture/video import program!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A massive disaster of Microsoft!&nbsp; I wouldn't have minded so much if I got a warning of the possibility of all these things that might happen!</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANGRY CUSTOMER.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 HP Pen buttons</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I am using an HP Elite X2 tablet with Windows 10. I want to configure my pen buttons. Here's my configuration, but whenever I press the pen top button, I get the error message below. Any idea why?</p>

<p>Pon la configuracion de inicio y vuelve a configurar la consola. Cuando te pida el pais pon el tuyo y creo que después te pide si es PAL o NTSC. Antes mira en opciones de pantalla a ver si se pudiera cambiar allí.</p>

<p>No se puede cambiar de PAL a NTSC. Lo que sí se puede hacer es cambiar de 50 Hz a 60 Hz en la configuración de la consola.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Si se pone a 60 Hz se debería poder ver en una tele NTSC.</p>

<p>Las teles actuales (Lcd o led) hacen que puedas jugar con cualquier consola PAL o NTSC...ahora el problema viene con los juegos...los juegos americanos por ejemplo creo que no funcionan en una consola PAL a no ser que sea un juego REGION FREE.</p>

<p><span>g. Then select “<b>Restart</b>” option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u><span>Step 2: Try to install in Clean boot state: </span></u></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Clean boot:</span></b><span> To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "<b>clean boot</b>." A clean boot helps eliminate
 software conflicts. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a) Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the <b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the <b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the <b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the<b> Task Manager window
</b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></span></p>
<p><span>f) Click <b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>a. </span></b><span>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the <b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items </span></b></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></b></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the
 problem item.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click
<b>‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 2: <span>&nbsp;</span>Run SFC scan</span></u></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>SFC/Scannow</span></b><span> checks your Windows installation for errors and corrects them. This will help with ensuring that a smooth upgrade occurs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>Start</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type: <b>CMD</b>, from the results, right click
<b>CMD</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click ‘<b>Run as Administrator’</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>At the Command Prompt, type:

<h2>            Bootmgr is missing message - Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a desktop with Windows 7 pre-loaded (no disc), HD not partitioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm getting the dreaded "Bootmgr is missing message".&nbsp; Did some searching here and couldnt find the right solution to match my issue.</p>
<p>It's a&nbsp;Compaq and&nbsp;the only help options on bootup (I think it was F11)&nbsp;&nbsp;are to re-install Windows which I do not want to do (dont want to lose files)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible to use a Windows 7 Repair Disk made from&nbsp;a different machine?&nbsp; (I have an HP laptop pre-loaded with Win 7. Laptop is working)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. What is the make and model number of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Were there any changes or updates made on the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned in the link to rebuild BCD (Boot configuration data)&nbsp;by accessing inbuilt recovery options.</span></p>

            <p>1.) It's a Compaq Presario, Model: CQ5329F</p>
<p>2.) There was some updates to it although I'm not sure what exactly (someone else trying to troubleshoot some other issue when Win 7 was working fine)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trying to boot into safe mode just gets me to the "bootmgr is missing" screen.&nbsp; The pre-loaded HP support just wants to re-install, refresh everything which I do not want to do until I can save off some personal files/data first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created a start-up repair disk from my Win 7 laptop.&nbsp; Tried to run it on the Compaq desktop and the startup repair process just fails and brings me to the HP troubleshoot screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't mind reinstalling, but I just want to get to those personal files first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I take out the harddrive and place it into another desktop as a slave?&nbsp; What if that other desktop is XP?</p>

            Yes, you can take out the hard drive, put it on another system, and get any of your files. As long as the operating system of the computer where you're moving your drive can read NTFS. Windows XP does. Something to consider is that if you get a window
 with Access Denied while accessing folders or files, then you have to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
take ownership of the folders and/or files</a> of the hard drive you're moving. It will depend on the way you set up your original profile(s) of the failing hard drive.

<div>For the boot manager issue, there are plenty of postings on how to solve it. However, the majority of them start&nbsp;assuming that you have a Windows 7 bootable installation DVD. If you don't<span>,

 website</a></span>&nbsp;to create a bootable USB thumbdrive even if you don't have the original DVD. You will need a working computer and a thumbdrive with nothing on it. Then follow the instructions on that site. Note: on step 1, the author says to run
 a command prompt with admin rights, click Start button, type cmd, pres shift+ctrl+enter (you'll get a warning about changing your computer, click yes). Also, you need to specify the drive number for your thumbdrive in the command: select disk #. The command
 "disk list" will make it easy to get the disk # of your thumdrive. Match the amount of space that corresponds to your thumbdrive: if your thumbdrive is 4GB then you should see one close to that amount on the list. Make sure you got the correct drive # for
 your thumb drive before issuing the commands after select disk #. Proceed with step 2 on the website. All that process will create a bootable USB thumdrive.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>The next process is to change your BIOS settings to boot to the thumbdrive. Check

            <p>Thanks ElRumbo, I'm going to try that out this weekend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing I noticed from your steps is the final one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the 'howtogeek' website, there is a screenshot showing the "System Recovery Options", which shows the WIndows Vista installation, partition, size...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I get to this screen after booting from the Win 7 repair CD I made, the options are blank on the Compaq.&nbsp; There are NO Operating Systems listed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I still proceed with this method?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<div>There's something missing on my steps to create the USB bootable without an original windows 7 DVD. With those steps, you can successfully create the USB bootable. However, the System Recovery Options won't launch automatically. I'm trying to find out
 why. In the meantime, I think there's something else going on on your computer. With the recovery DVD that you have, you should've seen Windows 7 on the list. If you try your recovery DVD on your HP, do you see anything on that list? Please, post your answer.</div>

            I was away for some time. Did you tried your repair CD/DVD on both the HP and the Compaq?
