<h2>            Office 365 - Not only does track changes in Word does not work, The settings for Insertions and Deletions do not stick.</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus en-us 16.0.9126.2336. I create a document in Word. I enable track changes. I switch to All markup. Track Changes Option are all default.&nbsp; Under advanced options Deletions are selected to Strikethrough. I change the color of insertions
 and deletions to by author. I save. Not only are the deletions not recognized and displayed but the color setting under advanced options reverts to default.
</p>
<p>I have done an online repair. I have removed the normal.dotm file. I have removed the Word registry entry from HKEY_CURRENT_USER, disabled all addins, ran word in safe mode, etc.
</p>
<p>Track changes will not track deletions let along display them as requested (strikethrough). What am I missing?</p>

<p>If you delete a word which is already being tracked as an insertion, Word will just remove it. This is by design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you insert text, accept the insertion and then delete the text, the text range will be marked as a deletion.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> fredrick zilz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Excel 2016 attachments - Scrambled</h2>
                    
<p>one of my Office 2016 (office 365 E3 subscription) users version 16.0.6001.1054 just had a very strange situation that I could not explain. &nbsp;She created an email and attached about 5 excel spreadsheets. &nbsp; She sent the email and the recipients wrote back
 that two of the spreadsheets appeared to have the wrong information and one they could not open. &nbsp;So the user opened the email that she had sent and then names of the attachements are all the correct file names, but when she tries to open them there is a message
 about the filetype being wrong. One would not open at all stating that the file might be corrupt. &nbsp;Gave the option of opening anyway, if you trust the source. &nbsp; So the one that she could not open, has a file size that is completely different than the original
 file. &nbsp;The ones she could open the wrong file content (data) opens for the file name. &nbsp;So file A has the data for file B and File B has the data for a different spreadsheet that the user was working on. &nbsp; The original files were still in her folder where they
 belonged and opened correctly. &nbsp; She forwarded the email to me and the wrong files opened just like they did on her computer (I thought at first it was some weird caching issue). &nbsp; I then had her create a new email and attach the same files (from the original
 folder location) and send to me. &nbsp;This time it worked fine. &nbsp; She sent the email to the original recipients and they received the files and they were as expected.</p>
<p>So I am completely baffled as to how the attachment excel files could have filenames that do not correspond to the correct excel files. &nbsp;What's going on here.</p>

<p>I look forward to help in understanding how this could happen and to determine if there is anything I need to do. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Fredrick,</p>
<p>This is a strange issue and I haven’t heard it before. After doing some research, I didn’t find a similar issue neither. And it’s hard to find out the cause of the issue as you are not able to reproduce it again.</p>
<p>Since it’s working now, it indicates that all the settings and services should be configured correctly. So you don’t need to do anything at this moment. If it happen again, please don’t hesitate to post back and I will collect information to help you troubleshoot
 the issue.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Henry Huang</p>

<p>Henry,</p>
<p>I am honestly very disappointed in your efforts to troubleshoot this problem as it has been a huge problem with Outlook 2010 and 2013. See link:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3095559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.microsoft.com/.../3095559</a></p>
<p>The update issued early Jan 2016 supposedly fixed this issue for Outlook 2010 and 2013, but now I also have users who are experiencing this problem in Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>Please look harder and try again or escalate to the same team that fixed this issue before.</p>
<p>Frederick,</p>
<p>When this problem happened with the older versions of Outlook it was hard to replicate, because it was only a specific workflow that caused the issue. I suspect the same is true in this case. I would bet that you will see the problem again. It happened when
 the first characters (I don't know how many) of multiple attachments were the same (similar naming conventions). Then if the email autosaved, and was sent (without being closed and reopened from the drafts folder), the attachments had swapped names. If the
 email was closed and reopened from the drafts folder, the attachments would show properly. It doesn't look like that is an option in this case, but I will try to replicate as my users just started complaining about it again with .xls (97-2003) files.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Bobby</p>

<p>Frederick and shoeshine,</p>
<p>I can update that the Outlook Product Team is forward porting the fix from Outlook 2013 to Outlook 2016 referred in this KB,
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3095559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.microsoft.com/.../3095559</a>. &nbsp;We do not know the release date yet as it is still being worked on.</p>
<p>The bug that causes the swapping happens when using the RTF format. &nbsp;One thing to double check is that the user who is seeing the issue is defaulting the format to HTML. &nbsp;To do so in Outlook click File, Options, Mail and make sure Compose new messages is
 set to HTML.</p>
<p>If the user is responding to an email its possible it came to her in RTF format. &nbsp;Make sure when responding to click Format Text on the ribbon and make sure the format is HTML. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>It gets stored in your clipboard. It is referred to as taking a screenshot. You then need to paste it into a image editing app of some type. Try using the built in
<em>Paint </em>app and selecting <strong>Paste</strong>. After you done any editing, you can save it to your hard drive then send it as an email attachment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some image handling apps&nbsp;have an option <em>New image from clipboard -</em> it does the same as the paste mentioned above though.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Alt </strong>+ <strong>Prnt Scrn </strong>will copy just the active window to your clipboard rather than the whole screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The built-in Snipping Tool is a useful&nbsp;alternative method&nbsp;if you need screenshots.</p>

<h2>            Slow Excel Downward Scrolling Speed</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased an i7 XPS 13 with 16gb of ram and a 4K display. The computer is great, but I noticed the speed with which the cursor moves from one cell to another in Excel going DOWN is slow/laggy when compared to any other direction -- I am dumbfounded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I completely uninstalled office and reinstalled it (the 64-bit version) and this did not help at all. It is simply not as smooth, especially when compared to my Dell Latitude that is a few years old and not nearly as powerful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please shed some light on this? Is it the laptop? Excel? Perhaps the 4K display?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>

<p>The behavior persists in safe mode - one thing to note is that it does not lag with a blank sheet. The problem only occurs when I open workbooks with many line items such as a financial model - even the more basic ones. The only time the downward scrolling

<h2>            Powerpoint 2010 fails to show ScreenTip</h2>
                    
<p>In Powerpoint 2007, I could add a shape, add text, then add a hyperlink with Tooltip text.&nbsp; When in&nbsp;presentation mode, a user could mouse over the object and see the additional text.&nbsp; This was most helpful for flow diagrams where the additional info or details
 could be in Tooltips leaving a cleaner initial view.</p>
<p>This "feature" apparantly no longer works in Powerpoint 2010.&nbsp; Can someone fix this or find me a workaround?</p>

<h2>            Missing Office Store tile in Office 365 launcher</h2>
                    <p>I own a subscription to Office 365 Business Essentials. I'm one of two users there. I've enabled Office Store in the Settings for add-ins and the other user now has a Store tile in his launcher. But I don't have it in mine. So how do I get the Store into
 my own launcher please?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Kevin,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure you have turned on the option of Office Store. Close all browsers and browse to the Office 365 portal again. Check if you can find the tile in All tab in the
 app launcher. If not, try<span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"> </span>accessing Office Store via:
</span><span><a href="https://portal.office.com/store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Office Store</span></a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a workaround, you can add a custom tile in your launcher. Please check the detailed steps via the link below.</span></p>

            <p>You are more likely to get an answer if you post in the Publisher forum, not the Photodraw, FrontPage &amp; Works forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also helps if you offer more details about the problems you are having, such as providing a link to your site so we could see the problem.

How to install Proofing Tools 2010 to Office 2010 on 64-bit Windows 7 Pro system?
<div>I have downloaded Microsoft Office Single Language Pack 2010 Turkish edition and when trying to install, I receive an error message regarding that this version is an 32-bit version and not compatible with Microsoft Office Single Image 2010 and asking me
 to install 32-bit Office system.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, there are no 64-bit versions of Language Packs, hence there is no such way to select the version from the download site. Does somebody have any idea how to install this add-on?</div>
<div>PS: I want to use 64-bğt office software in any case so i need to find 64 bit compatible Language Pack for Office 2010.</div>

<h2>            Outlook.com no longer receiving mail from pop.mail.yahoo.co.uk</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For at least a year now I have been getting my yahoo.co.uk email via outlook.com. &nbsp;I had my Yahoo account configured as a send / receive account and all has been working well until 3rd Jan when I stopped getting mail. &nbsp;A quick check of my Yahoo mail directly
 on the Yahoo mail interface saw a stack of messages there and a check on Outlook.com indicated there was a problem connecting to pop.mail.yahoo.co.uk.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I checked all the settings were correct but outlook.com still couldn't communicate. &nbsp;So I deleted the configuration and tried to add my yahoo.co.uk account again. &nbsp;When I click next the following message is displayed "<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There's
 a problem connecting to the POP3 mail server." &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;I've tried modifying the default settings to be pop.mail.yahoo.com but this gives the message "<strong>Sorry,
 we can't connect to Yahoo! right now" &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've ensured all the SSL settings are correct and have tried different port numbers (995, 110) but I still can't get it to connect. &nbsp;I have checked with Yahoo! what the correct settings for pop access are and I've verified my account is still configured
 for pop access. &nbsp;I also tested the pop settings provided by Yahoo! on my Outlook 2013 installation on my PC and can connect directly to my mailbox on Yahoo.co.uk.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>TIA</div>

            I've a feeling that it's just the end of this free feature.<br />
I think we should have been paying for this for some time to be honest, unless it's free in the UK..<br />
<br />
I know it's not something we wanted to hear and it affects me..<br />

I'm looking for solutions online too.<br />

            It appears that in other parts of the world (i.e not the UK), Yahoo charge for POP access via their Plus service. &nbsp;However, POP access has always been available for free in the UK - and it still is as far as I can tell as I can access my POP account using
 Outlook 2013.
<div><br />
<div>I'm hoping this is just a technical fault with either Microsoft or Yahoo.</div>

no other forums are showing anything so I'm just sitting back and being patient...<br />
Thanks for confirming you're yahoo plus marnot, as at least that proves that it's not a UK isolated issue.<br />

All this has done has finally started pushing me towards migrating me towards my live account properly ;)<br />

            I've just tried to add my Yahoo! account back into Outlook.com and it has worked with default options for a @yahoo.co.uk address. &nbsp;It did give a warning message that it might not have worked (different from the original message) but it did allow me to

<h2>            OneNote Keeps on Crashing on iPad</h2>
                    <p>I have had OneNote installed on my iPad 4 Gen for a long period and the app has been working fine. &nbsp;However, on 11 Jan, an update become available. &nbsp;After updating the app to version 15.30, the app stopped working. &nbsp;The purple splash screen would appear
 and then the app would crash and I would be returned to the home screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried re-installing the app and turning my device off and back on again; however, this was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still experiencing the same issue of OneNote crashing upon the splash screen.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To help you with your concern about OneNote keeps on crashing on your iPad, kindly answer the following questions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When OneNote crashes, are you getting an error message? </p>
<p>2. What version of Office are you using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would appreciate your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I have the same issues starting yesterday after the update, all as noted above. IPad is also Gen 4 if that matters and running 10.2 iOS.</p>
<p>In my opinion, OneNote is not actually crashing, but instead has lost focus, returning&nbsp;UI to the home screen. OneNote is still running in the background.&nbsp;You can bring it back to focus in the foreground but the same behavior returns again, and there is no
 error message.</p>
<p>I also have current Office 365 Home apps installed on the iPad running without any noticeable problems with their use.</p>
<p>I have also tried troubleshooting by uninstalling&nbsp;OneNote on the iPad as well as its data and even resetting&nbsp;all user account credentials. The problem&nbsp;immediatly returns after reinstallation and authentication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the error condition appears to happen when accessing the remote data stores, I tried troubleshooting without Wi-Fi. This results in OneNote not exhibiting the Error behaviour, however, it does give a message that it is unable to reach server resources
 when trying to open previous notebooks. I can also create new notebooks that&nbsp;operate as normal offline. If I make Wi-Fi operational again,&nbsp;and start OneNote&nbsp;with the new notebook, it immediately has the same error condition once attempting a sync.</p>
<p>Testing a little further I decided to change the OneNote account, since this problem was brought to my attention by my wife's use. I decided to use my own account. With the offline Test notebook active and the Wi-Fi turned off. I signed out of her account.
 I turn on Wi-Fi and signed into my account. The notebook actually synched to my account and note taking appears to&nbsp;be working normally. So naturally, taking this to the next level, I decided to try to open a notebook from my wife's account&nbsp;which is shared
 to me. The error condition returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will experiment more. Best.</p>

<h2>            Device suggestion&#58; Windows 10 feature phones</h2>
                    Here's my idea, the legend of the unbreakable Nokia lives on, it lives on not in Nokia but in Microsoft Mobile Oy, and the same designers and their patents are now at Microsoft, so I'm suggesting merging the Nokia&nbsp;Series 30+ platform into the Windows 10&nbsp;Internet
 of Things platform, the proposed telephone operating system will visually resemble Windows 10 on PCs but will be optimized for 1 inch devices but there will be several differences, though there won't be an application store the software will seamlessly integrate
 with PCs, for example the messaging application will synchronise with Skype and camera-enabled devices will automatically upload to Microsoft OneDrive, and on all devices this will happen with MMS'es, and if a user will switch from these devices to a Windows
 10 PC or mobile telephone (like a Lumia) all their contacts and messages will automatically be there, also these devices will show developers what you can do with Windows 10 IoT and will hopefully inspire o

<p>Today&nbsp;<span> i´ve received a call <span>from Micrsoft Corporation in Washington DC,</span>saying that my computer was being hacked and that my computer identification was being used for illegal acts.<br />
They made me verify that the ID they had was the same as my computer, and then they asked me to enter a support connection page,but we have paralyzed the call because it seemed very strange.<br />
They have left us a phone number<br />
1800 xxx-xxxx</span></p>

<br />It's a scam that has been going on for years. Microsoft never makes unsolicited phone calls. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Is that call from Microsoft a scam?

 a total of 15 in each cell.

<p>You could do a simple loop. This assumes the value to increment is in C1 (so you don't have to adjust the code all the time):</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Sub foo()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim x As Long<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x = Range("C1").Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each c In Range("A1:A6")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.Value = c.Value + x<br />

<h2>            How to add a server trust record in cPanel &#63;</h2>
                    Hi there does anyone know how to add a server trust record in cPanel ?<br />
<br />
This it what it says on windows live admin center :<br />
<br />
<strong>Server trust </strong>(recommended)
<div>Create a TXT record to allow other mail servers to trust email originating from your domain. Also known as sender ID configuration, this setting will help prevent your mail from being marked as junk mail. Use the following
 settings:</div>
<ul>
<li>DNS record type:&nbsp;TXT</li><li>Host: (my domain)<br />
</li><li>Value:&nbsp;<span>v=spf1 include:hotmail.com ~all</span></li><li>TTL:&nbsp;3600 or 1 hour (if requested)</li></ul>
<p>In cPanel advanced DNS editor I have added the information it says like this :
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
Name : (my domain)<br />
TTL : 3600<br />
Type : TXT<br />
TXT Data : v=spf1 include:hotmail.com ~all<br />
<br />
Is this correct?<br />

<h2>            All office file type icons turned to generic white icons</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I noticed some two days ago that all office file type icons turned to generic white icons.</p>
<p>I searched everything of relevance on Microsoft Community but without any success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be appreciated if someone can look into this and suggest or guide me to overcome it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though every ms app is working as it should, it&nbsp;rankles to see the white icons instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>&lt;snip&gt; From the <strong>Start menu</strong> &gt; open <strong>
Microsoft Office</strong> folder-&gt; open Microsoft Office <strong>2010</strong> <strong>
Tools</strong>- folder &gt; start Microsoft Office <strong>Picture Manager</strong> &gt; Click
<strong>Help</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>&gt; select <strong>Detect and Repair</strong> &gt; Select ‘<strong>Restore my shortcuts while reparing’</strong> &gt; click
<strong>Start</strong>. </p>
<p>After this all my Office icons&nbsp;came back!<span>&nbsp;
</span>&lt;/snip&gt; </p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; </p>
<p>I had the same problem as described above. &nbsp;The issue I found was the missing folders in C:\Windows\Installers. &nbsp;The registry has references to these folders for the icons images and if you have any utilities that have deleted
 these files or folders, the icons will not appear correctly. &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I restored these folders (e.g. -&nbsp;<strong>C:\Windows\Installer\{91140000-0011-0000-0000-0000000FF1CE} )
</strong>and the icons displayed correctly again.</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>**************************
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p><span>Rebuilding the icon cache did not work for me either. What did work was opening MS Office Tools --&gt; Picture Manager --&gt; Help --&gt; Detect and Repair. Easy and all set.</span></p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>I had the same issue as eeryone here and I think I’ve FINALLY figured out a solution!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to c:/Program Files/Microsoft Office/Office 14</p>
<p>right click on each program icon individually and unpin from BOTH your Taskbar and/or Start Menu. (e.g. EXCEL.EXE, MSACCESS.EXE, MSPUB.EXE, OUTLOOK.EXE, PWERPNT.EXE, WINWORD.EXE, etc.)</p>
<p>Then right click and select&nbsp; “Pin to Start Menu” (not to Taskbar).</p>
<p>Do this for each program you want to eventually make itonto your Taskbar.</p>
<p>Now go to Start and then for each program (that should now show in start menu with the actual Microsoft Office icon), right clik and select “Pin to Taskbar”.</p>
<p>You can then Remove each one from th Start Menu if you wish by right clicking again and selecting “Remoe from this List”.</p>
<p>Your icons should now be back to their original format.</p>
<p>I’ve rebooted my system several times so far and the icons have remained.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will work for eve<span> </span>
yone else as well!</p>
<p>Good Luck!!!</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>

<p>An alternate technique to recreate all of the icons</p>

 &gt;</span></p>
<p>… I have found a very simple solution:</p>
<p>1. Unpin all of the Office applications for which this is an issue from the task bar.</p>
<p>2. In Windows Explorer navigate to the Office folder (for me this is Program Files (x86) &gt; Microsoft Office &gt; Office16)</p>
<p>3. For each of the application .exe files you need:</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span>3.1 Right click on the .exe file</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span>3.2 Select Send To &gt; Desktop (create shortcut)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. When all of the applications shortcuts are on your desktop, rename them if you want (by default they will all be in the form “APPLICATION.EXE - Shortcut”), for example, I renamed “WINWORD.EXE - Shortcut” as “Word”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Drag each shortcut to the task bar and drop it on</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. The task bar item thumbnail should then keep the correct icon</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. You can then delete the shortcuts from the desktop without losing the task bar thumbnails.</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>

<p>This is the exact problem, because I accidentally deleted&nbsp;C:\Windows\Installer&nbsp;myself to save space in drive C thinking it store installation files that I don’t need anymore.
</p>
<p><span>Last resort before doing system image restore I uploaded the Subfolder that belongs to Office 2010 32bit here, if someone want to test if it works:</span></p>
<p><span>C:\Windows\Installer\{91140000-0011-0000-0000-0000000FF1CE}</span></p>

</p>
<p>At first I did not understand what you were asking because you kept saying that your applications were using the default icon. The screen shots help immensely. What you are seeing is NOT the default icon but NO icon. If you were seeing
 the default icon you would have what you want.<br />
<br />
I have seen this problem before and sometimes it is an extremely easy fix and other times it is harder. Let’s hope yours is easy.
<br />
<br />
You can download a program from <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>NirSoft - freeware utilities: password recovery, system utilities, desktop utilities</span></a> that will help you fix all your file types and point them back to the correct icons. Download “<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">FileTypesMan
 v1.56”.</span></strong><br />
<br />
The other time this happens when the icon file is missing because the folder that holds the icon has been deleted.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the most part the icons come from the application itself or a DLL for that application, however many applications don’t do that anymore and store the icon in the windows install folder. A good example of this is Adobe Reader v9.2
 the icon for this application is stored at: C:\Windows\Installer\{AC76BA86-7AD7-1033-7B44-A92000000001} If you delete this folder your PDF icon(s) will be gone and look like your screen shots. It is possible you may have deleted these folders by mistake or
 a cleaning software deleted them thinking they are just left over folders from an install. The easiest way to fix this is to access another computer with the same software copy these folders from that computer to the broken computer and reboot. If that does
 not work or you do not have access to another computer, reinstalling the applications typically fixes the problem.</p>

<strong><span>Word Icons Generic White</span></strong>

<p>No, I have no other word processors apart from the obligatory Notepad and Wordpad. But would it explain identical behaviour on four different computers, two with Win 8.1 and two with Win10?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aha!!! Got it!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Musing on what I’d just said, I tried “opening with” Wordpad and ticked “always use this program”. The icon changed to something similar but with “DOCX” written in grey at the bottom. (I’d expected to see the normal Wordpad icon.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I “opened with” Word once again, with the “always use” ticked. But I noticed that it gave me the choice of two Word programs - no obvious difference between the two. I tried the first - back again to the generic icon. So
 then I tried the second and ..... I have the Word docx icon back again!! Hurrah!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was on a Win 8.1 machine. So I turned my attention to the Win10 machine, which is the one where I could open a docx file from the hard disk but not an attachment from my favourite mail reader. This time “open with” didn’t give
 the option of choosing from two Word programs but, if I clicked on Properties, it did. Changed it and that works now, even opening from an email attachment!</p>

<p>The link to the zip file no longer works.</p>
<p>I resolved this issue by uninstalling the update for Microsoft office 2010.</p>
<p>Once uninstalled all the word and excel files instantly returned to their proper state without a reboot.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend uninstalling this update as it is a security update.<br />
<br />
I plan to install it at a later date when Microsoft has patched this&nbsp;mess.&nbsp;<br />
I have good backups and restore points.<br />
The update that is responsible for the issue is&nbsp;below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security Update for Microsoft Office 2010 (KB2920748) 64BIT Edition</p>
<p>Download size: 90 KB</p>
<p>You may need to restart your computer for this update to take effect.</p>
<p>Update type: Important</p>
<p>A security vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office 2010 64BIT Edition that could allow arbitrary code to run when a maliciously modified file is opened. This update resolves that vulnerability.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you’re the only one that actually figured this out. I’m working on a 32BIT version so I’m not sure which specific update it was (KB number did not match yours), but after pulling the updates, the client’s icons have been
 restored. Thank you for this post. </p>
