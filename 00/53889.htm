<h2>            FrontPage 2003 will not load on Windows 7 64-bit</h2>
                    I have a virtually new HP 64bit Laptop running Windows 7. <br />
<br />
I have downloaded FrontPage 2003 complete with key but it won't load. <br />
<br />
It goes through the motions of asking for:-<br />
the product key ‚Äì fine<br />
Name, company ‚Äì fine<br />
Do I agree to the terms? ‚Äì Yes, fine<br />
Which install do I want?&nbsp; - I‚Äôve tried typical, custom and complete ‚Äì fine<br />
<br />
And then it says right, ready to install. Up comes the installation box and we wait. And wait and wait‚Ä¶<br />
But it doesn‚Äôt load. I left it for 2 hours at one point with no joy.<br />
<br />
When asked to cancel, it sits and looks at me and I have to get rid using the task manager.<br />
<br />
But when I try to load again, it tells me that there‚Äôs a version already in the process of loading, so it‚Äôs reboot time.
<br />
<br />
I've scanned the machine and program for viruses, and there aren't any. <br />
<br />
I have worked with the seller and gone through the usual suspects (AVG anti-virus etc.) but no joy. Any ideas?<br />
<br />

            Hi, Got them from Digital River. Also got Adobe 8 from them, which works fine.
<br />
They've sent a version of Expression 2 as a replacement for the Frontpage 2003, which (oddly and annoyingly) works perfectly.
<br />
However, and pedictably, it's virtually unintelligible!!<br />
I used Frontpage 2000 to set up my web site (something I have change slightly about 4 times a year) and it was a walk in the park. FrontPage 2003 is much more complex but still quite logical.<br />
Expression has clearly been designed for computer geeks by computer geeks - and that ain't me. The phrase 'plug and play' is one I love to see...<br />
<br />
16th January<br />
Problem now sort of solved - discovered that SharePoint Designer 2007 is available free of charge from Microsoft and it's almost identical to FrontPage 2003. Downloaded that, it worked first time out. Job done.
<br />
Thanks for advice. <br />

<h2>            I store my music on a NAS. I added this location to my music library. The Windows 8 Music App will not show my music. Help&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I store approx. 130 gigs of music on my Synology DIskstation NAS. The music is in a single folder, available to my network. I can see, access, and play music via the file explorer.</p>
<p>In Windows 8, however, the Music App cannot seem to add the music to my library. If I manually "open a file location", I can see and play my music, but not in the app's natural state.</p>
<p>This sucks. How do I get the app to see and index my music?</p>

            I've just spent a week working on the 90 day evaluation download of Windows 8 Enterprise in which I had no issue at all with mapping the music files on my NAS - in fact, they were all indexed automatically. &nbsp;So.... now that I've bought a new laptop with
 Win 8 pre-loaded, I've tripped over the same problem as everybody else - inability to index networked drives. &nbsp;How come it works fine in 'Enterprise Edition' but not in Win 8 as shipped?
<div><br />
<div>Having read elsewhere that MS policy seems to be to push us all towards offline cloud rather than local networked storage, I can only say that
<b>this needs fixing</b> urgently. Not impressed!</div>

            <p>The problem is: You cannot connect a non-Windows-hosted NAS to a Windows 8 music-library. In my opinion Microsoft should have a better solution for this.&nbsp;A few more details are summarized in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Blog-post&nbsp;<a href="http://triggerspectrum.wordpress.com/2013/12/21/the-missing-link-connection-between-windows-8-1-and-nas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"The

    <title>Driver Software Installation window opens on second monitor in an dual - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laurenËõiu roman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Driver Software Installation window opens on second monitor in an dual monitor extended monitor setup</h2>
                    The "Driver Software Installation" window opens on second monitor in an dual monitor extended monitor setup<br />
<br />
I have a dual display setup. An LG 225WS 1680x1050 monitor connected throught a VGA cable and a VGA-DVI converter to a DVI port on a Radeon 6850 video card. The second display is a Samsung HDTV set at 1920x1080 and connected through HDMI to the same video card.
 I have set up the LCD monitor as the primary monitor and the Samsung HDTV as the extended display. The HDTV is off most of the time but i do use it at least once a day. This is not a driver problem because it also happend when i had an old Nvidia video card
 and it doesn't get fixed by a fresh install of windows and setting up displays from square one.<br />
<br />
The setup works great almost all of the time except when i try to use a few particular programs or Windows (7) functions. When i try to startup the MozBackup application or i pop in a new usb device and click the notification bubble, both those windows (MozBackup
 and the "Driver Sofware Installation" window) open in the center of the HDTV as opposed to the LCD monitor (which is set as primary). The problem is that the displays are ~3 meters apart and the HDTV is mostly off.<br />
<br />
I have sent a bug report to the MozBackup developer because that part is maybe an issue with his software or what old Windows functions and hooks it uses, but the "Driver Sofware Installation" window (or who knows what other core Windows program) has the exact
 same problem and is part of Windows.<br />
<br />
What can i do to fix it? I WILL NOT set the displays in any kind of "clone mode" to have the desktop mirrored between them. Is it fixable in any way? I assume that it is not a problem with the video card drivers because i have used two different video cards
 with either the manufacturer's or windows update drivers and the problem is the same.<br />
<br />
I'm talking about a window similar to this one<br />

<h2>            How do I download Netflix App Without Xbox LIVE&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Pursuant to the news that I could begin using NetFlix and other apps without having to pay for an Xbox LIVE account as a prerequisite, I cancelled my Xbox LIVE subscription.</p>
<p><br />
Today I tried using NetFlix for the first time since the update, and it would not work (nw-1-19 error). I went to NetFlix support, and it advised that I delete the app and redownload it.</p>
<p><br />
But since I do not have an Xbox LIVE account anymore, I cannot browse the app store. And since I cannot browse the app store, I cannot redownload NetFlix.</p>
<p>I attempted to use the "redownload" option via the Xbox website, to add NetFlix to my download queue, but doing so is not an option.</p>
<p>I must be missing something; they wouldn't tell us "you can use apps without a Xbox LIVE account" but make it impossible to download said apps, right?</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Nitinpreams,
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Event ID 6008 entries indicate that there was an unexpected shutdown.</span></p>
<p><span>Critical thermal event indicates that the problem is related to one of your hardware components not functioning properly that is triggering
 the computer to shut down.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if your CPU is overheating. Also c</span><span>heck if the heat sink
 or fan is functioning properly. If the laptop is under warranty, get in touch with the manufacturer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it isn‚Äôt,
<span>get a good cleaning done for the fan and heat sink with compressed air only if you‚Äôre comfortable.</span>
<span>Otherwise seek the help of a technician. </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, since power supply plays a major role in cooling the computer‚Äôs innards check if PSU (Power Supply Unit) is functioning properly.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Other thermal events (depending on your board) can be from the graphics card, bridge chipsets or hard drives.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may opt to check for third party
</span><span>Thermal Event Monitor software so that you have a brief idea as in what‚Äôs triggering the critical thermal event.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</span></p>

 ran sigcheck against both drivers and confirmed that they are signed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a work around, I use F8 and boot with driver signing verification turned off but that is certainly not ideal as I have to remember to do so every time the computer is restarted. Anyone have suggestions for a permanent fix?</p>

</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>Boot into Advanced Boot Options and disable driver signing checking</span></p>
<p><span>The Advanced Boot Options screen lets you start Windows in advanced troubleshooting modes.<br />
Restart your computer. As soon as the booting process starts you will hear a beep sound, start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. Instead of Windows loading as normal, Windows Advanced Options will appear.</span></p>
<p><span>Select this Disabling driver signature enforcement and check with the issue. This allows drivers containing improper signatures to be installed.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 8 permissions nightmare. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wraithtdk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 permissions nightmare.</h2>
                    I have two hard drives in my desktop. One for Windows and my programs, and one for data. Today, I had a problem moving a file in my music folder, so started editing permissions on folders. I keep getting the following error when trying to take control
 of my folders:
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>An error occurred while applying security information to</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>D:\&lt;directory&gt;\&lt;Directory&gt;</i></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>Failed to enumerate objects in the container. Access is denied.</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div>It's driving me nuts. I've always been able to get around file access errors by changing security permissions. What the heck do you do when you don't have permissions to change permissions?!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>P.S., before anyone suggests the "download unlocker and move the file/folder" suggestion, that doesn't really work with your entire user directory, containing your Desktop/Documents/Music folders and all 1TB+ data inside them.</div>

<h2>            How to Move Free Space from one Partition to Another&#63;</h2>
                    what i first got this computer (Dell, Windows 7) i had two &nbsp;i had two partitions, a C drive which had 50 GB and a D drive which had the rest of my 500 GB (around 397). now my c drive it filled up and i cant get it any of the files to move over to move
 over to the D drive so it is like i have no space left on my computer. i tried to shrink the amount of GB that were in the D drive but it didn't let me extend the C fill. and i cant just delete the D drive&nbsp;eather&nbsp;because i have files on there that i had to
 move over. is there a simple why that i can shrink the D drive and extend the C drive?

            Another option would be to leave the partitions as they were and redirect your Documents, Pictures etc to the larger partition (I think this is what you&nbsp; were trying to do before you tried to change the partitions) as described in the following link:&nbsp;

            Hello JosephManski,
<br />
<br />I am sorry to hear you are having problems updating your machine.  Based on the error you provided, here is a resource I found with a few options to stop the error and allow the download to continue:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update-winpc/error-0x80004005-window-10-update-failure/156adfb8-e7e1-46fa-b5c6-cbd5dcfebbb9">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Please let me know if that does not help and we'll continue to work on your issue.
<br />
<br />Have a great day,

            The forum filter removed the error code and the build number.
<br />Try resetting Windows 10 updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

            Several users are reporting this issue as well.
<br />
<br />Make sure you disconnect any non-essential devices attached to your computer and also remove any SD card. 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select ‚ÄúCommand Prompt (Admin)‚Äù from the menu.
<br />
<br />2. Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the ‚ÄúENTER‚Äù key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver
<br />
<br />3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the ‚ÄúENTER‚Äù key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />
<br />4. Now, let‚Äôs restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Typethe following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                        net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />                        net start cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                        net start bits
<br />
<br />                        net start msiserver
<br />
<br />5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it and then restart the computer. 
<br />
<br />If you need more help, please continue to engage with us. We want to help you through this.

            HI JosephMaksi,
<br />
<br />I am glad it worked and the error is no longer happening.  Can you try to update the machine again - by going back through the updates.  Now that you have stopped the services and restarted them, you should be able to update with no problem.
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps at all.
<br />
<br />I look forward to speaking with you,
<br />
<br />Danielle

            Ok.  So I did some research on the 17063 build specifically to see what the known issues are with it.  
<br />
<br />I found this resource that walks through updating to the 17063 build. 
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/new-update-build-of-windows-10-technical-preview-now-available-for-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/new-update-build-of-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have it downloaded again - before you power off the PC, I saw some recommendations to make sure that wifi was off and automatic updates were not turned on.  This was based on other builds that had the rollback issue.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helps at all!

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I connect my laptop to our wireless network&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello! This is my problem: I cannot connect to the internet through wireless but I CAN connect via Ethernet.</p>
<p>Though the 2wire connection shows on the list of available networks with full signal, it wont connect via wifi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a problem before I switched to Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ASUS laptop model# Q551L</p>
<p>I've tried resetting my WiFi by unplugging the power and letting it sit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rest of my family can connect their laptops to the router wirelessly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an AT&amp;T 2wire router.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be happening?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. &nbsp;I think "wirelessly" should be acknowledged as a word. :)</p>

            Check your antivirus software
<br />
<br />In your antivirus app, look for settings related to blocking access or permission to use your webcam. For help, visit your antivirus software company‚Äôs website.
<br />Check for an outdated webcam driver
<br />
<br />    Select the Start button, type Device Manager, and then select Device Manager from the search results.
<br />    Find your webcam under Imaging devices or Sound, video and game controllers.
<br />    Press and hold (or right-click) the name of your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select the Driver Details button, and look for a file name that includes stream.sys. If it‚Äôs there, your webcam was designed before Windows 7 and you'll have to replace it with a newer webcam.
<br />    If you don't find a file name that includes stream.sys, try rolling back your webcam driver.
<br />
<br />Roll back your webcam driver
<br />
<br />    In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select Roll Back Driver, and then choose Yes. (Note that some drivers don‚Äôt provide a rollback option.)
<br />    After the rollback is complete, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
<br />    If rolling back didn‚Äôt work or isn‚Äôt available, uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes. 
<br />
<br />Uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes
<br />
<br />    In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select Uninstall &gt; Delete the driver software for this device, and then select OK.
<br />    In Device Manager, on the Action menu, select Scan for hardware changes. Wait for it to scan and reinstall updated drivers, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
<br />    If your webcam still doesn‚Äôt work, try looking for help on the webcam manufacturer‚Äôs website.

    <title>Why unable to assign drive letter to ZIP drive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> okieseeker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why unable to assign drive letter to ZIP drive&#63;</h2>
                    I'm working with an older Dell computer running WinXP SP3. The tower has a built-in ZIP 100 drive connected on the inside with the flat cable I believe called ATAPI/IDE (wide&amp;flat w/red wire near the power plug). To my knowledge, this ZIP drive has not
 been used since the computer was purchased. However, I have a bunch of data on ZIP 100 disks that I need to retrieve and move to CD or DVD.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I noticed that the ZIP drive "working" light turns on when a disk is inserted, and I hear the drive spin up. But Windows can't see it. I looked for any Iomega drivers or software but they were not installed. So I checked the Iomega site, which says XP
 supports ZIP 100, and downloaded/installed the latest drivers/software. Rebooted. Still can't see the ZIP drive. "Add Hardware" didn't work. So I walked through the Iomega troubleshooting support page for this exact problem. Things like making sure there are
 only two devices on the cable, that the drive is getting power, that the jumpers are set correctly, check the BIOS settings, try to find the drive in the Device Manager, etc. No luck. Any tips?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Check if the device is listed in Device manager:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Click <b>Start</b>, click <b>Control Panel</b>, click <b>Performance and Maintenance</b>, and then click
<b>System</b>.</p>
<p>b. On the <b>Hardware</b> tab, click <b>Device Manager</b>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Step 2: Check drive management.</strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Click <b>Start</b>, click <b>Run</b>, type <span>compmgmt.msc</span>, and then click
<b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>b. In the console tree, click <b>Disk Management</b>. The Disk Management window appears. Your disks and volumes appear in a graphical view and list view. To customize how you view your disks and volumes in the upper and lower panes of the window, point
 to <b>Top</b> or <b>Bottom</b> on the <b>View</b> menu, and then click the view that you want to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If it doesn‚Äôt show up in either location, the drive could be bad.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please post back if you are facing any further issues in Windows.</span></p>
        </p>

            I'll try that tonight after I get home from work. One thing I remember about looking for it inside the Device Manager is that I was looking for something with a name like either "Iomega" or "ZIP." &nbsp; Do you know if this type of drive my show up under a
 different type of name?
<div><br />
<div>And, the drive management approach I didn't know about. I appreciate that tip and am curious to see results.</div>

            So far no luck with any of this. As for the drive going bad, turns out this is a one-owner PC who bought it 10 years ago with the ZIP drive already installed but
<b>never used it</b>. As I said before, it seems to respond normally when a disk is inserted, the drive spins up and the activity light goes on. But it's still not on speaking terms with Windows XP. What are the odds that some crucial internal circuit might
 just die during the past 10 years despite lack of use?<br />
<br />
Tried some other tips found on the Web, like tinkering with port/printer settings in Device Manager, and disconnecting the printer while trying to use the ZIP. No change.Also, the disks are formatted for Mac, but even at that I should be able to see the drive.
 Tried some software that lets Windows handle Mac files, no luck there.<br />
<br />
I did notice two unexplained oddities in the IDE ATA/ATAPI Controllers, as shown in the gif file at the following link
<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/view/?rudcyxpqk8r7tu3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/view/?rudcyxpqk8r7tu3</a><br />
<br />
Unless someone has another suggestion, the only thing I can think of is to put the drive in another PC and see if it behave differently?<br />

            <p>Hello okieseeker, <br />
<br />
In Device manager on your computer, when your right click on the ??IDE?? entry, what does it show?<br />
Does it give an error message or error code?<br />
Does it show drivers are installed and working?<br />
Same thing for the Primary IDE channel? What is the error message when your right click on it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Were you able to see if the drive is being seen in another computer?<br />
Does it show up in Device manager on the other computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide an update when you get a chance. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />
Marilyn <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

            When I right click either of these entries with the red X, there is no error message I've been able to locate. What I do see in the General tab is that both are marked "Device is disabled (Code 22)" and a drop-down selector has been set at "Do not use
 this device" Drivers seem to be fine.
<div><br />
<div>No time yet to test the drive elsewhere.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Seems especially odd for the Primary IDE Channel. But we haven't noticed the PC having any problems utilizing the C drive until I ran the TreeSize Free utility that checks to see which files are occupying how much space. When I right clicked the C drive
 I got a dialog box I've never seen before: "Windows - No Disk" followed by some technical gibberish. But when I clicked Continue button, the utility ran normally.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sorry about the holiday reply delay. I hope someone is still paying attention to this thread.</div>

            Without any reply here, I decided to stab in the dark. I enabled the entry in Device Manager that just said "?? IDE ??" and then rebooted. Now the ZIP 250 drive I've been trying to access is visible in both Device Manager and Windows Explorer.
<div><br />
<div>When I insert a ZIP disk, the drive spins up and clicks a few times as it accepts the disk. Windows AutoPlay briefly tries to launch but then that activity box automatically closes. I know the disk is Mac-formatted with Mac files, but I have MacDrive installed,
 which has worked every time on another XP box I have.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I double-click the icon for the ZIP drive, Windows gives me a message saying I need to insert a disk. There's already one there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, progress, but still can't get to my data.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You mentioned zip100 initially then 250 later, are the disks 100mb and the drive a 250?</span></p>
<p><span>If that‚Äôs the case, that might be a problem. If you have 250mb disks you can test with, that may be helpful in testing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Even if it wasn‚Äôt formatted in a way that Windows could read it, the disk should still be detected. It could be the drive itself, the disk as mentioned above or possibly driver. At this point I would lean towards the drive or disks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Post back with the result.</span></p>

            <p>Deleting the ini file can't cause icons to disappear, or cause any problems with your wallpaper.&nbsp; Whatever problems you have, they aren't related to the desktop.ini file I assure you.&nbsp; That file is not responsible for showing other icons or your wallpaper
 picture.</p>
