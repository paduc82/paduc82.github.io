<h2>            Windows 10 Technical Preview Install from USB stick.</h2>
                    <p>When I went to install Windows 10 Technical Preview I had to do it via a USB stick, On my first attempt I used the windows 7 USB tool to create a bootable USB stick &amp; no matter what I tried I couldn't get it to boot from the USB stick. On my second attempt
 I used a program called "Rufus" to create a bootable USB stick &amp; had the same scenario as my first attempt.</p>
<p>After a bit of research, someone suggested using "WinRAR" to extract the files from the ISO file to the USB stick to create a bootable USB stick, end result was still not able to get it to boot from the USB stick, no matter what I tried.</p>
<p>By this time I was getting frustrated with it, but with&nbsp;perseverance &amp; a bit more research I found the cure, what the problem was with creating&nbsp;a bootable USB&nbsp;using the windows 7 USB tool&nbsp;or Rufus&nbsp;was that these two programs created the bootable USB stick
 using NTFS file system &amp; for some unknown reason my PC wouldn't recognise the USB stick.</p>
<p>The cure was to format the USB stick using the FAT32 file system &amp;&nbsp;then using "WinRAR" to extract the file from the ISO to the USB stick, once that was done &amp; upon restarting the PC &amp; selecting change boot order to boot from USB it worked like a charm &amp;
 bingo I was able to install Windows 10 Technical Preview with no problems at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this is of help to anyone who has trouble getting their PC to boot from a USB to install Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. I did a clean install rather than an upgrade.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have exactly the same problem- the 'Options' button is greyed out on every workbook I have with Power View.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My colleagues are also unable to open&nbsp;these Power View sheets and I can't change the trust settings because the 'options' button is greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advise greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Using a variable string to reference a sheet&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamstewart3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using a variable string to reference a sheet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have three, possibly four, sheets of data that i'm consolidating into a single report using the vlookup function.</p>
<p>I'm making this so that an account clerk only has to enter in the data set and the account number in her report to call up the correct value.</p>
<p>I've got a variable in the vlookup so that the column number in the data set can also be set by the clerk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=VLOOKUP($A18,Qbx!$A$3:$D$136,E$5,FALSE)</p>
<p>$A18 provides the account number that the vlookup search will use.</p>
<p>Qbx! is the sheet of the workbook on which this data set resides</p>
<p>$A$3:$D136 is the array on the QBx sheet</p>
<p>E$5 provides the column number from which the vlookup will return the value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like the clerk to be able to enter the name of one of several data sets, each one on a sheet, to drive the vlookup. I cannot figure out the syntax for it. I've tried naming the data sets and that doesn't seem to work.</p>
<p>I would like, for example, for her to be able to enter the name of the sheet, QBx, into cell B17 so the formula might look something like this:</p>
<p>=VLOOKUP($A18,&amp;B17,$A$3:$D$136,E$5,FALSE)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>Would it be possible using the Name utility or some other way to let the operator name the page in a vlookup?</p>
<p>Thanks for your assistance&nbsp;</p>

            The INDIRECT function should do that for you. 
<br />
<br />Here’s some info on it:
<br />

            You will need to use INDIRECT block.
<br />
<br />I am showing you the right way to do this on the basis of your post
<br />
<br />=VLOOKUP($A18,INDIRECT($B17&amp;"!$A$3:$D$136"),E$5,FALSE)
<br />
<br />This assumes that your sheet name has no blanks. If sheet name has blanks then (The below formula would work even for sheet name without blank)
<br />
<br />=VLOOKUP($A18,INDIRECT("'"&amp;$B17&amp;"'!$A$3:$D$136"),E$5,FALSE)
<br />
<br />Suppose you have your range also in some cell. Let's assume even A3:D136 is in a cell, let's say B18
<br />
<br />=VLOOKUP($A18,INDIRECT("'"&amp;$B17&amp;"'!"&amp;$B$18),E$5,FALSE)
<br />
<br />Hence, you need to construct your INDIRECT block appropriately.

    <title>Excel Shockwave Flash ocx - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ftsc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Shockwave Flash ocx</h2>
                    Does Excel 2013 or 2016 have the shockwave flash activeX object as a default in the references? If not, how does it get installed? When Adobe Flash Player gets installed? I just installed Flash Player on a new computer&nbsp;with Excel 2013 and the Flash.ocx
 did not get installed into the windows\system32\macromed\flash folder?<br />
<br />
I have a workbook that needs the shockwave flash object and if the computer that runs this workbook does not have it, on startup the workbook errors with a compiler error and halts the loading of the workbook. With VBA code how can I check to see if that activeX
 is selected and if not how to continue with the loading of the workbook, and or code to prompt the user to install it when the workbook makes calls to it?

 that I need my workbook to run on. If it is not installed I need a work around code that will trap that error (of not finding flash.ocx or, missing reference error) and continue with the loading of all macros in the workbook.</span>

            Let me clarify. I created a user form with a shockwave flash object. The Excel I was using allowed me to do this because I added the reference to the shockwave library. I removed the reference to the shockwave library and it works fine on the computer
 that I created the workbook on. Now when I pass this workbook to other Excel users they get the message "cannot load an object because it is not available on this machine." What I would prefer to do is,&nbsp;if the user tries to load the form with that object,
 is to test first to see if that form could load without error or, cannot load with error, and if it cannot load&nbsp;display a message before the form opens and exit the sub.

<h2>            Rendering Issues in 15042 and 15046</h2>
                    <div>
<p>In both 15042 and 15046 installed in a Hyper-V VM I see rendering issues in 3 apps I've found so far.&nbsp; Two of these (Recipe Keeper Pro and NextGen Reader UWP) when displaying some types of list with elements containing both image and text does not display
 the text part of the list element.&nbsp; Clicking and holding the mouse on an element does cause it to display correctly.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Also HO AiO Printer Remote fails to draw some of its components making the app unusable.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Never seen anything like this on any previous Insider build - right back to October 2014.&nbsp; Either something amiss with some display Controls, or something amiss on my Insider installation.&nbsp; Anyone seen this?</div>
                </div>

<p>hi ruben,</p>
<p>for your questions:<br />
<em>1. is it possible to share files with an external user&nbsp; (outside the company) from a group?</em><br />
no, it’s not feasible to share files with an external user from a group. we can only share files with the people in the same organization.</p>
<p><em>2. is it possible to add an external user as a member to a group?</em><br />
we can add an external user whose profile has already been listed in sharepoint online(an external user we share with and he accessed the file successfully) as a member to a group. however, it’s not feasible to add a new external user who has not been shared
 with to a group.</p>

                    <p>I install W10 on a clean drive with no other drives attached.</p>
<p>I then boot to W10 with My W7 drive attached.</p>
<p>I then disconnect my W10 drive and boot to W7.</p>
<p>Before it can boot it must run chkdsk because the drive is inconsistent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY??????????</p>
<p>
</p><p>It did it on W8 also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I guess there is something different about the format b/c I just booted to W7 with the W10 disk attached and it is running chkdsk on the W10 drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>can't that be fixed??</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>As per the query, you have issues with regards to installing Windows 7 and Windows 10 Insider technical preview in Dual boot configuration.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to always install the lowest version of Windows first and then install the highest version in order to correctly load the order of the boot files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may first install Windows 7 and then create a new partition to install Windows 10 Insider technical preview.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you install Windows 10 and then try installing Windows 7, you may not get the option to Dual boot so I would suggest you to install Windows 7 and then Windows 10.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Rug,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the query, you have issues with regards to installing Windows 7 and Windows 10 Insider technical preview in Dual boot configuration.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to always install the lowest version of Windows first and then install the highest version in order to correctly load the order of the boot files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may first install Windows 7 and then create a new partition to install Windows 10 Insider technical preview.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you install Windows 10 and then try installing Windows 7, you may not get the option to Dual boot so I would suggest you to install Windows 7 and then Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps, please get back to us with the relevant information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank You</span></p>

<p>Can u explain to me how u read DUAL BOOT from my question??????????</p>
<p>Or maybe it is a typical technical support response - u read what u can answer not what it written.</p>

<p>Hi raghu2106,<br />
<br />
Welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions!<br />
<br />
What's the model of your Bluetooth headset? This is for us to check if the headset is compatible with the Lumia 920. In the event that you are using a third party accessory, I would suggest checking with the manufacturer to confirm it. For your reference, you
 can check this link for the supported Bluetooth profiles of the Lumia 920:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.developer.nokia.com/Devices/Device_specifications/Lumia_920/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.developer.nokia.com/Devices/Device_specifications/Lumia_920/</a><br />
<br />
Initially, you can try to clear the paring history of your devices. Once cleared, try to pair them again. If the issue remains, you can try to reboot the phone and reset the headset. Please refer to the user guide of each device for your guidance.<br />
<br />

<p>I had similar problems with my car Bluetooth. I'd recommend trying to update the software on the device. My Lumia 920 wouldn't work with my car. The update was iPhone focused, but that was what the issue was.</p>

<p>But, the point here is, I am not able to listen via Bluetooth not only in Nokia Music, But also in any Music Applications that are available in Market Store.&nbsp; It looks it is an OS issue, rather than Nokia Music issue.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I suggest, if you could help me with any application, similar to BTMONO in Android OS, that allows/enables to listen music via Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
Please note that, I see no issue in using the Bluetooth for attending calls both mobile calls as well as Skype Calls.</p>

<p>Inablility to listen to music via Bluetooth,&nbsp; is extended to Youtube videos, or for that matter any Videos in Nokia Lumia 720. So it is confirmed that it is an OS issue, &amp; not specific to any Application.</p>

            Microsoft / Nokia need to work together on creating a workaround, to play audio &amp; video recordings in MONO format too, apart from Stereo output of Bluetooth.

<p><span>That doesn't help me.<br />
<br />
My point is, if this same Samsung Mono Bluetooth model HM1100 can work on all Android OS phones, using a third party application called BTMONO ( by BEDOIG), then MICROSOFT / NOKIA should also try to develop similar application to support music / videos using
 MONO Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
<span>In ANDROID OS, not only BTMONO, there are loads and tons of third party applications now, that supports streaming music for MONO Bluetooth without A2DP profile.<br />
ANDROID Phones are great, when compared to Windows Phone.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If that is not possible, please suggest me a good Bluetooth model that is of same size as of Samsun<span>g HM1100, with NO WIRES, &amp; able
 to listen to music in one ear. If you answer this, then I would consider that only part of my problem is resolved for my Nokia Lumia 720.

Bluetooth music can be played nativity to stereo&nbsp;headsets supporting the A2DP bluetooth profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it takes an app to play music to a mono bluetooth headset with android I suggest you contact the developer of Btmono to develop an app for Windows Phone. No dodge of the issue. An app is required, android or WP.</p>

<h2>            Applying different margins to different pages</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong><span>Hi! I'm using Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac and I'm helping someone format a book.<br />
<br />
The final document has to be one long Word document, but the first page of each chapter has to have a top margin of 2 inches, while subsequent pages of the same chapter have to have a 1 inch top margin. There are multiple chapters, so this has to happen multiple
 times in the document.<br />
<br />
Right now the best solution I've come up with is to apply the 2-inch margin to the first page of the chapter and place a section break w/ new formatting exactly at the point in the text where it moves onto the second page, but this means the margins get messed
 up any time I shorten or lengthen the content in the first page and the chapter gets split into 2 sections. Does anyone know a better way to do this?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Hi! I'm using Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac and I'm helping someone format a book.<br />
<br />
The final document has to be one long Word document, but the first page of each chapter has to have a top margin of 2 inches, while subsequent pages of the same chapter have to have a 1 inch top margin. There are multiple chapters, so this has to happen multiple
 times in the document.<br />
<br />
Right now the best solution I've come up with is to apply the 2-inch margin to the first page of the chapter and place a section break w/ new formatting exactly at the point in the text where it moves onto the second page, but this means the margins get messed
 up any time I shorten or lengthen the content in the first page and the chapter gets split into 2 sections. Does anyone know a better way to do this?</span></p>

<h3> pb40  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Outlook 2016 problem with tiscali and lineone email accounts</h2>
                    <p>I have a tiscali email account which works OK using webmail and Android phone.</p>
<p>However, on two different Windows 10 computers, Outlook 2016 logs this tiscali account into a lineone account of mine instead and does not get any of the correct tiscali emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should not be possible to confuse &lt;name&gt;@tiscali.co.uk with &lt;name&gt;@lineone.net but it is happening; the IMAP mail servers for both accounts are imap.tiscali.co.uk incoming and smtp.tiscali.co.uk outgoing, so the only difference between the accounts is
 the part after @ in the two email addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TalkTalk whose mail servers carry these email accounts were unable to help as this appears to be specifically an Outlook 2016 issue.</p>
<p>I was using an older version of Outlook before which worked OK.</p>
<p>I have tried all the obvious tests, such as confirming the settings are configured correctly; deleting and recreating the accounts in Outlook; using a different Outlook profile, etc. but nothing has solved the problem.</p>
<p>
So can someone help me to get this tiscali account to work as it should in Outlook 2016 please?<br /></p>

<h2>            One Note - Filing Cabinet</h2>
                    Is there a way to create a filing cabinet? intent is to keep work and personal notebooks separate. Cumbersome in that I have multiple notebooks and one note, in my admittedly limited use, appears to&nbsp;lack this hierarchical functionality. Basically looking
 for under the File drop down adding an open cabinet function and the notebook contents in that cabinet would be available.

<p>It offers to contact to an administrator, and then it says that my admin had been notified, but nothing happens.</p>

<h2>            DSOfile.dll doesn&#39;t work on windows server 2008 R2 64 bit for office 2k7 documents</h2>
                    
<p>I was using dsofile.dll to extract document properties from office docs. This worked fine on windows server 2k3 (32 bit).</p>
<p>On upgrading to windows server 2008 R2 64 bit although its working fine for office 2k3 docs but its not working for office 2k7 docs (properties are returned as undef).</p>
<p>Office version on the machine was 2003, then I installed compatibility pack for office 2k7 and it still didn't help.</p>
<p>I then upgraded my mahcine to office 2007 and still the same issue persists. Anyone having any idea on this?</p>

            <p>Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your reply. Sorry for not getting back to you sooner. I've only just signed up and asked the question&nbsp;and I am surprised that I didn't get an email notification to say that someone has posted a reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding my original question. As I'm very new to VBA, I'm keen to put together a solution without using add-in. That way, it would hopefully help me learn more.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent my last weekend working on the project and I have been making good progress. There are still a couple of things I need to find out how to do but I'm confident that I will be able to get to the bottom of it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's good to know that I have your add-in to fall back on though ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for taking your time answering my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Ownership Verification Scam&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I would like to share this with everyone so that maybe others won't fall into this scam. I work for a small company and a software developer/IT and a coworker responded to this email on the link. Luckily I caught it fast enough like in 30 min or so and reset
 the password on said email. Hopefully this can help someone else identify this scam. Always remember they won't ask for credentials they already have them and for fraudulent names like "Microsoft Data" with no contact information and a funky link that don't
 go to&nbsp; a Microsoft website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already submitted a scam report to Microsoft</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this saves some people. Cheers!</p>

<p>How are you connected to the internet?&nbsp; Is it through a Proxy Server of some kind?</p>
<p>SGOS = security gateway operating system<br />
Usually refering to a server or router or proxy server utilizing the SGOS. It can also be used in pop up blockers and instant messaging blockers using a vpn tunnel between diferent IP adresses. Look for any of the software&nbsp;blockers and either update them to
 get new permissions or remove them.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
