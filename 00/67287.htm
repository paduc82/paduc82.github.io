                    <p>This is a new asus windows 8 laptop I just bought. I'm stressed out because it happened when I'm connected to my home wifi, which means I cannot connect to internet at my own home at all. &nbsp;I've met the technicians few times, but they dont have the solution
 as well! &nbsp;:(((</p>

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade fails &#34;Cannot access system reserved - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rbdjm01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade fails &#34;Cannot access system reserved partition&#34; on cloned SSD using Samsung Data Migration</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed new Samsung SSD's in several systems. I used the Samsung Data Migration tool (version 2.7) to move from my old HDD to the new SSD on 3 systems.Things worked fine, system has worked great for months. Windows 8.1 (Before and after migration)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to install the Windows 10 upgrade this weekend. It downloaded, then started the install process of checking my system. It stopped there and said Windows 10 cannot run on this system, "Cannot access system reserved partition".</p>
<p>After researching this problem, I checked the&nbsp;System Reserved partition and it was no longer named "System Reserved", the Samsung Data Migration software renamed the partition to "Data" when it did the migration. I confirmed this by checking the original
 HDD it was migrated from. This occurred on all 3 systems I used the Samsung Data Migration software on to install the SSD's.</p>
<p>I tried renaming the partition and it did not solve the problem. I eventually reinstalled Windows 8, did all the updates, including 8.1, and then Windows 10 installed without a problem. The "System Reserved" partition was 100MB with 58MB free, only difference
 was the name of the partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the Windows 10 update on a system that still had the "System Reserved" partition (100MB by the way) and it loaded fine. So I am assuming the problem is that Windows 10 could not identify the "System Reserved" partition because it was renamed
 to "Data". Is this likely? If so, does anyone know any other solution?</p>
<p>I still have 2 systems to upgrade and I do not want to reinstall Windows 8 again on each one, very time consuming. And I am sure many other people who used the Samsung Data Migration software will have this problem.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to perform a clean boot on your Windows 8 computer before installing Windows 10 on the system and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to</span></span><span><span>start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer
 to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that you have enough space before installing Windows 10 on the system.</span></span></p>

            <p>Sorry, I did not really think&nbsp;your suggestion was&nbsp;going to work&nbsp;because it had nothing to do with the drivers or conflicts, it was a problem with the System&nbsp;Reserved partition. And I was right, your recommendation had not effect and returned the same error.</p>
<p>I did however use&nbsp;EaseUS partition manager to rename the system reserved partition from "Data" to "System Reserved" and Windows 10 loaded without a problem and is running fine. Someone needs to let Samsung know their migration software is making it difficult
 to do upgrades. I found it also terminated my ability to do a restore.</p>
<p>So, I resolved it myself, all is good now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway</p>

            <p>I followed the exact same path, installing&nbsp;Samsung ssd's on 2 systems running 8.1 several weeks ago.&nbsp; Then when updating the ssd's to&nbsp;Windows 10, the&nbsp;upgrades failed in the same way, with the same error, "Can not access system reserved partition."&nbsp; At this
 point I removed the ssd's and replaced the traditional drives, updated 8.1&nbsp;with the&nbsp;latest updates, and then installed Windows 10 with no problems on the old drives.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With 10 running fine on the old drives, I then tried to use Samsung Data Migration software to again&nbsp;clone the ssd's, but the Samsung software, now running on Windows 10,&nbsp;would not&nbsp;recognize the ssd drives.&nbsp; (This was true even after I used the Samsung software
 to create the bootable DOS&nbsp;cd, and run through the process of restoring the ssd to original factory shipped status.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to use EaseUS free software to clone one of the disks, where I was copying a 1TB traditional drive to a 1TB ssd drive.&nbsp; But the EaseUS software failed on the second system, where I was trying to clone a 750GB traditional drive to a 500GB ssd drive.&nbsp;
 This was true even after I modified the partitions so that there was slightly more than 250GB unallocated space on the end of the&nbsp;750GB drive.&nbsp; So, still looking for a fix for the second system.</p>

<p>Sorry, I did not really think&nbsp;your suggestion was&nbsp;going to work&nbsp;because it had nothing to do with the drivers or conflicts, it was a problem with the System&nbsp;Reserved partition. And I was right, your recommendation had not effect and returned the same error.</p>
<p>I did however use&nbsp;EaseUS partition manager to rename the system reserved partition from "Data" to "System Reserved" and Windows 10 loaded without a problem and is running fine. Someone needs to let Samsung know their migration software is making it difficult
 to do upgrades. I found it also terminated my ability to do a restore.</p>
<p>So, I resolved it myself, all is good now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway</p>

    <title>Is there a solution yet to extend the Xbox one wireless controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mfranch87  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a solution yet to extend the Xbox one wireless controller range yet&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have an xbox one in the living room. on the direct opposite wall is the bedroom &amp; its HDTV.&nbsp; I was able to run a HDMI cable from the living room based xbox one to my bedroom HDTV. It initially worked great, but when I then brought a wireless controller
 in as well, that wouldn't fully work properly and would constantly disconnect. Basically unplayable.&nbsp; I have EASILY done the same thing with my PS4 and absolutely no problems. I can easily play the PS4 in the living room or adjacent bedroom.</p>
<p>After some research, I learned others are having this issue &amp; its a common problem. People also seem to be clamoring for a solution from Microsoft. As of now, the ONLY solution I have been able come up with is to run a 25ft USB extension cable to then basically
 make the controller wired. Is this STILL the only way to do this or is there possibly another "wireless" solution to get an xbox one wireless controller to work in a different (but close) room? This seems ridiculous that Microsoft has done it this way and
 its such backward thinking. </p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>MiffedJoker46,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you're running into an issue with range due to the wireless on the controller, then there is likely nothing you can do currently to fix that (other than the USB cable). You can try following<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 these steps</a> to update the controller, which does fix some disconnection errors, but again probably will not resolve your range issues. Microsoft did listen to the customers about this, and designed a new controller with better range due to Bluetooth, but
 the solutions would require purchasing an Xbox One S which isn't out till August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to stop Cortana using Edge&#47;Bing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wondering if anyone has a work around for Cortana forcing me to use Bing/Edge?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Preferred browser is Chrome/Google but the option of setting my default browser no longer works. I've disabled all of Cortanas suggestions and I've tried installing chrome extensions to get around this... still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>KB</p>

            Microsoft made Microsoft Edge and Bing as the default browser and default search engine for Cortana. It's best to send a feedback to Microsoft about your Cortana concern to be able to get a solution for your concern in the future updates.<br />

</p><p>But no luck here, it does nothing, and I have found that Windows Store and XBOX Live App also not working, launching app does nothing and nothing about it inside Event Log. Probably I have to do Roll Back to previous version.

<p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>It does indeed sound that you could have corrupted Operating System files.<br />
If possible, do a roll back to a previous version to see if it helps.</p>

<h3> jangraham-mcmillen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 requiring installation of a new driver for Canon Pixma MP830 that does not exist.</h2>
                    <p>Windows Update keeps trying to install a new driver for Canon Pixma MP830 with failure and error ("â€¢ Canon driver update for Canon Inkjet MP830 Series - Error 0x80070012".</p>
<p>The Canon site says that the printer is compatible with 7 and 8.1 but will not be issuing a driver for Windows 10. &nbsp;See their notice here:</p>
<p>http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/printers_multifunction/pixma_mp_series/pixma_mp830#DriversAndSoftware</p>
<p>
</p><p>At what point will Windows stop all attempts to install something that doesn't exist ?</p>
<p>Can I do anything to stop this attempted installation?</p>

            <p><span>Hi JanGraham,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to tell you that this issue might be occurring because of some software conflict or any corruption in system/program files. Letâ€™s try to follow below mentioned steps and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try to run the Windows update troubleshooter, it will detect and resolve the most common issues with the Windows updates. To do so, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press â€œ<strong><span>Windows + X</span></strong>â€, open
<strong><span>Control Pane</span></strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In view all control panel items, open <strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on <strong><span>view all</span></strong> in the left pane</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Run <strong><span>Windows Update</span></strong> troubleshooter</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Try method 2, if the issue persist</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> <strong><span>Clean Boot</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more, follow
 the article below:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>The same steps can be followed for Windows 10 operating system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section â€˜<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>â€™.</span></em></p>
<p><span>Check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope the issue will be resolved. Please keep us posted on the issue. We will be happy to assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>What's the point of repeating the steps above that don't work if Canon is not issuing a driver for Windows 10? &nbsp;Going through all the troubleshooting again is pointless unless there is an updated driver to be installed. &nbsp;I've tried all the troubleshooting
 instructions and that led me to check with Canon. &nbsp;NO UPDATE EXISTS ! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Shall I just go on checking on "updates cannot be installed" and reading all about how to update this NONEXISTING driver? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone actually read my issue and reply to what I wrote?<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your response. We apologize or the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that you, that if you are unable to find the driver for Windows 10 you can download and &nbsp;install the drivers for 8.1 and run it in compatibility mode. To do so follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Right click/tap twice&nbsp;the driver setup file and select
<strong>Properties </strong>then tap or click the <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. Place a check in the Run this program in compatibility mode for: box.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. Tap or click the drop down box and select a previous operating system, then tap or click OK.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. Try installing the driver/software and check.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope this information helps</span></p>

    <title>3D Builder - Subtraction Bugs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suraky  say:</h3>
<h2>            3D Builder - Subtraction Bugs</h2>
                    When I subtract one object from another, to make a hole, or to cut an area off of my model, &nbsp;often the subtraction creates many new triangles that inappropriately join between nearby edges. &nbsp;Usually across the gap i was trying to create. &nbsp;Most of the time
 these are not recognized as needing repairs, &nbsp;or are ignored by the repair tool.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When will we be getting a tool to delete triangles like this, and to manually close holes?

</p><p>So, No. &nbsp;It wasn't. &nbsp;I was redirected away from the Answers website. &nbsp;The issue which i continue to experience was essentially not acknowledged. &nbsp; And I guess no one else here saw it or cared. &nbsp; So I have to assume that 3D builder is a failure that no one
 bothers to use.</p>

            I have been experiencing multiple issues when joining (merge function) and subtracting objects from other objects. Lots of triangular artifacts that look like root vertices are not endgons. Hard to see with the wireframe mode turned on what is really going
 on. 3D Builder has promise ONLY if it gets a true mesh editor, or at least better than a simple slider for controlling subdivisions and vertex counts. It is simple and intuitive, but very limited in capability. There is no way to even round off a corner. Frustrating.
 Please tell me you are working on a remesh editor?!?!?!<br />

<h2>            Virtual Pro HELP needed</h2>
                    
<p>I've played well over 100 games with my Pro (mainly in Career mode), I've played a season at the back, one in midfield, and half a season up front. I've scored plenty of goals and assisted in many too. But yet my Pro stil only has an overall rating of 76.
 Am I doing something wrong here? </p>
<p>Any tips?</p>

<p>Hey, are you playing on world class? Most accomplishments have to be done on that level and have you looked into that list aswell for things to complete? Basicly just look at the list, and try to complete them 1 by 1, however there are a lot of them that
 just require you to play a lot of games.</p>
<p>Good luck with it.</p>

<p>There is an even easier way to do it.</p>
<p>Edit a half star team to have a goal keeper who is the shortest possible and really fat.</p>
<p>Then edit them to all out attack leave on defender and play him as either CAM,RW or CF and you will be able to get loads of goals on world class to rank him up quickly you can also 1v1 with the defender all the time and beat him (Set his stats low also very
 tall and very fat should do)</p>
<p>Hope this helps I know the pain of having to rank up your virtual pro it's a pain.</p>

    <title>Xbox Live account suspended for talking in German. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Live account suspended for talking in German.</h2>
                    
<p>I had recently gotten suspended on Xbox Live from communications for half a month for "harassment of other users on Xbox Live in the form of racial slurs and racially intolerant verbal abuse". I was speaking German because I am German in game chat with some
 friends and someone from that game reported me for being "racist". I applied for a overturn of the suspension and explained what had happened and the response I got was the same exact thing that I read about in the rules about being racist. They did not overturn
 the suspension and said that if this continues happening then there will be a permanent account suspension. What I want to know is that can I speak German on Xbox Live or will it be considered "racist"?</p>

<p>If you did not say anything that broke their rules like slurs and such then you can file a lawsuit and win because thats messing with freedom of speech. No matter what they say if you did nothing wrong you can bust their butts. I would.That would show ms

<p>Of course to op wasn't suspended just for talking German,there's more to it than they are letting on.</p>
<p>If that was true then they would ban everyone from Germany who plays on xbox live.</p>
<p>As for the freedom of speech remark,xbox live ToU/CoC trumps that,any solicitor/lawyer would just laugh at you.</p>

<p>Actually MS cant limit you. Thats like saying the government can tell you what to say or not to say and that is illegal. The tou/coc cannot trump the the Constitution. If you think they can then you are no better than those people in washington.Xbox live
 may not be the government but they do like them and are above the law.</p>

            Hi Michael,
<br />
<br />Is sounds like the Service guy installed a volume licence version of Windows 10 . . .
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Activation
<br />
<br />What is reported there under Activation?
<br />
<br />Does it say: Windows is activated using your Organisation;s Activation Service
<br />
<br />If so, the service guy used the wrong or hacked version of Windows 10
<br />
<br />When reinstalling Windows, he must use the exact same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) that came pre-installed on your PC
<br />
<br />In the Settings App, go to System - About
<br />
<br />What Edition of Windows 10 is reported there?       
        </p>

            the key which can be used with either 32 or 64 bit Windows 7 is only intended for use with 1 of the disk. You cannot use it to install both. 1 license, 1 installation, so choose wisely. If you want to install Windows 7 32 bit on another partition or another
 computer, you will need to purchase an additional license.<br />

    <title>Unable to view shared screen until I request control in Skype for - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to view shared screen until I request control in Skype for Business 2016</h2>
                    When someone I'm in a Skype for Business 2016 meeting with shares their screen, most of the time I can't see the content. If I request control, then I can see the shared screen. If I then release control, the shared screen remains visible. Others in the
 Organization report the same issue when I share my screen. It doesn't happen every time, but it does happen with frequency.

<p><span>Hi David,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for the information provided in
</span><span>private message</span><span>. After checking the version and PM, I find the Skype for business client is connecting your local Skype for business
 server rather than Office 365 side. Our forum will focus on Office 365 for business issue(connect to Skype for business online). So, to get dedicated support, I suggest you post the issue to our Skype for business server forum, and they are in charge of this
 kind of issue. Thanks for your understanding.</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t access help &#38; support Windows 10</h2>
                    I can't access Help &amp; Support using the desktop icon shortcut or with F1. I saw other posts that talked about partitions or blue tooth but I have neither. When I click on the icon there is the small blue circle for a few seconds then nothing. When I click
 to go to the file location it just takes me to another screen with the shortcut which also doesn't work. In the program file list the file folder says the help file&nbsp; is empty. What do I do??

            <p>I have a Gateway all-in-one Model ZX4270 and have Windows 10. </p>
<p>When looking for answers about this problem&nbsp;I saw postings that asked what partions people had on their hard drives. My hard drive has not been partitioned.</p>
<p>I do not have any blue tooth devices so don't know how I could check this for access.</p>
<p>When I go to the notification panel on the right hand side to see what emails etc have been received the box for blue tooth is lit up.</p>
<p>I do not get any error messages and there is nothing to take&nbsp;a screen shot of as when I click on the help shortcut the little blue circle only lasts for a few seconds then disappears, all you would get is a picture of my desktop &amp; all of the other shortcut
 icons there..</p>
<p>I do not have a microphone so don't think I can access Cortina, I just want the regular help &amp; support program like I had in Vista and Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Any suggestions welcomed</p>

            <p>It might be helpful to explain what type of device you are looking at to set COM ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, if you look in Settings -&nbsp; Devices and left click on the device and select manage.&nbsp; You will see a properties option with will give you access to the COM port settings.&nbsp; Make sure you use the Devices Properties and not just the properties option
 on a right click menu.&nbsp; For instance, if it were a printer there would be a properties and Printer properties option...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get there by using the Control Panel, Devices and Printers or Settings - Devices and left click select the device.</p>

</p><p>I will need COM1 port to work with RC flight control unit FY-41AP&nbsp;for&nbsp;FPV. My computer has Windows 10 Home. When I am in Control Panel and search for Settings and Devices there is no result. Neither Devices Properties give result.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot reach Com ports through Device mger -view-hidden devices either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like my computer with Windows 10 Home does not have window for Com ports to select or I just do not know how to search for Com ports. What is the path.</p>
