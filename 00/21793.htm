<h2>            Family Safety &#43; Windows 10 PC &#43; Windows 8.1 Phone</h2>
                    <p>I don't know where all this belongs, but I would appreciate if somebody could post if they had made it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 PC and I have assigned my kids an account. I am monitoring those accounts using Family Safety. I had been using Family Safety earlier for atleast an year and I had used these features and I do know all the features worked except phone.
 Now,&nbsp;most of them don't&nbsp;work. (Hey Microsoft, its not just enough you make us create accounts for kids and sign off on our privacy, you have to make something work)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue:1</strong></p>
<p>I can tell with 100% sure that Family Safety is not capturing any Websites that the kids are browsing. They are browsing youtube and others and my family safety accounts shows blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue:2</strong></p>
<p>Family safety is supposed to send me emails on what they are doing on the devices, no email ever after this new version on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue:3</strong></p>
<p>Apps downloaded on PC. Nothing is coming to my attention. Why cant I restrict not just by age but I want to approve each app they are downloading.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue:4</strong></p>
<p>This is most excoriating of all. I bought my teen son a Windows Phone and hooked up his PC account. The Windows phone is 8.1 Lumia 640, not upgraded to Windows 10 yet (thanks ATT). Family Safety is seeing the phone and now we have a problem. He is not able
 to download the apps that he had already purchased and he had owned. Example Dropbox. He was trying to delete apps and install it on SD card to make room for Windows Mobile 10. Now the apps are not even downloading. Not able to purchase new apps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had removed his device and re-added, reset his device, &nbsp;removed him from FS and added back, nothing has worked. What the heck is going on? Roll back to the version that we had last year or the year before where everything worked as configured.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I logged into that URL and I was see that it was listing my device as windows 8.1 I made sure that my account settings are good. I even made a dummy update, but no luck. Its been a week and its been a pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Using Microsoft Access as a Service Ticket Write-up program - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patickclapp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Microsoft Access as a Service Ticket Write-up program</h2>
                    <p>Hello all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is my basic need: I manage the service department in a bike shop, and I'd like to begin using microsoft office to create and store repair tickets for bikes. I have been learning a good bit about the possibilities with the new Access, and I'd like
 some input from experts on how exactly to go about this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will need at least two databases:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Labor Database:</p>
<p>- Sku numbers</p>
<p>- Labor Descriptions</p>
<p>- Prices</p>
<p>- Time allotted</p>
<p>
</p><p>Product Database:</p>
<p>- Sku numbers</p>
<p>- Item Description</p>
<p>- Prices</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I will need a front end repair ticket with fields that can communicate with the other two databases. For instance, in the repair ticket, if I were to enter a sku for something in a field, it would automatically transfer the data associated with that
 sku, into the repair ticket and into the appropriate fields. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen a few things that brings me to the assumption that Access gives you the ability to create applications that puts blanket over whats happening in the background and just allows you to input certain things. This would be awesome if I could find
 an easy way to make it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I would like to be able to have certain fields of the repair ticket automatically transferred and saved into another database. For example, if I put a customers name into the repair ticket, when I saved that particular ticket, the customer's
 name and contact info would automatically be saved into a archived list of customer info. Furthermore, being able to find that customer at a future time and having the ability to access previous repair tickets associated with that customer, would be extremely
 helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And one final thing that would be helpful, is being able to edit existing repair tickets, adding notes and items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done something similar with this, without any of the automation, and it feels so clunky, and I'd like to have a fresh new way to implement the idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance for the advice!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It's interesting to me to read what you have just written. Kind of deja-vu back to 1995. ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news?</p>
<p>Yes, all that you've mention is ENTIRELY possible using a relational database like Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "not-so-good news" is that it's a TON of work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Table and relationship design is crucial, and has to take a LOT of scenarios into account.</p>
<p>tblCustomers</p>
<p>tblVehicles</p>
<p>tblVehicleRepairs</p>
<p>tblPartsInventory</p>
<p>tblSuppliers</p>
<p>tblPartsRecd</p>
<p>tblPartsSold</p>
<p>... more</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa6b7690-2b19-4d2a-b082-aed07bfefb3c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words ... a specific table for each group of entities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the relatively easy part.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that one customer can have many vehicles, and conversely, one vehicle could have multiple drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, there are many suppliers than can supply the exact same part. Sometimes it's just easier to order a part from a different supplier out of convenience or freight concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that people will probably jump all over me for saying this ... but I purposely disobey the rules of "normalization" when it comes to recording sales transactions. I want to be assured that if a part gets deleted, or even if the price changes in tblPartsInventory
 ... that my repair history info remains intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conversely, I have decided that not every parts purchase should be added to tblPartsInventory. There are many occasions where you order a "one-off" part that you'll likely never sell again (sometimes referred to as a "buyout")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway ... I hope this gets you started.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will actually be only a write up system, it won't be tied into the inventory in any way shape or form. Basically, once we've written up a repair ticket, we will print two off, one to the customer and one goes with the bike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our POS system will handle all of the logistics and inventory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if that helps clarify.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I agree with Don, what you are asking for is certainly doable, but if you want this for use in a business, I suggest you splurge and pay a professional to do it for you or buy a ready made one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Don said, making a database like this is an effort that is "bigger than a bread box".&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure you can probably cobble something together, but you will find that in the future when you want to make changes there will probably be "issues".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really want to do it yourself, I suggest you take an introduction of Access Database programming course.&nbsp; Most courses include doing a simple database application such as what you have described.&nbsp; You may even be able to find free online courses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, you will learn the required terminology, such as a</p>
<p>- a "field" is a piece of data / information</p>
<p>- a table is a collection of related fields</p>
<p>- a database is a collection of related tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what you have been calling "databases" are actually tables. </p>

            <p>Rohn beat me to it, but you do need to get your nomenclature correct. it does sound like you are referring to tables, not databases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But its not clear what the two tables you refer to are. Are they a listing of standard labor costs for a type of job and repair parts that might be used or what?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would see a structure like the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblCustomer</p>
<p>CustomerID (Primary Key Autonumber)</p>
<p>FirstName</p>
<p>Lastname</p>
<p>Address info, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblBike</p>
<p>BikeID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>CustomerID (Foreign Key)</p>
<p>other info about bike</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblRepair</p>
<p>RepairID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>BikeID (FK)</p>
<p>InDate</p>
<p>OutDate</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblRepairDetail</p>
<p>RepairDetailID (PK autonumber)</p>
<p>RepairID (FK)</p>
<p>DetailType (Part or Labor)</p>
<p>ItemID (FK)</p>
<p>Qty</p>
<p>UnitPrice</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblLabor</p>
<p>LaborID (PK) &nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">- Sku numbers</span></p>
<p>LaborDescriptions</p>
<p>UnitPrice</p>
<p>TimeAllotted</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblPart</p>
<p>PartID (PK) - Sku numbers</p>
<p>PartDescription</p>
<p>UnitPrice</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there, you should be able to receive a bike for repair, print a repair ticket and prepare an invoice.</p>

<p>Yes, so something like the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The table would have a row like this:</p>

<p>
</p><p>And on the actual frontline invoice template, what I would want is to input the "1045" sku number into one field, and it automatically transfer the other data associated with that sku into the other fields (description, price, and time), in a manner that
 allowed the price and time to be added at the bottom of the page for other uses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize, I think a large part of my difficulty in getting my idea across is that I am not perfectly familiar with the nomenclature.

            <p>That is fairly standard except I would do some things differently. First, I would have ONE Items table. If the only difference between labor and parts is time, I would just leave that blank for Parts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, it is not necessary to have the Time and Description fields in tblRepairDetail.&nbsp;I'm guessing this info is static so it can be pulled from the Items table whenever needed. One of the principles of a relational database is that data should be in ONE
 place only.&nbsp; However there is an exception to this rule. That is when the info is time sensitive and you need to capture the data as it was at a point in time. The UnitPrice falls into that category.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, its SOP that you select something and automatically fill in other controls on a form (Nomenclature again; you don't have fields on a form, you have controls that may or may not be bound to a field in a table. This is a subtle but&nbsp;important distinction.}
 You have a&nbsp;combination here. You select the item description from a combobox and it displays the SKU and other related data in unbound controls. But it will fill in the value of bound controls. I've written a blog on Displaying Related data, that illustrates
 some of these techniques. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've given you the outline of the proper table structure and some direction on creating the forms and reports. If you have specific questions as you go along, please feel free to ask.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is a very good start at defining your requirements. Question, it is possible to have the same SKU more than once in an invoice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't have to apologize. You are asking for help in the right place.&nbsp; But it is also why I suggest you take some sort of course in creating Access applications and databases. To learn the terminology and techniques.

            Yes, there will be a quantity column that will be changed manually per situation and have no connection whatsoever to the rest of the tables, but it would double the times and prices for each item.&nbsp;

            As I noted, the quantity field will go in your Detail table. You can then use that field to calculate the extended cost for that line item. Note, the calculation would not be stored, rather you would use the expression (Quantity*UnitPrice) to display the
 extended cost in queries, forms and reports.

<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately there is no restore options in the Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to perform a clean install from the original Windows 7 DVD or backup media that you created in Windows 7.</p>

            <p>This is an operating system not an app. It is not scheduled to be finished until next year so is very buggy and not ready for regular users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will probably need to reinstall windows 7 completely - formatting the drive in the process to remove Win10. Make sure you back up your data before doing that.</p>

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 10 Commandments about installing any beta or preview software. Number 1 is always read the documentation and Number 2 is Backup, backup and backup again before installing a beta.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The information has always been available in the previous link that I posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That link is also on the website where you downloaded the ISO file.</p>

            Yes there is windows old, so just install a clean 7&nbsp;go back to Windows old as maybe be Windows old2. There you have all Your old files. As Ronnie say here you have to backup. Dont forget this Windows is just a test to find bugs.

<h2>            What does M3U and WPL stand for in the Windows Media Player&#63; Which one is the best option to use to insure that my CD disc I burn will player in my car CD player&#63;</h2>
                    I'm tryin to burn myself a music CD disc to have for my car...I am able to get my playlist made and everything but once I hit the "Start Burn" button the following message pops up: "Windows Media Player cannot burn some of the files. To investigate the
 problem, click the icon next to the files in the burn list."...I do not see any kind of icon beside any of the files in my burn list to be able to check the problem...When I choose the "more option" button from my burn section to check out my settings the
 last section in it is "Data Disc" with the following: "Add a list of all burned files to the disc in this format: either WPL or M3U...I don't understand what either one of those formats are in order the best choose one to insure that my disc will play in my
 car cd player. If someone could please help me out i would really appreciate it.

            Hi, how are you, thanks for posting in our microsoft community, I'm here to help you solve your problem, I hope this information helps you
<br />
<br />WPL and M3U are two file types that are used to store playlists, or a list of audio files with its associated information like file location, title, album, artists, and other relevant information. The most common use of playlists is in segregating and grouping music files for use on computers or on portable music players. The main difference between WPL and M3U is the principal application that uses them. WPL was created for and is used by Microsoft’s Windows Media Player. It is the default file format and all playlists you create with WMP uses WPL. On the other hand, M3U began with Winamp; a very popular and free music player.

            Hi  E_J_Dean#71511 
<br />
<br />Do not burn M3U and WPL to the disc, they are not music files, they are just playlists 
<br />
<br />You should only add Music files to the Disc, to ensure it is compatible with your player in your car . . .

            <p>Hi Dana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are right but it is the way how they interpret.</p>
<p>2.35 stands for 2 Acre &amp; 35 Guntas =&gt; 2*40+35 =115. Backward conversion is in the same way, 115 is 2 Acres (80 Guntas) and the remainderis 35 =&gt; 2.35</p>
<p>
</p><p>Added: A2G: =INT(A1)*40+MOD(A1,INT(A1))*100 (this&nbsp; in D1)</p>
<p>G2A: =QUOTIENT(D1,40)&amp;"." &amp;MOD(D1,40)</p>

            <p>I was, years ago, involved in a thread to sum and subtract acres &amp; guntas and came with a very long &amp; complex formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Applying your idea ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sum: =DOLLARFR(SUMPRODUCT(DOLLARDE(LARGE(A2:A4,ROW(A2:A4)-1),40)*40)/40,40)</p>
<p>Subtract: =DOLLARFR(ROUND(SUMPRODUCT(DOLLARDE(LARGE(A10:A12,ROW(A2:A4)-1),40)*40)/40,5),40)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both are standard formulas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note the use of ROUND in subtract. </p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Acres.Guntas</td>
<td>Guntas</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5.35</td>
<td>235</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-2.35</td>
<td>-115</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-1</td>
<td>-40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2.00</td>
<td>80</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>
</p><p>Without the ROUND, the formula returns 1.40. This caused by the floating point error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=(SUMPRODUCT(DOLLARDE(LARGE(A10:A12,ROW(A2:A4)-1),40)*40)/40)-2-0 =&gt; </p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>-6.66134E-16</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p>Sumproduct returns in fact 1.9999999.... but is rounded up to 2.00000... but DOLLARFR takes the real value and rounds it after the calculation 1.3999999... =&gt; 1.40 iso 2.</p>

<h3> ssafecor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exporting Personal task lists from MS Project 2013&#63;</h2>
                    <p>There was a time when I could easily produce a sequential task list for each resource and export it to Excel. Have just recently switched from a stand alone version of Project to Project 2013/ Office 365 I can't find a way to accomplish this without filtering
 the Gantt chart view by resource and copy/pasting the data directly into Excel and then going through numerous steps to format the data for analysis.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project produces a view very much like what I was using as the Resource Form but I can't modify the content or export to Excel. how can I add and delete elements from the resource form and then export them? I also used to be able to run the report over the
 entire project and then sort the results by individual team members so I didn't have to run the report multiple time to get the team a quick task list sorted by start or finish date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone provide some direction?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

 the Resources to Rows underneath Tasks. &nbsp;Swap the order, placing resources before rows. &nbsp;Drag the Weekly calendar from Filters to Columns and place before the summary data.</p>

            Its best you go back to classic if you need that functionality:
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<h2>            Build 9926&#58;  Restarted Without Warning to Install Updates</h2>
                    Well, I just had a scare. &nbsp;Build 9926 just restarted itself to install updates (KB3035129, KB3035034, KB2267602). &nbsp;To the best of my knowledge, there was no indication that it had updates to install and no warning when it did so. &nbsp;I was about 2-1/2 hours
 into some financial work when it restarted, but, thankfully, I appear to have been saving regularly and don't seem to have lost any work. &nbsp;Didn't previous versions of Windows put an indication up when updates were scheduled to be installed? &nbsp;Wasn't there a
 warning about the system restarting in 10 minutes or something? &nbsp;But, regardless, Win10 needs something similar.

                    <p>Hi guys,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a question about opening the file on onedrive and edit in word/excel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently using word&nbsp;2016 for mac and excel 2016 for mac. After I updated both of them to version 16.15, I cannot access it through sharepoint, and it gives me an information:&nbsp;Sorry, we couldn't open 'https://d.docs.live.net/ for mac</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is macOS High Sierra version 10.13.6. Before I updated, the onedrive works very well with word and excel, and I can edit it in word/excel using other computers that have a windows system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it that because there is a bug for the new version of word and excel? Or should I change anything? I have tried to delete the cache according to the previous solutions but it seems like the situation is quite different for macbook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Xinyi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>Based on my test, I didn’t meet the issue.</p>
<p>I suggest you try another browser to check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, you can try sign out account of Office, then open it to check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information?</p>
<p>1. Where did you store files, OneDrive Personal or OneDrive for Business?</p>
<p>2. Check if all files meet the issue.</p>
<p>3. The screenshot of error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Qing,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the safari and I have tried Chrome but it doesn't work either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also signed out the account (both office 365 and onedrive), and then resigned in, but could not change anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am using the personal onedrive, but I do have an account for onedrive&nbsp;business, which is my university student account. For both of them I can access the word and excel on windows system but not my MacBook with the updated version. So I believe there
 is something wrong with the new version but not the onedrive itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to open different files with different accounts, and it seems like none of them can be accessed through "edit in word/excel".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the screenshot:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49c0e761-3399-4ab6-bb54-5fe6f6dc50c4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49c0e761-3399-4ab6-bb54-5fe6f6dc50c4?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Hi Xinyi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>Based on my test, I didn’t meet the issue.</p>
<p>I suggest you try <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a> to check if the issue still exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, I suggest you reinstall Office to check if the issue occurs:</p>

<h2>            Allocating Revenue by month based on a start and end date</h2>
                    <p>I want a simple function to allocate revenue by month based on a start and end date. Every formula I see out there is overly complicated for my needs. Is there an excel function that could accomplish this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an example:</p>
<p>Revenue $120,000</p>
<p>Start Jan 1, 2017</p>
<p>End Dec 31, 2017</p>
<p>
</p><p>The output should be $10k per month under each column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am open to formatting suggestions but right now I'm thinking Col 1 would be revenue, Col 2 start, Col 3 end and then every column after that would represent the output month/amount (Jan - Dec).</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Enter below formula in cell G2 &amp; copy to the right:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=(G$1&lt;=EOMONTH($E2,0))*(G$1&gt;EOMONTH($D2,-1))*($C2/DATEDIF(EOMONTH($D2,-1),EOMONTH($E2,0),"m"))</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Presumed that the number of months will be from the month of start date &amp; month of end date (with both months included) so that:
</p>
<p>if start date is 3/31/2017 &amp; end date is 5/31/2017 this will be taken as 3 months,
</p>
<p>if start date is 3/1/2017 &amp; end date is 5/1/2017 this will be taken as 3 months,
</p>
<p>if start date is 3/1/2017 &amp; end date is 5/31/2017 this will be taken as 3 months,&nbsp;</p>
<p>if start date is 2/28/2017 &amp; end date is 5/31/2017 this will be taken as 4 months.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be your requirement &amp; if you want otherwise the formula can be updated.</p>

    <title>How do I change the default row height&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joyce wermont  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change the default row height&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a simple question. I would like to change the default row height of my worksheets in Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My sheets have rows of varying heights, depending on how much content is in some of the columns. I&nbsp;always wrap text so I can see it all at once.&nbsp;I do not want to widen the column width, because I prefer to have all the columns in view at once (rather than
 having to scroll back and forth to see various columns). As it is, it's often a tight squeeze with all the columns the files usually have. Also, there's no way I will be able to widen the column enough to show all the text in one single line, in some of the
 rows!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select the entire sheet and then select "Autofit row height," the rows having only one line of text will default to 12.75 points. I would like that default to be bigger, say 15.75, so that there's a little more white space (easier to read). But I can't
 select the <em>entire sheet </em>and then set the height of every row to 15.75, because then the cells with wrapped text will show only the first line of text. What I want to be able to do is an autofit on the height of all rows, and have the one-line rows
 default to 15.75, rather than the current default of 12.75. So, how do I change that default from 12.75 to 15.75? This should then be the height default for all subsequent Excel files that I create (in other words, I want to change a global setting that will
 persist when I close one Excel file and open another one.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already looked through help files, but didn't find the answer. I did find out how to set defaults for column width, and I found out how to change the height of a specific row, or maybe a group of rows selected together. The latter can be pretty time-consuming,
 so that's not a good solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Thanks! That is certainly a reasonable workaround. I created a column with some dummy text in a larger font, and then hid it. Works pretty well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why the ability to set a default directly isn't included in the features of Excel, though. It seems like something that should be standard.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem.&nbsp; I've tried making Internet Explorer the default program but it doesn't work:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I make Microsoft Edge the default program, it's fine, and Outlook will open the link directly in Edge.</p>
<p>Similarly, if I make Firefox te default program, it also works as expected, and the links open directly in Firefox.</p>
<p>But after I make Internet Explorer the default program, when&nbsp;I click on an HTML link in Outlook.&nbsp;I always get the pop-up asking what application to use.&nbsp; Clicking on "always use this application" does not help.&nbsp; The pop-up still appears the next time&nbsp;I click
 on a link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked fine in Win 8.1.&nbsp; It seems to be an issue with Internet Explorer 11 in Windows 10.</p>

            <p>I too, have this problem.&nbsp; IE11 is set up as the default and has all its defaults.&nbsp; As PDA2010 wrote, it worked fine in Win 8.1.</p>

            Worked fine with Windows 8.1 but after upgrading to Windows 10 I now get the pop up box asking which browser I want to use even though I have IE11 selected as my default browser and putting the check mark in the box to always use this application does
 no good.&nbsp; I am beginning to have doubts about upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp; Too many things that worked fine in Windows 8.1 does not work in Windows 10.&nbsp;

<h2>            MIN and MAX function formulas</h2>
                    I am using Office 365, which was upgraded from Office 2007. In my 2007 Excel spreadsheets, I was used the MIN and MAX formulas to determine the total number of days between the earliest entry date value and the latest entry date value, within a huge range
 of date cells values. Furthermore, in Excel 2007, I was able to use a range name instead of identifying the first and last cell locations in the range of cells. Once I had the total number of days (by subtracting the MIN value from the MAX value, I was able
 to easily calculate an average expense per day incurred over the entire period of days determined in the first step of the calculation described herein above. In Excel 365, it appears I cannot use a range name to determine the total number of days; i.e., using
 MIN and MAX functions with a range name between the parenthesize. Furthermore, when I follow Excel 365 help guidance, which instructs you to use the actual first and last cell locations in the range of cells your are using for
