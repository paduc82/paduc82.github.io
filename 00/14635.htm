<h2>            OUTLOOK SEARCH</h2>
                    <p>After the Windows 10 v 1709 update my Outlook Search won't work.&nbsp; First it said it was indexing over 200K entries, now it just says "Something went wrong and your search could not be completed".&nbsp; I have had this problem last time Windows updated, and just
 had to wait for the index to rebuild.&nbsp; This time it is worse and I don't know what to do.&nbsp; Why are we prompted to update and told the new Version will be sooooo much better, only to find important functions are disabled?</p>

            CLOSE Outlook down completely  (if you don't do this now you will need to close and restart it later)
<br />
<br />2.  Click Start Button
<br />
<br />3.  Type "Index"
<br />
<br />4.  Select "Indexing Options"
<br />
<br />5.  Click Modify 
<br />
<br />6.  Check the box beside "Microsoft Outlook"    
<br />
<br />7.  Open Outlook and do a search.  
<br />
<br />You may find you get a short list of hits and then "Search for more" link.  Just click the link.  Once the indexing service has completed re-indexing things will be back to normal.
<br />
<br />If that checkbox is already ticked, then this is not the cause of the issue for you.
<br />
<br />Other things you can try:
<br />
<br />
<br />If you find search is not working for one specific POP account or PST file check the path of the PST data file and make sure it is correct.  In Outlook click File, Account Settings, Account Settings click Data Files.  Look under location and see if any of the paths are UNC based such as \\?\C:\users\username\Documents\Outlook Files\file.pst.  To fix this click Settings and see if you can manually fix the path.  If not, remove the PST and add it back.
<br />
<br />Normally after fixing the UNC path and restarting Outlook search will start working again or shortly thereafter.  If the fixed path does not take affect in a half our or so go trigger a re-index and it should in some time, Search, Search Tools, Search Options, Indexing Options, Advanced, Rebuild. 
<br />
<br />The bad UNC path would have happened if you created a new profile including setting up Outlook new on a machine in February or March 2017 before the PST search bug was fixed.  Reference this fix, <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Outlook-search-stops-working-after-updating-to-build-7870-2020-and-higher-0bcf0b06-320d-40c3-8cf0-7e3df90793ed?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Outloo...</a>.
<br />
<br /> If you are getting the "Something went wrong" search error and it started in June 2017 see this article and make sure you have Windows Updates turned on, <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Outlook-known-issues-in-the-June-2017-security-updates-3f6dbffd-8505-492d-b19f-b3b89369ed9b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Outloo...</a>.

</p><p>If you are looking for free documentation, you can search through this forum and the TechNet forum on Microsoft Project, and you can look for blogs dedicated to Microsoft Project.&nbsp; However, this is not how I recommend you learn to use Microsoft Project.&nbsp;
 Instead, I think you would do much better if you took an instructor-led course taught by someone who has actually used the software, or if you purchased a book on Microsoft Project.&nbsp; There are a number of excellent books on the market, including one co-authored
 by me (shameless plug).&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

<h3> kiwimex67  say:</h3>
<h2>            All MS Office 2016 Pro applications get stuck on start &#34;Processing&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated from Office 2013 to Office 2016. In both cases, the installs were using my Home User Programme subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2013 was working fine in my compute (Acer All-in-one with i3 chip, 4 GB RAM).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2016 installed without problems and worked without problems for a few days. Then programmes (all of them) started hanging up on the flash welcome screen ("Processing..."). I even left Powerpoint running overnight and next morning was still on the
 flash screen. I repaired, uninstalled, reinstalled... programmes worked fine for 1 day. Today, the same issue is back. I ran the repair tool again, and it did nothing. Programmes do not run in safe mode (Outlook) or without add-ins (e.g. Word).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything else in the computer runs well... with exception of the Task Manager. If I use the TM to close the unresponsive splash screen, then the TM itself becomes unresponsive after stopping the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the end of my tether trying to find a stable fix. Computer is the family computer and we all need Office running.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is possible that your Office 2016 has a different installation type compare to your Office 2013 version. This could be one of the main reason why you're having challenges with its application performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to determine the appropriate advice to your concern, kindly provide us the answers to the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How did you upgrade your Office 2013 to 2016 version? </li><li>What specific process did you do to upgrade?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>What type of Office installation do you have? Is it MSI or C2R based installation? To find out whether your installation is MSI or C2R, in the Microsoft Office application, such as Word or Excel, go to
<strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Account</strong>. If you see an <strong>Office Updates
</strong>section, the installation is <strong>C2R</strong>. If there is <strong>no Office Updates
</strong>section, then it is an <strong>MSI installation</strong>.</li><li>Which version and build of Windows 10 do you have? To check that, simply type "<strong>winver</strong>" on the search field or Cortana, then hit on
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>If it is possible, please send us a screenshot of the issue for us to have a better picture of it.</li></ul>
<p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. Answers to your questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How did you upgrade your Office 2013 to 2016 version?
</li></ul>
<p>The first time I installed O2106 the installation programme, I did it by clicking the link in the email I received from the HUP purchase.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What specific process did you do to upgrade?'</li></ul>
<p>After clicking in the link mentioned above, the installation programme started and detected the previous Office version. A dialog appeared saying that proceeding ahead would uninstall Office 2013. I accepted and the installation proceeded without a hitch.&nbsp;
 After a few days, I started seeing the issues, including the Project and Visio programmes I also installed. So, I repaired (online repair) Office, but things didn't work. I decided to do a full uninstall of 2016 versions of Office, Project and Visio. Then,
 I re-installed 2013 and checked that the old version was working fine. I then did uninstall O2013 using the programmes and features, hoping that it could clean any files that were interfering with 2016 and had not been removed using the 2016 installation process.
 I re-installed 2016, but this time I used an image obtained from the IT department of my workplace (from where I have access to the HUP). After this installation (2 days ago), Office 2016 was working, so I thought I had solve the problem. But yesterday, it
 froze again.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you getting any error messages? </li></ul>
<p>None at all. Immediately after installation, I opened the programmes (Outlook, Word, Excel, Powerpoint and OneNote) and all of them worked without problem. I also purchased the 2016 Project and Visio, I recall opening Visio without problems too. The only
 problem (error) I see is the Task Manager, which stops working when I try to close the unresponsive window,</p>

<li>What type of Office installation do you have? Is it MSI or C2R based installation? To find out whether your installation is MSI or C2R, in the Microsoft Office application, such as Word or Excel, go to
<strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Account</strong>. If you see an <strong>Office Updates
</strong>section, the installation is <strong>C2R</strong>. If there is <strong>no Office Updates
</strong>section, then it is an <strong>MSI installation</strong>.]</li></ul>
<p>You realise that step requires Office working, to actually see the menu... I rebooted my computer this morning to answer this email, and to my surprise the previous instances of Powerpoint and Outlook started running. I didn't start them, but as soon as
 logged in to the desktop, the 2 programmes started running... and they actually opened. I can confirm that i must have a C2R installation, as I can see the Office Updates section. I would not have a clue what type of installation 2013 was. I could uninstall
 2016 again and install 2013 to check if that is a critical piece of information. I have clicked on the updates, but it tells me that the software is up to date now.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which version and build of Windows 10 do you have? To check that, simply type "<strong>winver</strong>" on the search field or Cortana, then hit on
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>Windows 1709 (OS Build 16299.192)</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If it is possible, please send us a screenshot of the issue for us to have a better picture of it.</li></ul>
<p>Sure, although there is not much to see. This is the screen I got this morning after I left Outlook running (trying to open) for 9 hours. As I mentioned above, I turned the computer off and re-started again only to find Outlook (and Powerpoint) starting
 and actually opening. Baffling!</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
We appreciate your response. Other causes for unresponsive Office apps are incompatible device drivers. You may need to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">run a Windows update</a></strong> on your PC to ensure you have the latest drivers.<br />
<br />
If the problem persists, make sure that the specific video card, printer, mouse, and keyboard drivers are up-to-date. Drivers can usually be downloaded and installed directly from the manufacturer's website. If you are using a laptop, see the manufacturer's
 website for updates related to the laptop.<br />
<br />
Feel free to reach out if you require further assistance.

<p>After doing several repairs and uninstalls, including a deep uninstall using the online Microsoft tool to correct an interrupted uninstall, followed by a clean installation of Windows (basically going back from scratch), installing latest updates for both
 Windows (Creators version 1709) and Office, plus updating drivers... the issue continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several years of using Office 2013 relatively flawlessly, the explanation of 'need to update your drivers' seems to me like clutching at straws. There is obviously a major bug in Office 2016, considering the number of people reporting similar issues
 to mine (particularly for Outlook), which Microsoft seems to be at a loss to solve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going back to my Office 2013 HUP version. This few weeks spending hours in front of the computer trying to fix the Office 2016 issues have put me off completely with regards to ever consider installing Office 365 in my computer...</p>

<p>Hector, after my rant from last week, I can now report that it looks like the issue is sorted. As I mentioned, I ran both the Windows and Office updates without any success. I checked the manufacturer site for updates and it looked like my computer was up
 to date, too.</p>
<p>However, I kept on reading about the issue and found that some people reported issues similar to mine associated to a conflict with NVIDIA cards, which was sorted with a driver update.</p>
<p>I have a AMD Radeon HD4000 in my computer. When I ran the Radeon diagnostic, it suggested an update. I updated the driver and suddenly a failed instance of Word suddenly sprang back to life. I will keep an eye on how things work, but so far Office 2016 seems
 to be working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if people report issues with Office and they have the Radeon HD4000, an update may help.</p>

<h2>            Rather odd behaviour.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello first time poster here - so be nice :).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently got the Nokia&nbsp; 2730 classic , it has Ovi Maps 3.0. I downloaded Maps from the site etc installed it onto the memory card. Now when I go to search say London. The search comes back with results I choose any of them and I'm presented with a blue
 circle souranded with blank yello :(. Now If I go to select Bath I choose any of the results I get a perfect map with locatoins etc, infact I can pan to London and get the same results (good map with info).So why can't I search London and get the map with
 th details ? Infact I can't do any location but Bath :(.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Haha no I'm acutally in London. I wans't planning on using the triagnlar feature to find my location , rather just browse the maps if you get my drift. I didn't even know that it calculated your postion in such a way , I don't recall seeing the feature

<p>With my 3720 Classic which is similar S40 device to yours the United Kingdom maps were pre-installed on 1GB microSD and as I used an external Bluetooth GPS have not experienced any issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm a new user and have just bought a 2730 on orange (UK) to replace my 6230i which ran google maps fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though mine claims to have Maps pre-installed they don't work at all, it can occasionally verify an address but that's about it. It appears not to be listed on the Ovi pages as a compatible phone for any of the Maps versions&nbsp;and I gather Nokia are fully
 aware of this problem but continue to sell this defective article and don't plan to do anything to sort it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I gather that whatever is (or in my case isn't)&nbsp;pre-installed can''t be upgraded at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I call it a complete con, particularly as I can't use the excellent google maps on it either. I shall not buy another Nokia handset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've made two complaints to Nokia so far neither of which have been answered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't expect GPS and Navigation at this price, but I do expect that it does what it says it will do - the instruction book concerning maps with this handset is utter rubbish.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 next build date - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaeljones1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 next build date</h2>
                    Obviously there have been several builds for Microsoft employees but nothing for us in the trenches. You would think that Microsoft is working on some sort of schedule and should have some idea when next build after 9926 will be available. It would be
 nice if they let us testers know at least an approximate time frame for this next build. The replies to questions from Microsoft to questions are mostly more questions and no real answers. Come on Microsoft we have taken some ricks by truing Windows 10 TP
 and deserve a little more information on status of the OS.

            I feel that Microsoft is not very concerned with the people that have downloaded the Windows 10 TP. We all took chances with our computer, data and personal information to test this new version of Windows. I realize that the updates will take some time
 but your would think that Microsoft would have some idea when the next build will be ready for download. We are testing it ad giving them feedback to help them develop a stable OS that has features wanted by the ultimate users of the OS. I understand that
 there are something like 2 million of us now. I have been lucky hat it has worked (build 9926) with no problems on my computer but I would still like to see improvements as they are available. Come on Microsoft throw us a bone once in&nbsp; a while.

            <p>I think it's important for everyone to understand a couple of things here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, builds are not released on any kind of schedule. In fact, builds are never scheduled. One morning a project lead will wake up, say, yes this build is good enough to release and then 3 days later it's released. There is no release schedule EVER for
 builds. Only milestones. A milestone would be the release of TP or the release of DP or CP or RTM. Only milestones are scheduled (or semi-scheduled). If Microsoft released builds on a set schedule, you would have 3 times as many bugs and your data would be
 at a higher risk because builds, in themselves, are unstable. Imagine how bad it would be if a project lead had to guarantee a build on a specific date. (The thought of that just makes me cringe).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, You made the choice to assist Microsoft in helping them trouble-shoot. You did, not them. Assistance is a privilege they are granting you, not because they need you. They are giving you the ability to see their work before its finished and comment
 to make it work best for you. They are doing you a favor, not you doing them a favor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, Microsoft explicitly states not to download Windows 10 TP. They tell everyone don't do this and never do it at the risk of your data. If your claim that you are taking "chances with" your data as you say, then you should not have downloaded Windows
 10 TP in the first place. You should only install it on a second computer that has data you can afford to lose or have backups of. You are responsible for your data, not Microsoft. It's your fault if your data is lost because you "took a chance" with your
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has always been good at releasing software that works well and is extremely stable. They are also responsible enough no to release test builds until they know that the stability of that build is high enough to be "acceptable" to their standards.
 They will release the next build once all parts of the next build meet those "acceptable" standards. Not before.</p>

            I have done Microsoft many favors, I moved from DR Dos to Microsoft DOS many years ago.&nbsp; have owned and used EVERY version of Windows. I have owned and used Microsoft Office from first version to latest version. There have been times when there were better
 operating systems available (Digital Research Windows X and IBM OS2) but I stayed with Microsoft as I could tell that the others would fade away, and they did.&nbsp;I have invested my hard earned money through the years with Microsoft, that is my favor to them.
 I find it hard to believe that Microsoft does not set schedules and just depend on some guy deciding that next build is ready on a whim. It would be nice if Microsoft let us little guys in on future expected developments on some sort of regular basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps
 a thread here by Microsoft with news and developments.

            You need to be on a Sharepoint server to publish slides and you need to be using the Professional Plus or Enterprise versions, which are only available in volume licenses for corporations. In my opinion, this command should be hidden in versions that can't
 actually use it.

            <p>As John says publish need a pro version. I would also consider whether there are huge images on the master causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another approach is to delete save the presentation with half the slides deleted and see which half has the problem. You can then continue halfing to find the slide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To simulate publish (not quite the same) you can use code:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This code is modified from code on Shyam's site here</p>
<p>http://skp.mvps.org/ppt00036.htm#2</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try it on a copy to see if it does what you need. Obviously you should specify a different output folder.</p>
<p>Sub ExportSlidesAsPresentations()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Dim oPres As Presentation<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Dim oExportedPres As Presentation<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Dim oSld As Slide<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Dim sSlideOutputFolder As String<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Dim sFilename As String<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;'alter this to suit<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;sSlideOutputFolder = "C:\Users\Optiplex\Desktop\Slides\"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Set oPres = ActivePresentation<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;For Each oSld In oPres.Slides<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sFilename = (sSlideOutputFolder) &amp; "Slide" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Format(oSld.SlideIndex, "000") &amp; ".ppt"<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set oExportedPres = Presentations.Open(FileName:=sFilename, WithWindow:=False)<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kill sFilename<br />

<h2>            Keeping &#34;comments&#34; in Word after deleting associated text</h2>
                    <p>I am using Office 365. I have "Track Changes" and "All Markup" selected. If you delete text that has a comment attached to it, the word is deleted (with a strike-through) but the comments associated to that text disappear.&nbsp; The comments should remain. See
 these 2 screenshots. </p>

<p>The first shows the original text, the second screenshot shows the changes to the text and the missing comment. How do I keep comments from deleting? I need a history that shows conversations of the changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you Stefan. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This does work, however this seems to be an issue with Word 2016. I can open the document in Office 2013, highlight an entire paragraph click the delete button on my keyboard, and it will delete the text and keep the comment.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the users in our company have to remove paragraphs of text by using the delete key, one by one, that will be very time consuming and I will not have happy users. These users work with large contracts with upwards near a hundred pages; and to use this
 method for deletion will be maddening. Is there a way we can escalate this bug to the programmers and get a fix applied?</p>

<p>I don't like to contradict you, but in every version of Word installed here -- that is, every version from 2003 through 2016 -- when I delete the text to which a comment is anchored, the comment is also deleted. The comment can be preserved only by keeping
 at least one character of the anchor text, either in place or by dragging it to another paragraph that will remain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't have to delete a paragraph by backspacing one character at a time; you can select all the text that isn't in the anchor, plus all except one character of the anchor, and press Delete.</p>

<h2>            Old Version Of Mapping Software</h2>
                    I have just updated my mapping software and the new version seems to be worse than the old version if thats possible. I'm have no compass rose now in the bottom right hand corner. It now shows a download icon which I can't turn off. The Sat signal has
 changed to three green dots which at times show sats as locked but then show my position as somewhere else. When you open up the application the globe does'nt rotate upon startup and I get NOKIA MAPS in big white letters which is kind of distracting. Its probably
 my imagination but the colours on the map seem a little less bright. Its also a lot slower now.<br />
<br />
How do I get the old version back?

<h2>            How do you transfer apps from phone memory to card memory on a 5800 XpressMusic mobile&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Totally new to this phone, with the option to download applications. Having great fun in doing so but not always given the option of where to save them to with the end result that they are saving to the phone memory which keeps filling up and then giving
 me an error message. Can anyone please tell me how to move apps from the phone memory to the card memory. And can anyone also tell me if I have an icon on the 'Menu' screen
<strong>and</strong> the 'Apps'&nbsp;screen, does this mean the application has been downloaded twice and do&nbsp;I need both or can I delete one (presumably the 'Menu' one)?</p>
<p>Many thanks for any help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>U usually get to choose where to store apps, but some of the apps from SW updater cannot be installed on E - Nokia only allowes them to be stored on C. Inside Ovistore, you can choose where to install your apps. If you have apps like facebook, fring etc
 from ovi store, it's possible to install them on E, but you will have to delete them from C and reinstall on E.</p>

<h2>            E71 Turn off nokia welcome tune</h2>
                    Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to turn off the nokia tune that appears with the nokia handshake logo when you turn the phone on, it's really loud and people in the office look when I turn the phone on.<br />
<br />
How can I turn it off, I've done this with other nokia phones but just can't see the option for the E71, only turn the welcome not to default or text.<br />
<br />
thanks.

            It's Tools, Settings, General, Personalisation, Tones, Warning Tones, Off.<br />
It also turns off a few other noises like low battery beep. But that's a small price to pay!

            Another option is to turn the phone off in "Silent" mode so it'll start up in silent mode.

            hi guys,<br />
<br />
good input, these all seem like pretty bad work arounds, eg: turn off all warning tones, thats quite handy, I like to know my battery is on it's last legs, so I'd rather not do that,<br />
<br />
turn the phone into silent mode before turning it off, again seems a dirty work around,<br />
<br />
in all the others nokias it's just setting thats welcome tone or something like that, I can't believe teh E71 doesn't have the ability to turn this off.

            How about just hitting the red "exit/hangup" button at the first note. That works for me.

            Unfortunately Nokia seems to have left out the option for the user to turn the welcome tone on and off in their latest S60 phones.<br />
<br />
BTW, You can also turn off the Welcome note by pressing the # key just before or as the Welcome Tone is playing. This will probably suit you better.

            well thats a surprise,<br />
<br />
nokia please put this back in your firmware update ASAP, so I can hassle Vodafone uk - to ignore it and not release it ever as it the story of vodafone-nokia firmware.<br />
<br />
Gutted about this, it may seem minor but every time I turn the phone on it's that loud the world knows about it, not great for a "business" phone.<br />
<br />
The hint on pressing the # key is appriciated though.

            I think they want you to be proud to be a Nokia owner. Turn on the phone and tell the world "Hey I have a Nokia". :D<br />
<br />
The # key works and I have gotten used to using it so now its become a habit with me. So nowadays its turn phone on, enter pin code pause press #.

            Time stamp on SMS is usually done in message center of each provider it's not always in synch with phone for SMS are not send immediately, some in fraction of minutes some more than 24 hours; it defends how busy the network &amp; availability of the recepient.

            Hi David,
<br />
<br />First, you might want to create one or more new modules for your macros. It is easy to lose track of them otherwise.
<br />
<br />Are these all recorded macros?
<br />
<br />Try renaming the ones that are causing problems. You do this (as well as make new modules) using the VBA Editor (Alt+F11).
<br />
<br />This forum is a user-to-user support forum. I am a fellow user. 
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. 
<br />
<br />You are asked below whether this response solved your problem, please do not answer that question for this or any response unless the answer is "yes" or unless you feel that the response is not helpful to you in resolving your problem. Otherwise it reports the response as not being helpful. A "no" answer on any response will not give you any more help than not answering but will give negative reinforcement to the person who responded. On the other hand, a "yes" answer to that question helps other users with the same or a similar question by directing them to the response.

<h2>            Many problems with the N8&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My N8 has a herd of problems that are ruining my user experience. I am soon looking to change to Apple if it doesn't get fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problems:</p>
<p>The internet closes on its own for no apparent reason, especially when I am in the middle of something important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the applications I download do not even register on the phone even thought they are directly from Ovi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applications that do register just close like they have a mind of their own. Also, some are very slow, and do not work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The battery life is very poor, and I read everything about the phone before I got it, and treated it very well, yet the battery is absolutely terrible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The screen unlocking takes a while to unlock sometimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Camera likes to close when I am using it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is very disappointing because I couldn't wait to get the phone, and it has let me down terribly. I don't even know if I can get a replacement or if they are all this terrible.</p>

<p>Here is an Idea, hook up your phone to your PC and sue ovi store to reinstall the FW. I've done these and usually help A lot, it will download the newest version of the FW from the server and installs it on your phone. You don't use anything on your phone.</p>
<p>Many of your problems sound software related and can just be a bad FW version.</p>
<p>I suggest using opera mobile for browsing. Its much better eventho I use the native browser every now and then and I actually find it useful at times. So yeah try that and see if it fixes your problems.</p>

            I agree. Make sure your software is upto date. You should expect to recharge overnite with moderate use.

<p>Man, I have exactly the same problems as you have. It's so anoying when internet just decides to take a break or something and closes. Even with Opera mobile, which I use all the time, the problem still remains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My battery is really inconsistent, the other day I charged it all night, but it was empty only 10 hours later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My screen unlocking has become terrible. I do not exactly know when it started, before or after the software update, but my screen unlocking is just terrible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My camera? Ridiculous. Not only the quality sucks (that MUST be my bad) but everytime I try to record something, after half a minute or so, it freezes. The red light on the back stays on, and sometimes I can continue using the phone but not the camera until
 I turn my nokia of and back on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>''It is very disappointing because I couldn't wait to get the phone, and it has let me down terribly. I don't even know if I can get a replacement or if they are all this terrible.''&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dude, you take the words out of my mouth. I was jumping up and down almost screaming (ofcourse not, but you know what I mean :P) when I got the phone, but only a week later, it started to freeze. And some more. and some more. Now, it freezes all the time.
 Right now, this moment, I am trying to put some more music on my phone, but it doesnt even connect to the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ive got loads and loads more problems with this thing, and the hard part is: My brother and my sister have got the Samsung Galaxy S. It hurts, cause that phone is soo awesomee, then I turn to my pitiful Nokia and im pis-sed off that I chose this phone. I
 hope it can get fixed, otherwise I'll just have to take the Samsung one way or the other. But man, this has been so dissapointing......</p>

<p>i sympathise with you my friend.i found out i increased my battery life by just removing simple things like the vibrate function when you scroll and beeps etc.also when not in heavy use i use the battery saving mode.worked for me.</p>

<p>Battery life is poor because Nokia default to turning a load of junk on you don't need. Remove all of the widgets. Turn off wifi scanning. Turn off bluetooth. Turn off the constant email checking. Then the battery life should be a lot better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The freezing can be a sign of the hardware issues. I'd just send it back and get a replacement if updating to the current firmware doesn't fix it as it means it is clearly faulty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mine started with a few of the same issues. I sent it back. It became unusuable. Wouldn't even work as a basic phone - couldn't message, couldn't make a call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found out the hard way with my previous nokia (n86) if it is unreliable to begin with it won't get better so it's best to send it back and get replacements until you get one that works properly.</p>

            I cannot disagree with you, Aldstar! I started to use Galaxy S after years of Nokia. Now I play with my set hundred times a day, news, quotes, mail, books, web etc. It's fantastic. I can't get enough of it. :-) Did you heard about Galaxy II coming to the
 market soon? No ungrounded promises, no delays, just coming. It must be a SMASHING hit, the iPhone now would be in a real danger. ;-) I'd buy it without hesitation. Thank you Nokia for your N91, N95, E66, not many thanks for N85, and no thanks at all for N97.
 But it has been over for 6 months already.

<p>Haha man Mojitto you sure are making me jealous, I will try to send my nokia to get it fixed, but if the problems remain, that Galaxy II sounds very very good to my ears. I actually have no idea why I took the N8, I just wanted to be different, everyone
 here has a blackberry or Iphone, so I went for the N8 and man I regret it. Anyway like I said, if the problems won't fix, I'll definitely take the Galaxy S or Galaxy II depending on when it will be released.</p>

<p>I actually treat my phone with the utmost respect. I read the whole manual before touching the phone, and I read online about how to preserve battery life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can say, I have never used Bluetooth ONCE on my N8, and one time when I tried to, it failed anyway. I deleted all lots of unnecessary widgets. I literally have OCD, anything that I don't use, I will not switch on; I try to be 100% efficient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I always lock the screen when not using it, and I never have vibrations on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I always update my N8 with the best software available because I want it to be at its best standard. However, my N8 still suffers from these problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, my battery life also shows the wrong amount of battery, and after my nephew played angry birds (at least one application seemed to download properly) for about half an hour, the battery showed full, but by the time I got home, it was on three
 bars!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually about&nbsp;angry birds, when I played it or the first time,&nbsp;it severly froze my&nbsp;phone such that nothing was responding, and I had to reset it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am worried that if I send my phone to Nokia, I won't get a replacement.</p>

            i had almost same problem and i find out most of the problems was because i was running to many heavy application on it like antivirus,2 task managers, 3 programs bloking calls etc which all was running in the background and finally was costing trouble
 to the phone<br />
<br />
if you have have heavy programs in a pc it will slow down as well if is not high ram<br />
<br />
or<br />
delete what heavy programs you dont really use and reinstall the software via pc<br />
or<br />
if you got it from nokia it has i think 30 days to return it for exchange<br />
or<br />
if the 30 days are over take it to nokia care to reinstall there the software again but back it up first

    <title>Recovery of my 18mb mix file in Photo Draw 2000 V2 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Recovery of my 18mb mix file in Photo Draw 2000 V2</h2>
                    I was unaware that when I saved and closed the .mix file that I was rendering yesterday, that, due to it's size, I would be unable to open it again with MS Photo Draw 2000 V2. Hence, three long days of my labor at digitally tracing and recreating my original
 pencil sketch is now unreachable by the one program that created it. I'm wondering if a better computer will help matters? My pc is running Vista Ultimate SP2, with an AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core processor 4200+ 2,21 Ghz, 18MB RAM, 32Bit OS. I'm running the
 program in compatibility mode.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I note, in Windows Task Manager, that the program tries to open the file using the memory of only one of my two processors, even though I have Affinity set to use both. It maxes out the available memory at 50% and then just sends me an error message. Do I need
 more RAM? I tired increasing the Priority of the program, without success. I've also tried to allocate more Virtual Memory to each of the two hard drives that I have, doubling the recommended amount but this didn't help either.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since the program was created when only single core processors were in use, I suspect that the dual core that I now have or even a quad core system might be part of the issue.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your response!

=============================================<br />
First...the info Anula D'Souza refers to is specific for Picture It! <br />
.mix files and would probably not be useful for PhotoDraw .mix <br />
files.<br />
<br />
There is a slight chance that setting afinity to use only one core<br />
may be worth a try.<br />

            Anula, <br />
<br />
Thanks you for your suggestion. I tried using PolyView. It didn't work. I also just tried Microsoft Digital Image Starter Edition 2006. While this program recognizes the .mix file format, it did not open the file.&nbsp;I received an error message "Sorry this file
 can't be opened".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
PhotoDraw offers me the following error message. "There may not be enough memory to complete this operation, the image may be too large or another problem may exist. Please save your work, restart Microsoft PhotoDraw and try again."<br />
<br />
At nearly 18mb, my file appears to be larger than PhotoDraw can handle. I wasn't aware of that issue until I tried to access my file yesterday, to continue to work on my digital drawing project. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Though I've used PhotoDraw for many years, to create other graphic projects, I've only recently started exploring using this program to digitally render some of my old sketchbook pencil drawings. I'm able to recreate them with clean digital lines, like
 a vector graphics illustration. I stumbled upon a means to accomplish this using PhotoDraw but I wasn't aware of the file size limitations inherent in the program.
<br />
<br />
I like the intuitive nature of PhotoDraw and the fact that it's relatively easy to use. With a low learning curve, and the simple set of tools to choose from in PhotoDraw, I've been able to accomplish a great deal. While other drawing programs that I've explored
 contain many wonderful and some very similar tools, I have yet to find another program with exactly the same vector graphics drawing features offered in PhotoDraw. Even Digital Image Starter Edition 2006 doesn't contain the same features.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;The file that I'm trying to recover contains three jpg files, the images that I was tracing, one small text file and the digital tracing file that I was working on, which is made up of many tiny curved and straight black lines, 1pt. in thickness. This is the
 part of the file that I would like to recover.<br />
<br />
I did manage to get PolyView to save one of the three jpg files within this project but I already had this file scanned and saved elsewhere. So, that was an unnecessary effort. PolyView was not able to recover any portion of my digital rendering work, which
 took me three long days to create.&nbsp;</div>

            Thank you Volunteer J.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I had not considered limiting the program's ability to access memory from only one of the two processors with the Affinity setting. I did note, using Task Manager, that it was only drawing it's resources from only one of the two. Perhaps, directing it
 use only one processor might help. <br />
<br />
I just tried that idea out and here's what happens. In Task Manager, the column named 'CPU' jumps from 00 to 50 and hovers between 48 and 49. Meanwhile in the column titled 'Memory', it indicates that my computer manages to use up to 45,000 K before it gives
 up and tries again. After a couple of ties, the computer stops trying to open the file and sends the error message.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there a setting which can be altered, to allow the processor to access as much memory as is needed to perform the operation? If I can gain access to the file I can cut it into smaller pieces and make it more manageable for the program to deal with.
<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I'm faced with the task of starting from scratch and re-rendering all of my work. Only with this lesson well learned, I'll be careful to recreate my project in small sections, which can be assembled together, to complete the finished work.</div>

==================================<br />
Thanks for the detailed info...<br />
<br />
My personal thought on the issue is that an 18MB <br />
.mix file is not excessive and I doubt that file size <br />
or lack of memory is the cause of this issue. <br />
<br />
Maybe the .mix file became corrupted somehow.<br />
<br />
Regretfully...I do not have a solution for you.<br />

            Hmmm, corruption is rampant everywhere, why not in my software folders. I have found that this issue has happened before with some jpg files that I try to view via PhotoDraw. The error comes up and mentions that they may be damaged. I scratch my head at
 this random description. Because I find that I can open the same files using other programs, like MS Office Picture Manager. I wonder if I could take a copy of the file to someone who has a far better machine, in terms of memory and if they would be able to
 open it?&nbsp;

            You'd think, that after all of the these years, with all of the advances that have been made to computers and software programs of all kinds, that someone would have developed a solution to this issue. Why create a&nbsp;proprietary file format, when everyone

Microsoft is always in the process of fixing bugs in their programs. How much time could it actually take to create the fix for this issue?&nbsp;&nbsp;It's only been about 12 years since this program was first being released. Surely the guys who wrote this code are still

============================================<br />
You could certainly try the file on a different machine but if it <br />
is corrupted only a data recovery service could recover the file<br />
and that can get expensive.<br />
<br />
Best bet may be to start over and be sure to save a copy of<br />
each successive edit in a photo format like .jpg, .png, .tiff...<br />
then if it happens again it won't be a total loss.<br />

            Is there a filter, program or tool that allows the conversion of Microsoft Photodraw 2000 *.MIX (Layered images) files to something similar, which allows layered images to be edited such as Adobe Photoshop *.PSD file?

            Hi, I hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />You cannot do it by hours, the most similar thing you can do is to add the before and after conditions but that only work for days, sorry.
<br />
<br />Regards.

<h2>            1520 sensors not working after denim update</h2>
                    I recently updated my uk 1520 to denim and now the movement sensor isn't working , screen rotation is very delayed and games such as temple run 2 and doodle jump are un playable. Anyone got any thoughts how to sort this problem.

            <p>Hi TonyaBellxl, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to your post, movement sensor stopped working since you installed Denim update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may perform soft reset by pressing and holding volume down + power buttons until the phone restarts. If the issue still persists, I would suggest you back up all the content on the phone and reinstall the OS trough the Software Recovery Tool. The tool
 erases all the stuff so please make sure you have backed up everything:</p>

    <title>Office 365 MFA &#34;Don&#39;t Ask Again for XX Days&#34; not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timbaker1956  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 MFA &#34;Don&#39;t Ask Again for XX Days&#34; not remembering All devices</h2>
                    <p>In our O365 Tenancy we have Enforced MFA for some users. We have also allowed "Don't ask again for 60 days"</p>
<p>We also have ADFS 2 as part of the authentication.</p>
<p>When users logs into domain PC a script runs to map some team sites folders and personal one drive. The script can detect and capture MFA Code from Mobile Authenticator App (user input box) and also check the "Don't Ask" Box.</p>
<p>This works well for all Windows 7 PCs and most Windows 10 - but not all Windows 10 pcs.</p>
<p>On the failing Windows 10 pcs - logging in to portal.office.com via IE brings user to Enter MFA Code box and shows "Don't Ask Again" - however when checking the box - the device is not remembered and "Don't Ask Again" is displayed again at next login the
 following day.</p>
<p>If we create a new profile on failing windows 10 pc - the "Don't Ask Again" works as expected.</p>
<p>Which leads me to believe there is something in the existing user profile of that causes the&nbsp; "Don't Ask Again" to fail for that user.</p>
<p>I have tried Resetting IE, deleting credentials in Credential Manager etc.<br />
I could delete the existing profile for the effected users and start again - however that would be very disruptive and since most of the effected users are senior managers - not good PR.<br />
So suggestions of what maybe causing the problem and suggested solutions are most welcome.<br />

<p>Hi Tim, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I could understand your feeling. It caused some problems for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As when you use the feature on Chrome or creating a new user profile, the issue didn't occur, the issue is not related to MFA feature.</p>
<p>It maybe caused by Internet Explorer browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the situation, since our category only focus on Office 365, about Internet Explorer issue, I suggest you post a new thread via the following category:</p>
<p><strong>Internet Explorer</strong>/<strong>Internet Explorer 11</strong>/<strong>Window 10</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.<br />
Qing</p>

<h3> tom_whitfield  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote on iPad and Windows ruled lines don&#39;t align</h2>
                    <p>When creating a new page with lines in OneNote, the iPad and Windows (Office 2016) versions no longer show the same ruled line spacing, so my hand written notes don't align with ruled lines on the PC but they do on the iPad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back through old notes this is not a problem until some time between June 13 and June 14 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screenshot attached of ruled lines on the iPad where I have drawn over them, displayed on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on our test, this is an expected behavior if you create a notebook on OneNote app and open it in OneNote 2016, the ruler lines won't align.</p>
