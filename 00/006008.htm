                    I just went to update my Windows Acer Switch 10 to Windows 10 Technical Preview, and it say it's a compressed system and cannot complete. Is there anyway I can change the platform to not compressed?

<p>Hi, inter222.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting and welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we know your phone model? Upon checking, the weather service provided by the Maps Weather app on the Symbian phones has been discontinued in Dec 2013. The service is not available any more and there will be error
<strong>"The latest forecast is not available"</strong> when trying to load the forecast.</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For alternative weather apps, please check Nokia Store, there are several weather apps available in Nokia Store.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>About your concern in Viber app, what error message are you getting? Do you have a stable Cellular data or Wi-Fi connection? What is the exact error message that you are getting? Are you trying to download the said app from the Nokia Store?&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>As mentioned by many people above - how shoddy of Nokia to disregard all the people who have supported them over the years ! I have been using Nokia exclusively since buying a 1610 in the&nbsp;mid 1980's, and always recommended Nokia to anyone who asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How rude of Nokia to now shoot me in the foot by unceremoniously pulling the rug from under my feet ! No more Symbian phones, no more weather updates - for an OS component !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried to load Viber on my phone. Viber.com sent me to the Nokia shop, where I was told "Sorry, this item is no longer available" ?????</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Symbian OS&nbsp;was a serious contender to iOS and Android in my mind - wouldn't it have been wonderful to see how Belle performed on an advances multi processor&nbsp;handset with serious RAM ! What a shame this will proobably never come about ... :smileyfrustrated:</p>

<p>I am sure its about feeling envious towards Nokia!!! when Nokia was on the top of the world of mobiles, some riffraffs from Microsoft wished to see Nokia disappeared, I think you now understood what happened and what else will be happened when the dream
 came true!!! by the way its not only WEATHER stopped or Viber but also one of the best programs ever was stopped and here I am talking about&nbsp; Nokia Internet Radio and also without any warning, I did read all the comments and discussions at that time and they
 "Nokia-MicroShit" used same method as I saw it now, trying to look incent as usual then under the presure they admited and really they looked bad, I am sure the time is coming soon when we woke up someday and our phones are not functioning because some monky
 from&nbsp; MicroShit decided to end it early, same on you Mockia MicroShit.</p>

<p>Why dont you stop playing games or playing stupidity with us, you know damn well its about the GREAT Old Nokia and New **bleep** Nokia, you are trying to sell **bleep** to us but oh no never, no matter what you do to convince us about the **bleep** new Nokia,
 you did not respect us when you are removing srvice after service, the only thing you succeeded to do is one thing: the hell with MicroShit products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aboviously its the feeling envious towards the Great Old Nokia N8!!! when Nokia was on the top of the world of mobiles, some riffraffs from Microsoft wished to see Old Nokia disappeared, I think you now understood what happened and what else will be happened

                    <p>I have intermittent problems with connecting to friends in Western Australia. The connection can freeze or go fuzzy etc, which looks as if it's a download/upload speed problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way of checking the actual Skype connection speed before or during the Skype call, so I know where the problem lies? I'm supposed to have a download speed of c. 30Mbps and upload c. 8Mbps<br />

    <title>WM 6 Standard Proxy settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> etnaelk  say:</h3>
<h2>            WM 6 Standard Proxy settings</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I just got a new Softbank X02HT which is a Smartphone running WM6 Standard and am having trouble setting up a proxy connection for both WiFi and GPRS.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
On my old Softbank X01HT, PocketPC, WM 6 Professional there are different settings for proxy connections.&nbsp; In this (touch screen) version, I am able to set up a proxy that works for both my WiFi connection and GPRS connection.&nbsp; The proxy runs on the device's
 localhost 127.0.0.1 and intercepts all requests from IE, logs them, then goes to the web to complete the request.&nbsp; There is a setting in which I can point both my Network Adapter (WLAN) to connect to Work and have a Cellular connection via GPRS all in one
 configuration.&nbsp; Then I have a proxy server that connects from Work to The Internet.<br />
<br />
On WM 6 Standard (non-touch screen), the settings are different.&nbsp; I can set Internet Explorer Connections setting to use The Internet, have my GPRS connect to Work, and have my proxy running on 127.0.0.1 connect from&nbsp; Work to The Internet.&nbsp; This will intercept
 my GPRS packets and force them to go through my proxy as in the professional configuration.&nbsp; The only problem is with the WiFi configuration on Standard is that regardless if I tell it to connect to Network type Internet or Private/Work Network, it simply
 goes to the Internet with IE and disregards the fact that I want it to go through my proxy.<br />
<br />
I apologize its so winded I just wanted to be clear.&nbsp; If anyone knows how to configure WiFi to a proxy on WM 6 Standard or has any ideas on this, I'd really appreciate all the help I can get...<br />
<br />
Does Work = Private/Work Network (doesn't seem like it)<br />
Does Internet = The Internet (??)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
Nick<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            According to the Registry values:<br />
<br />
//the GPRS connection:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Comm\ConnMgr\Providers\{7C4B7A38-5FF7-4bc1-80F6-5DA7870BB1AA}\Connections\SoftBank<br />
DestId = {A1182988-0D73-439E-87AD-2A5B369F808B}<br />
<br />
//the WiFi connection:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Comm\ConnMgr\Providers\{9eefcedf-a6bc-4457-a8ae-fb664a196450}\001601DA3470<br />
DestId = {A1182988-0D73-439E-87AD-2A5B369F808B}<br />
<br />
//the Proxy:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Comm\ConnMgr\Providers\{EF097F4C-DC4B-4c98-8FF6-AEF805DC0E8E}\LSProxy<br />
SrcId =&nbsp; {A1182988-0D73-439E-87AD-2A5B369F808B}<br />
DestId = {436EF144-B4FB-4863-A041-8F905A62C572}<br />
<br />
and then<br />
<br />
// The Internet<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Comm\ConnMgr\Destinations\The Internet<br />
DestId = {436EF144-B4FB-4863-A041-8F905A62C572}<br />
<br />
// Work<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Comm\ConnMgr\Destinations\Work<br />
DestId = {A1182988-0D73-439E-87AD-2A5B369F808B}<br />
<br />
So it appears that <br />
<span><span>Work = Private/Work Network<br />
Internet = The Internet<br />
<br />
are both true statements.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the WiFi still ignores the proxy.&nbsp; Any help is still appreciated.<br />
<br />

<h2>            950 getting so hot, it caused damage and wooden table started to smolder</h2>
                    Not sure what's going on with our new Microsoft 950s but my spouses phone got so hot yesterday that it damaged our table causing it so smolder.&nbsp; If we hadn't smelled it, I think the table would have caught fire.&nbsp; The phone burned my spouse's hand.&nbsp; Has
 anyone else experienced this? I'm thinking of going back to AT&amp;T or Microsoft to ask for a refund.

            Hi Erica 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask what is the version of the Skype app you are currently using and if you have already tried to use the Skype for Web to check if the speaker issue would persist.

<p>Thank you so much.&nbsp; It is a new computer with the latest version of windows 10.&nbsp; I was able to solve the problem because the PC had the sound unable and all I did was to enable it and I got sound and checked Skype and the ring was there.&nbsp; Thank you again

                    Is there a command line for accdc files to auto extract without entering a location or name. Values will come from the database file and the default directory setting option.

            Please clarify your question. Access databases are usually "accdb" or "accde" files; I've never heard of an aacdc file. It's not at all clear what you're trying to extract. And typically an Access Table will have many records; how can you decide which
 of those records should be extracted.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>If you use Save as &gt; Advanced &gt; Package and sign then Access will</p>
<p>create a package and generate the accdc file that</p>
<p>is compressed and signed by a cert.</p>
<p>Running this file will open a form to provide a name and location</p>
<p>for the extracted database.</p>
<p>I want to bypass the form and extract to a defined location with</p>
<p>command line options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, there is also an accdr extension that is just a rename of</p>
<p>accdb but the database operates as a runtime file.</p>
<p>You can also pass the /runtime switch to an accdb file</p>
<p>to get the same effect.</p>

            What version of Access? The Packaging wizard has, I believe been deprecated. Now was it something frequently used. You can simulate this by using a self extracting zip file.

<h2>            Office 365 applications insist on signing in to one drive every time i save a document</h2>
                    <p>Hi, having problems saving using office365 to one drive. The issue lies with 365 as my colleague across the office (pc-based office suite, same onedrive account) can save to onedrive fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever i save a document, even if i want to save it locally, it insists on me signing in to the onedrive account. It never used to do this, only this afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Darren</p>

            <p>Hi Pete,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first thought is that it's a different version somehow (different OS, different bit size, different version of MSE - possibly older, different country or language - maybe still English, but Canadian English or UK English vs. USA English,...).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mine on 32-bit Vista Business SP2 shows "PC status: Protected."&nbsp; I'm using the following (from clicking the down arrow next to Help at the top of MSE and then clicking about:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Antimalware Client Version: 4.1.522.0</p>
<p>Engine Version: 1.1.8904.0</p>
<p>Antivirus definition: 1.139.63.0</p>
<p>Antispyware definition: 1.139.63.0</p>
<p>Network Inspection System Engine Version: 2.1.8600.0</p>
<p>Network Inspection System Definition Version: 15.12.0.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, going back to a much older article from another counttry in 2010, I see "Computer Status: Protected":
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/canada/protect/protect-your-computer/antispyware-technology/article.aspx?article=help-protect-your-pc-with-microsoft-security-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/canada/protect/protect-your-computer/antispyware-technology/article.aspx?article=help-protect-your-pc-with-microsoft-security-essentials</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, let's see if we can figure out the cause:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; On the one different computer, please post in your reply the same information about it that I included about mine above (including the Operating System).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; When did you start using MSE on that computer (was it before you did on any of the others and long ago)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Were or are you in the MSE Pre-release program and/or did you convert from that to the standard MSE program?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; What country are you in (or was that computer in when MSE was&nbsp;downloaded)&nbsp;and from where did you download the MSE that's installed?&nbsp; Is this any different than any of the other computers - meaning did you use the MSE main site for most but some other
 site for this computer (like Microsoft Download or even some third party site)?&nbsp; Did you install MSE on all the computers yourself or was it installed by someone else on this one computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Is there absolutely anything you know different between the this computer and the others?&nbsp; Is is the only one using that OS or that version of MSE or the only one that's 64-bit rather than 32-bit or anything different about it at all (aside from what
 you pointed out)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; How long has this been different?&nbsp; Are you suggesting it has changed when the others did not or that it has not changed when the others did?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Is MSE otherwise functioning fine on all of your computers including this one despite that difference?&nbsp; Is it updating autoatically and properly?&nbsp; Is it scanning properly?&nbsp; Does the icon in the notification area show green?&nbsp; Are any of the settings different
 and unique on this one computer than the others (I mean ANY setting you can see)?&nbsp; Has this one computer been infected in any way?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answers to the above (and the requested information)&nbsp;may help us identify the reason.&nbsp; Frankly, I've never paid attention before, so I can't say for certain - but while I don't think it changed for me, it may have.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;not sure I'd have noticed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and good luck.&nbsp; Your response should help us narrow down the reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Ha ha, thanks for noticing this. Maybe the student was writing and the screenshot was taken right before she added the squared :) I will let the team know.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there is normally a reson for not providing one app for a particular model, normally a incompatibility. You have to to think about upgrading to a Nokia 302, Nokia 210, or go for another operating system like</p>
<p>a) Nokia Belle and a Nokia 700,</p>
<p>b) Windows Phone and a Nokia Lumia 510.</p>

    <title>Sort order for OneDrive files when I open Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chas362  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sort order for OneDrive files when I open Word</h2>
                    <p>I posted my query in a thread on the OneDrive forum, but I've been told it's an Office issue and to post here instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using O365 and can sort the files on OneDrive into any order I choose if, that is, I go to OneDrive.com or use the OneDrive app. I can save that sorting order and it retains that order when I next open up OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I go into Word or Excel and want to open a file, the files do not display in that same order. Instead I get them in what looks like an unordered sequence and I have to scroll through them to find what I want. I cannot manage to change their
 order within Word or Excel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what I may be doing wrong or failing to do, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using the latest versions of O365 (installed Monday) on a Mac and iPad - both with the latest operating systems.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your detailed and interesting reply. I downloaded the latest version of O365 Home (installed Monday as per my first post). So Word tells me that the version you supplied me to download is version 15.19.1 (160212).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, here are the screen grabs you requested. The first shows some of my daily schedule files in the correct order (date modified) when I open OneDrive; the second (with the larger icons and in just one column) shows what I see when I click Open within
 Word and the order is quite different and, frankly, puzzling. I have no idea on what basis it has been sorted. It is certainly not the same. I have tried using the OneDrive.com website to order the files in various sequences, but that makes no difference when
 I go into Word and look at the file sequence it presents. I look forward to receiving your guidance as I assume it must be user error on my part, it simply cannot be Microsoft's fault. Thank you in advance for your kind help.</p>

<h2>            can&#39;t set up my outlook account on android devise</h2>
                    Hi everyone
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried many times to set up my outlook account on an android devise using the inbuilt email app but doesn't work</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It keeps saying wrong username or password even though I certainly use the correct information. I can even sign in to my outlook account using the browser on my tablet with the same username and PW that won't work with the email app</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>so what's that and how can it be resolved?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>every help is highly appreciated</div>

<p>I have also succesfully configured at setup the Office365 on the phone so I'm able to acces my documents etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But to setup mails, I am using the default e-mail program to receive and read mails, but found out to download Outlook seperately. Unfortunately I can't find the setup settings in the application and therefore it thinks it shall use my Google account or
 someting like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I setup my Outlook on the phone to reflect the one installed on my Laptop?</p>

                    <p>There are a large number of these problems, and I try to follow them reading down step by step as someone tries to fix it.&nbsp; Surely, the resources of Microsoft would allow this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Put at the top of these pages the "fix" that seemed to work the best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Or how about just letting us download it again?</p>

    <title>Intel RST not reinstalled in release 14271.rs1 release. 160218-2310 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wbbaker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel RST not reinstalled in release 14271.rs1 release. 160218-2310</h2>
                    In the prior build 14267, the Intel RST was not working. After going to the Intel website and downloading the "Intel Driver Update Utility 2.4" and installing it, I clicked "launch program" and nothing happens. So I deleted the Intel RST program via the
 Control Panel/Programs. I assumed that when I downloaded and installed build 14271 (details above) that the Intel RST program would automatically be installed by Microsoft. No, it was not. I tried to run the Intel Utility noted previously and it does not seem
 to launch. At least nothing happens. I'm very disappointed with the Intel website. Not helpful. What should I do and is anyone else seeing this issue? Shouldn't Microsoft provide the Intel "stuff"?

<p>I've done this and the instructions are poor. There is an application which I ran as administrator, but nothing happened. I unzipped the folder and ran two batch files. I still don't see RST under my programs via Control Panel. I would like to see very explicit
 instructions on how to install the RST. They don't exist on the Intel website as far as I can see. Also, my impression from reading forums is that when you download an OS from Microsoft, Microsoft by agreement with Intel installs the relevant Intel programs
 as well.</p>

    <title>Problem with rewards account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> malachy_880  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with rewards account</h2>
                    I have had a rewards account for several years now and until now had no problems. Last night I tried to redeem points only to have system tell me that my email address is not a rewards account. I have been using the same email address for years. I cannot
 contact support because that requires logging in with a rewards account. I do not have multiple accounts nor do I use bots. I am still able to earn points and checking my status shows I am a gold member. I redeemed points about two weeks ago without issue.
 Any assistance or suggestions would be appreciated, thank you.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't find Tools because you're using Edge, not Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge has, by design, very limited toolbar options. Explore all of the options in the upper right, 3 dots, 3 bars and circle with dots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also have IE11 installed on Windows 10 and can use IE11 instead of Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Edge and want to use IE11, click on&nbsp;the 3 dots at the upper right corner&nbsp;and select Open with Internet Explorer.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>do you mean this web address</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://my.screenname.aol.com</p>
<p>? (please include the full address of any websites that you are having problems with your questions.... this allows us to visit the exact same pages as you to make some tests and to give an informed answer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Security tab,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click "Reset all zones to default"</p>
<p>2. Trusted Sites icon, 'Sites' button, remove all aol website domains from your list.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Close and restart IE for the full changes to take affect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trusted sites list in IE is mostly used by large companies for e-commerce between themselves and corporate service providers.... The web security for sites/domains in the Trusted sites list is ACTUALLY lower.... for example unsigned ActiveX controls
 are allowed to run in sites that are in the Trusted Zone....</p>
<p>
</p><p>THERE SHOULD BE NO REASON WHY HOME USERS SHOULD PLACE PUBLIC WEBSITES IN THEIR IE TRUSTED SITES LIST......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Public websites like aol, google, facebook and msn use a number of different domains (web site names) to validate your site credentials. for example google uses
<a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.google.com</a> and account.google.com</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>IE has a security setting that "Prevents navigation into a zone of lower integrity", so if say you have only google.com in your IE Trusted sites list, IE prevents the navigation to account.google.com that is required for your google account verification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the secure protocol (https) works just as well (that is communication is encrypted) for all web sites in all of IEs security zones. THERE IS NO NEED TO PLACE A WEBSITE IN THE IE TRUSTED SITES LIST IF IT USES HTTPS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;aside&gt;</p>
<p>AOL have their own support forums. When asking specific questions about THEIR sites and IE you may find seasoned answers from their support forums.</p>
<p>&lt;/aside&gt;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>Do you mean when you initiate Hybrid remote to move mailboxes to Office 365, you encountered this error message above? If so, to help you troubleshoot this issue, we would like to confirm the following information?
<br />
1.&nbsp;Please share the screenshot of the error you encountered.<br />
2.&nbsp;Please run the cmdlet below and send us the results via PM. <br />
<strong>$Credentials = Get-Credential<br />

<strong>adminCount</strong> attribute set to 1. If it is 1, please set it to 0 to see if there is any improvement.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the results. Accordingly, the connection to the on-premises Exchange server failed due to Autodiscover configuration. I’m still a bit not clear about the issue symptom. To sort out the issue more efficiently, I would like to confirm the
 following information.<br />
1.&nbsp;Can you describe the detailed migration problem that you are experiencing? Are you able to actually successfully submit a migration request? Please share the screenshot of the error you encountered. To upload images, please click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and then select the<strong> Insert/Edit Media</strong> button.<br />
2.&nbsp;Can you describe the method that you are using to migrate mailboxes into Office 365 -&nbsp; is this ECP/EMC or via PowerShell?<br />
3.&nbsp;Can you confirm the version of Exchange on the hybrid server, 2010 or 2013?<br />
4.&nbsp;How many hybrid servers do you have and are they load balanced?<br />
5.&nbsp;Are the Hybrid server(s) &amp; Mailbox servers in the same AD site/location?<br />
6.&nbsp;And if the batch was submitted successfully, please check if you can run the following cmdlet then send us the results via PM<br />

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>Really appreciated for the information. Do you mean you are able to create migration batch and issue about “<strong>Error: MigrationTransientException: The call to ‎'fqdnservername/.../mrsproxy.svc‎' failed. Error details: Access is denied</strong>” disappear
 after the IP opened from the firewall? If it is not this case, can you run the cmdlets below so that we can help you troubleshoot?<br />
<strong>Get-MigrationBatch -identity “name of the migration batch” |fl <br />
Get-MoveRequest -identity “name of the migration request” |fl</strong></p>
<p>Regarding “<strong>the IP (13.67.xx.xx) it returned</strong>”, can you let us know if you mean the IP resolved from the namespaces such as yourdomain.autodiscover.com? You can send us the complete results in PM so that we can know what happened.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Ran<br />

<p>i spoke too soon. the migration batch went but when i went to complete the batch this morning the same error occurred.</p>
<p>what i meant in the earlier post was the failed test <strong>test-migrationserveravailability -exchangeremotemove -autodiscover -emailaddress
</strong>saying go to </p>
<p><a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/</a>. when i tried the test from there it failed. i did an nslookup which produced the result;</p>
<p>which is an ip address out of singapore. we block ip from singapore and many other countries because we're in california. when we opened that ip the mrca worked and was able to start the migration batch.
</p>
<p>today the ip address for <a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/</a></p>
<p>which is in ireland. which we do not block. and it passes the tests so it must be something else again.</p>
