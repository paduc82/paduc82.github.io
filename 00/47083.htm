    <title>All video and audio playback on laptop suddenly lagging&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            All video and audio playback on laptop suddenly lagging&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes I'll be listening to music or watching videos on my laptop when suddenly and completely randomly, all kinds of playback - video and audio - suddenly starts playing at half their usual speed and all audio has this dreadful static-y sound behind
 it. I would describe it as buzzing or crackling, or a metallic-sounding griding or crunching. This applies to all sounds my computer makes, from Youtube videos to offline videos to the alert sounds my computer makes. I even remember a time where I was using
 my laptop's camera and even my own self being shown on the screen was moving at half speed. The only way to fix this is to restart the computer. I've tried troubleshooting sounds, all it does is install the same (probably faulty) Realtek audio driver and the
 problem isn't fixed at all, it keeps coming back. This happens completely at random, sometimes I'm doing something with the computer, other (most) times I'm not even touching it and I just have it on as background noise while I'm doing something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I've noticed is that whenever I restart the laptop after one of these episodes, I get the spinning white dots with "Please wait" under them as if it were updating or fixing something. But when I check for updates it says my PC is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do? I wish I could attach audio or video files to better illustrate what I mean but it doesn't seem like there's an easy solution to all this.</p>

            Hi Katie, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />I'd firstly suggest that you try a clean boot, which may help your poor performance. It might be a background app or service interfering, so give this a try:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />Then, try updating your graphics card drivers to the latest version. Depending on the brand of your graphics card, you can find the drivers here:
<br />
<br />AMD Radeon:
<br /><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amd.com/en/support</a>
<br />NVIDIA GeForce:
<br /><a href="https://www.geforce.com/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.geforce.com/drivers</a>
<br />Intel Graphics:
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />Once you've tried the above, reboot your PC and see if performance improves. If not, let me know how you go and I'll see what else we can try! Thanks!

            Hi Katie
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these steps for both Video and Audio
<br />
<br />VIDEO:
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />AUDIO:

<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio

<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />

<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing.

            <p>Hi Mike judge,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft Community forum. I understand that you are facing issue with accessing websites and receiving error message “connection
 was reset”. In order to provide you with a quick resolution, please reply to these questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any change son the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is the issue confined to iPlayer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you try using Internet Explorer and check the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m glad to provide you with these methods which will help you to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> I would suggest you to run the network troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Using the Network troubleshooter in Windows 7</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> If the above method does not help, let’s temporarily disable antivirus software on the computer as a test and then proceed
 with connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Make sure you turn-on the antivirus software later.</p>
<p><b>Warning:
</b></p>
<p>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you
 have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span>Disable antivirus software</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Method 3:
</b>I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of
 startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

<p><b>Note:
</b>After troubleshooting, make sure to set the computer to start as usual as mentioned in
<b>Step 3</b> from the KB article mentioned above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need further assistance, please reply and we will be happy to help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 4:</b> I would also suggest you to visit the manufacturer’s website and update the network drivers to the latest version available
 for Windows 7 and check if that fixes the issue.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Which version of windows installer is installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>As a work around you may also try to follow the steps provided below, which would help you to
<strong><span>unregister and re-register Windows installer.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the "Start" menu, Click on “Run” and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Open" box, type "msiexec /unreg", and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the "Start" menu, Click on “Run” and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Open" box, type "msiexec /regserver", and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method </span></strong><strong><span>2: </span></strong><span><br />
Also I would suggest you to update your Windows Installer Package with the latest version of Windows Installer available in the link below.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable: </span></strong><b><span><br />

            Do try those Support Engineer ideas and see if they help.<br />
<br />
I think I would just check to see what version of Windows Installer you have before going to all that trouble and I find workarounds unacceptable "solutions".<br />
<br />
It is too bad that we don't know anything about your system, but that is the way they choose to run things here.<br />
<br />
HP printers used to have a program called Instant Share, but I think <a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00063957&amp;tmp_task=useCategory&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=444649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
it has been discontinued</a>.<br />
<br />
Do you now or have you ever had any HP printers installed and if so, have you updated any software for them?<br />
<br />
There is also malicious software that come to mind, so you should check for that anyway before troubleshooting:<br />
<br />
<div>Download, install, update and do at least one full scan with these free malware detection programs:</div>

<p>even i tried downloading from a different isp from different computer and what not but still the download is not completing .</p>
<p>It stops after downloading some mbs then speed goes to &nbsp;- 0 bytes and then i wont get any speed but if i again restart the download it will start. Sometime it does not starts and redirects the page where i get error 404 link not found.</p>
<p>On chrome and internet explorer the downloads don't stop it shows that it downloaded but when i go see the file size it is only around 500 MB or some time 2.5 GB. I tried downloading another big file from them they download quiet well means does not gets
 interrupted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My internet connection is slow at 1 mbps in my city there is no connection more than 4 mbps.</p>
<p>looks like i need to have a high speed not less than 50 mbps connection to download this file. :(</p>
<p>

            <p>Nevermind, I got a Win7 Ultimate x64 SP1 ISO from a Microsoft tech support rep. It was the same file and md5 sum as one I got from a German site that had mirrored all the TechNet and Digital River downloads. The key was successfully registered valid and
 activated. Whew.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as mentioned before, the Software Recovery page is extremely buggy and often fails to validate, or in my case, after the first few attempts, load at all. It was down for several hours, even after I had installed Win7 and was able to get online.</p>

<h2>            XPS 12 Tablet mode and Auto rotate problems since latest Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 launched auto update yesterday.&nbsp; Today my first generation Dell XPS 12 (2 in 1 with the crazy flipping screen) no longer switches into tablet mode when the screen is flipped.&nbsp; Auto rotate is also now buggy and the screen frequently gets locked
 in the wrong orientation.&nbsp; Extreme (90 degree or more) rotation will reset the orientation correctly.&nbsp; Tablet mode can be turned on manually.&nbsp; I have double checked all the Display settings and re-started several times.&nbsp; Even tried disabling HID Sensor Collection
 V2, restarting, enabling, restarting.&nbsp; No success.</p>
<p>If anyone has encountered this and found a solution, please advise.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
An outdated sensor driver is one of the possible reasons why you are having issues using the tablet mode and auto rotate feature on your Windows 10 device. We suggest that you try to download and install the latest driver from the manufacturer's website of
 your device. You can follow the steps in this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware-winpc/how-to-install-and-update-hardware-drivers-in/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">
Forum Article</a> that was provided by <strong>Andre Da Costa</strong> and go to the section,
<strong>How to find and download drivers from the manufacturers website</strong>.<br />
<br />
Should you need further assistance, don't hesitate to get back to us.

            I had used Dell's 'Support Assist' program to download and install any old drivers (there were three). The drivers that were downloaded and installed had no obvious correlation to the problem I am encountering, and they did not repair the malfunction.&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>If preinstalled, you can also&nbsp;contact your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.
</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost, IF they still have them available (Most don't).</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you do have a Manufacturer's Recovery Partition on your Hard Drive and you can Boot into Windows, you should be able to make and have&nbsp;your own Recovery Disks from it to reinstall the Operating System in case of Hard Drive failure.</p>
<p>Look under Programs &gt; your Computer Manufacturer's name &gt; then their System Tools or Recovery Software Headings for them, depending how it is worded.</p>
<p>If you can not find any reference to it, contact the&nbsp;Manufacturer for advice on how to make those Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can borrow the exact same edition of Windows 7 Retail DVD and use your Product Key on the COA sticker to reinstall the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can use this for preinstalled OEM&nbsp;or Retail Licenses</p>

<h2>            On 16th August, Print Screen saved to Screenshots folder. On 18th after 10586.545, it does not.  Why and how do I fix it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 continues to frustrate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Print Screen, and ALT+Print Screen to save screenshots to a folder in my Pictures folder within OneDrive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last successful use of that was 16th August.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I logged on today, there awas a notification that updates had been installed.&nbsp; Winver shows me to be now on 10586.545.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I tried to do the same ALT+Print Screen as usual, and nothing happened.&nbsp; No image aded to my Screenshots folder.&nbsp; Indeed, not saved anywhere I can find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does seem as if I can paste the clipboard into an image app and save from there, but that is not the point.&nbsp; I also know there are other options such as Snipping tool, but that is a pain in the neck, as it insists on calling everything capture.png, and
 will NOT add (1) to a file name like the previous method did.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get Windows to save Print Screen to my C:\Users\MyName\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots folder like it used to?</p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to respond. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As it happens all has now returned to normal</p>
<p>I was saving to my dropbox/pictures /screenshots folder</p>
<p>No error or any other messages were showing.</p>
<p>I had been saving there since windows 7, and have even using Windows 10 site last October.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd not changed the location </p>
<p>I had tried a restart and it made no difference.</p>
<p>Finally yesterday I shut down the laptop and left it for half an hour before turning it back on.</p>
<p>The screenshot now works as before and gives a pop up bottom right confirming that. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>After Win10 Updat&#59;e, Epson Work Force Pro WF-4630 printer not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dancolley  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Win10 Updat&#59;e, Epson Work Force Pro WF-4630 printer not found</h2>
                    During the evening of 12/16-12/17, Windows 10 performed an update.&nbsp; When I woke my computer up and restarted it, I attempted to print a file using my browser's (Firefox) print feature.&nbsp; A prompt told me that the printer was not found.&nbsp; I opened Word and
 attempted to print an existing document in the file and got the same type of prompt from the system.&nbsp; Thinking that the default selection had slipped, I went to the control panel and could not even find my printer listed in the list of printers in my system.&nbsp;
 Something has happened during the update and now I cannot print.&nbsp; I see that there are a boat-load of complaints about this same type of problem after an update.&nbsp; Is there anyone out there who can help me get this sorted out?

<h2>            Network Drive Mapping Issue - Incorrect Password</h2>
                    Using Win 7 Home Premium - new update from Vista.&nbsp; Yesterday (before the massive Windows update and associated restart), I could connect to a network drive.&nbsp; Today, I can no longer connect to it.&nbsp; I have disconnected and tried to remap it, but the computer
 shows my password as incorrect.&nbsp; It shows the domain as my computer - is that the problem?&nbsp;

<p><span><span>There is no difference in behaviour between the regular classic Skype installation and the "portable" installation. If the option "Sign me in when Skype starts" is selected, then
 the application should remember the password. I have several "portable" Skype installations on my computers, and Skype remembers the password. If this is not the case with your installation, then there might be an issue with the location where your portable
 installation saves the local profile data.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In any case, if you want the latest 7.41.0.101 classic Skype version to be installed on your Windows 10 computer, you don't need to download the portable installation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Have you made any changes to the computer?</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would recommend suggest you to run the Windows Media Player settings troubleshooter and check.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-Settings-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-Settings-troubleshooter</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>This problem occurs because the Windows Media Player library database has become corrupted. Try the following steps and
 check the result.<br />
<b>Step 1:</b> Clear the Windows Media Player database<br />
a. Click Start, type, run, click Run, type %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player, and then click OK.<br />
b. Select all the files in the folder, and then click Delete on the File menu.<br />
<b><i>Note:</i></b> You do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.<br />
c. Restart Windows Media Player.<br />
<b><i>Note:</i></b> Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b><span> If the issue
 persists, clear the Windows Media Player database cache files<br />
a. Click Start, type run, click Run, type %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft, and then click OK.<br />
b. Select the Media Player folder, and then click Delete on the File menu. <br />
c. Restart Windows Media Player.<br />
<b><i>Note:</i></b> Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.<br />
d. Check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Step 3:
</span></i></b><span>Check if the library path and rip settings are correct<br />
a. Open Windows Media Player, click Tools -&gt; Options.<br />
b. Click "Rip Music" tab.<br />
c. Under "Rip music to this location", change the location where you want to save the files.<br />
d. Under "Rip settings" select the options.<br />
e. Click ok to apply the changes.<br />
f. Close Media Player and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>For additional information on ripping music from a CD, I’d suggest you to refer the following articles:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Rip music from a CD:</span></b></p>

<p>
</p><p>The issue I'm having is that I tried to start my computer on my regular account and also I tried to start it on the built in administrator account and both ways after I log in I get a dead screen (black on the administrator account and purple on the regular

<p>
</p><p>I have been trying for hours now. &nbsp;I read about possibly booting on safe made but then that's my dilemma it won't load and it has never loaded in safe mode since day 1 .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Bill Gates for such a piece of c r a p &nbsp;as windows vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to solve this problem?</p>

<p>Manufacturers Recovery Disks do not normally have Repair Options; thay are normally&nbsp;a reinstall to Factory Settings option&nbsp;only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the guide to using the Repair Options while using a Microsoft Vista DVD.</p>
<p>If a friend or work acquantance of yours&nbsp;has one, you may borrow and use it for Repairs.</p>

<p>If you do not have or can not borrow a Microsoft DVD there is&nbsp;a download of a Vista&nbsp;Startup Repair ISO file available&nbsp;which you can make into a Bootable disk to do the above&nbsp;Startup Repair and&nbsp;that&nbsp;method&nbsp;is recommended by a lot of posters in these Forums.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you have to buy it.</p>
<p>Here is a link to it:</p>

<p>
</p><p>To reinstall Vista on an Acer, or use DVD you make from&nbsp;download for Startup Repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This&nbsp;may assist you (download the files and make your own DVD).</p>
<p>Vista ultimate is available. Read information in lower part of message about how to use it for other Vista Editions:</p>

<p>
</p><p>And&nbsp;here are&nbsp;instructions on how to burn&nbsp;ISO images to&nbsp;disk:</p>

<p>You&nbsp;press the Left Alt Key and F10 at Boot to start the Recovery to Factory Settings process.</p>

<p>You can order Recovery disks from Acer, if they still have them.</p>
<p>How to order eRecovery Disks:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also you should have made your own Recovery disks.</p>
<p>Read your manual on how to make them through Acer's eRecovery in Programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some manufacturers no longer have Vista Recovery Disks available.</p>
<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>
<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is
 installed. </span></p>
<p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>
<p><span>"<strong>How to Do a Clean Install and Setup with a Full Version of Vista"</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>

<h2>            My PC is stuck in sleep mode&#33;&#33;&#33; Help&#33;</h2>
                    Upgraded from Windows 7 to 10, closed out in sleep mode and my computer (Desktop PC) appears to be in permanent sleep. Cannot get it to display, even after reboot, black screen only even after 24 hours. How do I fix this if I can't get to settings? I shut
 the screen off and back on, comes on with Acer logo and says no signal. Checked cables, everything seems fine. Unable to call system back up after two hours in sleep mode. Tower lights on. Tried rebooting with no luck. How do I reboot into safemode so I can
 change sleep settings to never? I am hoping there is a key or set of keys I can hit at reboot to do this since there is no screen display in sleep mode.This PC has maybe three hours of use on it. It's new. Looking for a way to bypass Windows 10 at boot up
 in the hope it will give me a display in safemode to access settings. Please help!

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may create a bootable media using the Windows 10 ISO file and perform automatic repair via the bootable media.

            <p>This is incredibly frustrating. How I am suppose to do what you are telling me to without asking to use someone else's computer? I am afraid to do so because I don't want to screw up anyone else. Is there any way you can mail me a boot disk? Of all the problems
 I have had over the years with your software this one has me the most upset. I understand software, believe me. What I don't understand is why I am left hung out to dry upgrading from one version to another? And you put a time limit on it!! I had less than
 6 weeks left now to get this resolved or I don't get the software in any form what so ever. AND unless you can send me a boot disc I will be forced to take it to a PC repair place to do it for me which is going to cost money to fix a problem that I would not
 have if I had ignored the annoying messages to upgrade in the first place. Never again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I am done with my rant, I would like you to answer my question about sending me a boot disc. Can you send me one?</p>

<p>I have no reply. I have the same question. What is wrong with you people?</p>
<p>My screen saver is: blank screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 10 minutes, my screen goes blank as it should. However, hitting any key or moving the mouse will not wake up the PC. As this forum is probably as useless as most forums I have joined, I will attempt to solve the problem myself. But thanks for wasting
 my time anyway.☺</p>

<h2>            Project zero 2 &#40;PAL&#41; wont play on my 360 &#47;AKA Fatal frame 2</h2>
                    
<p>I checked it all out before my purchase and it should play. Im in the UK with compatible PAL game and 360 console, according to the list it is backwards compatable. It just keeps saying there was a problem and that i should try downloading the game again:;
 even though it is on disc!! It has an error code which i shall come back here with in a min or 2...but my faith in that code helping is not high. Plz help as i have wanted to play this game for years, i dont own an old xbox anymore either. Have searched the
 internet for existing problems with this, but no luck. Everyone elses seems to work fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh and i tried redownloading system updates but it didnt help either. I also have a 120g HDD...so it cant be lack of memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am confused and disappointed
 :(</p>

<p>What type of xbox are you using? If you dont have a HDD the game will not work. So if you are using the 4gb slim 360 the game will not work as the console doesnt have a HDD but it has flash memory. If this is the case you would need to purchase an official
 MS HDD. Also if your not using an official MS HDD this could also cause issues</p>

<p>I could solve this problem myself.<br />
<br />
1. install Windows 10 stand alone sdk &nbsp; &nbsp;https://dev.windows.com/en-us/downloads/windows-10-sdk<br />
2. after that add this to PATH: &nbsp;C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Redist\ucrt\DLLs\x86</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I heard most people don't have this problem on W10, but some do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For people getting this error on older Windows systems:</p>
<p>they need to install a fix: &nbsp;&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2999226</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTH,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>After I installed win10 SDK, but I still got this problem, though I reboot my computer. I get in the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">PATH: &nbsp;【C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Redist\ucrt\DLLs\x86】, and I found

 wrong?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">And sorry that I&nbsp;</span>don't quite understand what you said, you said&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">add this to PATH: &nbsp;【C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows

 Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Redist\ucrt\DLLs\x86</span>】? Or when I finish installing, I should copy the files from&nbsp;【C:\Users\116\Downloads\Windows Kits\10\StandaloneSDK】 and paste them to&nbsp;【<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">C:\Program

            Hi Connor, 
<br />
<br />Have you checked the recycling bin? If the folder isn't there, let's try one of these apps in hopes they can recover it. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/recuva" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ccleaner.com/recuva</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.easeus.com/file-recovery/recover-deleted-user-folder-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.easeus.com/file-recovery/recover-de...</a>
<br />
<br />You can give both of these a shot. now these are both 3rd party apps, and I trust them. Free to use.

<p>What does "...attempting to download photoshop and can't find it..." mean?&nbsp; Are you trying to&nbsp;<em>install</em> Photoshop or download it?&nbsp; If the former is true, what happens when you try to install?&nbsp; If the latter is correct, what does downloading Photoshop
 have to do with "...cannot find it."?</p>

            Oh shucks! It didn't just find the folder that you can restore huh? 
<br />
<br />Currently in mine, I only have an adobe reader folder. What happens when you try to download photoshop again? Error? 
<br />
<br />Are you trying to download Adobe Photoshop Express? <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/adobe-photoshop-express-image-editor-adjustments-filters-effects-borders/9wzdncrfj27n?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/adobe-photosh...</a>

<p>Please describe what happens when you try to install.&nbsp; Does the installation seem to complete successfully? The installation should create the folders it needs.&nbsp; What version of Photoshop?</p>
