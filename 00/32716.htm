<h2>            Can&#39;t defragment HDD</h2>
                    Hi there. I can't defragment my hard drive. After installing CC29 firmware for my 3 Tb Seagate drive which vastly improved read/write speeds, I can't defragment it. I checked for errors with seatools and Windows nothing no problems. The drive is recognized
 by windows as it is listed in my computer but when I go to defragment it it doesn't show on the list. Tried Microsoft support and they just offered to fix it for 99$ which I could just buy a new hard drive for that. Thanks in advance for any replies.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on issue description I can understand that you have issue performing defragmentation your
</p>
<p>hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer the following questions to assist you better.</p>
<ol>
<li>You have mentioned it doesn’t show in the list are you able to access the hard drive?</li><li>You have mentioned you have checked for errors with windows, may I know what tool in windows you tried to check for errors?</li></ol>
<p>I suggest you to follow the below mentioned methods and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Run hardware and device troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <strong>Windows + W</strong> key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>2. Type troubleshooting in the search tab and press Enter.</p>
<p>3. Click View all on left panel.</p>
<p>4. Click Hardware and devices, new window will popup.</p>

<p>Hi there. So I tried both your Methods to no avail. The Windows de-Fragmentation just won't see the drive for some reason. I don't have a clue why. Soooooo I decided just to disable it completely and installed Defraggler a third party software. It sees all
 the drives and gave the Seagate drive a much needed work over. Thanks for your help anyway.</p>

            Hi ErnieHw, <br /><br />It looks like your device is unable to boot.

            Hi Ernie.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.  If one of these methods work, then go to Step 3.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media or Repair Mode  Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi ErnieHw, <br />
<br />
It looks like your device is unable to boot. If I am wrong, please correct. <br />
On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.<br />
<br />
Create a USB Flash Drive<br />
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a><br />
<br />
Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.<br />
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a><br />

<br />
Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.<br />
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a><br />
<br />
Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.<br />

            I'm afraid you have to purchase the Microsoft Window XP Multilingual User Interface Pack to accomplish your goal. There is also the Microsoft Windows® XP Language Interface Pack for Office. Seems like they're just trying to avoid abritrage. :/ Imagine
 if we could buy Windows&nbsp;denominate&nbsp;in a low value currency&nbsp;overseas in another language and just switch it to English. ... I'm not sure how that is worse than the myriad of manners&nbsp;by which you can get it elsewhere online but so it goes.<br />
<br />
You'll a bit of it by completing these steps:<br />
Start -&gt; Control Panel - Regional and Language Options<br />
Standards and formats: Polish<br />
Location: Poland<br />
-&gt; Languages<br />
Installed services: -&gt; Add -&gt; Polish<br />
Default input language: Polich<br />
-&gt;Advanced<br />
Language for non-Unicode programs: Polish<br />

</p><p>There might be some errors on the system files causing this issue to happen. What error codes are you getting? Does the browser crash happens randomly, or have you noticed some actions you take that triggers the crash? What other steps have you already done
 on the attempt to resolve this? We need to have these information so we can isolate the issue. And if possible, please send us a screenshot of the issue so we can have a better picture of what is going on.</p>
<p>

            The worst part is this damn update made it so there are no earlier restore points to restore to only was one the same day the damn update was installed and apparently the restore point made itself after the install, this is a crock of crap no update should
 wipe out all earlier restore points, Microsoft needs to get on this and fix this issue and never make updates that wipe out restore points, freaking bullcrap

            <p>Hi Balamurali_katragadda,</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>How long have you been facing this issue?</div>
<div><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Method 1:</b> I would suggest you to check the behavior by booting the computer in clean boot state. You may refer the link:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state</b></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue does not persist you may continue with
<b>step 2</b> from the above link.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Make sure you reset the computer to normal mode after the troubleshooting completes. Refer the section “Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state”
</b></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Method 2:</b> If you still get the error message, Follow the steps and set the RPC server to automatic.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on the <b>Start</b> button and select
<b>Control Panel</b>, </div>
<div><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on<b> Administrative Tools</b>, select
<b>Services</b>. </div>
<div><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Locate <b>RPC Endpoint Mapper</b> in the list and check that the StartUp type is
<b>Automatic</b>. </div>
<div><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If it is not set to Automatic right click and select
<b>Properties</b>, click on <b>General</b> tab. </div>
<div><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>There is a box after StartUp type. The options are available on a drop down by clicking on the arrow down to the right of the box.
<div><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Make the change and click on <b>Apply</b> and
<b>OK</b>. </div>
<div><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restart the computer and check whether it has started.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 3 - Can&#39;t Install The Game</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've encountered a rather frustrating error regarding Forza Horizon 3 in the MS Store. After a while of tinkering, I finally got the app to&nbsp;actually download 100% -- But the game will always give me an error when trying to install. The error code I get is:
<strong>Error</strong> 0x80070005, which I've found is some sort of "access denied" error. I am the administrator on my computer, I've tried WSReset multiple times, I've tried typing commands into windows PowerShell, and&nbsp;I've set "new apps install to..." as
 m\y F: drive (128GB SD Card, exFAT). I run other games off this drive so I'm trying to install Forza there. I really can't quite figure out what could possibly be wrong with my permissions here. Please help! Thanks.</p>

            Hi  icepaka89, this is Andre from the Microsoft Community. 

Lets see if we can get your problem resolved.

Could you try formatting the SD Card as NTFS then try installing again?
Also, which version of Windows 10 are you running? Make sure you are running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update or later.

Best,
Andre

<h2>            Windows 10 KB4056892 update fail</h2>
                    <p>After unexpected fail of installing the latest Windows 10 update (KB4056892) I ended up with lost emails all installed software. Now I finally did bring back the system by bringing to factory settings or how it's called.. I couldn't install the system from
 scratch though for whatever reason (partition table error!?).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the Miscrosoft updates seem to be lame recently (untested? or system architecture itself is fragile / rigid).&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>My system is quite old (Athlon 64 X2 5600+ on Gigabyte&nbsp;GA-M55S-S3) so I wanted to update the HW within short time. Now I consider either moving to Linux or buing an Apple computer instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other option?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Some of my icons have changed.</h2>
                    <p>My Icons for TGA files have changed from the default program's GIMP icon to some windows folder icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They went from<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e3a3e32-8d77-45e0-a2cf-db0558a02ee2" />..........to this icon......<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4a3e5ccc-78bf-4d7d-9821-6b2afefc10bc" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The TGA files still open with GIMP just fine, but i really liked having the GIMP icon for spotting them among all the other files.</p>
<p>I have no idea what the new icon is, i don't remember ever seeing it before.</p>
<p>Any ideas how i can change it back?</p>

<h2>            Change owner details in XP</h2>
                    I wish to pass my XP computer onto a friend. I have found conflicting information on how to&nbsp;change the registered details to the new owner. I understand about clearing private data but apart from changing the names in the&nbsp; My Computer box, I thought it
 had to be changed in the registry under "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Current Version|Registered Owner" but I can find no reference to Registered Owner. Can anyone please advise?

<h2>            Windows XP Service Pack 3 Update Problem</h2>
                    When attempting to install SP3 for Windows XP, I first received error number 0x80070424.&nbsp; I found a response to thatproblem, cut and pasted this into theStart/Run box.&nbsp; I was never able to run this.&nbsp; Now I cannot get beyond "Checking form the latest update
 for your computer" when I try to update to SP3.&nbsp; The green bars just keep moving across the screen with no results.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Updates no longer works until you have service pack 3.</span></p>
<p><span>Before you install SP3 read this article…</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717</a></span></p>
<p><span>…and if your PC is an HP Pavilion, Presario or Media Center and has an AMD processor you need to install this
 patch before installing SP3…</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;softwareitem=pv-60484-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;softwareitem=pv-60484-2</a></span></p>
<p><span><span>…to find out if you have an AMD processor...</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hold down the Windows key (between Ctrl and Alt) and hit the Pause Break key</span>
</li><li><span>Your processor type is shown in the Computer: section</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>Then install SP3 by downloading and running from...</span></p>

<p><span>…you can ignore the text that says that it is for network installations and also ignore the text advising Windows/Microsoft
 Update if only updating one PC.</span></p>
<p><span>Then try and get up to date with Windows Updates.</span></p>

            Thank you Tricky 300.&nbsp; I did everything that you suggested, including ignoring the fact that I do not have a network, but downloaded the link you provided to a temporary folder. I also do not believe that my PC had any of the previous downloads that were
 listed as conflicting with SP3.&nbsp; I got through about 60% of the "Extract Files To Directory" process when I received an abort error.&nbsp; I am now uninstalling.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

            <p>Sorry to hear that SP3 did not install OK. Based on the limited info you have given me I can only suggest a few things...</p>
<ol>
<li>Try the download again with a different browser and/or at another PC, then retry the installation</li><li>Search this forum for the error message (I would have done this for you if you had supplied it)</li><li>Do an advanced&nbsp;Google search for the <strong><em>exact</em></strong> error message or significant part of it (again, I would have done this for you if you had supplied it)</li></ol>

            <p>Thanks Tricky 300.&nbsp; I tried it again, this time using another browser.&nbsp; It failed at the same area, about 55% of completion.&nbsp; The two error messages were:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Service Pack 3 Setup Error - </p>
<p>2) Service Pack Installation did not complete - Select OK to undor the changes</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not select&nbsp;OK, instead I clicked on the "X" and the Software Update Removal &nbsp;Wizard opened automatically to "Restoring Catogs" and then proceeded to "deleting Files", Copying Files, etc.</p>

            <p>A search on your error message in an XP environment does not reveal much. Check the contents of this article against your PC...</p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717</a></span></p>

<p><span>The same error message&nbsp;<em>is</em> listed for Windows 2000 service pack installation in this article...</span></p>

<p><span>...so it <em><u>might</u></em> be that you have deleted the default user profile, or do not have appropriate registry permissions. Is your logon account (the account your are installing from) a 'limited' user or an 'administrative' user?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Read the content of the service pack log, this my shed some light. The default log file location is C:\windows and its name is svcpack.log. You can copy and paste its contents to a reply if you want. There is also a setupapi.log file that may assist
 diagnosis.</span></p>

</p><blockquote>Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>My Xbox 360 wired controler for pc was working fine until &nbsp;today.</div>
<div>I did not install anything new (hardware/software) and it is not recognized anymore.</div>
<div>It appears as unknown device in the periphals manager (error code 43) when i plug it in.</div>
<div>I tried to install/uninstall the driver, the usb controller without success.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks.</div>
</blockquote>
 thread, even if OP already solved it. My 360 controller suddenly stopped working. No light on controller after plugging in and got "unknown usb device" in device manager. I of course tried all the suggestions I could find online, and nothing worked. I even
 plugged it into a different PC and it did the same thing! So I really thought it was toast.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
 I decided to try the release cable from the old remote on my broken one, in case that was the issue, and boom it worked! Now for the interesting part..after this I went back to the original release cable (the one from the previously not working controller)
 and now it works fine too! Not sure why that did the trick, but thought I would share as it is clearly worth a shot for you, if you've tried everything else and have a 2nd controller.</span></p>

<h2>            CD&#47;DVD Driver not working</h2>
                    Today when i went to install my computer editing program, which is on a CD, my ROXIO CD drive icon did not pop up. When i went to my computer to see if it was visible there, my CD drive icon wasnt there either. When i checked in my device manager it said
 "Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (Code 19)." I tried the Assisant Fix-It program and it tried to reinstall. However, it couldnt reinstal correctly. Can you please help
 me. I just got my computer a month ago and i ccannot understand why my CD Drive would have to be reinstalled.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Code 19 means there is a driver conflict such as two devices trying to use the same resources.<br />
<br />
Having too many CD/DVD programs can cause strange issues, especially if they load parts of them-<br />
selves at StartUp as they will compete for resources. This does not mean this issue was caused by<br />
those however it is a possibility depending on which and how many you have installed.<br />

References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your<br />
CD/DVD drive from someone with the same model.<br />

Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p><br />
DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays<br />
all devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

    <title>Sony VAIO Broadcom Bluetooth Adapter doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> olo3000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sony VAIO Broadcom Bluetooth Adapter doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    I upgraded my Sony VAIO VPCY115FX from Windows 7 to Windows 8 Pro x64. Shortly after upgrading, all Bluetooth was lost. I have spent 20+ hours trying to solve this. I have tried to install the Windows 8 drivers from Broadcom, but I get an error saying
 that "could not start Microsoft Bluetooth stack."
<div><br />

</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>I have researched that issue and tried to solve it by stopping and starting the Bluetooth Support Service in services.msc. When I go there, the Bluetooth Support Service is running but logged on as Local
<b>Service</b>, whereas Bluetooth Service is logged on as Local <b>System. </b>Not sure if these have to be the same or not. If I try to change the BSS to log on as Local System, I get Error 1079.</div>

</div>
<div><br />

<div>
<div>If I try to update driver thru Device Manager, I get "Access is Denied" message.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have even purchased a USB Bluetooth Dongle, and that doesn't work because it needs the same Broadcom driver.</div>
<div><br />

<p>Since you have done an upgrade installation now you may have to uninstall the old drives completely and try to download and install the new drives.<br />

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>I have tried your suggestion but it did not help. I uninstalled all Bluetooth devices/drivers from the Device Manager and tried to install the new ones. I tried this from my user account and also while logged on as administrator. The 2 errors still persist:</div>
<div><br />
<div>(1) When installing the Broadcom driver from the .exe, it says "Could not start Microsoft Bluetooth stack."</div>
<div><br />
<div>(2) When installing the driver automatically from Device Manager, it says "Access is denied."</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any other ideas?</div>

            Well I have a Sony VPCF1 and can't get Bluetooth to work with a Win 8 upgrade. &nbsp;And I actually get the drivers installed from Broadcom, but I can't add devices. &nbsp;It just doesn't see them. &nbsp;Very frustrating!

            I gave up on the internal Bluetooth adapter and just bought a USB dongle. I tried several before I found one that works because many of them use the Broadcom driver. The one I ended up using is made by Azio and I bought it from newegg. It uses a CSR Bluetooth
 driver.&nbsp;

            Finally took my laptop into Future Shop for diagnostics. In addition to Bluetooth not working at all, ever since I installed windows 8 my camera has been intermittent. The technicians were able to update all the drivers without uninstalling windows 8 and
 my laptop works like a charm now, Bluetooth included! All issues resolved for the price of a basic diagnostic fee.

<p>Replacing a failed hard drive, or upgrading to a new hard drive, is a long-established science, so there's no reason for you to have to figure this out on your own. Most retail hard drives now come with detailed instructions and all the parts and software
 you'll need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find the same instructions, often in more detail, on the drive manufacturer's website. Check it out before you begin so you'll know exactly what to do and what to expect. It's really quite easy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The type of backup you'll need is an image backup - that's an exact copy of your hard drive. The basic procedure goes like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Make an image backup of the old hard drive.</p>
<p>2- Replace the old hard drive with the new hard drive.</p>
<p>3- Restore the image backup to the new hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tada! That's all there is to it. However, you should definitely read the instructions on the drive manufacturer's website where you'll find more details and often videos. And if you have any questions or problems, the manufacturer's technical support will
 help you, because this is the #1 reason people buy new hard drives in the first place.</p>

<p>An image is nice, but only useful if the old drive is still working and not corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing that you are referring to the copy that Dell encouraged you to make when you first received the computer?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, that should be a copy of the what the factory put on the drive when it was new.&nbsp; Just loading that should put your new drive in as a copy of that factory install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is not.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have received a windows 7 install disk from Dell when it was new.</p>

            Thank you very much for getting back with me. As for the hard drive still working, it does not. I did run a diagnostics on the hard drive and it did not pass, everything else did pass. I have 3 backup disc, and 7 total restore disc that I made when the
 computer arrived in 2012. I have replaced hard drives before with older Windows systems with a Windows Disc that came with the computer. This is different I do not have a Windows 7 Disc. I am going to install all of the Disc that I have made. Is this correct
 ?

            &nbsp;Thank you for getting back with me.I made 7&nbsp; System Image Total Restore Disc and 3 Backup Disc when the computer was new in 2012. I am going to install the above Disc onto the New Hard Drive. Should I install the Backup Disc first or the System Image
 Total Restore first. I have installed hard drives before on older Windows systems with a Windows Disc this does not have a Windows Disc.&nbsp;

<p>That disk should be really an image.&nbsp; It completely replaces EVERYTHING that is on the disk including the Operating system with a copy of what was on the drive when new.&nbsp; Hopefully, your disk set still works.&nbsp; This should open and start just as it did when
 you got it from Dell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First step should be to prune and remove all the stuff you do not need.&nbsp; There will be lots.&nbsp; Especially remove any kind of security product.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to this page for some pretty detailed advice on how to update once that is installed.</p>

<p>You need to have kept the correct order they were made in and Boot from the first one, etc.</p>

<h2>            Arc Touch Mouse Surface Edition Bluetooth connectivity problems</h2>
                    <p>I am having difficulty in connecting the arc touch mouse surface pro to my Home built computer. I'm using an Asus p8z68 v/gen3 MB, and it's on-board Bluetooth module. I am running windows 8.1 pro. I have already updated the drivers for the Bluetooth and
 have checked that it can connect to other Bluetooth devices such as a Bluetooth stereo for out put, as well as Touch osc for input. I have also checked that the mouse does connect successfully to a surface 2. When I go to setting and search for Bluetooth devices,
 after putting the mouse into pairing mode, Windows does not see the device. Unfortunately I do not have any other computers with a Bluetooth module aside from the surface 2. However I have read that the Mouse itself should be compatible with anything running
 windows 8.1 and a Bluetooth module. &nbsp;Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
