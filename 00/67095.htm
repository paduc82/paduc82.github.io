<h2>            Windows 7 installation failure - HELP &#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,<br />
I have bought a Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade disk and tried (unsuccessfully) to install the OS on my Windows Vista 64bit system 4 times today. Having taken all the precautions advised:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Uninstalled conflicting programmes<br />
Dissabled Norton IS<br />
Backed up everything<br />
Checked and re-checked all available info<br />
<br />
I have still been unsucsessful.<br />
<br />
On each occasion on first reboot, during the "expanding windows files" part of the installation, the PC stops at Windows Boot Manager with the error "windows failed to load because a critical system driver is missing or corrupt".<br />
<br />
The following file is referenced: File: \ $windows.~BT\windows\systerm32\drivers\iastor.sys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sratus: 0xc0000359<br />
<br />
I am then presented with the options of selecting windows setup, which does not work and cycles me back to WBM, or Microsoft Windows Vista, which restores my previous OS. On selecting Vista my OS does indeed restore sucessfully but seems to have some added
 (non Vista) features ??.<br />
<br />
Having sat here for 3 hours at 4am in the morning am growing seriously tired and frustrated !!!.<br />
<br />
Any advice very welcome indeed !!!</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;Access&nbsp;Driver Repository Folder under C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository and move any folders that contain&nbsp;the file: iastor.inf to a temporary&nbsp;location.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> : To move the files from the FileRepostiry you may require additional permissions which can be accomplished by taking ownership of the the folder:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Right-click on the folder and choose Properties</span>
<span>,</span> <span>
</span></li><li><span>Clic</span>
<span>k</span> <span>
Security tab</span> <span>
.</span> </li><li><span>Click Advanced button</span>

</span></li><li><span>Click Owner tab</span>
<span>.</span> <span>
</span></li><li><span>Click Edit button</span>
<span>.</span> <span>
</span></li><li><span>Select your account.</span>
</li></ul>
<p>2. Search for references to iastor&nbsp;within&nbsp;the oem inf files in the&nbsp;c:\windows\inf folder.</p>
<p>Example Command: <strong><em>findstr /i /c:"iastor" %windir%/inf/oem*.inf</em>
</strong></p>
<p>3. Make a note of the oem##.inf files reported where ## is a numeral.&nbsp; Move&nbsp;the oem##.inf and corresponding oem##.pnf from c:\windows\inf folder&nbsp;to a temporary folder.</p>
<p>4. Delete $~bt, $~LS and $~Upgrade folders from c:\ drive if they exist</p>
<p>5. Download and install the latest version of the iastor.sys driver from Intel website on the Vista machine:
<a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;DwnldID=17882&amp;lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;DwnldID=17882&amp;lang=eng</a></p>
<p>6. Start the Windows 7 upgrade process.&nbsp;It should complete successfully now.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> : Once the Upgrade process&nbsp;has completed successfully, there is no need to&nbsp;restore the iastore files, or&nbsp;the oem*.inf and oem*.pnf files back to their original location as the devices&nbsp;will no longer be needed.</p>

    <title>HOW TO SET UP AN IDE HARD DISK IN WINDOWS 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> goshjm  say:</h3>
<h2>            HOW TO SET UP AN IDE HARD DISK IN WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    <p><span>&nbsp;</span>I<span> want to be able to access existing data from 5 No. old IDE Hard Disks by adding them externally to my new Windows 10 PC.</span></p>
<p><span>I therefore recently purchased a USB hard disk adaptor (with a separate power supply) that, in theory, should allow me to connect any IDE or SATA external hard disk via a USB port.</span></p>
<p><span>It works just fine with 3 of the IDE disks - but not with the remaining 2!<span>&nbsp;
</span>They are a Conner CFS425A (425Mb) and a Samsung SHD-3121A (125Mb).<span>&nbsp;
</span>They are both set up as ‘Masters’ , spin OK and I have no reason to believe that there is any fault with them (I have previously used them on old 486 PCs).</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 recognises both of them upon connection (with a ‘ding-dong’) but then fails to show them in “This PC”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, in Disk Management, it lists them both as “Disk 6” (when run separately of course) and adds
<span>&nbsp;</span>“Unknown” &amp; “Not Initialised”.<span>&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;</span>“Unknown” &amp; “Not Initialised”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My PC also shows them in “Device Manager” (including brand/model).</span></p>
<p><span>A fellow <em>Community</em> “good guy” very generously and expertly ‘talked me through” a somewhat similar problem earlier (involving setting up a SATA disk, with some “power use” of the Command Prompt),
<strong>however</strong>, that disk had no data on it (and apparently <span>
&nbsp;</span>it would have been lost if there had have been) – these 2 IDE disks <span>
&nbsp;</span><strong>do</strong> hold data and I want to retain/retrieve it!<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have seen reference to “mounting disks manually” – whether this is relevant or not I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span>Any help would be very much appreciated!</span></p>

<p>You're doing all the right things ... the problem is with the disks, not with anything you're doing. Unknown and not initialised means that the disks are unreadable for any number of reasons. The disk metadata could be damaged or the partitions could be
 messed up. Or the file system could be a format that Windows 10 can't read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is often fixable&nbsp;<em>but</em> you'll need 'partition manager' software, which you install on Windows. Then attach the hard drives (via USB) and open the software, which will analyze the disks, tell you what's wrong and how to fix it (if indeed it's
 fixable.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not worked with this kind of software in several years, so I'm not the best person to advise you. I used Paragon Partition Manager, but there are lots of other choices. You can find them by searching the web for:&nbsp; &nbsp;windows 10 partition manager software</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partition manager software is very powerful and also very complicated. It's definitely&nbsp;<em>not</em> a matter of 'follow these three easy steps ...' You'll have a learning curve and you'll have to be extremely careful. There are no do-overs with this type
 of software. But - you can do it.</p>

<p>Dear BulldogXX</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very many thanks for your input - of the three 'causes' you list, I think that the 3rd one may be the most likely but, either way, you've introduced me to the concept of a 'partition manager'.&nbsp; I shall investigate that (if with not much enthusiasm!).</p>

<h2>            Computer won&#39;t wake from Sleep Mode - Vista</h2>
                    <p>I have put my desktop computer into sleepmode by mistake and it will now not wake up again. It does not respond to mouse or keyboard. The monitor is black, but functioning, as it shows the 'no display' light.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had this problem previously, but cannot remember how to resolve this. I have tried&nbsp;switching Power off and taking the power supply cable out - the start up button continues flashing - pressed start up button again - it goes off - press start up button
 for a count of 10 - plug power back in -&nbsp;fan starts going,&nbsp;start up button flashes - but still in sleep mode - it is not booting up.</p>
<p>Can you please advise urgently. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Windows is activated using your organization&#39;s activation service and Your windows license is expring...&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Ok so, I bought my PC from an electronics store about 6-8 months ago and every thing was fine up until a few days ago. When I had booted up my PC and this pops up on to my desktop. I never once saw a Product key or anything when I picked it up, or let alone
 find the product code card thing the support site says. I haven't tried getting a false copy of Win10 pro/ or anything of the like. And Have no idea how to fix this. I cant find the Troubleshooter in the menu. I even tired a system reset and It still happens.
 So if anyone could be of help I would be grateful.</p>

            Try following -
<br />
<br />1. If you had pre-installed Windows - Right click on Windows Start &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />Copy the below line and paste into Powershell &gt; Enter
<br />wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey
<br />Make a note of your product key
<br />
<br />Windows Key+I to open Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key and Enter this product key
<br />
<br />You can also Use third party tools to retrieve keys
<br />A. Download and run OemKey from <a href="https://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a>
<br />OR
<br />B. Download and run Showkeyplus from <a href="https://github.com/Superfly-Inc/ShowKeyPlus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://github.com/Superfly-Inc/ShowKeyPlus</a>
<br />
<br />If you still face the problem, contact Support. They will help you to activate your Windows.
<br />
<br />By Phone - You can talk to support by picking up appropriate country

<br />
<br />2. If above doesn't work, I need to verify whether it is OEM or Retail or Volume, I need the screenshot of following output
<br />
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Click on either Powershell (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin) 
<br />Copy below and paste and Enter

            Hi BigMase.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The error normally means that someone has activated Windows with a Volume License Key meant only for business or organizations that activate a large number of PC's, which need to check in regularly to reactivate.  
<br />
<br />Sometimes this is done by shops unnecessarily because the PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated for free Upgrade and would have reactivated after a reinstall had they given it the chance and not interrupted this by installing the illegal key.
<br />
<br />If you know Windows was originally activated legitimately by one of these methods then to fix the problem what I would do is go offline to remove the Volume License key and then restore the Generic Product Key that is used to activate with the Digital License issued by Upgrade or Factory install.  Then we'll see if it activates:
<br />
<br />1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.  
<br />
<br />2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter:  slmgr -upk
<br />
<br />3) Restart PC and then insert Generic Product Key for WIndows 10 Pro from here:    <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>
<br />
<br />This sets everything back to default so that if there is a Digital License issued during a proper Upgrade it should reactivate within a few days.  If not we will need to try something else:  
<br />
<br />What Windows Operating System came on that exact model PC originallly - you can google it's make and model to read the specs to find out.  If it says Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Home version then that is a clue you need to reinstall Home instead of Pro to try to activate.  We might even be able to still activate it fresh with the old OS Product Key read from the BIOS or on the Windows 7 COA sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else works you may need to reinstall the licensed Windows edition that came with that PC, or buy a copy of Windows 10 Home to activate it.  
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Why is &#34;Device Census&#34; accessing my webcam&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr. danny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is &#34;Device Census&#34; accessing my webcam&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I opened Task Manager one day, and I noticed two never-before-seen executables running, under the name "Device Census." They disappeared before I could click on them. Is this how Microsoft counts Windows 10 users or is it something else? This isn't really
 a "need to know" question, just curious.</p>

    <title>Windows Update Installation loop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Update  Installation loop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
i am facing a problem with the Windows 8.1 Updates.<br />
<br />
Windows is trying to install the same 10 updates over and over again. Every time I restart, it installs them, the update history shows "Success" after the computer is restarted. But checking for new updates shows the same 10 updates again. Some updates were
 installed fine in between, its just those 10 that keep reappearing.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I attached a Photo of the Windows Update Window, there you can see the Updates. The Update History just shows the same 10 updates over and over again reported as "Success". The "Installed Updates" Section just shows one of them (KB2976978) as installed. The
 others dont show up.<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Password not working only for Skype</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason I was logged out of Skype on my laptop yesterday, and since it has been so long since I actually logged out I had forgotten my password. I managed to make a new one, and I can sign into Microsoft and Outlook just fine, but whenever I try
 to sign into Skype it tells me I have it incorrect. I've restarted it and turned off my computer but still I cannot log back in. Thanks for your help!</p>

I should add to this...<br />
<br />
I had Norton 360 do a complete system scan and it all checked out.&nbsp; I also have on other user on my desktop, and I've noticed that they appear to be unaffected.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
For example, I had Chrome installed, but VUZE kept putting up a toolbar in the browser.&nbsp; Despite every effort to remove this toolbar, it would always show up when I restarted the program.&nbsp; I even deleted VUZE from my computer, but to no avail.<br />
<br />
When I tried to re-install Chrome through IE, the download wouldn't even start.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
When I tried to open Firefox, it told me that it was already running.<br />
<br />
BUT, when I tried to do all these things in the other profile (the one that isn't the administrator for the computer) everything works fine.&nbsp; The programs load and work and there are no issues.&nbsp; It asks me for my admin code to download the programs, as usual,
 and then starts the download.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is, though, that once Chrome was downloaded and installed, it would not show up on my OWN profile.<br />
<br />
This appears to be getting worse.&nbsp; Is it a problem with my TEMP and TMP files?&nbsp; I can't figure it out.&nbsp; I'm close to doing a factory reset, but that would involve a lot of work....

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It looks like your administrator account is corrupted, try to make a new administrator account and check if it helps<br />
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
<div>Create a user account <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account</a><br />
<div>If new administrator account works, then try to repair the corrupted user account.<br />

I think that may be it, I'm just having trouble with the directions provided.&nbsp; Is there a way to accomplish the task below in Windows 7?<br />

<div>
<p>After you create the profile, you can copy the files from the existing profile. You must have at least three user accounts on the computer to complete these steps, including the new account you just created.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Log on as a user other than the new user you just created or the user that you want to copy files from.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Open the My Documents folder by clicking the

 and then clicking <span>Computer</span>. Double-click the hard disk drive that
<span>Windows</span> is installed on (it's usually your C: drive), double-click
<span>Users</span>, double-click the folder with the name of your account, and then double-click
<span>My Documents</span>.</span> </p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the <span>Tools</span> menu, and then click <span>

<h3> joesearle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Manger Performance Bluetooth display doesn&#39;t show headset connection</h2>
                    <p>Running Windows 10 version1893 and took in update 2018-09 last night. I am able to enable Bluetooth and connect up my headset just fine, but the Task Manager only shows a Bluetooth window when it is enabled as it should, but it never displays any Bluetooth
 activity. The Task Manager only shows "Bluetooth PAN Not connected" even when I'm listening with them and the "Bluetooth &amp; other devices" window of "Settings" shows Bluetooth as On with "Audio Evolution 2 Connected voice, music". It used to show Bluetooth
 headset activity if I remember correctly. Is this a feature or a bug?</p>

<p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to verify some information regarding your concern. Could you share a screenshot of the Task Manager where the&nbsp;<span><em>Bluetooth PAN Not connected</em> appear</span>?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, if the <strong>Show the Bluetooth icon in the notification area</strong> is enabled, the Bluetooth icon should appear in the notification area on the system tray. It should also flash the current Bluetooth activity if you're using it. You can
 enable it by navigating to <strong>Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Bluetooth &amp; other devices &gt; More Bluetooth settings</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>

 window. I was going to attach an additional screen shot or two to show you the list of device names that appear in the "Hardware" tab of the "Bluetooth Settings" window, but I can't get my computer to take an additional screen shot even after restarting it.
 Anyway the hardware device list shows:</span></p>

            Additional information. If I first establish my Bluetooth connection and then start my audio, I hear the audio just fine. But if I first start the audio, my Bluetooth connection gets established as far as the "Bluetooth and other devices" window is concerned,
 but the audio is not redirected on the fly to my headset.

            <p>I had the same issue . Apparently the drivers are NOT actually being installed by the software . You need to go to the software folder in /Program Files(x86)/Steelseries/World of Warcraft MMO Gaming Mouse/Driver7x64 folder&nbsp;&nbsp; and run the program DPInst.exe
 to actually install the correct drivers . Once I did this I had full functionality of the mouse , including the colors and lights settings .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would still change the&nbsp; compatibility settings to Run as Administrator though , and changed security settings on all 3 of the mouse programs to allow full access to all users .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; WoWMGui.exe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;WoWMHid.exe and &nbsp; WoWMTray.exe</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update causing Facebook Gameroom problems.</h2>
                    <p>I am hoping someone can help me with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the October update I have had problems getting Facebook gameroom to stay that it is in fact usable for more than once.&nbsp; Keep on repeatedly uninstalling and installing, tried changing date, even have the other version of adobe flash and still gameroom
 is not loading or just gives me a blank screen then redirects my browser to the facebook log in page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shortly after the update I did contact Microsoft support and was told to turn off automatic updates for windows, I have checked and nothing is coming up there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything I can do or am I stuck like this.</p>
<p>thanks in advance.</p>

<p>not sure how to give all details of updates installed but it was the October update that was later pulled.<br />
<br />
no significant changes to computer except a few updates to graphics drivers and uninstalled a few programs eg winzip etc.<br />
<br />
Yes the gameroom was working quite well before the october update.<br />
<br />
<br />
have tried all options I found before this from changing computer date, re installing with no permanent success.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tried the compatibility checker before, set it for windows 8 and it worked once perhaps twice then it would just redirect browser to facebook log in page.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<br />
Followed those on the thread this time including changing the program compatibility at time of installation, it seems to be working for now .</p>

<h2>            Available physical memory, XP</h2>
                    <p>
Hello all,</p>
<p>
I installed a Windows XP x86 on my PC. But when I open the system information window in the&nbsp;<em>System Summary</em>&nbsp;tab, in the right-hand pane and at bottom the following
 are written:</p>
<p>
<em>Total Physical memory 768.00 MB Available Physical memory 270.41 MB !!</em></p>
<p>
Why&nbsp;<em>Available Physical memory</em>&nbsp;is 270.41 MB please?</p>
<p>
PS: My system is very slow and also very slower when start up. Isn't that less Available Physical memory the source of that slowness?</p>
<p>
</p>

            <p>You just don't have enough RAM for the kinds of programs that run today. Your PC being slow is likely a combination of a slow hard drive with lots of page file use. A page file is using a part of the hard drive like RAM, but this kind of memory use is thousands
 of times slower than real RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can, you can try to upgrade the RAM in that PC, or it may be time to get a new PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, if you believe you have more RAM that the total reported, then you may have bad memory modules.</p>

<p>Show exactly how Windows is assigning physical memory, how much file data is cached in RAM, or how much RAM is used by the kernel and device drivers? RAMMap makes answering those questions easy. RAMMap is an advanced physical memory usage analysis utility
 for Windows Vista and higher. It presents usage information in different ways on its several different tabs.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2) Run Memtest86+:</strong>&nbsp; (Will test your installed memory to insure all of it is usable)<br />
This runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or confirm if one or more of your memory<br />
sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours (at least 3 full passes), if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />

            <p>Microsoft says XP needs at least 64MB of RAM and recommends 128MB of RAM:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314865" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314865</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your system will run under that configuration, but you won't like it.&nbsp; That is simply not enough memory to make running XP anywhere close to a pleasurable experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The total physical memory and the available physical memory displayed in msinfo32 will never be the same numbers since some of your memory is going to be consumed by your BIOS, hardware devices (like your video subsystem) and also consumed by the programs
 you have loaded.&nbsp; The numbers will never be equal and there is nothing you can do to make them equal.&nbsp; That doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can start with 768 but then you have to start subtracting the memory used by your devices and loaded programs.&nbsp; What you have left after everything loads up is going to be your available memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you want to waste your time, do not follow the advice to '<strong>Install RAMMAP</strong>' since it is not designed to run under XP and if you were to actually try it you would see a message like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6f50981-4776-45d9-9e8e-8476b4d149f2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>More RAM will certainly help your system performance but you can't add more RAM than your motherboard will support and XP will not support more than 4GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to see why your system might be running slowly or your startup is slow you need to provide more information so it can be analyzed - or you can just guess and try things that might work sometimes maybe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to see what you can do to improve things, provide more information by doing this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since the MS Answers forums implementation does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know absolutely nothing about your system.<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues but that is the way they choose to run things here.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers owners, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please answer the following questions as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
If you have a Dell computer, what is the Service Tag Number?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; avast!. Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<strong>msinfo32</strong><br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many systems have too many programs loading at startup and nobody can tell you what you might not need unless you provide a list of your startup programs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is one way to do that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the free version of CCleaner from here:<br />

CCleaner will let you manage most Startup items and also do some other cleanup oriented operations.&nbsp; Some people will recommend you not to use the registry functions in CCleaner so avoid those features for now.&nbsp; I have no issue with it myself, but it is sometimes
 a contentious issue I prefer to avoid whenever possible!<br />
<br />
You can uninstall CCleaner later if you don't like it.<br />
<br />
You can disable startup items, see how things look and if you want - totally delete unneeded startup items, or just leave them disabled while you continue troubleshooting.&nbsp; Note that disabling things does not uninstall anything and if there is a problem, you
 can just enable the item again.&nbsp; If you are sure you don't want it at all, then you can delete it.<br />
<br />
After launching CCleaner and seeing what startup items you can disable/delete if you still are not sure about your startup items, do this:<br />
<br />
Launch CCleaner and choose Tools, Startup and in the bottom right, click the "Save to text file" button to save the Startup information to a text file on your desktop with a name you can remember - something like
<strong>startup.txt</strong><br />
<br />
Save the startup information text file to your desktop (or someplace you can find it) open the text file with a text editor (notepad or WordPad), select all the text (Ctrl-A), copy all the highlighted text to the Windows clipboard (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V)
 the contents of the startup list back here in your next reply and perhaps somebody can tell you other things to consider.<br />
<br />
A more revealing startup analyzer is Autoruns which will allow manipulation of all areas of startups and does not actually install anything:<br />

<br />
Autoruns can be a little intimidating at first since it displays so much information.&nbsp; You would mostly be interested in the Logon and Everything tab and if you see an item you are not sure about, you can right click it and choose to Search Online to learn
 more about the item.<br />
<br />
I have zero startup items on my computer and my startup list is empty, so none of this matters to me!</p>

            Sorry&nbsp; about the error on my part about RAMMap, but you can try a "Clean Boot" and see if you still have the problem.<br />
You can one at a time add a program back into the list of <br />
apps that run at startup until you find the offending program.

            <p>Thank you very much all.</p>
<p>I installed a new XP on my PC and the problem of slowness is solved now. But after installing some apps some change appeared! The start up screen (Welcome screen and after that desktop screen) come up very slowly. That is from welcome screen to when all
 icons of desktop appear and I can start work on windows, it takes about 1-2 minutes!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: The number of apps are not many. And I use Malwarebytes Anti-Malware as AV.</p>

<h2>            Some games have disapeared from &#34;ready to install&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I was going through my "ready to install" game list and notice that some of them have disapeared. So far i notice 3 of them, Forza Motosport 5, project cars digital edition and Evolve. They were all games with gold free games. I did not hide them, yest i
 did a hard reset and i did a refresh on "apps &amp; games". If i go to xbox.com and go to "my games", it shows that i owned them. So why they are not showing/available on my console anymore?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's probably more games but thats those i notice</p>

            Sometimes games do vanish from the ready to install list from time to time, but they do come back on. It's probably caused by server issues. You can still download them from the store by selecting the install button.<br />

            Sometimes they disappear but you still own them but another reason might be that your gold service it's no longer active, why don't you check your subscriptions and also try a power cycle maybe ts the cache

            It could be they are delisted and also that the games were redeemed under another account. Sometimes you have to search the games in the Xbox store and download from there. Anything you own will show as owned.&nbsp;

<strong>Check if allow this device to wake the computer is checked in Device Manager.</strong><br />
1. Press Windows and X keys together. Click on Device Manager<br />
2. Select keyboard, it will display your keyboard, right click and select ‘Properties’.<br />
3. Select the ‘Power management’ tab.<br />
4. Check the “Allow this device to wake the computer” check box.<br />
5. Repeat these steps for Mouse and Network adapters as well.

            That works all the way to number 3. &nbsp;At number 3, when I right click, I do not have the option for "Power management tab" &nbsp;All that is there is, "Keyboards" and keyboards cannot be selected.&nbsp;
