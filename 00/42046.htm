<div>This steps works for me</div>
<div>1. Ensure that you're not using a local account, therefore you need to switch to your microsoft account, if you don't have it then register for it</div>
2. Check the time and date of your PC, is it correct? ( +timezone )

Hi! 


This steps works for me 


1. Ensure that you're not using a local account, therefore you need to switch to your microsoft account, if you don't have it then register for it 2. Check the time and date of your PC, is it correct? ( +timezone ) 


3. Try to connect your PC to different internet connections ( in my case I tried to connect to a cafe open network and it works! )  


 Hey 


That's not very helpful when you 1: can't even log in with your own Microsoft account either, 2: time and date well always correct and 3: Why the **** should you have to connect to a different connection other than your own? 


Personally I think it's a bug with Microsoft as I am seeing the same question time and time again, the best I've read yet is from a MS engineer who suggested a full clean install WTF like I have time to waste wiping all my software to have to wait for Windows to reinstall and go through whole tedious process again. My advice stick with Windows 7.

Well, if you're still willing, I had this problem for weeks and couldn't get around it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's what I did.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold Control+Shift+ESC on the keyboard to bring up Task Manager.</li><li>Find STORE and end the task.</li><li>Go into C:\Windows\software distribution\downloads</li><li>Delete everything in that folder.</li><li>Windows+R to go to the RUN menu.</li><li>Type in "WSRESET"</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, open up the store and you should be able to get back in providing that you're not using a Windows To Go installation.</p>

Tried this, Store App still just gives me the "running" but never any results after 10 minutes of grinding away. Also preventing me from updating any app on the computer.

            <p>Amazing new fix. For some odd reason my store would not start kept saying cannot communicate with the server.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here's the fix...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Click or touch the app&nbsp;store icon&nbsp;it will come up saying all that from above and it will be functionless. Open charms, touch settings, then touch your account. It will appear to be communicating. This may take a few times but you will see the sign in button
 briefly appear then disappear and you will get looped back to that BS can't connect. If you tap really fast or click really fast over where the sign in button briefly appeared you will catch it. The sign in page will appear. Sign in and then the app store
 will crash or minimize. Now touch or click the store again and it will finally turn on allowing you access to the App Store.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Months of jacking with it using Microsoft's techniques. Glad I found this workaround&nbsp;since some major apps are about to roll out.. 😉</p>

<h2>            Volume shadow copy won&#39;t start  -Error 1053 didn&#39;t start in a timely manner</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: volume shadow copy won't start<br />
<br />
Hi. I am having problems that I think all stem with volume shadow copy not starting. I cannot backup. I cannot volume shadow copy when I go into services. It says automatic but won't start. I get this erro:</p>
<p>error 1053 didn't sstart in a timely manner</p>
<p>It says volume shadow copy stopped working .</p>
<p>This means I can't restore to an early date. All the other relevant services are enabled to start and automatic in services.</p>
<p>I want to restore to earlier date but can't because it depends on volume copy (I have it on autmoatic) . I also checked and the 4 other services that are related I have in services as automatic started are all ok. HELP!! I can use my sprint card to get on
 internet but can't open documents in open office, can't find wireless networks, can't restore to earlier date and also can't delete programs as well! I am not a techie so can you tell me step by step? I do not want to do a clean install if I can help it. Everything
 else works fine so if there is a way I can just go back a few days I think everything will be ok.. but I can't without restore working. Or is there a different non-ms program that I can use to restore to an earlier date? That is all I really need..</p>
<p>Thank you for ANY help!</p>

<p>Hi. I am continuing my question. I figured out my login finally.</p>
<p>I have not resolved things. When I tried to update the windows netframe for the 1053 error it said there that was version 1.1 . I checked my computer and have several versions all the way up to 3.5. I did the update for 3.5 as it wouldn't let me do the earlier
 one. But it didn't help.</p>
<p>I also did the sfc checker and it said it corrected some corrupt files but couldn't do other ones. DO you think I should turn back the system restore another week earlier. Ihad already turned it back using safemode about 4 days back before problem started
 and it didn't help it so I don't think that will help either.</p>
<p>I read somewhere that if you can't turn on network discovery (another problem as it keeps saying invalid syntax) that it may be because you don't have computer browser on. I can't get that started either. When I go to servcies, it will say: it started and
 stopped.</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestion for the volume shadow copy now that I did update the network frame 3.5 and it didn't help? I have other versions of it on computer too but can't get those earlier updates added in as it won't allow me to do so. I also can't remove
 programs at all in the programs/features.</p>
<p>If I can somehow either get volume shadow copy to work, the network discovery to turn on (it can't because it says invalid syntax when I try to click apply) or to get the open office files to open again, I'd be happy.</p>
<p>Thanks for any advice.</p>
        </p>

            <p>What you need to do is restart the volume shadow copy service and set it to start automaticaly to do this first:</p>
<p>go to start and open the control panel go to administrative services in the classic view the open services and look for the service Volume Shadow Copy service and then right click on it and select properties. There will be a section that says Startup Type
 and set it to Automatic. And lower in the window it will show the service status and select start then press OK. Try to run The System Restore program again and it should work but if it dosent reboot the system to make sure the changes took effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if that dosent work do the same to these services as well:<span>: windows backup, and
<span>nti is schedule svc</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Ogleva,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you wish to the fast boot your <strong>BIOS</strong>, the hardware components of your device will load faster, in order to load Windows desktop faster. As for the windows fast boot, what it will load faster is the
<strong>Operating System</strong> itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a combination of a coldrestart and sleep or hibernate. Doing a fast startup for Windows would close all applications faster and same goes with loading an application, if you've enable your System Configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If further assistance is needed, don't hesitate to reply on this thread.</p>

<h2>            Weapons Firing Rate Change</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hey everyone. I've search the forums and didn't find anything relating to this particular question..</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When playing any game mode my weapons (primary weapon)&nbsp;switches from rapid fire to single round shots after being killed. I know the weapons have different firing options but I never select
 single shot at all, at least not intentionally. How can I switch back and forth from firing modes when this happens again? Any insight on this is appreciated. Thanks.</span></p>

<p>I think the Dpad toggles the fire rate for weapons. Im not sure if its left or right though (maybe down or up), but use the Dpad.</p>

<p>It's a glitch. If you press either right or left on the D-pad it has a chance to "glitch out". You'll still see it's in full-auto, but when you attempt to fire, it'll switch to semi-auto. Just to be clear, but I haven't heard any cases of this before the
 Aftermath patch, so it seems to be a recent addition. </p>

<p>Some weapons, like the AN-94, are automatically set to burst fire, even though they have Full Auto and Single Shot available. Some have Full Auto and Single Shot, and some have all 3. Just make sure that you have selected the correct setting by looking at
 the small blocks above your ammo indicator. </p>

<p>I honestly don't think it's a glitch. I think it has to do with the crappy Dpad on the 360 controller thinking you are pushing it up or down when in reality you are trying to hit it left or right. Why do I think this? i used to have the exact same problem
 until I moved to an Evil controller which has it's Dpad buttons all seperated like the A,B,X,Y buttons and I have not had the problem once since.</p>

                    <p>I installed windows 10 about a month ago, and was working fine. Then just recently i have been getting the blue screen saying dpc watchdog violation. I have tried numerous things, to unchecking fast start up, deleting and reinstalling Ethernet and audio

            Thank u so much for the help. I was able to uninstall and reinstall my driver for Ati Radeon graphics card. Now when I check the date on the driver it is 2015. But unfortunately I restarted and in about 5 min my system froze again and gave my the same
 error message - DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION. Any other suggestions? Really appreciate it ;)

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
If you did that recently try a System Restore.<br />
<br />
Right Click the Start - Button - Control Panel - System - on left Advanced System<br />
Settings - System Protection tab&nbsp;- System Restore.<br />
<br />
The best way to move that folder would have been make a .BAK folder<br />
under Windows such as SystemApps.bak - then you could have just<br />
moved it back.<br />
<br />
This is the default folder for Cortana :<br />
<br />

<h2>            Using DISM in PowerShell to set up features on Server 2012R2</h2>
                    <p>
This is all being done in VMware. I know I can point and click in server manager and it will all work. with the market trend I what to be proficient in PowerShell.</p>
<p>
logical layout is as follows.</p>
<p>
Parent domain x.local has 2 AD DC’s named SRV1 &amp; SRV2</p>
<p>
Child domain y.x.local has just the one DC SRV2</p>
<p>
I am having an issue with authorizing the dhcp server on SRV3 in powershell. I am logged in as administrator of SRV3.</p>
<p>
I have the service installed and running with example found at&nbsp;<a href="https://4sysops.com/archives/how-to-install-a-dhcp-server-on-server-core/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">how to install a dhcp server on server core</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
I also was able to create a scope&nbsp;of&nbsp;192.168.100.241 – 192.168.10.254 /28</p>
<p>
I can’t use the option to set DNS is this because the dhcp is yet to be authorized?</p>
<p>
I can see in server manager that the DHCP Service on SRV3 is running, And shows that post install configuration is needed.</p>
<p>
a) create the security groups “DHCP Administators &amp; DHCP Users” did that from powershell.</p>
<p>
b) authorize DHCP server on target computer (if domain joined)</p>
<p>
the &nbsp;<strong>Add-DhcpServerInDC -DNSName</strong></p>
<p>
any help would be great.</p>

    <title>Cant boot Windows 10, WINDOWS&#92;System32&#92;drivers&#92;ACPI.sys - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cant boot Windows 10, WINDOWS&#92;System32&#92;drivers&#92;ACPI.sys Dillema</h2>
                    Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I have just recently run into a problem with my Desktop PC, I am running Windows 10 and just recently moved offices and had to take apart and re assemble my Desktop PC. After putting all the computer components back together and booting up the PC. I was able
 to start up my Computer to my login screen. But when entering my password and logging in a error message was displayed and the PC turned off. Then when trying to start it up for the second time I was presented with the Automatic Repair Screen. The computer
 attempts to repair then displays the following screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
"Start-up Repair<br />
<br />
<br />
Start-up Repair couldn't repair your PC<br />
<br />
<br />
Press "Advanced Options" to try other options to repair your PC, or "Shutdown" to turn off your PC.<br />
<br />
Log file F:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt"<br />
<br />
I have tried booting recovery mode from a Windows CD and a USB image, when doing so I am unable to run Startup Repair, I have no Restore Points saved either. So i then tried to run the bootrec commands , I can run the "bootrec /fixmbr" command, but when trying
 the /fixboot , and /rebuildbcd I cannot run them and get this error message "element not found".<br />
<br />
I have run a chkdsk with the /f sand /r but could not find any errors, I then checked the "WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt" file but could not see any errors logged.<br />
<br />
I tried a number of tutorials on YouTube but most of them did not fix the issue or could not run because of lack of privillages.<br />
<br />
I then tried disconnecting all external hardware to see if that would fix the issue, but that didnt work. I then also disconnected any extra HDD I had installed internally, but that didnt help either.<br />
<br />
Lastly I changed the cable for my main HDD to another port and that also didnt fix it.<br />
<br />
I have also tried hard resetting the bios from the Motherboard, that also didnt fix anything.<br />
<br />
I then entered command prompt and typed in "notepad" and clicked open to see if I could browse all my data , just to see if my drive was currupt. But it looked like everything was there and fine.
<br />
<br />
I then disabled the Automatic Repair with the following command line "bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No" , I did this to see if I could boot up and access my login screen that way. But now that the Automatic repair screen loop has been disabled I am
 presented with the following error Message everytime.<br />
<br />
"Your PC/Device needs to be repaired<br />
<br />
The operating system couldn't be loaded because a critical system driver is missing or contains errors.<br />
<br />
File:\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\ACPI.sys<br />
Error code: 0xc0000102"<br />
<br />
Can someone please set me on the right path , I really do not want to have to do a Factory Re install.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to repair the "File:\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\ACPI.sys" driver.<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated,<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

            You said you reassembled the computer.
<br />
<br />Did you check to make sure each component is properly fitted and secured?
<br />
<br />Did you try swapping out RAM modules or installing banks 1 and 3 to see if it helps?

            Hi Peter.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Everything else possible to get WIndows 10 to start is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But you'd probably save time doing the automated Reset from the Advanced Startup Options:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  This is known to solve this problem when notihng else will.
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hey Andre, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I forgot to add, yes, I did swap out all the ram and swapping all the banks, and I also did recheck all the connections to see if they where all fitted snug. But none of these fixed the issue.</p>

            <p>You can usually uninstall toolbars or other junk items from the <strong>Uninstall a Program
</strong>page in Control Panel. See if you can find the toolbar there:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click the Start button, type Uninstall a Program and hit Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. In the list of programs installed on your computer, see if you can find anything that resembles a toolbar. Right-click and uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also run Google's Chrome Cleanup Tool. This is designed to restore default settings if adware or other unwanted programs mess with your settings. It works best with Google Chrome, but it also works with other browsers.</p>

<h2>            Raams shadow DLC problems&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>hey there guys have you been experiencing any glitches with this game? i've just have to replay a whole chapter again because restarting a check point didn't fix the problem and it's a bit that you can't move on from unless you get the bad guy to do what
 you want and it kept getting stuck in the corner. not only that, jacks door opening skills are brilliant as he can open them from round corners
<br />
<br />
i feel this is ruining the dlc slightly for me. :(</p>

<p>Yeah I had some dramas- When under ground fighting of wretches the droid is busy opening a door- but once you've killed all the wretches the droid was still cutting through the door. I then came and tryed to replay and it came up as corrupt save-delete save
 and start again. I left it untill i got back to the uk, stuck in the gears disk and the campaign carried on as normal--real weird.</p>

<p>I've only played it for half hour or so, so far I've just got into the bank and down in to the basement where the vault is, not had any real issues but I have noticed jack disappear and reappear from no where again, also issues with the computer controlled
 players, when I am down I crawl to them and they completely ignore me and let me die.
</p>
<p>Still enjoying the dlc though, glad to be playing gears 3 again</p>

<h2>            Xbox hard drive Empty</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My Xbox locked up while playing Skyrim off the hard drive and I had to turn it off. When i turned it back on it took about an extra minute than normal at the xbox screen with the white background. Once it loaded the dashboard it said there are no profiles.
 Going into storage shows that there is hard drive space still being used, however the breakdown in "Games and Apps" or "Profiles" etc etc all show as completely empty.&nbsp; I cleared the system cache and have tried starting the xbox without the hard drive inserted
 then restarting it with it back in without any sucess. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hey mrplow. Have you tried clearing the caches? And also can you please try inserting your HDD into another console and downloading it to test if it is truly your console or HDD. If it is your HDD please contact Support and request a repair. Thanks :D</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Are you able to open the program or application using both the Desktop shortcut?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Try to restart your computer in
<b>Safe mode</b> and check if the problem persists.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it works fine in safe mode try performing a clean boot to find the root cause</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the article for steps on how to start your computer in clean boot state.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program
 in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality
 when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network,
 network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>NOTE</strong>: Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting” to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Question about Gmail account and xbox</h2>
                    
<p>i made my xbox live account using a gmail &nbsp;account and i went through the process of verifying the email. my question is why did it make a hotmail profile for me i wanted everything to go through gmail. if i go to hotmail and sign in using my gmail it brings
 me to a hotmail profile saying do you want to start getting you emails form your gmail. just a little confused as to why it automatically makes a profile for you why cant i just go through gmail i can sign in with the gmail ?</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Every Microsoft Account automatically get's that same interface. You can make an account with @anyemailaddress.anything and it would still display that same Hotmail like page when you login to it. It's just letting you know that it can import your mail from
 Gmail or any other provider straight into Hotmail.<br />
<br />
Signing into the account on Gmail will sign you into your e-mail inbox and you can proceed normally, signing into your Xbox.com account and then going to Hotmail.com will automatically transfer you to the Hotmail.com interface but your gmail e-mail's won't
 be displayed there unless you actually import them.<br />
<br />
It's simply there because Gmail is a Google service, and Hotmail is a Microsoft service. Anything to do with a Microsoft Account is automatically paired with a sudo Hotmail account. You don't actually have to use that Hotmail at all, it's simply there. You'll
 still receive all of your mail at your Gmail address in regards to Xbox.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Hibernating results in a fade to black, then the lock screen&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tommy sebestyen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hibernating results in a fade to black, then the lock screen&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>This problem only recently started up.</p>
<p>Basically, if I hibernate in any way (the power button, like I usually do, shutdown /h, Start &gt; Hibernate, anything) it simply fades to black like normal and then immediately shows the lock screen. &nbsp;When I do shutdown /h, I receive a message saying "Not
 enough storage is available to process this command.(8)" This is strange, as I have 439.9 GB left on my hard drive and only 16 GB of RAM compared to that. &nbsp;I use hibernate everyday at school, so I hope to fix this soon. &nbsp;I've tried all sorts of stuff. &nbsp;Enabling
 automount in diskpart is useless because it was already enabled. &nbsp;Some people reported using startup repair, but that reported no problems to me. &nbsp;hiberfil.sys exists. &nbsp;I really don't know what's going on and this laptop is new. &nbsp;The only thing I've done recently
 that could have done something was that I used MSI Afterburner to overclock my GPU and RAM, but I didn't overclock my RAM at all and this problem didn't start until today, when I did the overclocking two days ago with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I haven't tested sleep, as when I first bought this laptop sleep was not working properly (refused to wake up) and I didn't want to have to force restart. &nbsp;But, I can try it if need be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MY specs are these.</p>
<p>ASUS ROG GL752VW</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home x64</p>
<p>Intel Core i7-6700</p>
<p>16GB RAM</p>
<p>Nvidia GTX 960M</p>

            <p>Hi Timmy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To assist you with your concern on using hibernate on&nbsp;your device, you can enable the hibernate in Windows 10 by&nbsp;doing the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Windows</strong> logo + X.</li><li>Select <strong>Power Options</strong>.</li><li>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Change&nbsp;plan settings</strong>&nbsp;beside your current plan.</li><li>Go to <strong>Change advanced power settings</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>On the pop-up box, select <strong>Sleep</strong>, then under <strong>Hibernate</strong> after you can change the&nbsp;number in minutes for the
<strong>Setting</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
        </p>

            <p>That has nothing to do with my problem. &nbsp;I know that I can change the delay for auto-hibernate, but I was trying to explain that no matter which method activates the hibernation command it fails and shows the lock screen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;Why is it that it always takes at least 5 replies on these forums to get someone who ACTUALLY reads my post and understands the question I asked, AND helps me solve it instead of copy and pasting a generic answer out of a Word document every employee
 gets.</p>

<h2>            Friend Unable to Play Installed DLC for Black Ops 2 on Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>Hello. As the title says, my friend has installed the DLC for Black Ops 2, seems to have everything where it should be. However,&nbsp;whenever he loads up Black Ops and tries to play zombies, it won’t show he has any of the extra maps, just Tranzit. We’re not sure why or how this is happening, and we’re hoping for some help. Thanks for any input!</p><p><br /></p>
