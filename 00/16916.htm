<h2>            Missing Codec&#47;Windows DVD player</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone. Trying to watch a DVD on my pc. After some extensive frustration with multiple players, I discovered that my pc might be missing a codec, called Dolby AC3. Does anyone know how to fix this? If I buy the official Microsoft dvd player will it
 be able to play this dvd movie? Also, why is it no longer free? I saw it costs like $15. Pretty sure it was free up until now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks guys and have a great day!&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's no longer free because many users don't want/need it and they would still have had to bear the cost of licensing. MS stopped licensing commercial&nbsp;DVD play&nbsp;several years ago (in W8.1).</p>
<p>However there's a very good free player available here - It plays most DVD and video (subject to some copyright restrictions) It's not a bad audio player either... Cheers, Ric.</p>

    <title>Daylight Savings Time - August patch working only temporarily - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mwmoore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Daylight Savings Time - August patch working only temporarily</h2>
                    Hi!&nbsp; I've installed the August, 2009 DST patch (http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/downloads/microsoft/daylight-savings-update.mspx) twice now.&nbsp; When I first installed it and checked appointments, times appeared to be correct (some actually changed
 right before my very eyes from the incorrect time to the corrected one).&nbsp; At some point however, the patch "stopped working".&nbsp; I don't know if it happened when I turned my phone off or let my battery drain completely before recharging or what, but for example,
 if I viewed appointments from October, 2009 on my phone they were an hour off even though they were corrected when I had initially installed the patch.&nbsp; I uninstalled the .cab file and reinstalled it; the appointments were fixed, but again only temporarily.&nbsp;
 For a second time now the patch has just "stopped working."&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; <br />
<p><br />
This whole DST issue has been a thorn in my side for the 7 years that I've had Windows Mobile products (currently I have an HTC Imagio).&nbsp; I was so excited when this August, 2009 patch seemed to do the trick, but find myself completely frustrated again at the
 incorrect calendar and the hours of time put in to fixing it.<br />
<br />
Would love to hear any thoughts on this.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Michelle</p>

            Do you also sync with your PC?&nbsp; If yes, then you'll need to update Windows and Microsoft Office Outlook as well.
<br />
<br />
There are two sets of instructions (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/downloads/microsoft/daylight-savings-update.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/downloads/microsoft/daylight-savings-update.mspx</a>).&nbsp; You need to follow
 the set that applies to your situation.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />

Anyway, to answer your question, I do sync my phone with a PC but I have had the Windows and Outlook updates installed.&nbsp; All of the dates are correct in&nbsp;Outlook even though they are not correct on my phone.&nbsp; Any other thoughts to the problem?<br />

            Michelle, try changing your TimeZone to a different TimeZone and then soft reset your device.&nbsp; Now change it back, soft reset and check to see if it is fixed.

            By the way, I just uninstalled and reinstalled the August 2009 DST patch AGAIN. &nbsp;Appointments were correct. &nbsp;I powered off and on my phone and the patch stopped working (just like in the original post on this thread); appointments were incorrect. &nbsp;I tried
 changing time zones, restarting phone, and switching back to the correct time zone again just for kicks. &nbsp;Still no fix.

<p>Are we still waiting on an answer to this?</p>
<p>I am in Australia and we have just changed over to our non-Daylight Saving Time (first Sunday in April). I too have had the DST issue every single time we change to/from DST. Previously a reinstall of DST update kb949168.cab (March 2008) has seemed to solve
 the problem, but not this time (April 2010).</p>
<p>I tried the recent August 2009 update this time and I am having the same issue as Michelle&nbsp;- it works temporarily until the device needs to be restarted (such as when the battery goes dead).</p>
<p>I am syncing with Outlook 2003 and running Win XP (SP3) - all updates are current. My phone is a HTC TyTN II running Windows Mobile 6 Professional. Outlook is fine, the issues is only with the Calendar showing correct times for appointments.</p>
<p>Have tried changing time zones and then back again to no avail. The Aug 2009 fix works, but doesn't stay working - surely this is an easy adjustment to make?</p>
<p>Hopefully Windows Mobile 7 will solve this issue once and for all, but in the meantime can we please have a fix that doesn't need to be reinstalled everytime you restart the phone.</p>
<p>Terry.</p>

<p>Just some further clarification and information on this.</p>
<p>Should clarify from my previous post that Outlook on the PC is showing all the correct times for the appointments. It is the Calendar on the Phone whose times are out by one hour. No problems with DST on the PC, just on the Phone. This is the first time
 the previous phone patches haven't corrected it (I have tried un/re-installing those several times).</p>
<p>Also the Aug 2009 patch seems to stop working randomly even if the phone doesn't power down. I thought that the restart of Windows Mobile was the culprit, but after playing around some more without restarting or powering down, it appears that the patch still&nbsp;fails
 after some time so it is not a power/restarting issue. I cannot work out what is causing it to fail -&nbsp;I have played around with opening and closing&nbsp;various programs (including the calendar and contacts) and can't replicate it. However inevitably it will stop
 working every time.</p>

            <p>I am having basically the same issues as Tectrix - I have the same setup, with the exceptions of running Windows 6.5 on a&nbsp;HTC Touch Pro II&nbsp;and living on the East Coast of the US.&nbsp; When DST happened, my appointments and clock on my phone are shifted one hour
 ahead.&nbsp; However, if I schedule an appointment on my phone calendar, it shows up as an hour EARLIER on my PC outlook calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I'm so uncertain as to my actual appointment times that I go into the notes for the appointment and actually type in the time -- that's the ONLY way I know for sure when my appointments are.&nbsp; As an organizational consultant, I absolutely have to be
 on time for meetings.&nbsp; I need a solution to this ridiculous work-around!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Corrupted my External Hard Drive</h2>
                    <p>If Windows 10 is corrupting your extrenal hard drives, for instance a data drive that is a portable usb drive, the solution is 2 fold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First disable "fast Start Up" :</p>
<p>1 settings &gt; 2 System &gt; 3 Power and Sleep &gt; 4 Additional power settings (On right side)&nbsp; &gt;5 Choose what the power buttons do &gt;6 Choose settings that are currently unavailable &gt;7 turn off fast start up (uncheck).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see no difference in the start up speed, but it does corrupt the external drives when on. I am guessing now, but I suspect windows 10 writes to the system drive instructions on what it's state was before shut down, and this includes definition of the external
 drives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Part 2:&nbsp; The annoying chkdsk at boot up (press any key to stop error checking)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/160963/chkntfs-exe-what-you-can-use-it-for</p>

<p>
</p><p>Are you referring to the icons at the bottom of the &lt;Nav Pane&gt;? Just need to click on the 3 dots --&gt; select &lt;Navigation Options&gt; and check the box for &lt;Compact Navigation&gt;</p>

            <p>Hi mikeagop </p>
<p>
</p><p>Re "<span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>They advised me that if the phone cannot be repaired and has to be replaced,
</em></span><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">it would be substituted with the AT&amp;T 1520 version,</span> NOT the RM-938 1520.3 that we originally purchased. This is categorically unacceptable.
</em></span>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>RM 940 Is perfectly reasonable as the issue is WARRANTY not a guarentee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is NO answer answer or an answer (except replacment) however <span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>if the phone cannot be repaired</em></span></span> is the bridge yet&nbsp; to be crossed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand it there the&nbsp; RM-938, USA &amp;&nbsp; RM-940 AT&amp; T are "similar"</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The AT&amp;T, RM-940 has additionally the 1700 MHz frequency for HSDPA</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>BOTH RM-938, RM-940 have exactly the same 4G frequencies.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>My opinion is that if the Qi Charging plate was part of a package the relative expensive charger not being faulty should NOT be returned
<strong>****</strong>!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an&nbsp; issue if&nbsp; your original 1520 was unlocked as I would expect a replacement to be locked to AT&amp;T</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>****!!! </strong></p>
<p>The 1520 battery cover has an <strong>induction strip</strong> inserted and without it you cannot charge wirelessly
</p>
<p>Uk based so I do NOT know where you can get one from <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/list/Shop-Nokia-Lumia-1520-accessories/categoryID.67762200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/list/Shop-Nokia-Lumia-1520-accessories/categoryID.67762200</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The AT&amp;T model will NOT be supplied with this essential induction strip </p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally on the issue of repairs</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>The major cure all procedure is the Battery Pull . JUST removing the battery and re inserting corrects many diverse issues.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The 1520 has a NON user replaceable batttery so it may be the one procedure needed to fix the phone or kick start it to get the diagnostics to complete in order NOT to face the replacement issues that can follow</p>

<h2>            N95-1&#58; PC-suite won&#39;t sync Adress Books thumnail pictures&#33;</h2>
                    Hello, this is my very first post here. Just registered. I'm Daniel from Sweden.<br />
<br />
Now now..<br />
<br />
Ive got a first model of Nokia N95. Connectivity works the way I want it to, exept one thing. I can set a picture to each person in my Windows Adress book, and every info on each one syncs down to the N95. Exept the thumbnails of each person resembling their
 faces. A really neat thing, tho I can live without it. When I used this phone on a Mac months ago, iSync did it just right, that included the pictres.<br />
<br />
Note: ON THE PHONE; I can attatch faces pictures wih Adress book endties, but I want to do it from the Pc Sute.<br />
<br />
How anyone has any kind of help to this.<br />
<br />
Regards!<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            Yeah, I know that I even with this new version, that I now use, (7.0.41.13), /CAN/ set thumnails of people. But the thumbnail does not get synced to the phone and visisble on the phone when the name in question is highlited (or that person calls). I want
 that. It worked on a mac using iSync. Why wouldnt a genuine software from Nokia on a PC include that ability as well?<br />

<h3> dave cannon62  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 830 apps crashing</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lumia 830 and had the upgrade to W10 a few months ago.</p>
<p>All was fine until there was an update a couple of months ago. since then, several apps including Facebook crash while using them.</p>
<p>Last week, I did a factory reset and then set the phone up as a new device rather than restore from a back up. Everything has been fine for 6 days, but now Facebook and other apps crashing again and occasionally causing the phone to reboot. Not sure what
 else I can do.</p>

                    I'd like to create an email that allows the reader to see additional information in a pop up/text box when they hover over a certain text (like a number) .&nbsp; Is there a way to do this in outlook 365 with having to write html code?<br />

            <p>Hi Brandon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can add alternate text to your pictures, shapes etc.. in Outlook email message. Refer the article below and see if the information helps.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Add-alternative-text-to-a-picture-shape-chart-SmartArt-graphic-or-table-52327e7c-cecb-45d4-9367-f911aa442371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Add-alternative-text-to-a-picture-shape-chart-SmartArt-graphic-or-table-52327e7c-cecb-45d4-9367-f911aa442371</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But having html coding to create hover over texts is not good since it will have an effect on the clients who are viewing. Sometimes, client machines are not capable of handling that kind of complexity in code then the email might break. If you send an email
 you must design it to be received by all email clients and the way to do that is to with the simplest form of HTML.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Let us know if you have any queries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>One of the possible reasons why you're unable to delete the message is corrupted profile. We suggest
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-an-outlook-profile-f544c1ba-3352-4b3b-be0b-8d42a540459d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">creating a new profile</a></strong> in Outlook and check if you're still unable to delete the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also clear out your <strong>Deleted items</strong> folder if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Update us with the outcome so we can provide you further assistance.</p>

Go to options via the gear dropdown in the top right corner. Then click the calendar you want to delete. Now there is a remove option in the top bar right next to the big Calendar logo.<br />
<br />
It also took me a while to find it!<br />

<p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>First make sure&nbsp;your files&nbsp;not exceed the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2933738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 any improvement.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: <strong>Backup</strong> all the local documents &amp; files to another place
<strong>before </strong>clearing cache to avoid any loss.</p>
<p>Besides, if you are syncing with your OneDrive for Business library only (no SharePoint libraries), I would suggest you use the OneDrive Next Generation Sync Client to avoid such issue.</p>
<p>Download the guide at<a href="https://preview.onedrive.com/sync/setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"> Welcome to the OneDrive for Business Sync Client preview!</span></a> and follow the Configuration Guide included in the .zip file on how to use the new

    <title>Missing shared mailbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing shared mailbox</h2>
                    <p>I'm coming to this late, but hopefully I have enough details to get this out coherently...</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had a terminated user's mailbox setup as shared, and the on-prem AD account was accidentally deleted a few months. We recovered the account from the AD trash and (supposedly) the mailbox was recovered as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of this week, the users that are still accessing the mailbox no longer see it though, and it's missing from the shared mailbox list. The user is still in AD on-prem and in the 365 portal this time; we're just missing the mailbox. I've done a check against
 soft-deleted mailboxes, and it's not there either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts? I know we should use holds on cases like this...one thing at a time.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Amervis,<br />
<br />
Firstly, I’d like to confirm whether you have Exchange on-premise or not. If not, my understanding is that you synced the AD user account to Office 365 and then assigned an Exchange online license for the synced user account. As a result, this user account
 has a corresponding Exchange online mailbox. After that, the user mailbox was converted to a shared mailbox.
<br />
<br />
Given the situation, I suggest you disable/delete the AD user account if you don’t need to manage this user locally. Then you can directly create a shared mailbox in Office 365 with the same address; if you need to manage the AD user locally, you can repeat
 the process of converting the shared mailbox in Office 365 online as the above paragraph mentioned.
<br />
<br />
If it is not your situation, please clarify it with more details. For example, how you got the shared mailbox previously.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>This is correct, Alan. When the user left the company, the mailbox was converted to shared and the license was removed. Normally we keep the mailbox shared for a month before the user account is deleted and the shared mailbox goes away at that point. In
 this case, the mailbox was needed for longer and so the account has remained active.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The AD account remains disabled but active today, but sometime since March 1, the shared mailbox has vanished.&nbsp;I&nbsp;am fairly certain that the mailbox is lost permanently, but I'd like to know if there's anything besides a soft-match check I can try?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Amervis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>I'd like to know whether the shared mailbox was migrated to Exchange Online from your Exchange Server as a regular user mailbox and later converted to a shared mailbox through the Exchange admin center in Exchange Online. If yes, please try the steps below
 to fix the issue:</p>

            <p>Hey Robert, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The mailbox would have been originally created in the Exchange Online environment, not on-prem. You are correct that it was converted to shared in the EAC. However, the mailbox does not show up in either the regular, shared, or soft-deleted&nbsp;lists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>Since the (shared) mailbox is originally created in Exchange Online, if the AD account of the mailbox gets deleted and then restored in AD, the AD account will be synced to Office 365 again, but the mailbox will go into the 30-day grace period since it is
 converted to a shared mailbox and has no Exchange Online license.</p>
<p>Given the situation, please assign an Exchange Online license to the user, then give full access to one user to see if the mailbox is still there. If not, I'm afraid the mailbox is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
Robert

            I reapplied a license to the accoutn to generate mailbox, but it was empty. That would indicate the data was lost, correct?

            <p>Hi Andy,<br />
<br />
I would suggest you try to use eDiscovery search to see if you can find these data in the mailbox. You can refer to the article below to create an in-place eDiscovery search:<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd353189(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd353189(v=exchg.150).aspx</a></p>
<p>If the data can't be found, it would be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Yang</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>Since you can find some items in the mailbox, please try to recover it.</p>
<p>As you cannot find the mailbox in eDiscovery, it cannot be recovered. For your question "but I'm curious as to why there's such a clean break between the two mailboxes?", it is difficult to find the reason, thanks for your understanding.</p>

            I'm afraid the voda varient doesn't allow you to use mp3s as ringtone. I guessing that it is so you have to buy their ringtones<br />

            Vodafone's 6630 variants do, indeed, have the MP3 support disabled. They probably wanted to "encourage" people to buy the ringtones from Vodafone Live! instead.

                    I just saw on YouTube new build of Windows 10 carrying Cortana in Search. Is it true? and if yes, why I am not able to see it?

<h2>            Is there a way to link an MS Project 2007 file to MS Access&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to DIRECTLY link a Project 2007&nbsp;file into Access?&nbsp; I know there are various ways to get Project files linked to an Access database, but since I keep uncovering new ways to do it that many other people say aren't possible, I thought I should
 just ask.&nbsp; Since I have already found many sources saying it can't be done, please don't bother saying "It can't be done."&nbsp; I am just looking to see if there is someone who knows how it CAN be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, since this is a longshot anyway, I am also interested to know of any ways that it might be possible to Link Project files to a database INDIRECTLY.&nbsp; These are the ones I have picked up so far:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- In Project, save as an Excel file.&nbsp; Then in Access, import as a Linked table.</p>
<p>- In Project, go to Reports &gt; Visual Reports &gt; save as a database.&nbsp; Then in Access, import as a Linked table.</p>
<p>- In Project, select a cell and copy.&nbsp; In Access, Paste Special &gt; Paste as Link.&nbsp; (So far I can't get the Paste Link to work, but this option is way too tedious to make it viable anyway.)</p>

            See the following blog post for guidance on the reporting db<br />
<br />
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/project_programmability/archive/2006/12/05/reporting-database-diagrams.aspx<br />
<br />
The SDK for Project 2007 contains a lot of data about reading from the db.<br />
<br />
A couple of excerpts from Rod Gill's book are on MSDN and his book covers reading from the reporting db in detail.<br />
<br />
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee355230.aspx<br />
<br />
This would not be something likely for a new programmer but Rod's book is excellent.&nbsp; If you wish to pursue this path, I'd suggest visiting the Programming and Customization forum on technet:<br />
<br />
http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/project2010custprog/threads<br />
<br />
I'm also a bit baffled as to why you want to link from a db with the reporting data into another db.&nbsp; Can you not just use the reporting mdb file?<br />

    <title>Outlook.com calendar automatic notifications - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> olistead  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com calendar automatic notifications</h2>
                    Since the recent UI update for the Outlook.com calendar, it seems that a default notification is applied when creating all-day or time-boxed events. This is annoying to turn off&nbsp;<em>every single time</em>. Is it possible to have them turned off by default
 again, as before?

            Hello Olistead,
<br />
<br />I am an Independent advisor willing to help you.
<br />
<br />I would suggest to you check the configuration for Add or remove reminders for meetings, the you can change the settings for all new meetings This applies to all the existing appointments and meetings in the calendar. Save this setting for future appointments and meetings.
<br />
<br />Click File &gt; Options &gt; Calendar.
<br />
<br />Under Calendar options, select or clear Default reminders.
<br />
<br />Set the default amount of time at which you want to receive reminders before new calendar items (for example, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.).
<br />
<br />Set the Default reminders
<br />Set the default reminders for new calendar items.
<br />

            Hi 
<br />Give this a try Click on link below sign in and it should take you to the Calendar notification reminders page on the old classic version. This will replicate through to your new version. On reminders uncheck show reminders and set default reminder to 0.
<br /><a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/options/calendarreminders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/options/cal...</a>
<br />When creating events you can select reminders and choose time for the reminders that you want notifications for. 
<br />Let me know if it resolves your problem. 
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

</p><p>I don't believe the new skin has the trash icons - at least I can't find them:</p>
<p>

</p><p>In any case, I think this would only have worked for this individual event. I am trying to remove the notifications from being added by default.</p>

<br />if that doesn't work then I suggest that you contact microsoft with a suggestion through andsuggest them to fix it.

<br />We are only moderators in this community just like you. We do not have any special fixes. We try to help others with our suggestions. 
<br />Sorry if it doesn't work for you give it a try I know mine are all unchecked and I don't hear them so maybe this is where in the newer version you'll have to turn them off.

                    When I log onto the wall street journal website with my new windows 7 computer their site does not give me access to paid online service. The site does however recognize me because I can access my account information and see that my subscription is current.
 It also will let me go to their Barron's site which is also paid and the Barron's site does recognize me. Access still works correctly from my old computer and from my i-phone. What is it about this one site that does not like my new computer? HP E9280T, IE8
