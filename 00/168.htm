            Anthony,<br />
&nbsp;In New Outlook you have to perform an action to see<br />
the hidden buttons.<br />
Example Open a E-mail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write a new e-mail<br />
When you do an action you should see the Send button<br />
at the top of Command bar.<br />
Also,to get to Forward you have to select the down arrow<br />
next to the Reply button to see Forward.<br />

<h2>            Need help with userforms</h2>
                    I have spent the last 3 days researching every forum on this matter on Userform property and loading. There was 1 workaround by Microsoft saying to turn on the visible factor during design more but I dont even see this property. Unlike the others, I can
 change font and text position but nothing else. When I attempt to change Height from 253, it goes to 42 automatically, Worst is the error message Microsoft Visual Basic as title, then "Error occurred when loading" on each AND EVERY USERFORM whether created
 by me or from someone else. My earlier action was to delete all forms and redo after I re-installed Office for Mac 2011 (TWICE) but nothing changed.FYI, I only just bought the 2011 about 3 weeks back and have already reinstalled twice. PLUS, it actually got
 worst than before the reinstall. Previously, I only get the error on loading message&nbsp;occasionally. Now, it happens to each and every form and a new bug after install cut the form into half, leaving the text box visible but the command button severed. Researching
 that, the only solution that someone actually found a way round this was to change display resolution on screen but for me, amplifying it to 800 x 600 didnt change the form size. Hence the &nbsp;2nd reinstall. I am way past my dateline and with no sleep, its getting
 .............
<div>I tend not to bother others as I believe there's a solution from some techkie and yes I did find many solution which some are only applicable to Mac but many suggestions also generated less than desirable resolution and thus after 3- days I have no more
 options. I needed that userform to perform login function across a few layers of user types. Office hinges on ActiveX which Mac clearly stayed away and so object creations are and if created would not be consistent. I should have known of this prior and that's
 where I am at the corner and &nbsp;dont know of any other options to do that, I am so fried now.&nbsp;</div>

            According to google that error is "ambiguous name." We can't really help unless you provide some of the code that is causing the error.<br />
<br />
Lastly, uninstallig and reinstalling Office rarely, if ever, helps and usually causes more problems that it was intended to solve. How did you uninstall it? Unless you did it this way already, I recommend completely uninstalling this way: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768.
 then empty the trash and restart your machine. Then reinstall from your original disc and reapply all updates, repair disc permissions, and restart again. Now try the problem and post the results.<br />

<h2>            Battery draining very fast when idle</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased a Nokia Lumia 730 in Mar-2016, </p>
<p>I have upgraded to Windows 10 build 10.0.10586.218 a month ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I regularly charge the phone with genuine nokia charger that came with the phone, at night i get it on charger and it gets fully charged in couple of hours.
</p>
<p>My usage details:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alarm : 7:30 AM Weekdays</li><li>Battery saver settings - 30 % - allowed only motion data when on battery saver</li><li>Location services always ON</li><li>Mobile Data ON only for 3 hours max.</li><li>FM Radio 30 mins while traveling from home to office</li><li>Approx 4-5 calls of duration not more than 5 mins</li><li>Idea Cellular 3G unlimited internet plan</li><li>display brightness is on Auto or Low</li></ol>
<p>Battery is 100% at 9 AM and drains to less than 20% by 3 PM</p>
<p>Recently observed that the draining frequency is increased, charged fully 100% yesterday night before sleeping disconnected from charger. In the morning the phone was OFF 0% battery. As it was the weekend, there are no alarms, no internet on phone nothing.
 but still it got fully discharged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to upgrade to the latest available build, but it fails too.</p>
<p>Please suggest some sensible solution, please do not copy-paste answers like Reset the phone to 8.1.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you Lynneth,</p>
<p>like I mentioned earlier i am aware about settings that can save battery life.</p>
<p>I am already using the recommend settings with a few exceptions offcourse.</p>
<p>Today we are in times where we have 4G for better internet why would one turn to 2G?</p>
<p>why can't we build operating system and apps that are less battery consuming?</p>
<p>
</p><p>the real issue is that few days earlier battery was lasting more than 12 hours with same current settings. Now it lasts only about 5 hours. Isn't this a drop of 50% battery performance in just 15 days time??</p>

            <p>I suggest look for something that fails to sync, or syncs continuously.<br />
Settings for mail accounts, app updates stuck, a failed OS update, a bad SD memory card, and poorly coded social apps, all affects the power consumption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would backup all, then hard reset the phone (it stays on W10M). Next start it up on a reliable WiFi without adding your Microsoft account or any other accounts. Let it apply any additional system updates if it wants to, and evaluate the power consumption
 in this clean state?<br />
The standby power drain must be less than 2% per hour, preferably around 1% per hour, once it has settled down with nothing installed or configured, for the phone to be useful as a mobile device, in my opinion. - And that's with the factory default settings
 for Bluetooth, mobile data, app background activity etc.</p>

<h2>            Adware&#58;Win32&#47;OpenCandy&#58; False Positive on WinSCP428&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I ran a full scan yesterday using MSE (with the latest definitions), &amp; it alerted me that the file "winscp428setup.exe" was infected with "Adware:Win32/OpenCandy".</p>
<p>This file has been sitting untouched on my HDD since I downloaded it last year, from http://winscp.net/eng/index.php.</p>
<p>It has been scanned with MSE several times previously, &amp; only now does MSE claim it is infected.</p>
<p>I submitted the file to www.VirusTotal.com, and MSE was the only AV out of 43 to claim it was infected.</p>
<p>I have re-downloaded the file from SourceForge ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/winscp/files/WinSCP/4.2.8/ ), and MSE also claims that is infected.</p>
<p>I have downloaded the release notes from SourceForge, &amp; checked the MD5 &amp; SHA-1 hash values against those of the two files I have (the one I have had for months, &amp; the one I downloaded today). Both hashes on both files match those in the release notes.</p>
<p>I believe that this is a false positive. Can someone please confirm, and update the MSE definitions accordingly.</p>

<h2>            Unable to share notebook in OneNote</h2>
                    <p>A user is unable to share a notebook in OneNote. When they go to the "Share" tab to add other users to share the notebook with OneNote tells them "You do not have permission to send invitations or links." The user is trying to share a notebook that is located
 on SharePoint. All other users are able to access this document and share it perfectly fine. I have not seen this issue addressed anywhere else online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any information on this please let me know.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Linda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have found that the user was unable to open the notebook because it was already viewable by everyone on SharePoint. The user moved the notebook to their private SharePoint account and was able to share the notebook with whom they wish via OneNote. Thanks
 for the quick response.</p>

            <p>GTA IV runs just fine on my system. &nbsp;Did you upgrade from Win8(.1) or do a clean install. &nbsp;I had GTA IV installed on Win8.1 and upgraded to WinTP. &nbsp;GTA IV still worked without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck! &nbsp;Have a good one!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh... btw... I wouldn't expect any help from Rockstar about this either now, or when Win10 is released. &nbsp;GTA IV wasn't even meant to work in Win8, so don't expect an update for Win10 anytime soon.</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am french canadian, and my english is far from perfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question, I did a clean instal of Windows 10 TP.on a new partition of my hardrive. &nbsp;My GTA IV and Stories from Liberty City, Steam version, (Gay Tony and The lost) are working perfectly on Windows 8, and then Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But to be able to have it working on Windows 7 or Windows 8, I had to follow the steps here above mentionned, that is to say : (and these steps were crucial to allow my recognition as an authorised member of GFWL, mandatory to have GTA IV working on my PC)</p>
<p>
</p><p>"</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: YOU MUST MUST MUST DO THESE STEPS EXACTLY. DON’T SKIP ON REBOOTING OR ANYTHING. ALSO MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THE FILE I’VE LINKED TO, AND NOT ANY OTHER VERSION OF GFWL.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1\ uninstall both “Microsoft Games for Windows &nbsp;- LIVE Redistributable" AND “Microsoft Games for Windows Marketplace"</span></p>
<p><span>2\ reboot</span></p>
<p><span>3\ download the GFWL installer from&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>6\ After it’s installed, run the GFWL game again. It should now work fine and redownload your profile.</span></p>
<p><span>Steps 4 and 5 are really, REALLY, REALLY important."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>But I am unable to have GFWL working on WIndows 10 TP. </p>
<p>
</p><p>GTA IV &nbsp;will open and play on my computer, but you can't save your progression in the game, so it is impossible to use the game properly, the system asking to be recognise by GFWL before to allow the saving of the progression.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thank you again for your answer.</p>

            <p>So it sounds like it might not be logging into Xbox (Windows) Live. &nbsp;It might be an incompatibility between the GFWL the instructions provide and WinTP, or an indication that Microsoft is separating Windows from the old Live games even more. &nbsp;As I said,
 my installation from Win8.1 is still running fine on WinTP after a upgrade, so I'm not sure how to work around it. &nbsp;Maybe look up some instructions on setting up a liveless installation, so that the saves are saved locally.</p>

            I think I have found the problem, however i do not know how to solve it. When I try logging in to Xbox Live it says I type the wrong password even though I know it is right, therefore I checked GFWL's internet settings and there I noticed that it has no
 internet connection. Again I do not know why or how this happens but I think this might be the problem many of us are having with GTA IV not being able to save your progress. (By the way, I bought the game from Steam if that is in any interest)

            <p>There are no fixes for GFWL and Windows 10 at the moment.&nbsp; I have spoken to Windows and Xbox tech support to no avail.&nbsp; I've never seen a wholesale breakage of compatibility before outside of the main Operating System.&nbsp; I suggest everyone gets on the phone
 with Microsoft and attempt to escalate this issue.&nbsp; Most games that were designed around Microsoft's DRM scheme will not open at all.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp; Mortal Kombat 9, Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection, Fable III.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some games I have been able to open but not
 play, like GTA IV. </p>
<p>
</p><p>These games are still being sold on Steam.&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft respects backwards compatibility and this needs to be addressed right away.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Do you not remember MS-DOS or something? </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's pretty telling when people like EA are packaging DosBox, a <strong><em>completely unofficial
</em></strong>emulator with official digital purchases of older games like SimCity 2000 (though technically it was a feebie as part of the Orgin free games thing but I digress).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did they even get rid of it outright?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Also GFWL is freezing when I try to sign in under similar conditions using the GFWLClient program and the GFWLive exe one wants me to install the login assistant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit2: Well SFxT is working anyway after I use the startup parameter I found to fix the crash right as the game starts up... looks like I don't need any help.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm not sure why you guys are having this problem. I bought GTA IV today from Steam on Windows 10 Home &nbsp;( latest build) and followed this video&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KbAGn4JUaA ( I put Windows 8, not Windows Vista pack 2) now Games for Windows
 Live works like a charm for GTA IV. Whereas before the game would stop responding. You may try this method and see if it works.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Bing is going away</h2>
                    I've used Bing for over a year. This last upgrade to Windows erased all my bookmarks. I did not erase the old Google bookmarks. Therefore, I'm switching back to the Google search engine if Bing doesn't restore my Bookmarks. I'll bet I'm not the only one
 to switch back.

<h2>            Excel - FILE SAVE  , existing files vs new</h2>
                    <p>I noticed that when i create a new file and do FILE SAVE AS, it goes to documents like it should.</p>
<p>The default save location is set to documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHen i do a File Save as with an existing Excel file that i have had for a while, it goes to C:Windows.</p>
<p>Why does it not follow the default save location that i set in Options?</p>

            The "Save" command for the fresh new file follows the default location as already set in Excel Option. But the "Save As" command follows the Existing File's location, where it is.<br />

<p>with the existing file, when you do FILE, SAVE AS, it just goes to wherever you have the existing file currently saved and it assumes you want to keep it there in that location. &nbsp;I guess that is an okay assumption.. unless you want to save that existing

<p>If your "Existing File" (which is already saved in previously with a name.xlsx) is in "C:\Windows", then it will locate the "C:\Windows".</p>

            <p>yes, but you said SAVE command. &nbsp;i used <strong>SAVE AS</strong> for both. Did not use save.</p>
<p>I guess save and save as are the same with a new file.</p>
<p>Anyway, i figured it out so this is solved. Thanks.</p>

<p>If the IE Command Bar is not enabled, right-click the Internet Explorer toolbar and check (enable) Command Bar.
</p>
<p>Then, from Tools (on the Command Bar) click on Toolbars&gt; Disable add-ons&gt; at the bottom ("Tell me when the delay...") increase the time to (maybe) 2 seconds. The add-ons dialog should stop appearing. You can choose a longer time if necessary or you can disable
 the add-ons which have the longest load time.</p>

I found this helpful so thanks --- but I have to wonder why Microsoft keeps making everything harder. Do the developers not use computers? I swear their mission statement has to include "more clicking."

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>Glad the information helped. I don't know why that setting is non-intuitive and difficult to find. It seems like there could have been a "Don't show this again" box to check.</p>

            <p>Why do they make things harder??? good question. imagine if the software geeks that confuse our working/leisure lives had to start their day by sitting in their cars on their way to work, placing the key in the ignition switch and were then faced with a
 barrage of confusing dashboard control&nbsp;puzzles to resolve before they could start the car&nbsp;and get to where they wanted to go. Eventually after much time and trouble they would figure out the answer and off they'd go. A few months later some guy would change
 the puzzle and they would again be stuck in their driveway, 'I figured this out last time , all I want to do is get to work, it was working fine last time, it WASNT broken but they have 'FIXED' it...... why........&nbsp;</p>
<p>get the message software guys.....?????&nbsp;&nbsp; As an Engineer I Know simple, easy to understand works in the real world, please listen and connect with your users....</p>

<p>Google Chrome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft keeps making matters worse, I'll be using nothing but Linux.&nbsp; Seems like every new release just keeps getting worse and worse.&nbsp; OS, IE, Office, Visio...&nbsp; Remember the good old days in Visio if you had an item selected and did a zoom the zoom would

            <p><strong>1.</strong> Type <strong>regedit</strong> in RUN or start menu search box and press Enter. It'll open Registry Editor.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Now go to following key:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Create a new key under <strong>Policies</strong> key and set its name to
<strong>Ext</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Now select the new "<strong>Ext</strong>" key and in right-side pane, create a new DWORD
<strong>DisableAddonLoadTimePerformanceNotifications</strong> and set its value to
<strong>1</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fmedia.askvg.com%2farticles%2fimages3%2fDisable_Speedup_Browsing_Disable_Addons_Popup_IE9_using_regedit.png" /></p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> If you are using <strong>64-bit</strong> edition of Windows, you'll also need to follow the same steps 3 and 4 for the following key:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>6.</strong> That's it. It'll permanently disable add-ons performance advisor's annoying "Speed up browsing by disabling add-ons" popup notification message in IE9.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Issues with applications may happen if they are outdated and other software-related concerns. To better look into this, make sure that the apps on your phone are updated by going to
<strong>Store</strong> &gt; <strong>Menu</strong> &gt; <strong>Download</strong> <strong>
and</strong> <strong>updates</strong>. Make sure that you are connected to a stable network when updating the apps. If the apps are updated and the issue still persists, you can perform a
<strong>soft</strong> <strong>reset</strong> to refresh the phone. This method will not remove any files or data on your device. To do this, press and hold the
<strong>Volume</strong> <strong>down</strong> and <strong>Power</strong> <strong>
button</strong> at the same time until the phone vibrates and restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

<p>Ty for your answear, but i think that you didnt understand the issue and im pretty sure that i know when the system is up-to-date or not, i own 14 Windows 10 machines + 1 windows 10 mobile phone and a xbox one. (some of them OS´s are on Insider program,
 but is not the issue here) The issue is the GAMES Apps on my PHONE that dont work on the latest update. (I´m talking about only the games).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, I´m not going to hard/soft reset my phone for every bugged update that MS release, that makes not sence...</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The concern that you have for the game apps installed on your Lumia 640 XL is probably caused by an issue with the migration of the apps' data to the latest build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try to resolve your concern by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Uninstall the game apps that you are having issues with.</li><li>Soft reset your phone by pressing and holding the <strong>Volume down</strong> +
<strong>Power</strong> buttons for ten to fifteen seconds. Soft resetting is the same as removing the battery. This will not remove anything on your phone and is completely safe.
<br />
</li><li>After your phone restarts, re-install the game apps again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please tell us how it turns out.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I installed the Downgrade tool but it has no support for the Lumina 635 ;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I reload Windows 8? Wipe it? Or is it just a nice paper weight?</p>

<p>If you're using the built-in Save as PDF functionality then hyperlinks for a TOC should automatically be included without the need to add additional options. Do the hyperlinks work in the Word document?</p>
<p>If what you're referring to is the Bookmarks pane in Adobe Reader that provides a TOC of sorts for your document then in the Save/Publish As PDF dialog box, click the Options button and make sure the "Create bookmarks using" option is selected. Then below
 that option, if you are using Heading styles then make sure "Headings" selected. If you created your own using bookmarks then make sure "Word bookmarks" is selected.</p>

<p>you can try to select the contact by tap and hold and select save to Sim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However the best solutions will be to synchronize with outlook on your desktop, This will be your back up. This will copy them all with full information. saving to sim won't copy the address info for example.</p>

<h2>            Unable to select encryption certificate</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem sending encrypted mails with Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>In order to encrypt mail I have to select encryption certificate for my account in Accounts -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Security dialog.</p>
<p>Encryption for digital signature can be selected, but drop down list for encryption certificate is empty.</p>
<p>This leads to error message when I want to send encrypted mail saying that no encryption certificate for this account is selected. When I send mail anyway it can not be decrypted in Sent Items folder.</p>
<p>However, mail is sent encrypted and recipient is able to decrypt it.</p>
<p>The same functionality works correctly in my other mail clients (Mail and Thunderbird).</p>
<p>Certificate from my PKI card is visible in KeyChain Access.</p>
<p>The only problem is that Outlook does not "see" it as encryption certificate.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The formula in the yellow highlighted cell is =SUMIFS(E7:J7,E4:J4,"&lt;B3").&nbsp; However it eavluates to "0", even though the answer should be 2795.&nbsp; What am I doing wrong?&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; E7:J7 = the sum range, 583.33..........100; E4:J4 = the criteria range, 31-Jan-10
 to 31-Mar-10, and B3 is the criteria,&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;10-Aug-10.</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong?&nbsp; Can dates be used with a sumifs formula?</p>

<p>First of all, the critera should be expressed as "&lt;"&amp;B3&nbsp; (not "&lt;B3")</p>
<p>Then, if you really want to sum all siz number you have to have the dates i all siz of the cells E4, F4, G4, H4, I4, and J4.</p>
<p>From your example it looks like they are only in cells E4, G4, and I4 (and then the sum vill be 1750). It does not help to just merge E4 and F4, G4 and H4, and so on.</p>
<p>It seems however a bit odd to sum the Budget with the Actual. To subtract the Actuals&nbsp; from the budget would make more sense, but that just my feeling.</p>
<p>Hope this helps / Lars-Åke</p>

<h2>            History Disabled in Defender Win10</h2>
                    <p>A strange one this. Julia posted two links in <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/feedback/forum/fdbk_commsite-mods/moderation-requests-week-of-january-29-2018/83b7e6ab-c28e-4d38-86ae-8e5e498ae6b2">
&gt;page 12 of Mod Requests.&lt;</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In IE11 both&nbsp;took me to the same page but in Edge they took me to two different screens - details just below Julia's reply above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the "What to do now" link (on the IE screen) to "Windows Defender" and
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17464/windows-defender-help-protect-computer#1TC=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
&gt;got this screen.&lt; </a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I then checked out the "set your own scan" advice there <em>(1.Search for and open Schedule tasks. 2.In the left pane, expand Task Scheduler Library &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows and then scroll down and double-click the Windows Defender folder. 3.In the top-center
 pane, double-click Windows Defender Scheduled Scan. 4.Select the Triggers tab, and then select New. 5.Set your time and frequency, and then select OK.)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>and what I've found is that although my Defender is turned on, my History has been disabled</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e24f413-3316-4d93-ab35-e2109d9b92c3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e24f413-3316-4d93-ab35-e2109d9b92c3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do now please to resolve the History disabled problem?</p>

I think Morange has the best interface in all IM apps and it supports MSN, Yahoo Messenger, Gtalk, ICQ and AOL. I am new Moranger. Found it on

            Do you people understand that some of the mentioned applications are proxy clients?<br />
<br />
In other words, you give somebody your Gmail login/password credentials, and then their server connects to gtalk service, and you connect to their proxy server. Who knows how do they care about such sensitive data?<br />
<br />
<br />
I used a freeware MGtalk J2ME application to connect to GTalk service. It is a working generic Jabber client with Gtalk extensions.

<h2>            &#34;Suspicious Activity Detected. Your Account is Locked&#34; Obvious Scam</h2>
                    <p>When I attempt to access my email, my browser prevents the page from loading with a shield icon warning saying 'This page includes script from unauthenticated sources'. If I tell it to load script, a page comes up telling me that&nbsp;"Suspicious Activity Detected.
 Your Account is Locked." with a prompt for me to input my country. Screen-shot:&nbsp;http://postimg.org/image/izpn3psft/&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I input my country it then asks for my credit card information (hahahaha... no).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is obviously a scam, but I can't access my email through my computer at all (app on phone works fine). I haven't found any information through google searches, and I need to know if this is a problem on my end (and how I can resolve it) or if it's a
 problem on Microsoft's end (in which case, Hi. Please fix Microsoft people!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: I logged onto my account successfully on a different computer. Suspecting it may be a virus, so I'm running a full scan using avast. However, I can't find any information on a specific virus that may have caused this.</p>
<p>Virus scan, and going through recommended procedures, has done nothing.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2007 Configuration in Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> win8 from vista  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2007 Configuration in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased a new computer with Windows 8.1. I prefer to use Outlook 2007 for viewing and organizing my gmail account emails. I have successfully configured Outlook 2007 to send/receive emails on Windows 8.1, but when I open Outlook 2007 I find that
 I am not receiving the newest emails (the newest is several days old now) and Outlook continues to go out to gmail to receive a couple thousand old emails. It appears to be receiving these a few hundred at a time.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Windows Mail, the emails appear to be sending and receiving just fine.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How do I correctly set up Outlook 2007 in Windows 8.1 so that it sends and receives my newest emails consistently?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>If a pop mail account it will download all mail from the server, which may take a while, and if you have an anti-virus program integrated with Outlook this may add to the delay.</p>
<p>Whereas an IMAP account is a copy of what is on the server and may take a while to sync</p>
