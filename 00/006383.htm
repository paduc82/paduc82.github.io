<h2>            Cortana app for phones</h2>
                    I have downloaded the Cortana app for my android Samsung Galaxy S7 edge phone only to find that the Cortana app icon places itself dead centre at the bottom of the phones screen thus stopping me from putting in the numbered pass code to open my phone.
 The icon for Cortana does not allow itself to be moved away to another part of the screen. I therefore recommend that you do not download this app to your mobile phone.

<p>Hi, couple of things may help, Google ' how to increase c memory on N97', bit obvious I know but has helped me, there are more forums than this one. Remove all apps possible from c drive and install on E. Clear browser history regulally,save all messages
 to E (default is C and will eat up memory). Also install Best Taskmanager from ovi store, it's only £1.50 and will close any running operation on phone that is not essential, including some you can't see. When I close all programmes with Best Taskman my ram
 goes to between 39 &amp; 45 ! But the best thing is trawl the internet, there are 1000's of people more knowledgable than me, willing to help !!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p><font>Hi,</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>The main thing consuming the C memory is because of an application in N97 called IAD (Independent Application Delivery). This application automatically searches for any new updates for the pre-installed applications in the handset,
 so this in turn consumes memory. So keep clearing your cache memory &amp; browser history often. If you are using GPRS/EDGE &amp; if it is set to "Always on'. Then it automatically searches for updates. So try reseting the factory settings, as this would delete the
 settings &amp; it wouldn't connect online for searching updates. Also try changing the GPRS availabilty to "When needed" &amp; check.</font></p>

</p><p>The issue might be caused by some rules created on your email account or emails are too old that might be deleted from email server. Take note that you can only retrieve or recover email messages if you are still able to find it on your Deleted Items folder
 or other folders on your Outlook.com. Check this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot see some of your emails, it is possible that a rule in your Outlook.com is the one that caused your emails to disappear. We recommend that you check your list of rules to see if you have a rule that deletes old messages. To access the list
 of rules, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In Outlook.com, click the gear icon.</li><li>Click <strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Mail</strong>, select <strong>Inbox and sweep rules</strong>.</li><li>Check the list for any rules that deletes old messages.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have any rules that erases any kind of messages, it is still best to check the Deleted Items folder to see if your mail items are there. If you cannot see your emails in that folder, click
<strong>Recover deleted items</strong> to verify if you can see them in the mail recovery page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            It wasn't possible to retrieve more than 1 month of messages in any folders, including deleted. However, just as mysteriously as this problem presented itself, it has resolved itself. &nbsp;

    <title>CK-15W start up problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> asmithy  say:</h3>
<h2>            CK-15W start up problems</h2>
                    I have spent some time trolling through the forums in an attempt to reslove a problem with a new installation of a CK-15W car kit. I have found the problem mentioned several times but never a resolution??<br />
<br />
The problem appears to be with a new installation where on power up the display locks up at the Nokia welcome screen, sometimes prompting for a reset via the navi wheel. Is there an answer to this problem or is the unit simply faulty?? thanks to anyone who
 can shed some light on this matter....

            Thanks Confiture<br />
When removing the unit for return I determined the actual cause of the problem which others should know.<br />
<br />
The problem occurs when you turn the cable of the display unit back 90 degrees so the unit can be screwed down on a flat surface. this appears to put stress on the connections in the base of the unit. The unit is designed for this routing of the cable but great
 care needs to be exercised when pushing the cable back so as not to stree the connections inside.<br />
<br />
Unit now works fine with out the hassles of returning it and the arguments that would of occured when the unit tested fine.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps others<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>We have been using outlook.com for a few months now. Our web application www.netparcel.com is designed to allow our customers to ship. When a shipment is created, an email is sent out to the consignee/receiver to let them know about the shipment, pretty
 standard stuff.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Today we had more than usual number of shipments because we got a big order come through. After some time we started seeing this error from the outlook.com SMTP server.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<b>Our daily message limit was meant to stop spammers--we're sorry that it's get's getting in your way. You can wait a day to send your message.</b>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way we can avoid this? The email to the customer is crucial for us to let them know shipment is on its way.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help.</div>

            Upon reading this again, it appears that I was already at my 300-message limit, so why was I instructed to Add a Phone to increase the limit? Just trying to scam my phone number? Instructing me to do something to solve a problem that clearly will not solve
 the problem is the kind of manipulative behavior that makes everyone detest M$FT. Be honest and helpful, please. Do unto others and all that, not he who has the gold makes the rules. :P

My N8 appears to be under Hong Kong firmware as well. How did you go about changing the firmware version to a more relevant region?</blockquote>

    <title>WM6 &#38; responding to requests for email read receipts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dutchy74  say:</h3>
<h2>            WM6 &#38; responding to requests for email read receipts</h2>
                    
<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope someone&nbsp;can give me&nbsp;a solution for the following question/problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When using WM6 in combination with the Exchange direct push functionality to get email pushed to the device, there seems to be no possibility to&nbsp;influence the way you&nbsp;respond to requests for read receipts; whenever the sender of an email requests
 a read receipt, a (positive) response is always sent when you read the&nbsp;email on your WM device. This is standard in WM6 (at least&nbsp;in&nbsp;WM6 'Standard'). I checked with Microsoft in The Netherlands and in the end they pointed me to this forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the fact that I personally don't want people to know whenever I'm reading my (work) mail at night or&nbsp;during the weekend, there is another more serious&nbsp;issue.
</p>
<p>We have been working with a new internet domain and corresponding new email addresses on which I receive many mails from 'new' senders that I read on the device. I occasionally receive spam (like the rest of the world) and sometimes I only recognize
 it being spam after I read the mail on my device. After a while the number of spam mails grew very fast. Someone once pointed me to the fact that&nbsp;most spam senders request read receipts to ensure the email address is 'active'....
</p>
<p>The standard positive responses to requests for read receipts in WM6 are only making things worse, spamwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being able to&nbsp;stop the sending of&nbsp;positive responses from my device would not only be a convenience&nbsp;matter but to me it seems a necessity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, disabling read receipt request is not supported.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just an Idea: When you receive such emails, open them and quickly go to the menu and select Mark as Unread. With some luck, this might prevent the receipt from going out. Let me if this works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully this flaw will be fixed through a patch orin the next version of Windows Mobile.</p>

            Thanks for your feedback. I have escalated to the team in case there is a better solution. Meanwhile, one of the workarounds I employ for potential spam is to not read Exchange Outlook emails from an unknown sender or with a suspicious title from my device.
 I regularly read and respond to co-workers and my known contacts emails to me on my 6.5 device. We'll let you know if there is a better solution. We appreciate your patience.

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Although I do not have these problems, I do have a link to software which is not mentioned here (AFAIK and I did a search)
<span><span><strong>"Jeyo Mobile Extender for Outlook"</strong>
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://handheld.softpedia.com/get/Internet-Utilities/Email/Jeyo-Mobile-Extender-for-Outlook-14355.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://handheld.softpedia.com/get/Internet-Utilities/Email/Jeyo-Mobile-Extender-for-Outlook-14355.shtml</a></p>
<p>If this is not solving the problem it is most likely the registry which needs provisioning! Therefore I'll do some more investigation into this interesting matter, before mentioning anything further on this matter. Please report back if the above software
 works for you. TIA,</p>

<p>I have installed Ovi Maps 3 (upgrading Nokia Maps 2 existing) and i have installed the Italia Maps and voices. At the first opening, the software required a licensing, i have connect the wifi sessions and the software are operating. Now, at 5 day later the
 licensing is out ... Why?? Ovi Maps and Driving is NOT free .... Please help me and, if possible, write in italian!</p>

<p>Hi JackNicklaus,<br />
<br />
Unfortunately your device is not compatible with Maps 3.03 (with free navigation), but only with 3.01 (which you already have installed).<br />
A full list of compatible devices with the 3.03 version can be found here :</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.nokia.com/ovi-services-and-apps/ovi-maps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maps.nokia.com/ovi-services-and-apps/ovi-maps</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What this means is that you would need to purchase a license to be able to Navigate with turn by turn instructions or to use the Premium services.</p>
<p>You can see the pricing structure within the Shop on the device (go to <strong>
Options &gt; Shop &amp; Licenses</strong>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this clarifies things for you.</p>

                    I have to create a detailed Client List for our business.&nbsp; The format is to be columns, with each cell containing&nbsp;a line for the&nbsp;client name, address, phone #'s, &amp; addtl info needed (pet names, children names, nanny names etc.)&nbsp; Since the client names
 are listed alphabetically, the 2nd name will be under the first cell and so on.&nbsp; I don't know enough about Excel to make this happen, even trying to format cells to allow all this info in one cell has not worked for me, including merging the cells.&nbsp; Any help
 would be great!!!

            <p>My suggestion:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- In Excel, use a flat table with a column for each of these bits:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Client Name,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Address,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Cell
 Phone,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Work Phone,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Home Phone,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Children,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Housekeeper,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Dog
 Name</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Then fire up Word and create a Mail Merge with the Avery label you find is a good fit. Point the merge document to the Excel workbook as the data source and plug the column names into the labels.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Your husband can then open the Word document and refresh the data. The Word document is basically a dynamic report that will change according to the entries in the Excel workbook.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Add new data to the Excel workbook and sort it as desired. Then open the prepared Word document and all clients will show up in the labels.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Are you able to sync other items? Note that synchronization of sub-calendars is not supported.

<p>Make sure update Java and your Windows.</p>
<p>Are you facing this problem with other browsers?</p>
<p>It is good idea to contact the device manufacturer and check this issue with them too.</p>
<p>It seems to be a bug in their system.</p>

            <p>Microsoft makes the operating system that the <strong>Alcatel product</strong> uses.</p>
<p>Alcatel is ultimately responsible for testing and approving OS updates - which may also have to be approved by Mobile Providers if they are branding the phones firmware. At that point it is no longer an Alcatel product, but a provider product. Alcatel also
 has to work with Microsoft to provide recovery images for their phones before insider preview builds can be given to users - otherwise users would not be able to reset their phones back to a production build of the software.<br />

<h3> orthoducks  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to determine linked&#47;inserted status of an image in a Word document&#63;</h2>
                    Is there a simple way to tell whether an image in a Word document is linked or/and inserted, and if it's linked, what the link is?<br />
<br />
The Info page's "Edit Links to Files" gives information about the linked images, but it's very difficult to use for this purpose. There's no apparent way to identify the image(s) that a given link represents, except to look up the image at the link target,
 then look for a matching image in the file.

<p>First, I mentioned linked images only for completeness. My own need is just to distinguish between inserted images and linked-and-inserted images. I think some of the answers apply only to linked images. Those answers are within the parameters of the question
 I asked, and they may well be useful to others, but they won't actually help solve my problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using the method I described, the INCLUDEPICTURE field will contain a \d switch if the image is&nbsp;only linked; there will be no \d&nbsp;switch if it is inserted and linked. There will be no INCLUDEPICTURE field for an embedded image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a given image, you could also test its status with a macro. For example:</p>

 says "organization polices prevent you from changing this primary alias". This means I will never be able to migrate from Hotmail to Outlook account. I want to resolve this and use my alias in outlook.com as my primary alias.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As I want to do a migration to Outlook, I do not need to change back to hotmail.com.hk again after the migration. So I just need a one time change of my primary alias from hotmail.com.hk to the outlook.com alias created there already.</p>

    <title>Office 365 repeated error&#58; Outlook cannot log on. Verify you are - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonathanmccoid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 repeated error&#58; Outlook cannot log on.  Verify you are connected to the network...</h2>
                    <p>I run a small business with 5 employees and we all use Office 365 for our exchange email. &nbsp;I have a local server with some proprietary software (sql server) that is our domain controller. &nbsp;We all log in to the domain when we're in the office to run the software
 clients locally. &nbsp;We use laptops and the server also allows us to work remotely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, when we take the laptops out of the office and connect to another network, every once in a while one of my employees comes back with a broken Outlook profile. &nbsp;9 out of 10 times they work fine... take the computer home, they can connect
 to their home network, use Outlook, return to the office and all is good. &nbsp;But every once in a while they either go home or return to the office and Outlook won't start because of this "Outlook cannot log on. &nbsp;Verify you are connected to the network..." error.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shouldn't have to drill through the registry and delete Outlook profiles every time. &nbsp;It's a nuisance having to re-set up Outlook every time this happens. &nbsp;I have not figured out why switching networks breaks Outlook. &nbsp;Would love some help trying to diagnose
 the root cause of this repeated issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, I am not an IT professional. &nbsp;I set everything up myself, so if there is something that could be setup incorrectly on the server side I would be happy to drill into that. &nbsp;So far it all seems to be in working order... the only "critical" server error
 I have is that it says my remote desktop service is not set up correctly (which seems to be a common error in which I just delete the "GracePeriod" registry key and it resets the counter).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need to eliminate this Outlook profile problem though. &nbsp;It is a pain for everyone involved. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Jonathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are an administrator or have access to modify tenant’s DNS, follow instruction provided by Support and Recovery Assistance to removed references to Webmail service with IMAP and SMTP in DNS with only necessary records to allow users to connect to
 new Office 365 mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only CNAME record for autodiscover.&lt;domain&gt;.&lt;suffix&gt; to autodiscover.outlook.com is required to connect user to Office 365 mailbox in most deployments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SRV record, in combination with a CNAME record, prevents Outlook from starting or loading the user’s profile.
</p>
<p>1. Go to your domain hosting GoDaddy. </p>
<p>2. Remove SRV record “_autodiscover._tcp.office365.net”. If you recently modified the DNS records, you need to wait up to 72 hours for the DNS records to fully replicate on the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional Information for your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-DNS-records-for-Office-365-when-you-manage-your-DNS-records-B0F3FDCA-8A80-4E8E-9EF3-61E8A2A9AB23?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create DNS records for Office-365 when you manage your DNS records</a></p>

<p>I understand that you can't access Outlook on your mobile device. What we need to confirm is if you're using the Outlook App or using your mobile browser. Also, can you please clarify what happen when you try accessing Outlook? Does it freeze? Did you receive
 an error message (please specify)? <br />
<br />
We need these details for investigation and it will help us to have a concrete solution to fix your problem. Let me know if you have other clarifications.</p>

<h2>            EXCEL Find&#47;Replace  LookIn&#58;  VALUE only  Not function in cell</h2>
                    <p>I have a formula in C3 that works great leaving me with TEXT that I can search on.</p>
<p>=IF(IF(B3="0"****"")</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could be hundreds of the word PRINT in my sheet based upon this formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I Find/Replace the word PRINT with SENT -- <strong><em>it changes the cell formula also</em></strong>, so TODAY(),<strong>"PRINT"</strong>,"") changes to TODAY(),<strong>"SENT"</strong>,"") in all cells.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I Find/Replace without effecting the formula ? -- I do not mind if it replaces the formula with the word SENT</p>
<p>

            Okay, let's see how your code works. The important part is this:
<br />
<br /><pre><code>For i = 1 To N
      If Cells(i, "C").Value = "PRINT" Then
            Cells(i, "C").Value = "=(""SENT "" &amp; TEXT(TODAY(),""m/d/yy""))"</code></pre>
<br />
<br />This code reads every cell in column C and compares if the cells contains "PRINT". If so the code writes a formula into the cell.
<br />
<br />So far, so good, but I see several issues:
<br />
<br />a) The code runs a long time, because of the access of every cell.
<br />b) The formula contains TODAY(), means today you see the correct date. But if you open the file tomorrow, the formula is calculated again and it contains the date of tomorrow! That is obvious wrong.
<br />c) TODAY is a volatile function, means it is recalculated every time Excel performs a calculation.
<br />d) The code did not find "print" or other spellings.
<br />
<br />So what's the way out of this?
<br />
<br />a) If you want to search for "PRINT" then perform a search! In VBA your can use Range.Find (Write that in the VBA editor, press F1 and read the article for the details how it works).
<br />
<br />Range.Find is much faster, because you call a "internal" function in Excel that does the work for you.
<br />
<br />b) Do not write formulas, perform the calculation in VBA and write the value. If you do so, the date is fixed and always stays the same.
<br />
<br />c) and d) we can forget this issues.
<br />
<br />For practice purposes try to solve this problem with Range.Find then it would be easier for your to understand how my Function FindAll below works.
<br />
<br />Store the function in a safe place (for example, in your PERSONAL.XLSB) I bet you'll need it often in the future. :-)
<br />
<br />Andreas.

            <p>To properly install, first you must completely remove Office 2011. Please follow these instructions:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768</u></a></p>
<p><u><br />
</u></p>
<p>If you have not done so since your last update of Mac OS X, run Disk Utility to verify the startup volume and repair disc permissions.<u><br />
</u></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After reinstalling Office 2011 you may have duplicate fonts. Run Font Book application (or your favorite font management utility). Validate your fonts. Keep the newest edition of duplicate fonts. Trash old editions of duplicate fonts and any other questionable
 fonts. Restart your Mac and then empty the trash to get rid of those bad fonts.</p>
