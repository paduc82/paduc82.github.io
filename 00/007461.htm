<h2>            Connect Outlook 2013 to Office365 group&#47;team calendar &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Our organization uses Office365. &nbsp;I just got added to an internal team/group in Office365, and we have a shared calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I view that calendar in my Outlook 2013 on my desktop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The web address for our Office365 group &nbsp;is</p>
<p>https://outlook.office.com/owa/?path=/group/<em>&lt;groupemailaddress&gt;</em>/...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried every imaginable way to add it : &nbsp;"from address book", "from internet", "open shared calendar" - and I cannot figure out how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: &nbsp;this is an Office 2013 question, not an Office365 question, because I'm trying to perform this action in Outlook 2013.</p>

    <title>Why exactly is the Realtek driver still in Windows Update&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angel del norte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why exactly is the Realtek driver still in Windows Update&#63;</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I cannot get anywhere with this build simply because of one driver update; along with many other people I've found that the kb.stonegroup.etc "workaround" simply doesn't work, however many times people post the link; not so much
 a workaround as a<span>&nbsp; </span>jerkaround. There's more going on here than a simple timeout issue, and it's happening on two machines. Until it's removed, or hiding updates is re-enabled, I've had it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that clean installing from the slow ring ISO might stabilise things -- this time I sidestepped the Express settings specifically to ask that device drivers be NOT installed from WU (the setting has no effect when set inside the OS, while it's still
 running…). For a day or so this seemed to work, the default MS drivers were fine for what I need. I got about two hours usage out of W10 this morning, but then it started playing up, and on reboot I found that WU had awoken and turned up these drivers, like
 a cat with a dead mouse. Actually, it's on the second machine that the mouse dies, but that's another issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things went from bad to worse; the bluescreens pointing at RTKVHD.sys becoming more and more frequent. I couldn't run DISM because it kept crashing a few minutes in, and the sfc scan couldn't fix it; I tried to refresh the thing from the install disk, which
 started off okay, but during the second phase that also bluescreened, and on reboot went into a crash/ reboot loop. I had to use a USB recovery drive to get back to the main partition.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which is where I'm staying for now; I signed up for the Insider thing to actually
<em>use</em> the burgeoning system, and give feedback, not to spend hours and hours just trying to get it to work. Had enough of that in my Linux days…
</p>
<p>
</p><p>From these forums I see that the issue is about six weeks old, and still no solution has emerged, nor any reliable workaround. It's an insane situation where an entire OS is nullified by one lousy driver simply because installation is mandatory. So it looks
 like I'll have to hand in my Insider badge and gun for the present, and temporarily become an Outsider again; perhaps the next build (it's always the
<em>next</em> build) will be a step forward without the ten steps back. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I'll keep the gun. </p>

            <p>I've got the same problem, but in my case is with the display driver for my R9 290X. I ended up disabling Windows Update service whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if this driver works for you (although it would be a good idea to start fresh and install the driver in order to be sure you don't get the conflicting one in the first place).<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the kind thought, squire; I've already tried a downloaded driver on both machines (but I'll check the version numbers just in case). In both cases, it rapidly got to 90% and then got stuck. I think I'll have to leave the ball in MS's court for
 the now, though. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Update! </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Make that two drivers; there's a Synaptics touchpad&nbsp;dingus which disables the keyboard. I saw that happening the other day, but couldn't get in long enough to find out why.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It's too early to say, but I may have found another workaround. I'll know more in a few days, but here's the current sitch, for anyone in a similar position.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Poking around in the Group Policy Editor gpedit.msc, I found some more settings near the timeout one, located in:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/System/Device Installation/Device Installation Restrictions</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two settings in question are </p>
<p>
</p><p>Prevent installation of devices using drivers that match these device setup classes<br />
Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it's the top one that works (so far). Anyhew, to enable these we need the Class GUID and (maybe)&nbsp;the Compatible IDs from the Details tab of the device&nbsp;Properties (invoked from Device Manager). Just right-click to copy, and paste them into the edit
 box for the settings -- it's fairly straightforward when you see it. </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fdf2750-007e-4a50-8778-74badf29b545" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>That value is the feller you want, then open up this: </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34945779-89ab-4a9e-888f-2653e8a617c3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking the "Show" gets you </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f3f4be1c-824e-47e1-b9b8-283fa11853fc" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>These two GUIDs refer to the sound device and the touchpad (I think it shows up as a PS/2 mouse, for some reason). It may, as I say, not be necessary to alter the other setting. Leave the "Also apply to matching devices... " box unchecked, as that fouls
 up the existing installations. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, after the just-in-case reboot, Windows Update installed the <em>system</em> updates as it should, with nary a mention of scary driver updates. Time will tell whether it all goes tesseract-shaped again; all I want to do is get the system set up enough
 to image it, so I don't have to start from scratch all the time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>@Jackalito: it might be worth trying for your display driver -- as long as you've&nbsp;backed the system up first :-)

<p>
</p><p>Good Luck with that :-) </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just tried it on the other machine, but on instigating an update, the same old same old *&amp;%$£* thing reared its incredibly ugly head again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But! After thrashing the CPU at 100% for a mere ten minutes, it bombed out with error code 0x800F0248. So I went a-hunting for this beastie, and found the error&nbsp;buried in a mile-long table of codes:
</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>0x800F0248<br />
SPAPI_E_DEVICE_INSTALL_BLOCKED</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The installation of this device is forbidden by system policy. Contact your system administrator.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>
</p><p>Exactly what I wanted (well, sort of). I also had the CompatibleIDs thing blocked as well as the ClassID -- same procedure as above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm hoping that even though the unwelcome critter keeps trying to get in, we might at least be able to block it from mortally wounding our systems. And a moral I'm taking away is Don't Deliberately Go Looking For Updates. That's just asking for trouble
 ;-) </p>
<p>
</p><p>But see how you get on, anyway. I'm all ears, which is more than Microsoft seem to be on this issue, darn it
<em>&lt;walks away muttering and kicking things&gt;</em>. </p>

            <p>Hi, Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems I don't have the first setting you spotted in the Group Policy (quoting from your previous post):</p>
<p>"Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/System/Device Installation/Device Installation Restrictions</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two settings in question are </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Prevent installation of devices using drivers that match these device setup classes</strong><br />
Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look at this screenshot I've just taken:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/009e18c0-b2b8-4b25-b276-9119f603bf34" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clues about why I may be missing "Prevent installation of devices using drivers that match these device setup classes"? I have Windows Update service disabled. Do you think it may be related?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Luis.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Yes, indeed that was it. After enabling and starting Windows Update service again, I got the rest of the settings, including the one you think may be the right one. I've followed your steps, including the "just in case reboot" (old
 habits are die hard, I guess :P).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I ran Windows Update, for a moment there it seemed like it was indeed downloading and installing the dreadful AMD WDDM 2.0 driver, because it even asked me to reboot the machine once it finished (which I did), but after rebooting and having a look at
 the device manager no new driver for my graphics card had been installed :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, as a matter of fact, I now get this beautiful message every time I try to update the driver through the Device Manager:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b374c7bf-a9e3-4ffc-899a-e144e991307f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So far, so good!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Thanks a lot, Rob!!!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Mother of God, what we have to do just because Microsoft seem to ignore what a big deal is something as elementary as letting the user choose which updates to install on their machines.</p>

<p>Hiya sport. I don't have gpedit to hand (in bed with a tablet, no keyboard either), but the folder you have there is the wrong one: "Device Redirection". I think it's the one above it which is Device Installation.

            Three of my test units (the slowest ones) have that Realtek audio system, so were getting the driver pushed at them. For two of them, I had to increase the timeout setting well beyond the 1800 seconds mentioned on the website, and they all finally finished
 installing the driver. I haven't seen it in updates since then. &nbsp;

</p><p>Great stuff -- I didn't think that disabling the service would have caused a bunch of settings to just vanish, so that's something else I've learned, cheers.

            Hi Godwin
<br />
<br />Open Internet Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to your preferred Home Page
<br />
<br />Then click the gear icon at the top right of Internet Explorer and choose 'Internet Options'
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Use Current' then click Apply and OK
<br />
<br />That should reset your Home Page, restart Internet Explorer to check if that is the case . . .

            Hi Godwin
<br />
<br />You have nothing to worry about that was just a Home Page redirect, it is very common and not sophisticated, your system will be fine . . 
<br />
<br />If you do want to uninstall and re-install Internet Explorer:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Apps - Manage Optional Features
<br />
<br />From there you can remove Internet Explorer
<br />
<br />Then restart your PC, go back in and choose 'Add a Feature to add back Internet Explorer . . .

<p>No, Forefront could manage its own product that is Forefront Endpoint Protection or Forefront client security. Forefront is Enterprise products and its scope is to mange large enviroment and manage many PCs easily .</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Essentials is customer products and it design to target normal users when they want protect their own PC and there is no managibility concept there.</p>
<p>You need to have forefront to manage them using Forefront management suite.</p>

<h2>            Right click-menu &#58; last clicked option stays on screen </h2>
                    
<p>This happened recently and it's weird. It always happens under IE9, but problem stays even when IE9 is closed completely</p>
<p>If you right click, sometime leaves off the last clicked contextual menu entry.</p>
<p>Note: Example here . Google maps right clicked on 3d mode on. It's not about google maps per se, but even if you paste the address on the bar , you get "Paste" on the upper screen.</p>

<p>Could be a third party program causing this.</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Put the computer in&nbsp;Safe mode with Networking&nbsp;and see if the issue
 persists:</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Clean boot</span></span></p>

            Hi Michael,
<br />At the bottom it says Tip: Merge to E-Mail is unavailable if you have not selected your default email program.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-mail-merge-to-create-a-form-email-message-in-word-for-mac-cbd0ecfa-e5b7-4455-bb1a-ab9d10540d30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-ma...</a>
<br />I can't test as I do not have a Mac in saying that good old you tube may give you a hint as to what is meant by default email. 
<br />Check to see if outlook is set as your default email.
<br />To do this, follow these steps:
<br />Run the Mail application.
<br />On the Mail menu, click Preferences.
<br />Click the General tab.
<br />For Default email reader, select Microsoft Outlook.

    <title>Return To Old Outlook Mail Format&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shopper1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Return To Old Outlook Mail Format&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello.<br />
</p>
<p>I just signed into my Outlook Mail account (@hotmail.com) and noticed that the layout now has a 'Favorites' section and a 'Folders' section on the left and the 'Inbox' beside it and 'Older Messages' below the 'Inbox.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to be able to select a 'Junk' email in my 'Inbox' and move it to the 'Junk' folder ('without' opening it, which I preferred since I do not open unknown email). With this new set-up, clicking a 'Junk' message in my 'Inbox' opens it in the right panel,
 which I do not want because I do not open unknown email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, there is a 'select all' box at the top of the 'Junk' folder so they can be deleted without being viewed-There should be an option to select 'Junk' messages in the 'Inbox' folder to move them to the 'Junk' folder, without having to open them
 first. already in the 'Junk' folder do</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I change Outlook Mail back to the default layout? Users should have the option to keep the original layout 'or' switch to this new layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>hi craig,</p>
<p>i would like to confirm more details for further troubleshooting.<br />
1. could you show us the error message in screenshots? to upload screenshots, you can click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> at the bottom and then click the icon of <strong>
insert media</strong>.<br />
2. try to remove all the credentials under <strong>web credentials</strong> and <strong>
windows credentials</strong> by going to <strong>control panel</strong>\<strong>user accounts</strong>\<strong>credential manager</strong> to see the outcome.<br />
3. as you mentioned microsoft account, i’d like to know whether the onedrive or onedrive for business has the problem.
<br />
a) if you can log in <a href="https://login.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.live.com/</a> &nbsp;with the account, then you can sign in personal onedrive app with this account. for this issue, we recommend you post on
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/forum/odsignin?tab=threads">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/forum/odsignin?tab=threads</a> &nbsp;forum for advanced help.<br />
b) if you can sign in <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.microsoftonline.com/</a> &nbsp;with the account, then you can sign in onedrive for business with this account. if this is the case, could you try to log in
<a href="https://echohu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/echo_echohu_onmicrosoft_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
onedrive for business</a> from browser and click the <strong>sync</strong> button as below to trigger the sync from online to local app to see if it helps?</p>

<h2>            IMAP problems</h2>
                    Im trying to get all my e-mails into one place. And ofc. the mail.live.com in the only one that is giving me problems.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I know the log is in Polish but you can get the essentials from the commands. So I ask. What is happening? Why can't I use my mail properly?<br />

            Hello MateuszHoppe 
<br />
<br />My name is Parmi, I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting your question. I'll be happy to help. 
<br />
<br />As per the IMAP settings, it look correct, I do see this
<br />
<br />"generated by AVG Antivirus for SSL/TLS scanning", "AVG Web/Mail Shield", "AVG Web/Mail Shield Root"
<br />
<br />Do you have this anti-virus installed which is scanning your mails? can you exclude that scanning for sometime and reboot your machine and check if, mails are working fine.? 
<br />

<h2>            WASTAGE OF MONEY</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to urge everyone not to waste their money on this useless product. I wonder why would a reputed company like microsoft even launch such a product . My band just doesn't charge completely even after 5-6 hours of continuous charging. &nbsp;It hangs
 like crazy after every while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel cheated as a customer and think I have wasted my money buying this useless product. I would never recommend anyone to buy it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have started to have a disbelief in microsoft as a brand now.</p>

<h2>            Unable to create Table of Figures</h2>
                    <p>A problem I haven't previously encountered:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm unable to insert a Table of Figures in a document I'm presently editing. Each time I try, I get the error message "No table of figures entries found."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure captions in the document are all in Caption style, wrapping for all images is set to "In line with text" and there are no text boxes anywhere in the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be specific to this one particular document. In other documents I have no such difficulty.</p>

            Try this array formula:<br />
<br />
=SUM(MID(A1:C1,1,1)+MID(A1:C1,5,1))<br />
<br />
Enter with Ctrl+Shift+Enter, not just Enter. Excel will put curly braces { } around your formula.<br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/introducing-array-formulas-in-excel-HA001087290.aspx<br />
<br />
To add the numbers of the other player, replace 1 and 5 by 3 and 7, like so:<br />
<br />
=SUM(MID(A1:C1,3,1)+MID(A1:C1,7,1))<br />

<p>Like the fact that I can see the new build updates appear on my pc by using windows hide/show troubleshooter. It will normally show Windows Defender update also. Have found doing Windows Defender update from Windows Defender setting rather than Windows Update
 setting makes for better download experience. I let this update start on its own (usually I will click Windows Update setting to start). This update started pretty quickly after I found that it was there. It seems like ease of getting new build updates has
 made my pc part of first up pc's for upgrade. Having a decent download speed helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Follow up edit:</p>
<p>I almost blew my download because it showed 93% download and stayed at that % for about 14 min but luckily I did not re-start my computer but just closed settings page and then re-opened it. The install of download began shortly</p>

<p>I got that too. Both last night upgrading one from 15063 to 16188 and just now trying to go from 16188 to 16193. Last night, all I did was hit Retry, so I am doing that again. It seems to be working, as it went right to

<p>Hi Frederick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell us if you were able to back up and turn ON sync on the phone prior to this scenario? By the way, are you trying to initially update the phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Ian</p>
<p>With reference to your first question yes I could.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem occured after switching my phone on I was not updating</p>
<p>At first I thought it had updated but then realised I had lost contact information, profiles,ringtones for my contacts etc.</p>
<p>I have managed to recover most of my details but not all, some of my photos are still missing.</p>
<p>
