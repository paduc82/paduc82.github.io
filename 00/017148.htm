<h2>            FORMULA QUESTION - How to count or sum cell by color and multiple arrays&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am working on a spreadsheet that captures workflow and budgets for construction projects. &nbsp;I am having difficulty writing a formula to capture specific budget totals by month based on project scope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Column B - List projects by month and are color coded based on project phase (PRECONSTRUCTION, CONSTRUCTION, CLOSEOUT). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Column A - List the projects total construction budget.</p>
<p>Column C - I am attempting to total the PRECONSTRUCTION Budget totals for that current month based on what is color coded in Column B.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I do a =SumCellsByColor? &nbsp;=CountCellsByColor? &nbsp;I am missing a piece and I cannot seem to capture the value that I need.</p>

            <p>To give you a straight (and perhaps unpleasant) answer - Excel does not have any Color based formula - I mean - Excel does not have any excel function which can be used in a formula to take action/decision based on color of a cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there is a workaround, in case if you are applying color to cells based on some conditions, then you can certainly develop formulas using those same conditions to take further action (as if you are taking action based on the color of a particular
 cell).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, Excel Macros do have the facility of achieving what you want. There are functions/commands in excel VBA which can be used to take any necessary action based on color of a cell.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But for this you will have to write excel macro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are the cells of your spreadsheet given their colors using any conditional formatting ?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick response. &nbsp;I was afraid it was more complicated than I wanted it to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question, no. &nbsp;The color formatting is done manually as project schedule adjusts on the fly. &nbsp;I was hoping to avoid doing a macros. &nbsp;However, a co-worker found a VBE UDF online that might do the trick. &nbsp;Thank you for your direction.</p>

<h2>            Bing on my WP7 won&#39;t return images during searches</h2>
                    1. Samsung Focus Flash<br />
2. SGH-i677<br />
2. Straight Talk Wireless<br />
3. WP 7.5 <br />
4. Zune 4.8.2345.0<br />
5. Computer OS Windows 7<br />
<br />
For reasons I can't figure out my WP7 has stopped returning images on the bing search when I use the search button. Images used to appear on the Images tab with every search I did, but recently all I get is the "No results for..." whatever I am searching for.
 Images that used to appear like cats, dogs, birds, planes, etc. have inexplicably stopped being displayed.
<br />
<br />
It used to work. Now it does not. Anyone else have this problem? Solution?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<h2>            Cannot install hotmail connector upgrade &#124; Outlook 2010 64-bit &#124; Win-7</h2>
                    I have been to the website addressing the missing olc.msi problem at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2561414.&nbsp; I tried a repair installation of Hotmail Connector and even of Office 2010. Both failed. Plus, the version of Hotmail Connector provided at the
 heretofore mentioned website is outdated - Windows Installer will not install it because the version I have on my computer is more recent. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I uninstalled Hotmail Connector in hopes of being able to download the upgrade but Windows seems to think Hotmail Connector is still installed.&nbsp; I downloaded Revo Uninstaller Pro to make sure it had been completely uninstalled.&nbsp; Revo Uninstaller was unable
 to detect it. Yet I cannot re-install Hotmail Connector because it supposedly is still installed and olc.msi is still "on a network that is unavailable". &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I also am having problems doing a repair installation of Office 2010 - it gets about 2/3 of the way done and then aborts.
<br />
<br />
I&nbsp; have tried the Fixit that is supposed to cure problems with installing and updating but it has not cured the problem.
<br />
<br />
I had a similar problem installing the last required Hotmail Connector upgrade but the solution that worked for me then is not working for me now. At that time, I used Revo Uninstaller to completely uninstall Hotmail Connector.&nbsp; Win 7.<br />

            <p>This did not work: connector could not be uninstalled, Office 2010 could not be repaired despite correct product key. Installation would get about&nbsp;2/3 done and then abort for no apparent reason.&nbsp; Fixit did not work.
</p>
<p>I ended up calling Microsoft Support and a tech assistant had to go through laborious and tedious process of manually uninstalling Office 2010 and Connector, then re-install both. Now all is working fine.</p>

    <title>Problems Sync Lotus Notes 7 Calendar to E61 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> quika---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems Sync Lotus Notes 7 Calendar to E61</h2>
                    I am having numerous problems getting PC Suite to Synchronize with my Lotus Notes calendar. I am running Windows XP professional SP 2. PC Suite 6.85.12 and Lotus Notes 7 connected via Bluetooth and USB. I have tried reinstalling the Phone Software and
 PC Suite on the phone. Currently getting a message "PC Suite has encountered a problem and has terminated the synchronization" and "The Synchronization was aborted by the user" When I look at the PC Suite log on the E61 it shows Status canceled.<br />
<br />
I see lots of posts related to synchronization issues so it is clear that while PC Suite has improved it has a long way to go. Lotus Notes is a given in our company so I can't change that. If I can't get this working pretty soon I will probably just give up
 and get the Blackberry 8820 although I would prefer to stay with Nokia because I have had good luck with them but maybe Nokia is just a consumer phone company.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas or even suggestions on how to diagnose this. I am convinced it is between the phone, probably the calendar and PC Suite since it does access and read my Notes Calendar entries.<br />
<br />

            If you disable the calendar synch it seems to at least synchronise your contacts. That's my get-by till I reluctantly trade in my Nokia for another model (just got an E61i hoping it would be better but it is not, so it is going back and I'll have to get
 a Blackberry)

<h2>            MS Excel 2010 Q.&#58; Hyperlink to a cell in another worksheet by specific text &#40;not cell number&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to create a hyperlink in Excel 2010 to a specific cell in a different worksheet (same Excel file).</p>
<p>The catch: the hyperlink has to be by text, not cell number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i.e.: by clicking on the hyperlink cell, it will take me to the a cell that contains the text "Hello" in worksheet named "World".</p>
<p>I tried looking for the solution but came across only to reference by cell number (i.e.: A11), not a specific text.</p>
<p>Is there a solution to the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>thanks in advance,</p>

<p>I think I must have clicked on something while browsing some porn the other night. Now I keep getting emails from an account called Adult Dating. It's really annoying because any attempts to block it do not work. There are instructions on how to unsubscribe
 at the bottom of the email but I genuinely think these are merely for show. I've tried unsubscribing twice already but I still receive the emails. The most frustrating part (and likely why unsubscribing does not work) is that each email sent from Adult Dating
 is sent from a new email address. I've tried using the blocking function on Outlook but this also does nothing. I suppose I could just keep deleting the emails, and thankfully they only show up in my junk folder, but it's really annoying and malicious on the
 part of the sender.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's very iffy. Sometimes it's over-sensitive, other times it doesn't work at all, and if you're lucky it works quite well. I don't use it that often though as when playing music it becomes so slow to respond when browsing through music.</p>

<p>So it's a genuine issue.</p>
<p>I wonder if an update would be issued by Nokia.</p>
<p>Because the phone itself is a fanastic piece.</p>
<p>But i found that if I slide the finger on the rim of the scroll key it works quite well actually.</p>
<p>But that's an unusual way of using it.</p>

<p>I wonder if any further improvement may be forthcoming because basically this feature doesn't work.</p>

<p>Well i've had the same problems with my nokia n85 the navi wheel wasn't working. I opened my phone to check the where is the problem and there was a problem with a cable that connects to the chip.I needed to order a new one. Well nokia tries to make the
 phone as cheap as posible and all the wires a like papper. The only thing that you can do is order new vires from ebay or anny other website or just bring your phone to repair. I paid 20 Eur for the new one and it works now. Ofcourse be carefull if you'll
 do that your self. Look over the internet how to disasseamble your phone.<a href="http://www.google.ie/imgres?imgurl=http" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.google.ie/imgres?imgurl=http</a>://chinagoodstore.com/bookpic/n85-2.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=<a href="http://chinagoodstore.com/pshow.asp%3Fpid%3D2217&amp;usg=__udIBbSkoQBysPlO6ov7pND9-pfs=&amp;h=583&amp;w=777&amp;sz=56&amp;hl=en&amp;start=0&amp;zoom=1&amp;tbnid=xhWLZEZo3RHXCM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://chinagoodstore.com/pshow.asp%3Fpid%3D2217&amp;usg=__udIBbSkoQBysPlO6ov7pND9-pfs=&amp;h=583&amp;w=777&amp;sz=56&amp;hl=en&amp;start=0&amp;zoom=1&amp;tbnid=xhWLZEZo3RHXCM</a>:&amp;tbnh=134&amp;tbnw=181&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3DItem%2Bimage%2BOEM%2BNEW%2BKEYBOARD%2BPCB%2BFLEX%2BCABL%2BFOR%2BNOKIA%2BN85%2BN%2B85%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26sa%3DN%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26channel%3Ds%26biw%3D1280%26bih%3D607%26tbs%3Disch:1&amp;um=1&amp;itbs=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=826&amp;vpy=115&amp;dur=649&amp;hovh=194

            The Navi Wheel on my N81 stopped working only after few days after first use... At that time I noticed even new/demo phones in Nokia shop had same problem, they told me to bring the phone to Nokia Care for repair... In those days I didn't have time for
 repair, I'm still using it and I'm happy with it, the thing is the Navi Wheel is not very important, there are not many apps which work with it, so there is nothing to be worry about.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I suggest everyone to take their phones to Nokia Care if they have time, they are for sure the safest solution for these problems, never try to open the phone by yourself!

            You should be able to select any portion of text in the footer and change the color of it. The fact that you're using a template shouldn't matter. What happens when you select text in the footer and then choose&nbsp;the Font color drop down arrow. Is it active?

<h2>            Outlook 2016 - How to change proofing language when replying to an email</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>I have three proofing languages setup: English (United States), French (France) and German (Germany).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I create a new message, I have the possibility to choose the proofing language of my email via the Ribbon</p>
<p>Review &gt; Language &gt; Set proofing language...</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I reply to a message, <strong><em>as I do not wish to open it in a new window</em></strong>, I do not have access to this functionality.</p>
<p>Neither the ribbon Message, nor a right click provide the option to change the proofing language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading through online forums with what sounded like similar issues I found that I should tick</p>
<p>File &gt; Option &gt; Mail &gt; Ignore original message text in reply or forward</p>
<p>It is already ticked and does what it should ie ignore the rest of the emails, but not what I am typing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone please let me know how to fix this? There must be a setting that I didn't apply...</p>
<p>Surely, using multi languages is common enough that this functionality exists...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply want the ability to set the proofing language to emails replies&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi J_T_O,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to replicate your concern on my end, I've found out that it's by design that the option set the proofing language isn't available when replying to an email unless you opted to pop out a new window. I highly suggest that you post your concern in
 our <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook User Voice</a>. I believe that your idea is a great one, which would help many of our consumers as well. Our developers will gather sufficient information regarding this and might consider adding this feature on our future updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't hesitate to post should you have any other concern.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Matthew,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the certain users, I suggest you follow the steps below to grant them the Reviewer permission:</span></p>
<p><span>1.
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell</a> with an admin account.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Run the command below for the certain users one by one.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong><em><span>Add-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy ***:\Calendar -User *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -AccessRights Reviewer</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Replace
<strong><em>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** </em></strong>with the shared mailbox’s email address and
<strong><em>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** </em></strong>with the user’s email address.</span></p>
<p><span>More information about the command can be found in
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd298062%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>For other users, you can give them the
<strong>Full Access</strong> permission to the shared mailbox by following the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Log in to EAC (<a href="https://outlook.office.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange admin center</a>) with an admin account.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click
<strong>recipients</strong> &gt; <strong>shared</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Double click the shard mailbox and then select
<strong>mailbox delegation</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click the add icon to add users to the
<strong>Full Access</strong> box.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After doing this, the shared mailbox will appear in their Outlook client
 automatically. If they don’t want this happened, you may run the command mentioned above to only grant them the proper permission to the shared calendar.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Feel free to let us know if anything is unclear.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

            You may be seeing Outlook.com because your account was automatically upgraded from Hotmail. Hotmail customers who were upgraded automatically to Outlook.com were notified in advance via email.<br />
<br />
Why was my account chosen to be upgraded automatically?<br />
<br />
When we launched Outlook.com preview, we shared plans to eventually upgrade all Hotmail customers to Outlook.com. To help ensure a smooth transition, the upgrade will be gradual. Your upgrade is part of the process.<br />
<br />
Can I switch back to Hotmail?<br />
<br />
If you were automatically upgraded to Outlook.com, the option to switch back to Hotmail isn't available.<br />
<br />
To see if you have the option to switch back, check for the Switch back to Hotmail link in Outlook.com. Go here for steps on how to check for the link.<br />
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/switch-back-hotmail<br />
<br />
For more information about the automatic upgrade and Outlook.com please click here.<br />
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/auto-upgrade-outlook-FAQ<br />
<br />
Some accounts that are "co-branded" are not currently eligible to be upgraded to Outlook.com. This includes accounts that were offered through companies like Bell Canada and Telstra, as well as some MSN accounts.
<br />

<br />
This will be addressed soon, so please be patient. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you want to try it out, then I suggest creating a new email address and temporarily forwarding your old mail to the new inbox. But, keep in mind that you won't be able to "merge" these accounts later. &nbsp;<br />

            I do not care for the new outlook, I can only see l/2 of a message, and the check boxes do not show up to delete or get rid of a message, unless I click on it several times, the writing is not hardly dark enough to see plainly, and my replys to messages
 are going to draft, and no way to send them.&nbsp; please give me back the old format I had, I do not like this one.

<p>Hello Olalekan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We understand that your device is locked and getting a message "<strong>Emergency calls only: Try again in 1751252 minute".</strong> This can happen when there are too may incorrect PIN has been entered. However, in your case, you're seeing this after booting
 your device. It is possible that there could an incorrect setting on your phone or something that's triggering this. We suggest that you reinsert your SIM card and remove the SD card if there's any. Then, reboot your Lumia 630.
<br />
<br />
If that didn't help, you may need to reset your phone to its factory settings to get it working again.
<em><strong>Note</strong> that this process will delete everything stored on your phone</em>. Here's the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10666/windows-phone-reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link</strong></a> on how you can reset your phone and follow the instruction under
<strong>To reset an unresponsive phone</strong> using the hardware buttons. You can
<strong>Restore from a backup</strong> after resetting it if there's an existing device backup. For your reference, you can check this article about:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/11688/windows-phone-back-up-my-stuff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Back up my stuff</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p>

            Yes, you can re-install on the same computer after installing Windows 8. The activation system takes a "snapshot" of your computer. The activation system is supposed to be smart enough to recognize your computer as being the same, even after limited changes
 so that it "re-uses" that allowed installation count. Valid changes include changing the OS.<br />
<br />
You should download the installation file before doing the OS change.<br />

                    I only just noticed this in build 14332 just before updating to 14342. Really glad to see this made it. Just curious to know how long it has actually been in the preview if anyone knows, or if that was the first build to feature it.

            <p>Well, sadly&nbsp;I'm not seeing them anymore but, I saw tubecastpro and groove music.&nbsp;The names weren't always precise, tubecast for example didn't just say tubecast pro, it says tubecast_something and groove didn't show up under its own name, it was under another
 name I can't recall exactly&nbsp;but I'm sure it was&nbsp;something like Microsoft_wwa_host. I regret not taking&nbsp;a screen grab, but I didn't expect that this would have been so short lived.

 that wasn't mine, so I'm afraid the account has been hacked and info has been changed, or I've just completely forgot all log in info. I tried to report the account but there was only the option to block it. I can't get into it and I would love to talk to

    <title>Navigation voice on Here drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josieclayton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Navigation voice on Here drive</h2>
                    <p>I cannot get a navigation voice activation on my Windows Nokia Lumia phone. I have checked and tried everything posted on the internet from others, but it is not working.&nbsp; I have checked my settings, and all of the settings seem to be set right.&nbsp; I have,
 also, tried the internet had said to try, but nothing seems to work. I need the voice on my Here drive, and need to have my voice back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to download a new voice, it just tells me I have no navigation voice, and do I want to download a new one. I say "yes" and pick out the voice I prefer, but it just blinks, and comes back to "Do you want to set a new one now?" I say yes every time
 and select the voice, but it just keeps asking me the same question over and over.&nbsp; If anyone can help me, I would, really, appreciate it. I am going to need my Here drive soon (with a voice, I hope).&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Try running the Activation Troubleshooter and indicate that you have changed hardware.&nbsp; There is a chance that you may need to install the public build for it to work, but you could install it to a small partition by first shrinking drive C: to make some
 space. Try 64GB.&nbsp; 20GB is minimum space for 64-bit Windows 10.

            That is why I suspect that you need to install some older public build of Windows 10 to move the license to the new motherboard.&nbsp; The troubleshooter used to work more reliably, even with Insider builds, but something has changed in the last year or more
 with Activation.&nbsp; Now, even if it finds your old computer's license that was linked to the same Microsoft Account, it often says that it does not apply to this version of Windows, or something similar.

            The important question is the replacement motherboard the same make and model? if different most times you will need to get a new key as MS calls this a new system.

            No, it's a different make/model. Somehow finding it unfair after being on insider preview for 2+ years and testing SO MANY builds that I need a new license when the PC breaks.

            I agree you can try the phone activation do you have a win7 or win 8 key?&nbsp; did you sign in this forum with the account that you have been using for two years as it shows that you just joined.

            Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I have this page, but it does not give directions for office 365, only for powerpoint 2016 and earlier.&nbsp; Should I use the directions for 2016?

<p>Office 365 is a payment scheme, not a version. Try the method for PowerPoint 2016 first.
