<h2>            Notification of pending updates</h2>
                    <p>My PC boots direct to desktop in Windows 8.1 (I neither like nor want to use the 'touch screen' interface). My preferences for Windows Update are set to download automatically, but then ask about installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If updates have been downloaded at any time during a session, then a message about pending updates may appear when I try to shut down, or else when I next login again. However, unlike with XP, no icon appears on the bottom toolbar to advise of pending updates
 if they are downloaded during the course of a session. Is there any way to get such an indication???&nbsp;</p>

    <title>While One Drive for Business is syncing unable to save files or create - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            While One Drive for Business is syncing unable to save files or create folders in Windows Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Since about two weeks ago I am intermittently unable to save files or create folders in Windows Explorer. I use this PC for business with Office 2016 for desktop, Office 365 for small business and One Drive for Business for cloud storage.&nbsp; My files are synced
 and backed up in One Drive for Business.&nbsp; This is a Dell Laptop and is running Windows 10 Home 10.0.17134</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started immediately following the recent Windows Update a couple weeks ago but I am not sure whether that particular update actually installed or not because Windows Update is now saying the following, after several attempts to install KB4100403:</p>
<p>2018-05 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1803 for x64-based Systems (KB4100403) - Error 0x80070002</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repro Steps:</p>
<p>1. I attempted to create a new folder. I was unable to create it and got an error dialog.</p>
<p>2. I took a screenshot of the error dialog that I got when I was unable to create a new folder.
</p>
<p>3. I was then unable to save that screenshot to the desktop for some time, I'm guessing while OneDrive was still syncing updates.
</p>
<p>4. When OneDrive was done syncing, I was finally able to save the screenshot and I was then also able to create folders (therefore I suspect that this is due to the sync.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is the error dialog. I blocked out pii but you should get the point. This happens frequently. Thanks in advance for any advice on how to resolve this issue.&nbsp;</p>

            Ransomeware was just introduced in Windows 10, disabling it temporarily is not gonna suddenly compromise your computer. 
<br />
<br />This feature is still not well implemented and its causing conflict even with some of Microsoft's own programs.

<h3> robbabecki  say:</h3>
<h2>            Centrino Wireless n-2230 wireless keeps dropping after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I have upgraded to Windows 10 my WiFi cuts out after a few minutes. When I was running Windows 8.1 I never had this problem. Also no other wireless devices in my home have this issue so it's definitely Windows 10 causing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The wireless says it's connected but it will stop responding. The only thing that resolves it is disabling and reenabling the WiFi when it cuts out. Also, when I go into device manager the Wireless Card Power Management settings are ALWAYS set to allow computer
 to turn the device off to save power. I uncheck all these options and save them but hours later they always show up as being enabled. I have also set the wireless settings under power management to high performance but this has made no difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers using versions off both the Intel and Dell websites as well as Windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really do not want to downgrade back to Windows 8.1 but It is REALLY annoying to have my WiFi just stop working multiple times a night. I also don't understand why settings I select keep changing back on their own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched for weeks and tried multiple solutions, but none have worked for this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Since the only drivers available for this adaptor are from Microsoft through Windows 10 directly (HP directs users of this model to Windows Update for nearly every driver), the above solution is not an option or applicable. I'm also having the same exact
 problem as the OP, with non-stop disconnects every few minutes. The only way to reconnect is to disable then re-enable the device.

I've had the same problem on my Lenovo ThinkPad. Did both steps, then downloaded drivers from lenovo, finally had to roll back my computer to Windows 7.0 Pro. Gave Microsoft about 5 months, they had released a driver upgrade and patch. Still had my network
 drop. Rolled my computer back to 7.0 Pro again. I guess I'll be missing out on the free upgrade to 10.<br />

<p><strong>Here's the issue i keep running into. I insert the install CD. Tells me to insert my linksys adapter into an available USB port on your computer. I do that, it says "please wait" as it loads or scans. After a couple minutes its asking me to insert

<p><strong>I have tried inserting the adapter to every USB port i have. The adapter lights up but the linksys adapter software acts like it cant find it. I tried it on my laptop and it works fine there, win 7 64bit on both systems. I contacted cisco support
 and tried updating the drivers manually but when i do that and take it to the location windows says it cant find the drivers. I started to think that perhaps its my usb not providing enough power but when i test it with known good keyboard they work fine in
 those usb's. I tried running window's "Fix it" tool and it doesnt find anything wrong.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Also when i go to my Open network and sharing center, there's no manage my wireless networks or when i click on change adapter settings there is no wireless in there as well, just the local area connection. I am stumped.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD when ikev2 VPN traffic load increase</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Dell XPS 13 (9343) and upgraded to windows 10 home from windows 8.1</p>
<p>I setup ikev2 VPN with split tunneling (configure using powershell) to connect to StrongSwan IPSEC server.</p>
<p>Whenever the load of the tunnel increase (eg: download a file from the server), my laptop will BSOD with error (PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA). I've try reset the whole laptop and clean everything including personal files but the problem still exist.</p>
<p>I'm using L2TP/IPSEC vpn tunnel to connect to another server too (no split tunnel) but it will not BSOD even though I download files from server.</p>
<p>Im using Windows 10 home single language.</p>
<p>I'm not sure it is software problem or hardware problem.</p>

            Hi Lenny, 
<br />
<br />If you right click on your application, and go to properties, there will be a Compatibility tab. Look for Run this application in compatibility mode button, check it off, and choose Win XP or 7.
<br />
<br />See if this works!

<br />
<br />All Editions of Windows with the exception of the S edition support 32bit applications . . .
<br />
<br />Please check what Edition of Windows you are running
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to System - About
<br />
<br />What Edition of Windows is reported there?
<br />
<br />Are you running the S Edition?

<strong>My friend has a new HP Windows 7 machine. &nbsp;It is attached to a Linksys 802.11g router. &nbsp;She purchased a new HP OfficeJet 6500 (wired ethernet). &nbsp;I downloaded the latest drivers and software from HP for the printer and installed it. &nbsp;The printer is attached
 via Ethernet to the router. &nbsp;After installation I get a printer icon for the printer and one for the fax. &nbsp;A few days later the printer icon disappeared and the fax icon had the default check mark by it. &nbsp;It would not print. I reinstalled the software and
 driver again and everything looked good and it printed fine. &nbsp;A few days later and it did the same thing. &nbsp;She says if she reboots the pc and printer it will work for a while. &nbsp;I went over today to look at it again and the printer icon was gone again with
 the fax icon having the default check again. &nbsp;This sounds like a Windows problem and not a printer problem. &nbsp;Any suggestions?</strong></li></ul>

            No it sounds like someone forgot to give the printer a static IP to me.&nbsp; Once you give it a static IP and install it to that static IP, it should not disappear.&nbsp; Right now, everytime the router or the PC is restarted, the IP address of the printer changes
 which is why it cannot be 'found' and is defaulting to the fax.&nbsp; Windows likes to have a printer (think of it as a security blanket) and will always look for one.&nbsp; The first one it finds, becomes the default.&nbsp; That's the way it's always been.&nbsp; Once the printer
 has a static IP, the router will always know where it is and therefore, as soon as the PC gets an IP address from the router, it will know where the printer is.

            No can do. The TV and PC are in different parts of the house. That's why I want to navigate the PC file structure via the TV - to see my photos away from the PC.

<p>
</p><p>So you are comparing a UX on a TV with a UX on a different device (with a different OS).&nbsp; Why would you expect it to provide the same functionality?&nbsp;&nbsp;What does Samsung say should be possible?&nbsp; What is available under the Options menu?&nbsp; If you need more help
 here you probably should post some details about your TV so someone can try to find and interpret its user guide for you.</p>

            UX = user interface? If so, no, I'm not comparing anything. I want to know why I can't view the photos stored on my PC on my TV when I have navigated to the correct PC folder via my TV screen interface (using the remote control). The folders are displayed,
 with placeholders for all the photos, but when selected the photo is not displayed.

            UX = "User Experience".&nbsp; Again, ask Samsung or post enough details about your TV to let us check more from that angle; otherwise I would have no reason to think that you should be able to view your photos on your TV the same way that you are used to doing
 under Windows 10.&nbsp; The thing you are using appears to be a file browser with a GUI to help represent the files.&nbsp; There are options available on the top right but you haven't helped explain their function either.&nbsp; For example and in particular, merely selecting
 a photo could only be a first step to actually trying to do something with it on the TV side.

<p>Firstly I must state that being able to view jpgs and play mp3s from my PC to my TV used to work fine (when I had Windows 7). It's not a feature I used often; only wanting to display photos in the main room if visitors ask about holidays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated in the OP, I believe this may be a W10 share permission problem. I had exactly the same problem trying to display photos on my Android tablet when using the OneDrive app which I cured by uninstalling OneDrive v4.1 and replacing it with v4.4 (OneDrive
 had not updated itself)</p>

<p><strong>Code 12</strong></p>
<p>This device cannot find enough free resources that it can use. If you want to use this device, you will need to disable one of the other devices on this system. (Code 12)</p>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> <br />
<br />
This error can occur if two devices that are installed on your computer have been assigned the same I/O ports, the same interrupt, or the same Direct Memory Access channel (either by the BIOS, the operating system, or both). This error message can also appear
 if the BIOS did not allocate enough resources to the device. <br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended resolution</strong> <br />
<br />
You can use the Troubleshooting Wizard in Device Manager to determine where the conflict is, and then disable the conflicting device.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable the conflicting device</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>On the device Properties dialog box, click the <strong>General</strong> tab. </li><li>Click <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> to start the <strong>Troubleshooting Wizard</strong> . The wizard asks you some simple questions and provides a solution to your problem based on the answers that you provide.
</li><li>Follow the resolution steps provided by the wizard to resolve the problem. </li></ol>

            It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters.

<div>Hi <strong>D - Man</strong>,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What exactly are you trying to accomplish in indexing option?<br />
2. Did you try running search and indexing troubleshooter?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you have not run the search and indexing troubleshooter, I suggest you to run and check for the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Refer:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Open the Search and Indexing troubleshooter<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Search-and-Indexing-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Search-and-Indexing-troubleshooter</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Try in safe mode.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Start your computer in safe mode<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue does not recur then, I would recommend you to perform clean boot.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 3:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>If the issue recur in safe mode then, try sfc scan.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with the /scannow switch, the tool will scan all of the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as necessary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues. Considering that, plus the fact that SFC /scannnow is completely automatic and very easy to use, the tool should usually be one of
 your first troubleshooting steps.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>You can also use the Event Viewer to look for information about the issue.</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">Currently, our work around is that users call in and we have the option in windows 10 to roll back to a previous build which makes
 everything go back to normal until they either push the update or we have reports that the update pushes automatically.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">We want users to continue to be able to update all other updates but not the Windows Build Updates. Is there any way to do this?</span><br />

<p>Hi Borhan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We made the <strong>Creators Update</strong> to give users a better and more feature-packed experience with Windows 10. However, we do understand that some software may be incompatible with the latest updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best thing we can do is to roll-back to the latest version of Build 1607 via this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4023680" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong>. Do note that there will no longer be any major updates for the said build, but minor patches will still be released. They can be
 accessed <strong><a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> or the aforementioned support article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other questions or concerns.</p>

<p>Hi Jairit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. I do know about the roll back and that does work on a basis of the end user still being within the grace period of 10 days&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know specifically if their is a way to roll a user back that has passed the 10 day period where the roll back option does not display anymore??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your assistance is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>

<p>You could do a system restore point to Build 1607. If system protection is turned on, restore points will be created when you install a new app, driver, Windows update, or when you manually create a restore point. You may follow the steps from
<strong>Restore from a system restore point</strong> in this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong>.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're unable to restore from a system restore point, then a factory reset would be the way to go. For this one, you'll need ask for assistance from the manufacturer of the PC for instructions.

            Hi again,<br />
<br />
I have contacted Medion but they said i was on my own when upgrading to windows 8.<br />
And said i should try this "forum?"<br />
<br />
So that was not a success.<br />
<br />
I have installed all the latest updates for windows 8, and i have tried to rightclick on the "touchscreen" in device management, and find the "update driver" button.<br />
<br />
But windows cant find any driver for it.<br />
So i'm pretty lost here :/<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions ?<br />

            I guess bkarcher is not interested in disabling all add-ons, but rather blocking advertisement.<br />
<br />
Here is the solution:<br />
<br />
This tip appeared as a solution to block ads in Google Chrome but it works also in Internet Explore (I have just tried it). In this article:
<a href="http://www.mychromeaddons.com/chrome-addon-adblock-for-google-chrome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Chrome Addon: AdBlock for Google Chrome</a> you can read how to block ads in Chrome. You want to do this for IE so I will change few steps to show you how to implement this feature
 in your browser:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Download and <a href="http://www.privoxy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">install Privoxy</a> (it will be your proxy server, which will be responsible for filtering content, so ads won't be displayed. Installation is very easy, just double click on the .exe file)
</li><li>Run Internet Explorer </li><li>Choose from the IE menu <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Internet Options</strong> &gt;
<strong>Connections</strong> tab &gt; click <strong>LAN Settings</strong> button </li><li>Check "Use a Proxy server for your LAN.." and in the Address setting add <strong>
127.0.0.1</strong> and in the Port <strong>8118</strong> <br />
<br />
<a href="http://img121.imageshack.us/i/proxy.jpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimg121.imageshack.us%2fimg121%2f9917%2fproxy.th.jpg" />
<br />
</a></li><li>Click OK, and restart Internet Explorer. </li></ol>
<br />
...<br />
<br />
But, I'm just curious.. why don't you like Firefox?

<h2>            Why when I put my computer to sleep does it restart&#63;</h2>
                    Sometimes when I put my computer to sleep, it instantly restarts. Its very frustrating because then I have to wait for it to start up so I can try to put it to sleep again, and it will restart again, then I either just leave it or shut it down.<br />
<br />
Why does my computer restart instead of going to sleep?

<h2>            Where does the &#34;Xbox Music&#34; app save new playlist files&#63;</h2>
                    I just upgraded to Windows 8 and started using the Xbox music app. &nbsp;In the past I used a combination of Windows Media Player and Zune, which both saved playlists in the playlist folder in my default music folder.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I made playlist in the Xbox Music app and the&nbsp;realized&nbsp;I couldn't easily sort the songs (in this case, order them&nbsp;alphabetically). &nbsp;I had planned to see if the file would open in Windows Media Player, where I could put things in order and copy it into
 a new playlist. &nbsp;However, I couldn't find the playlist Xbox Music created.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>An app is like&nbsp;a container which gets&nbsp;a dedicated space on the hard drive&nbsp;and is not&nbsp;accessible&nbsp;from outside.&nbsp;However an app can save data outside this container if required like when you wish&nbsp;to export a playlist from the xbox music app. Unfortunately this
 app does not have such a functionality, see the following post.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The attached DMP file is of the <u><b>DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE (9f)</b></u> bug check.<br />
<br />
<i>This bug check indicates that the driver is in an inconsistent or invalid power state.<br />
<br />
</i>By default, the fault of the crash is labeled as atapi.sys which is the ATAPI IDE Miniport Driver (not the true cause and is being driven to fault by something else). If we go ahead and run an !irp on the 4th parameter of the bug check (blocked IRP address),
 we get the following:<br />
<br />
<i>&nbsp;[ 16, 2]&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 e1 fffffa800778eb10 00000000 fffff8024a198410-fffffa8009cac760 Success Error Cancel pending<br />

*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for <b>fltsrv.sys</b><br />
*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for <b>fltsrv.sys</b><br />
</i><br />
<i>^^ </i>fltsrv.sys is a the Acronis Storage Filter Management Driver. Acronis has been known to cause issues, especially if performing regular backups, so I would go ahead and definitely uninstall it for troubleshooting purposes.<br />

            Correct, the driver is still listed and loaded. Let's manually remove it:<br />
<br />
Navigate to C:\Windows\System32\Drivers and find and rename fltsrv.sys to fltsrv.old.<br />
<br />
Restart.<br />

            Strange, it was listed and loaded in the DMP you linked. Since you're still crashing, please enable Driver Verifier.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
8. Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
If your OS became corrupt or you cannot boot into Windows after disabling verifier via Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier. <br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />
Any other questions can most likely be answered by this article:<br />

            I ran the BSOD and as soon as I logged in I got BSOD'd, I tried to run a command prompt to turn off the verifier and it didn't work, I was able to get back to a restore point.
<div>
<div><br />
<div>If the minidump in question was not the BSOD I will try the verifier again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>EDIT: looking at that article you sent it said verifier.exe/reset wheras I was trying verifier/reset. I will try to BSOD again.</div>
<div><br />

            All of the attached DMP files are of the <u><b>DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION (c4)</b></u> bug check.<br />
<br />
<i>This is the general bug check code for fatal errors found by Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
</i>However, despite its name, it's failing to detect a device driver within violation in ALL dumps, therefore this is likely a hardware issue, or the system is crashing so fast verifier has no time to find the cause.<br />
<br />
How new is this system?<br />
<br />
