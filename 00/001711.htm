<h2>            web page after signing out of outlook</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
After clicking on the sign out in outlook.com, the webpage displayed is blank and the url is:<br />
http://www.msn.com/?ocid=mailsignout<br />
<br />
I have had several different pages display after signing out now.&nbsp; A page that takes you to the sign in page, a page that displays msn website, a page that displays just the text you have signed out with a sign in button and now this page that displays nothing.<br />
<br />
Which page should I expect to get and should I receive the same page each time I sign out?<br />
<br />
TIA<br />

<h2>            Help&#58; Nokia 6800 Software &#38;amp&#59; Hardware Revision Info</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi, I have just bought a discontinued model - Nokia 6800 (<strong>not 6800A</strong>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am confused &amp; curious about the revision of both the hardware &amp; software for this model.</p>
<p>If anyone here could shed some light, I'd greatly appreciate it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hardware</strong><br />
Here's a shot of my phone's keypads (when unfolded)<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimg707.imageshack.us%2fi%2fimg0790copy.jpg%2f" /><br />
Here's a picture I found from the web:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimg85.imageshack.us%2fi%2f6800webkeypad.jpg%2f" /><br />
</li><li><strong>Software / Firmware</strong><br />
My firmware is v5.46 (from my searches from the internet, this is supposed to be the most up to date, right?)<br />
My phone's "Messages" menu screen is similar to this:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimg693.imageshack.us%2fi%2f53539911.jpg%2f" /><br />
But, now here's a picture I found from the web:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimg205.imageshack.us%2fi%2fnokia6800.jpg%2f" /></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My phone's IMEI label matches with the IMEI when keys *#06# are pressed.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure I am not conned of my purchase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am just wondering if there is an explanation to the differences.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On another matter altogether here, the phone I purchased is a QWERTY version.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the firmware responds QWERTZ.</p>
<p>I have referred to the nearest Nokia Care center, they were polite but unfortunately totally unhelpful.</p>
<p>I am not looking for a solution to hack/modify my phone with illegal solutions.</p>
<p>Rather, looking for an answer/explanation regarding firmwares.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My firmware is v5.46</p>
<p>It should be QWERTY, right?</p>
<p>If it was QWERTZ, would it still be the same firmware version?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this.</p>
<p>Hope to receive some constructive responses!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<div><br />
<p>So, are those differences between 6800 &amp; 6800A?</p>
<p>Or has it got to do with European editions vs elsewhere, or is it the firmware?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help a lost soul... thanks!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Suggestion To Improve S40 OS - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Suggestion To Improve S40 OS</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>
<p>Hi, I am a proud owner of X2-01. I am quite satisfied with its performance. However I found some aspects where the S40 can be improved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My cell phone runs on the latest firmware i.e..... V 08.71, 15-11-11, RM-709.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After using this phone for quite a long time I found that this phone supports partial multitasking. Some applications do run in background such as What's app, mail, chat, community etc. But we can not switch between them. When I try to open new apps many
 times I get one notification of some kind which says 'memory full close some applications'. When I press yes a task manager kind of thing opens which lists all the applications running in background along with their respective memory usage. From this list
 you can close unwanted applications and good to go to start a new application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing which I want to point out is that this task manager like thing is not user accessible, means it appears only when you run out of memory and not when you wish to access it. If you have sufficient memory then you can not access this task manager
 thing. Some applications provided by nokia such as community, chat, mail once opened can not be closed in fact they keep running in background. The only way to close these applications is when you run out of memory and this task manager like thing appears.
 There is no option to manually close these applications as per your wish. In my opinion these unwanted applications running in background consume ram as well as battery charge. Therefore I would like to suggest Nokia that they can provide an option of task
 manager in the settings so that we can close unwanted applications which a particular user like me don't use often such as the community, chat, mail, or say what's app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing which I would like to point out is that there is no option to minimize a running application (other than those mentioned above which gets hide in background). Let me explain a situation. Suppose I am listening music and then open an application
 say opera mini. Now while browsing if I wish to change the song all I need to do is to close the running application (opera mini) first then go to music player and change the song then again start the app (opera mini) again type website address to reach the
 website I was browsing before. Its really annoying when you are digging deep into websites. I would like to suggest nokia to provide an option to minimize a running app so that other options can be accessed (Such as reading&nbsp; a message, changing songs, viewing
 call logs and notifications, viewing contacts, dialing a contact etc).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope Nokia will definitely look into the issues mentioned above and come up with a solution in their upcoming software updates</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and Regards</p>
<p>- Sagar Bhere</p>

            Nokia always try to improve their OS symbian. But they must think that maximum of their customers hold s40 java phones and we badly need improvement in s40 phones. Say I use Nokia X2-00. I am satisfied with its performance. I don't face problems of changing
 musics while browsing. But a key is very necessary to minimize apps such as chatting+browsing. Hope NOKIA must introduce minization system in s40. They can use short-cut key as: 'call key+*'

<p>The reason you can change songs while browsing or when using any app is that your phone has some dedicated music keys to start , stop or change music even i am able to change tracks when my phone is&nbsp; connected with a headset by pressing the call button on
 the headset but even then you can not directly jump to a specific song as its impossible to access (view)&nbsp; media player menu or say song list when browsing or using any other app. all you can do is keep pressing next key till you reach that song and its become
 tiresome when you hav around 300 songs in your cell phone. i want to point out this thing. Neways thanks for the reply</p>

<h2>            PPT 2010 Templates</h2>
                    <p>I have created a ppt and saved as a template (potx), in the template folder. Then created the masters for it. When I click design to apply to a blank template there are many more options than I want shown from other templates. I moved those other templates
 to the server and off my computer, but they still show up. I logged off, then back on, and they still show. Can I get it to show only the design options from a particular template? Some of the options shown don't work with my template backgrounds.</p>
<p>I moved the old templates to the server, but they are now back on my hard drive.</p>

<h3> oxygen it - jay  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to update user contact information in Office 365 admin portal with AD users&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to update our clients contact information in Office 365, however the boxes are greyed out as they are managed by the local active directory. I went to the active directory and filled out all the fields under the "Telephones" tab, but when it
 synced with 365, only the "Mobile Phone" field in 365 had become populated with the information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fields I want to populate in 365 are Office phone and mobile phone. I can get mobile phone across but how can I get office phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a setting I can change that allows me to edit this information in Office 365 instead of having to do it through the AD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jay</p>

            <p>Hi Jay,<br />
<br />
The Office phone number can be synced from local AD. It is synced from the Telephone number in ADUC-&gt; User Properties-&gt; General. You can add the number and force Dirsync to sync it to Office 365.</p>

    <title>Outlook Build 16.0.6965.2053 for Office 2016 causing access violation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> willems davy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Build 16.0.6965.2053 for Office 2016 causing access violation when using mapilogonEX from inside a service &#40;works when not run as service&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a service that uses mapi / cdo to interact with exchange / office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we do is install outlook 2016 and then create a profile with a certain name&nbsp;to connect to a specific office 365&nbsp; account. Our customn made service that uses mapi / mapilogonex to logon to the office 365 account by specifying the name of the profile
 we had created&nbsp;/ configured using outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since outlook 2016 build version 16.0.6965.2053 this system is not working anymore. during The mapilogonEx call from inside a windows service&nbsp;we are getting an access violation inside&nbsp;module 'mso20win32client.dll'. More specifically it's a write of address
 00000000. So probably using something that is either not initialized or already freed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the same code when run inside a gui program (so not as a windows service) does not have the problem and does not produce this access violation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Older outlook 2016 build versions (previosly i was using 16.0.6001.1078 until i switched to current update&nbsp;channel)&nbsp;also do not have this problem the problems started after installing build 16.0.6965.2053.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The windows service and dll that is being loaded inside the service and that does the mapilogonex call is creating using Delphi XE6 and the mapi runtime api.&nbsp; As said earlier if this dll that does the call to mapilogonex is loaded from within a gui application
 the error does not happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known issue or is someone else having the same problem ? Is there a solution ? I'm not sure how i could get a valid stacktrace or something similar to show you guys.&nbsp; I tried windbg and delaying the call for 1 minute, giving me time to attach windbg
 to the service. I added debuging symbols path or at least i think i did but it still says it can't find debugging symbols for 'mso20win32client.dll'.
</p>
<p>I have not used windbg a lot so don't know much about it, i'm used to the Delphi debugger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this issue can be addressed somehow</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>here is what i have gotten from windbg although not sure if it's correct. DcsSyncService.dll is the dll that gets loaded by the service dcssyncservice.exe and makes the call to mapilogonex</p>
<p>
</p><p>the methodinterceptor is code from Delphi dealing with try / except blocks to catch the exception..</p>

</p><p>With the latest Office version make sure you call mapilogonex immediately after the first mapiinitialize. After this you can call mapiinitialize as many times as you like. Mapilogonex throws the access violation error if you call mapiinitialize more than
 once.</p>

<h2>            Exchange 2013 Hybrid - Resource Room Calendar Inaccessible</h2>
                    
<p>Hi There,</p>
<p>I am in the process of configuring Office 365 and Exchange 2013 Hybrid..<br />
I've managed to get mail flow working and can migrate users.</p>
<p>We have a couple of Room Mailboxes (under resources) that we use for meeting rooms, and people have access to these to book or check availability.</p>
<p>These are working fine for those users that are still on-premise as the rooms are on-premise, but those users in office 365 cannot access the rooms.</p>
<p>Also if I migrate one of the rooms to Office 365, no one on-premise can access this room...</p>
<p>That I can see Sharing free/busy has been configured correctly, but if anyone can help point me in the right direction then that would be useful.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-Tim</p>

<p>Managed to find a work around using the public folders, though need to test it fully..</p>
<p>From my post above:</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>Ironically I managed to get the thing working (I think, just need to fully double check)</p>
<p>I created a Public Folder Mailbox on-premise, and then a public folder.</p>
<p>I gave myself owner permissions to the folder.</p>
<p>I then synced the public folder mailbox to office 365 like all the other users (not migrated)</p>
<p>I could then successfully run on the MSOL powershell connection: </p>
<p>Set-OrganizationConfig -PublicFoldersEnabled Remote -RemotePublicFolderMailboxes PFMailbox1</p>
<p>Many hours later the folders appeared in my outlook.</p>
<p>Unlike in the link you provided, I didn't need to create a separate database, just created it using the on-premise Public Folders. Also the scripts do not work in Exchange 2013, the only useful step is the last one.</p>
<p>I have a system running Exchange 2013 so the 2007 Public Folders is not an option, but I do know they brought back public folder from CU7 of Exchange 2013..</p>
<p>From my original post above, it turned out I needed to sync the mailbox across like all the other mailboxes, this then allowed the set-organizationconfig to find the public folders.</p>
<p>Thanks anyway :)</p>

            Rich's answer is probably what you need so see if that works for you first. However, depending on what you are trying to do with the data, you might prefer a VBA solution. The VBA solution is harder to implement, but it gives you more flexibility with
 what you can do with the data. Example 10.5 on my site:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.PowerfulPowerPoint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.PowerfulPowerPoint.com/</a><br />
<br />
is an example of communicating with Excel. That particularly example writes from PowerPoint to Excel, but it is very easy to see how to read from an Excel file. Just click on "Examples by Chapter" and "Chapter 10."<br />

    <title>Office 365 CTR Update path - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jay.schwenk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 CTR Update path</h2>
                    <p>Good Day</p>
<p>
</p><p>We rolled out Office 365 a little over a year ago to 300+ users. My predecessor however did not take into account the updates for CTR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently the clients are looking at MS Servers online for updates constantly which affects our internet on a daily basis. Is there a way to update the path to which the client looks for updates? Preferably without a redeployment after editing the .xml file?
 Majority of the users are still on 2013 with a select few on 2016 running trials before we roll it out to the rest of the business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Yes, you can edit the “</span><span><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj219426%28v=office.15%29?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>UpdatePath=</span></a></span><span>” in the .xml file, but you need
 to redeploy it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you don’t want to redeploy the Office, you can edit the update path in the registry:
</span></p>
<p><span>Create a new registry named “updatepath”.</span></p>
<p><span>Point it to the folder that contains the new Office package.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I am not getting these updates to work, not sure if I am entering the path incorrectly in the reg key. I am adding it using the default UNC path of \\Server\Share\</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that there are sub folders in the update location after running the deployment tool to download the latest version, would I need to point it to the root of these folders or to the last folder where it shows the version number? Pictures below to
 explain the above.</p>

            Hi Jay,<br />
<br />
We need to point the path to “Office” folder which contains the latest version of Office version.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7c3b49c-16e3-4c82-a119-053df55ba53b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7c3b49c-16e3-4c82-a119-053df55ba53b" /></a><br />
<br />
We can share the folder like “\\V-WILZ097317VM\Office”, so that the end user can get the update from this folder after running the deployment tool.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
William<br />

    <title>6 OPTIONS NEEDED FOR CONDITIONAL FORMATTING IN EXCEL FOR MAC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bill johnstone nsw  say:</h3>
<h2>            6 OPTIONS NEEDED FOR CONDITIONAL FORMATTING IN EXCEL FOR MAC</h2>
                    <p>I need six (6) options to be available to me to colour code cells in my extensive spreadsheets. The 6 conditions for each cell in the row is that value would be "equal to" the value in another 6 cells in the row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently using Excel for Mac 2008, and it only allows three (3) different options in conditional formatting. Which version of Excel for Mac do I need to buy which allows 6 options in conditional formatting, and also allows the selection of "equal to"
 - rather than "greater than" or "less than", etc</p>

            I no longer have Excel 2008, so I cant be specific, but in the conditional format dialog select classic, and then you can use a formula to specify the conditions. Then select the format. you should be able to add multiple conditions and formulas.<br />

            As far as I know, the N92 is not yet available, except as part of ongoing DVB-H MobileTV broadcast network trials.<br />
<br />
When the first DVB-H networks start in production mode, it will probably be first available/sold in such countries.<br />
<br />
You can monitor the DVB-H status through, e.g.,<br />

<h2>            How to obtain a refund</h2>
                    Hey. I rented a movie on the Microsoft movies and TV app tonight. The film did not play. I got an error message saying the license was expired and film could not be streamed. I've been trying for four hours now just to get a refund. I've called, tried
 to send emails, chatted with an online representative who was less than helpful. I just want a refund. Is there any way to actually get a refund, or are the representatives just going to bounce me from one department to the next?&nbsp;

            <p>I had the same problem, rented a movie and it immediately said the license was expired as we tried to start watching it. &nbsp;I also chatted with an agent and they said we have to reach back out to them again when the video system is back up and running. &nbsp;Then
 we can ask for a refund. &nbsp;I don't understand the logic, or why they are not already keeping track of who they owe refunds to. &nbsp;Their video system is broken so I would think they would try to make the reimbursement process as easy as possible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They should somehow stop stop allowing people to purchase movies until this is fixed. &nbsp;Had I known the system was down, I wouldn't have rented the movie in the first place. &nbsp;A 2-hr movie has turned into a 2-hr headache.</p>

                    <p>After completing the installation of build 10061, the Dell 1703 Bluetooth driver failed to install.&nbsp; (Code 43) This driver worked in all previous builds.&nbsp; Here are a few details concerning my hardware platform:</p>

Attempts to resolve:</p>
<p>

- uninstalled driver then scanned for hardware changes</p>
<p>- installed several different versions without success, "rollback" driver option is greyed out.
</p>
<p>- reran driver installation package in both compatibility mode and ran as admin.
</p>
<p>- Fixed Bluetooth Support service so it now runs automatically</p>
<p>- reviewed every current posting for Bluetooth errors in build 10061, trying any suggestions to fix</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone with additional ideas?</p>

            Had exact same issue, when tried uninstall / reinstall, refresh same error... i solved this by uninstalling, not refreshing but running ccleaner with the box check in advanced " enviroment paths " rebooted and instead of going to my pc manufacturer for
 the driver, i instead went directly to Atheros, downloaded installed, rebooted scanned for hardware changes in device manager and no issue, exact same process i used &amp;&nbsp;fixed issues with my realtek card driver, Nvidia graphics driver, realtel audio driver,
 to add further , none were run in compatibility mode , gd luck :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3> drewfdq2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2003 - Convert document with drop down form fields to html and .pdf issues</h2>
                    At work - OS is Windows XP with Office 2003.<br />
At home - Windows 7 and office 2007<br />
<br />
I've created a template (document not saved as "word template") for use by multiple users in 2003 (some users have Word 2007/2010)vwith drop down form field boxes for selection by the user.&nbsp; My problem is that I need to find a way to be able to convert this
 Word document to both .pdf and .html - web page /filtered without the box outlines or shading showing or disappearing.<br />
<br />
I'm also creating another document that requires more text than allowed (a paragraph) in 2003 for a drop down form field box.&nbsp; Is there a was to create this in Word 2007/10 that would be backwards compatable with 2003?<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
Drew<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Defender - real-time protection stopped working</h2>
                    <p>After many months of trouble-free operation, Real-time protection has suddenly switched off and can't be turned on - comes back with Error code 0x800705b4. Before upgrading to Windows 10 last year, I used McAfee internet protection but decided not to use
 this with Windows 10 and it was removed using the tool mentioned in other posts. When today's problem came up, I repeated the procedure just in case and have re-booted a couple of times. &nbsp;So far as I can tell, I have no McAfee left-overs. &nbsp;Any ideas?</p>

            Yes this is correct.<br />
<br />
The phone uses the wire from the headset as the antenna for the radio.<br />
<br />
I believe it was the Nokia 8310 that first introduced the radio and its always used the headset as the antenna ever since.<br />
<br />
Kind of makes sense really.

            makes sense in some other universe perhaps... to listen to the radio on loudspeaker you have to plug in the headphones... very intuative!

            Hi!<br />
I went and bought the headset where you can plug in your own earplugs/headset (does this make sense?) as I use Koss earplugs - I guess if you get that, and if your loudspeakers have a minijack - you can plug it in there, and listen to the radio too, as the
 "nokia"-part of the headset is the antenna...
