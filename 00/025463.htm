<h2>            How to Edit Blocked Top-Level Domain List&#63; - Outlook for Mac Junk Mail Preferences</h2>
                    <p>I manage the IT needs of my small 6 person firm.&nbsp; Half the members use PCs and half use Macs.&nbsp; We have Office 365 business subscriptions and use Outlook as our mail client.&nbsp; On PCs, Outlook has an option to manage "Junk Email Options".&nbsp; In this pop-up box
 are 5 tabs including "International" where one can edit the "Blocked Top-Level Domain List" and "Blocked Encodings List":</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d4ceea0-f4cd-4a40-ba9f-1ac6ff5870d8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d4ceea0-f4cd-4a40-ba9f-1ac6ff5870d8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>We have had several recent fishing attempts, including one that tried to pretend it was an official Microsoft Office email prompting that it was time to change email passwords.&nbsp; The sender email was from Germany, the destination URL on the hyperlink button
 was not a Microsoft Office destination link, and the notice came by way of email as opposed to the standard in-app pop-ups, so the attempt was easily avoided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These fishing attempts are only plaguing the Mac users because I have gone into each PC and made sure the Blocked Top-Level Domain List is set to block 99% of countries on the list (Germany included, which is why the PCs did not get the fishing email).&nbsp;
 I have searched and cannot find the option or feature on Outlook for Mac to perform this same security feature.&nbsp; I even looked at the settings online to see if Mac users had to set the security online as opposed to in app and there was no such option at Outlook.com
 either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something?&nbsp; Can you provide help as to where this feature to update "Blocked Top-Level Domain List" resides in Outlook for Mac?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi MSeurat,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in our forum. As far as I know, the blocked top-level domain list is not available in Outlook for mac. You can only specify e-mail addresses or individual domains that you want Outlook to classify as junk.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a workaround, you can contact your admin to create an international spam policy from server side to filter email messages that are written in specific languages or sent from specific countries or regions.
</p>
<p>For more detailed information, here is the article for your reference:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/configure-your-spam-filter-policies</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you really have concern on this feature, I suggest you submit your ideas via the following link:</p>

<p>Hi Huni Shen!</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I appreciate your suggestion, it does not help resolve the issue.&nbsp; First, we are a small business with 6 employees.&nbsp; One of my roles (as I wear many hats) is the IT Administrator.&nbsp; We are not a very complex business so rely on the IT tools provided
 by Microsoft Office 365 (and our anti-virus vendor) to provide for our security needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, is there a way in Azure or Office 365 for Business Administrator for me to set similar top level domain list restrictions?&nbsp; Can you provide a link to instructions on how to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note, and as a serious suggestion, please make the product for Mac match the product for Windows.&nbsp; Users really do not care about the warring OS factions, they just know the product is Microsoft.&nbsp; If it works one way on one OS the consumer expectation
 is that it should work the same way on all OS's.&nbsp; Making these great security features (and other features) universal across all OS's would make it less likely for consumers to seek other products. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a thought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi MSeurat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your kind suggesions. Since Outlook for Windows and Outlook for Mac are different products, they may have differency in certain feature designing. Based on your need, I recommend you can also try to block these specific domain via adding them
 to your domain block list. For detailed information, please follow below:</p>
<p>1. Login to <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
EAC(Exchange Admin Center)</a>.</p>
<p>2. Go to <strong>Protection &gt; Spam filter</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Double-click the default policy or another policy to edit it, or create a new policy.</p>
<p>4. On the <strong>Block Lists</strong> page.</p>
<p>5. Add the domains you want to block under&nbsp;<strong>Domain block list</strong>.</p>
<p>For your reference:</p>

<h3> nitinjha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi not working on lumia windows phone</h2>
                    <p>I have Lumia 730 DS and Wifi has stopped working. It has been only two months since the purchase and in the initial days it was working fine but recently I am facing problems as it is not connecting to any Wifi network (be it my home Wifi network or a Wifi
 hotspot). It is able to detect the network but once I try to connect it I get the message (T<strong>he WiFi network ****** didn't respond. Try again Later</strong>).</p>
<p>I am unable to take backup of the phone on cloud and there is no option to take backup on PC. I am unable to update the software since Wifi is required to update to latest version. I have tried soft and hard reset but still it is not able to connect to any
 wifi network. There are no problems with the Wifi network as I use my other phones and laptop to surf internet and I am posting using the same network. Please do not suggest to check my router settings etc. as I have done everything and all other devices are
 working fine on the same network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stuck with this problem and it now seems that it was a wrong choice to move to Windows OS.</p>

<h2>            Mails are moved to a subfolder without any existing rules</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've a strange question. Some mails that are coming in (most off them are marked as 'Newsletter') get automatically placed in a folder that I've created myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says 'this message is automaticaly placed in this folder' (or something similair because it's not in English).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most strange thing is; there are no rules that cause this and 2 mails from the same mailadress get treated different; 1 got in that special folder and 1 stayed in the inbox....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody tell me how this is caused?</p>

<h2>            Music from PC to phone</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 10 on my computer and I recently put some music on it from a CD. I'm trying to put it onto my windows phone (I think it is windows 8.1?) but I don't know how to. I've been on this page (http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/music-and-videos/sync-music-ringtones-and-podcasts-using-my-computer)
 but it doesn't help me. I don't want to sync everything, I just want to select an album, and move it to my phone. The Phone Companion app is not helpful at all either. I've looked all over the internet but I still can't find anything. I can't get itunes on
 my phone however moving things from itunes to an ipod is easy because you just drag from one place to another, is there anyway I can do that? I don't have OneDrive or anything like that, all I'm trying to do is put one album onto my phone from my computer.
 I don't want to download anything.</p>
<p>To sum up, how do I put an album from my computer to my phone.</p>
<p>I appreciate your help.</p>

            <p>Like profjulie said....just drag/drop to your phone using files explorer. First, find out where your music folder is on your phone or you'll have more frustration trying to get the phone player to find it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old "sync" mode is pretty much dead, as far as actual files go. You can usually use Windows Media Player to move songs around, too (and move playlists). Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.&nbsp; You can create playlists on your phone easily enough,
 and if you have Groove music pass you can sync all your music and playlists on every windows 10 device. That's what I am doing--a bunch of computers, a tablet and 2 Windows 10 phones. The 4 device limit only applies to devices you download music to for offline
 use. Streaming is not limited (I don't think---maybe it has that 10 device limit Windows apps have??).

            Hello Roninaz,<br />
<br />
Thank you for choosing Microsoft Office Community and posting your query.<br />
<br />
A quick question before proceeding:<br />
<br />
Do you have any Google Sync application installed on Windows Vista/Windows 8 computer?<br />
<br />
As specified in the following thread, issue could due to conflict with Google Sync app:<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/outlook/error-message-when-starting-outlook-2013-gsyncdll/bf9bc65f-fa6a-4d91-a42f-0ca5c26b0c3a?msgId=0ab2d9da-f4d4-452a-8540-a5ded63d822f">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/outlook/error-message-when-starting-outlook-2013-gsyncdll/bf9bc65f-fa6a-4d91-a42f-0ca5c26b0c3a?msgId=0ab2d9da-f4d4-452a-8540-a5ded63d822f</a><br />
<br />
Let's try the following and verify the result:<br />
<br />
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1) Start Outlook in safe mode following below mentioned instructions and verify the result:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
* Hold Windows key + R.<br />
* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Outlook /safe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note: There is space between Outlook and /</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
If Outlook safe works, disable the add-ins following steps mentioned below and determine the problem causing add-in:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
a) Click on <b>File</b> menu, click <b>Options</b>, <b>Add-ins</b>, <b>Go</b> button besides
<b>Manage</b>: <b>Com-in Add</b>.&nbsp;<br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the check box.&nbsp;<br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it.&nbsp;<br />
d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
2) If issue still persists, create a new profile following the instructions mentioned in the link below and configure multiple email accounts and verify the result:</span></p>

            Danial,<br />
<div><br />
<div>I have Outlook 7 running in Vista on the "old" machine. &nbsp;I was trying to run Office 365 on the new machine. &nbsp;I used a easy transfer cable to move the files. &nbsp;Everything appeared to move until I hit this snafu with Outlook.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried the fix you provided and was unable to get it to work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I have done so far is off load Office 365 and load Office 2007. &nbsp;I hated to do this but I have to have Outlook up and running. &nbsp;We are working on this right now to ensure that all of the files have moved over. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>In many respects I am lucky that I took the initiative to do all of this before the old computer went down totally. &nbsp;I wanted to get ahead of the curve and, man, what a curve this have been.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for the response.</div>

</font></span><span><font color="#000000">Thank you for replying and sorry for the delayed response.<br />
<br />
Which fix are you referring to? Did you mean starting Outlook in safe mode or in new profile resulted in the same error?<br />
<br />
As specified earlier, this </font></span><span><font color="#000000">issue could due to conflict with Google Sync app. While transferring the data from Windows Vista computer, the
 Google Sync app files would've got transferred along which is failing to integrate with Outlook 2013.
<br />
<br />
Once the files are transferred, you may install Office 365 and import the Outlook data into Outlook 2013 from the *.pst file and check whether issue re-surfaces.
<br />
<br />
Refer to the following article for information regarding managing Outlook data file:<br />

<p>I'm not sure if this will work for everyone, or anyone else for that matter, but I tried all the path corrections with no change. I was still getting the MAPI start service error. And I did not want to uninstall everything/do registry clean/ and reinstall
 everything as I did not have the Google App Sync information from my IT guy. So, what I did, (what worked for me) were 2 things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) I did a restore point to a date before the error occurred. This worked, but eventually the error came back as Windows/Outlook/MS Office/Google Apps Sync eventually updates and the error comes back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) I went to my downloads folder and just re-installed the Google Apps Sync program without uninstalling it first. This must have fixed the gsync.dll file issue because not Outlook is opening with my profile and google contacts synced and all updates are
 installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Did you really mean to type PM for the 0200 entry (or was that a typo for AM)? If that was not a typo, then at what time during the day should a number starting with 0 be considered AM? I mean by this that if 0200 is to be interpretted as an afternoon time,
 what about an entry like 0700... is that 7:00 AM or 7:00 PM? What about 0800 or 0900? Where is the breakpoint at which the entry should be considered a morning time?<br />
<br />
Also you say "format the cells"... formatting does not change a physical number (it would stil be 200 underneath), it only makes it look different (you want it to look like 02:00 PM)... is that what your client really wants? We can do it, we just need to know
 for sure that is what is required. We could just as easily use VB code to physically change the 200 number to a time&nbsp;of 02:00 PM... your (client's) choice.</p>

 that is in "People", OneDrive does not find them and I have to resort to opening Outlook / People in one tab and OneDrive in another, open the contact and then highlight and copy the email address into the "Enter a name or email address" field in the OneDrive
 share diaglogue box. This is very time consuming and seems crazy if I already have a contacts list setup. What am I doing wrong?

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for my delay. I’d like to explain The Office 365 directory feeds the SharePoint Online user profile. And OneDrive searches SharePoint User Profile Application. If you want to share an OneDrive for Business file with an external user, and the external
 user has never been invited to your SharePoint, the external user will not be listed in SharePoint User Profile Application. You will need to manually enter the email address of the guest to share the file. Once the external user has accepted the invitation,
 the user profile will be set up and you will be able to search the user later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use anonymous link as a workaround. You will need to copy the link and paste in Outlook and external users will be able to access the shared file with no need to sign in. However, please note that anyone with this link will be able to access the
 file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it’s not feasible to add the user directly to user profile, if you want to be able to add user to Delve directly, we suggest submitting your feedback in Delve UserVoice via voting for this
<a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273487-delve/suggestions/9682635-ability-to-edit-user-list-and-or-remove-users" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
idea</a>. Providing your feedback is the best way to let related team hear your voice, which will help better our products and services.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Help&#33; Problem with turning my new Nokia 5000 on&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought a Nokia 5000 and me and my daughter have been toying with it all afternoon...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were having troubles with it, we realised that not having the SIM card inserted was part of it...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we can't seem to figure out how to turn it on!! I know it sounds kind of stupid, but...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are looking at the manual and where it says the power button is, well, it kinda seems to be missing...or are we just not looking hard enough?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some help would be greatly appreciated, I need that phone! ;-)</p>

<p>EDIT - forget that, just downloaded the manual and see where the ON/OFF button is.</p>

<p>It's towards the top on the RHS of the phone.</p>

                    I've been locked out of my account for a couple of months now and I'm now urgently in need of accessing it again but it seems impossible to get the code they give you to work. I am so frustrated. First I got a really long digit code and when I tried to
 type it all in the box told me that it was a seven digit code!!!! So I tried again and waited 30 days and I received another code that was seven digits this time BUT NOW IT WONT LET ME PRESS NEXT!!!! What is the trick to get this all to work??? I've had my
 account for years and never had problems with it, why are they doing all of this to me now...

            Hello Buernovista,
<br />
<br />Thanks for your response. It is very strange as I am able to search in my account. If, the issue was with Outlook desktop client, we could have tried rebuilding the search index, but you are facing the issue on web browser version as well. 
<br />
<br />Could you please try to clear the browser cache and if, possible also attach a screenshot of what you see. 
<br />
<br />Please try to clear your browser cache. steps in below article for different browsers. Clear the forms and password history (checkbox) so that your browser doesnt remember the credentials you have entered.

<p>Hi Parmi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have cleared my cache but still not working. Just a question? After you put in the dates from the "search" bar and indicating searching "All Folders" and search from eg 1st Dec 2018 to 25 Dec 2018, what is the final key you press to produce the results?</p>

            Hi Buernovista,
<br />
<br />I dont press any key, it updates it, itself. 
<br />
<br />Here is an interesting thing. Now when I tested again, I entered a key which did not render any results. after that I selected other date ranges and still no results. 
<br />
<br />I then closed the window and opened new one, entered just 'date' in search box. I got some results. Now when I selected a date range, it then gave me the search results. 
<br />
<br />Regards,

<p>hi mike,</p>
<p>in this case, may i know if you would like to share a sharepoint site to an external user? if so, i would like to explain that when you share a site with an external user, the user will receive an invitation email as below. the user needs to click the site
 name in the email. then,&nbsp;he/she can use a microsoft account or work/school account(office 365) to access the site you shared.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a464d905-7910-4ffc-afaf-7397d22e281b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da464d905-7910-4ffc-afaf-7397d22e281b" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=428b468a-2348-442a-a552-79d51e4a81eb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d428b468a-2348-442a-a552-79d51e4a81eb" /></a></p>
<p>therefore, the external user needs to have a <strong>microsoft account</strong> or a
<strong>work/school account</strong> to access the sharepoint site instead of the email address you typed in this page.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=c6b44c25-4510-4cc2-925c-834b946fd3dd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dc6b44c25-4510-4cc2-925c-834b946fd3dd" /></a></p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 - not showing the All &#43; Unread quick filters</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something disappeared from my Outlook this morning when launching it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It used to show below the Search Bar some quick filters (All + Unread) with then on the right the option for additional filters such as "newest first", "by attachment", etc. The screenshot below shows what it used to look like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning it doesn't show the same thing (second screenshot). It uses the same real instate for a far less efficient use. It now shows on the left under the Search Bar the folder name I'm in (i.e. useless) and on the right has aggregated all possible
 filters adding an extra 2 to 3 clicks depending on the required action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An extra 2 to 3 clicks a few hundred times a day is a lot....&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Adding new rows to Timeline &#40;Project 2010&#41;</h2>
                    Hi, I am new to Project and am trying to format a timeline. I cannot seem to add new rows to the timeline!! They will only display in one row (squashed up so you can't read them), or as callouts (looks messy and not easy to read). I understand you are
 supposed to drag them up and down within the grey bar but when I do that it just&nbsp;instantly trips&nbsp;outside the bar as a callout.&nbsp; Can anyone help?

Sorry, I can't reproduce what you report.&nbsp; I have multiple tasks scheduled for the same overlapping time, and as I add each to the timeline, the height of the timeline grows and each task is added as a bar.<br />

I have SP-1 installed in Project, do you?<br />

            <p>Thank you both for your engagement and advice. I think I was missing something a bit obvious! I had given my summary tasks (the ones I wanted&nbsp;displayed on the timeline)&nbsp;a duration of one day, eg Write to MEPs, as&nbsp;to&nbsp;I&nbsp;had not linked them to their subtasks.&nbsp;(
 I was working in Manual so I was able to do this.). I guess as the bar in the timeline reflects visually a period of time, one day is squashed up. Even three weeks doesn't display the full task but I guess there is not much I can do about this. Once I have
 extended the period of time to a couple of months,&nbsp; I get the rows. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be great if there was a way of displaying tasks in a readable manner in rows regardless of their duration, but I guess there are sensible reasons for not doing so. I will live with the callouts or perhaps&nbsp;link the subtasks to the summary tasks so
 the time period is elongated - if the tasks last long enough for the display to work.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

    <title>Office 365 keeps asking me to download and install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slovill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 keeps asking me to download and install</h2>
                    <p>Using 10 day trial of Office 365 for Business. Downloaded and installed 32 bit version of Office 365 Business 2016 through admin portal using IE11, but I keep getting the notification "Don't miss out. Download and install Office on your computer. Install
 now." I searched for quite some time for an answer with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other info:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10 Pro&nbsp;64 bit</li><li>Uninstalled Office 365 for Home (64bit) after first two installations of Office 365 for Business</li><li>Uninstalled/reintalled Office 365 for Business about 7 or 8 times w/restarts&nbsp;- none of which turned off the pesky notification.</li><li>Office 365 for Business - the few areas I've delved into seem to be fine.</li><li>Office 365 for business shows as installed and activated on this system in the "Install Status" section of "My Account"</li><li>Previous OneDrive app not uninstalled</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Question: Why do I keep getting this notification, and can it be stopped?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some food for thought... is the previous 64 bit version of Office getting in the way? I notice the Outlook, OneDrive&nbsp;and OneNote apps still point to previous set ups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. </p>

    <title>Marking up wholesale costs to retail prices using Office Excel 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> austral_919  say:</h3>
<h2>            Marking up wholesale costs to retail prices using Office Excel 2013</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I am trying to write a formula in Office Excel 2013 that will mark up wholesale costs of items to retail prices.&nbsp; For example, a $10 wholesale item marked up by 80 percent would be $10 *(1.80) = $18.&nbsp; However, my wholesale costs contained in cells A2 to
 A100 range from $1.00 to over $250 and each wholesale cost has a different markup percentage.&nbsp; In other words items costing $1 to $9.99 are marked up by a factor of 2.0 and items costing from $10 to $25 are marked up by a factor of 1.8.&nbsp; I am thinking of an
 "If" formula, but don't know how to write the formula.&nbsp; I would think the formula might be something like the following:&nbsp; =If A2:A100 is between 1-9.99, then multiply by 2.0, If A2:A100 is between 10-25 then multiply by 1.8, etc. Any help would be greatly
 appreciated...Thank you so much!</p>

<p>Yammer best practice is to tell users not to post to All Company Group, rather post in relevant groups so that it reaches the right people and the right people comment.</p>
<p>In the context of a large company, posting it to the All company group will result in the post being buried by a large number of other posts.</p>
<p>You can set a group to private during creation or in the admin part (gear symbol) of the group (you will need to be the Yammer network admin, or the admin of the group to be able to do so).</p>
