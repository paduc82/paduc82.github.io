            MOHAA is compatible with Win7, no worries. It is not compatible with some (all ?)<br />
Integrated graphics, however (bottom of post).<br />
<br />
- Quick options in relation to your error message -<br />
Open the games install folder and run the Configure.exe. Then try the MOHAA.exe.<br />
If the game runs and your first shortcut still does not work then delete the shortcut and make<br />
a new one from the MOHAA.exe.&nbsp; I use the R/click &gt; Send to &gt; desktop option.<br />
- Failing the above;<br />
Delete the file called newconfig.cfg in the games install folder \ main folder \ to your desktop,&nbsp;
<br />
and do the same with the file called unnamedsoldier.cfg in the configs&nbsp; sub-folder that you<br />
will find in the <span style="font-style: italic">main</span> folder.<br />
Run the Configure.exe again and try launching from the MOHAA.exe.<br />
<br />
Or -<br />
The Pak0.pk3 files are one of the main components of the game. There are five pk3 files.<br />
As you get an error specific to one of these files I would think it was corrupted on installing.<br />
Try uninstalling and reinstalling the game.<br />
<br />
I may have suggested not installing to the default location Program Files (x86) in another<br />
MOHAA thread.&nbsp; I don't install any game to the default location, so I don't know if it benefits this particular game, but it may help.<br />
<br />
If you are using Intel HD Integrated graphics the game will not run.<br />
Integrated graphics are hit and miss regarding compatibility with older games.<br />
I have HD4000 and MOHAA will not launch due to Open GL issues.<br />
<br />

<h2>            trying to play &#34;Project Gotham Racing&#34; version 2 on an xbox 360s console&#59;- help needed&#33;</h2>
                    Can anyone help me please? I have a game cd originally made for the first xbox, from approx 2004. I can still use this game on my original xbox, but, with my newer tv, the picture quality is not great. I also have a relatively old xbox 360s from approx
 2010, and the picture quality from this is much better with my tv. I have tried to play the game cd on the xbox 360s, but a dialogue box opened informing me I needed a hard drive adding to my xbox 360. I have added a hard drive, but now when trying to play
 the old game, another dialogue box opens on screen stating;- "This original xbox game is not supported on your xbox 360 console. An update to support this game may be available. For more info. go to www.xbox.com/games" I have visited the website, but cannot
 find help. Can anyone help me please?

            The hard drive you bought, is it just an external hard drive or an actual 360 hard drive? If it is a 360 drive, was it bought brand new, or used/from a third party like ebay?

<p>Hi</p>

</p><p>It sounds like you may need to carry out&nbsp; software update on your Xbox 360 console to allow it to play the game, please see the guide below for how to update your console.</p>

            Hello, and thanks for your response. I can confirm that I did indeed buy the hard drive from Ebay, and it is a pre-used drive. The drive arrived today, it is supposed to be a 20gb hard drive. It plugged straight into the chamber on the side of my xbox
 360s console, and the console appears to "recognise" the hard drive. Someone else has responded to my request for help and suggests I may need to carry out a software update on the xbox 360 console. So, for the first time since buying the console brand new
 in late 2009, I have managed to connect it to the internet ( I live in a sparsely populated mountainous region, British Telecom are unable to reach up here with a conventional phone line, so I have to rely upon a&nbsp; mobile phone for internet access, and the
 signal is poor;- this is why I have never bothered trying to connect to the internet before with the xbox. However, I have finally managed to download an update, and, once again, the xbox invited me to "play Project Gotham Racing 2";- but,

 "inviting me" to play the PGR 2 game, as soon as I press "select" on the hand controller, the same dialogue box pops up saying the game is not supported. Any further suggestions please?

<p>Are you able to test any other backwards compatible games?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally issues with backwards compatible games on the 360 is down to the hard drive. A lot of third party purchases of hard drives tend to result in the hard drive being a knock off which will not work with backwards compatibility.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for prompt second response! Unfortunately I cannot test any other game cd. Ironically, I have only ever played Project Gotham Racing;- it's all I ever wanted the xbox for. I used to play PGR 2 on my original Xbox, and then bought an xbox 360s with
 PGR 3 when it became available. I always preferred PGR 2, and hence want to try playing it on my 360s console now that my original xbox console is difficult to connect to my new tv hence I only have PGR 2 and PGR 3 to test out my consoles with (both my original
 xbox and the 360s) I have had another look at the external "add-on" hard drive that I installed in the xbox 360s today following earlier advice. It certainly isn't marked anywhere with any xbox logos or wording, but certainly the console does seem to "recognise"
 it. As you can probably tell, I am not at all computer literate, so all this is a steep learning curve for me! Strange that prior to installling this hard drive earlier today the 360s console simply gave the message that the PGR

            As the original Xbox only had a very small hard drive. If you have any 16/32 GB (or larger) USB memory sticks available you could try connecting that to your 360 to see if you have the same issue.

                    Photos App is still not color managed. It doesn't respect ICC profiles at all. Images in Photos App are oversaturated and color shifted compared to all other image viewers and Adobe Photoshop - even old desktop Windows Photo Viewer which respect ICC profiles.

    <title>Surface Pro Backlight Bleed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> srivaasvenkataramanan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro Backlight Bleed</h2>
                    I bought a Surface Pro back in July. Unfortunately, I had to return the device in August as I had issues with the display. The support team were helpful and told me that I can get a replacement. The replacement device they sent had excessive backlight
 bleed so I had to return it again. New device ALSO has backlight bleed.&nbsp; I am not sure if Microsoft does quality control before they ship devices and if they read the repair request before they send a replacement out. I have seen other users complain about
 similar issues but none where even the replacement devices are faulty. I don't have to keep returning the device until my warranty runs out and pay for an actual repair. Do I? Can anyone help?&nbsp;

            <p>&nbsp;I'd think your download got corrupted somehow, so I'd try re-downloading it.&nbsp; While the download is running, try not to run other things.&nbsp; That shouldn't matter, but sometimes with a long download it can happen.</p>

                    <p>Quick notes on my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was booting my pc a few days ago, it was stuck on the windows logo for quite a while, and amidst several tries, it wouldn't load to my desktop so I forced numerous shutdowns (with me pulling off the plug directly) &nbsp;so i gave up then decided to make
 a fresh install using my usb stick, but when windows 10 installer almost loads, it abruptly goes to BSoD with a message saying session 1initiation failed. What is this error and what is the cause? Would really like to get some help. Thanks in advance.</p>

</p><p>I have strange problem with audio drivers on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ECS G41T-M7 motherboard which has VIA Vinyl VT1705 audio output for 6 channel High Audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded my PC from Windows 7 Professional - x64 to Windows 10 Pro - x64 and Windows automatically installed VIA HD Audio drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With these drivers (built in August 2015), I didn't have option to configure 5.1 Surround sound.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two weeks ago I got update for VIA HD Audio with new build date 03.12.2015. and now I have option to configure 5.1 Surround sound, but it's not working. After I configured speakers through "Configure speakers" and set "Fill my speakers" enhancement, I'm
 still getting stereo sound from my speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I uninstalled audio drivers manually, and downloaded drivers from VIA support website (<a href="http://download.viatech.com/en/support/driversSelect.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>). I installed VIA Vinyl HD Audio Driver (version v11.10b
 - v11_1000b_08182015).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installation I finally got my 5.1 sound output working as it should, but with these drivers I lost drivers for Line IN, Stereo Mix and Microphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I need Stereo Mix for recording internal sounds, I uninstalled these new drivers and let Windows automatically reinstall default ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to fix these problems?</p>

            <p>Hi Ashish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to use 5.1 surround output, Microphone, Line IN and Stereo Mix on Windows 7. But now on Windows 10, I'm able to record sound when Windows automatically install recommended drivers, but then I can only get stereo output from my speakers and 5.1
 surround sound is not working. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After I installed recommended drivers from VIA website, I got 5.1 surround output but then Microphone, Line IN and Stereo Mix are missing from installed device list, and troubleshooter list these devices as not installed and not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if I roll back to Windows 10 recommended drivers, then all of these devices working as they should except my speakers.

            <p>Hi Ashish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried to install drivers from VIA website using Windows 7 compatibility mode, and it doesn't work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installation I got installed Speakers, Microphone, Line IN, and SPDIF Interface, but when I tried to configure speakers through "Sound" in Control Panel, configuration window doesn't show 5.1 Surround option.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to manually install latest drivers from Device Manager and Windows automatically installed latest drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this, I got 5.1 Surround option in configuration window, but it gives me stereo output through my speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is how it all works:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If I uninstall all drivers and allow Windows to automatically install VIA drivers, I got all of these devices (Speakers, Microphone, Line IN, SPDIF Interface and Stereo Mix) working except 5.1 Surround sound (option is present in configuration window,
 but output gives stereo sound).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If I install drivers from VIA website over this existing VIA drivers which Windows automatically installed, I got Speakers (with 5.1 working perfectly) and SPDIF Interface, but other devices are missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If I uninstall all drivers and install drivers from VIA website (with or without compatibility mode), I got all devices installed except Stereo Mix, but then 5.1 Surround output doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this first option will suit me perfectly, if I can configure 5.1 Surround output to work as it should. And I also need Stereo Mix option, because I use this option to record internal sounds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these devices worked as they should on Windows 7.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>

</p><p>When you say, problem with some of my games, I suspect that the problem might lies with the game compatibility on Windows 10. Suggest you to check the compatibility of these games with Windows 10 from their Official website. In case problem is due to compatibility,
 then I suggest you to check this by installing them in compatibility mode.</p>

<h2>            Intel RST service is not running message when it is running and IastorU1 will not start</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have recently upgraded to win 8.1 (32) Pro from XP pro and all went fine. &nbsp; After that I did an upgrade from win 8 --&gt; 8.1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Now I can no longer use the Intel rapid storage technology tools available to administer the Intel Raid storage when the OS is
 running . &nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Have reinstalled all the intel drivers etc but this did not effect the problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I get the "intel RST service is not running message."&nbsp;In an icon&nbsp;on the bottom tool bar from the moment the computer starts.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I run&nbsp;<font color="#000000">Services.msc I can see "the service running OK.&nbsp; Also stopping and restarting the service has no impact on the problem.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We have other Win 8.1. P/C's in the house running in 64 bit mode and these work fine.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Mine is a 32 Bit version</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">IastorU1 will just not start because it thinks that the service is not running. &nbsp;Maybe there is a security issue or something?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><br />
</font></p>

            <span>Hi Celia,<br />
<br />
1. What happens when you try to use Intel rapid storage technology?<br />
2. Do you get any error message?<br />
3. How did you install the Intel drivers?<br />
<br />
Windows 8.1 is a new operating system, The drivers which get updated when you upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 is a generic drivers. I would suggest you to download and install the drivers from Intel website and see if that helps.<br />
<a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/SearchResult.aspx?lang=eng&amp;keyword=%222012+Intel+Rapid+Storage+Technology+%28Intel+RST%29%22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/SearchResult.aspx?lang=eng&amp;keyword=%222012+Intel+Rapid+Storage+Technology+%28Intel+RST%29%22</a><br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to contact Intel support to see if there are any updated drivers or known issues available.<br />

Hope this helps! Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

            Hi Vijay B,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for your quick response. &nbsp;In answer to your question 1. &nbsp;The RST program would not run because it said the the RST service was &nbsp;not running but when looking at the service via&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Services.msc in win 8.1 I
 can see the service running OK and it can be stopped and started manually. &nbsp;Otherwise no error messages. &nbsp;I used the intel driver checking tool to check the intel drivers on the ASuS P5B-E PC. &nbsp;Says all OK.<br />
<br />
I then down loaded the latest version of the RST utility reistalled it and rebooted the PC as it requested and after the reboot it all worked fine.</span>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you for your help and the links to the Intel website. &nbsp;Though I had been there before your advice and links were most reassuring. &nbsp;Will postpone the move to Ubuntu a little bit longer.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Best regards...<br />
