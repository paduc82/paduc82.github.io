            Hey System Support.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />We received information this morning that this is a known issue in V.1803 which they are working on and will push out a fix soon. 
<br />
<br />If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />Until then if you want to go over all the possible fixes, here is what I have that normally will work - but in this case since it's a known issue with v.1803 you might want to wait for the fix:
<br />
<br />Please run the Recording Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Right click volume icon in System Tray, choose Playback Devices, find the microphone and set it as default.  If it isn't present run the Hardware troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>XBOX ONE tenure not updating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ievil imonkey  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX ONE tenure not updating</h2>
                    
<p>I have been sent here by xbox support as they cannot help me and said I will get the help I need here within 24hrs so here goes.</p>
<p>My tenure goes up by a year every 17th Sept and should be showing as 7 years now. After a lengthy delay my tenure now shows as 7 years on my xbox 360 (as shown in the pictures) both in the banner and in my acc section. The problem is that my xboxone still
 shows as 6 years. I was told by support that it would be fixed in 24-48hrs and at that time I should delete my acc, power down the console and then fire it back up after a few minutes and download my acc again but having done this and all the usual stuff it
 still shows as 6 years.</p>
<p>I was told that posting here will get this fixed.</p>
<p>I'm having trouble uploading the images to this post so here are the links to them on imgur that I presented to xbox support</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>This Tenure problem has been around for a long time. This problem can't really be, fixed. Eventually, it will correct itself, as what the Xbox Support Agent said to you. Though, this is in my theroy. You can wait for a Official responce if you feel like
 my answer doesn't agree with you.</p>
<p>Hopefully, it will be sorted out soon. Good luck!</p>

    <title>Windows XP Professional Microsoft .net framework unable to install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robert_stewart_15  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP Professional Microsoft .net framework unable to install</h2>
                    I &nbsp;have been unable to find any satisfaction from the online support Q&amp;A as my computer is unable to download any help programs because the .net framework have been removed by the cleaning tool and I have not been able to reinstall all the .net items required
 to function normally.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>I have&nbsp;not been able to resolve the present mess my computer is in after an unsuccessful attempt to uninstall Avast anti virus with the intention of replacing it with M-S Security Essentials.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Subsequent problems arose attempting to uninstall the remaining files and folders of Avast following use of the "Cleanup tool" which removed some of the .net framework installations and I have not been able to resolve things
 since.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I did succeed in installing the&nbsp;"M-S Security Essentials" anti virus program&nbsp;however; but there remains other issues resulting from not having the .net installations installed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Other problems include Internet Explorer failing to function and inability to access some links and Microsoft support downloads.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Some error messages are:</div>
<div>"Error 25007 .... Error: 0x80131700"</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;"To run this application, you must first install one of the following versions of the .Net Framework:v4.0.30319.&nbsp; .......)"</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please advise the steps I need to take to help recover normal operation and how this problem can be rectified.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am&nbsp;running Windows XP Professional&nbsp;SP3&nbsp;but am&nbsp;unable&nbsp;to download any updates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would appreciate your assistance as soon as possible if you are able.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Microsoft Windows section missing under Installed Updates</h2>
                    I am having a problem uninstalling some updates that were automatically installed by windows because the section that contains those updates in "Installed Updates" is just missing. Normally you would go to Control Panel &gt; Uninstall a Program &gt; View Installed
 Updates then you would see a list trees with updates in each section. The section for Microsoft Windows isn't there. I'm not skipping over it, it's just not there.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Example of not showing the section for Microsoft Windows:</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cd652cc5-3129-4580-8c89-d9abc234eeff" /></div>

&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running windows 7 on a domain environment. I am trying to uninstall IE11 update to revert back to IE9 (this was previously installed). My hunch is that this is a group policy setting somewhere, but haven't found anything pertaining to this yet.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Any help is appreciated.</div>

            Employer, but I am one of two admins for the company. This is actually happening to all the computers that I've checked, so I assume it's a systemic problem.
<div><br />
<div>I have been working on a new pc today that I needed to create an image for and noticed it isn't having the issue yet. However, a computer I recently imaged (Tuesday) is already having the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did gpupdate /force on the new pc without the issue, and it still is working fine. I'm starting to wonder if it may be a side effect of using sysprep on the machine before putting it into service. Once I'm done with this new pc image I will sysprep it
 and watch for any changes.</div>

<h2>            Long Running Script on Windows 10, Edge and IE11 and also PC freezes</h2>
                    <p>I KNOW this has been asked before but I have yet to find the final, absolute answer - if there is one. I tried to use search without Bing on both Edge and IE 11 and this error appears, some sites more often than others. At least with Windows 7, I could just
 clear the website and go elsewhere. Now, with Windows 10, the PC freezes and I have to Task manager and stop the internet from running and then re enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the gamut of changing check marks in Windows tools and I have not corrected this. This is very annoying and I am almost at the point of reverting back to Windows 7 which worked much better.<br />
</p>
<p>I have Bitdefender Total Security 16 and C Cleaner and other but nothing permanently cures this.</p>
<p>Thanks, John</p>

            <p>Hello Hektor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>We&nbsp;realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with Long script errors and system freeze in Windows 10.&nbsp;We will certainly help you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Does this issue occur with different browser apart from IE and&nbsp;Edge as well?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Have you installed all pending Windows updates?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We suggest you to check for any pending updates and install it. Also check the issue with different browser. Further follow the steps given below and check:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 1: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to run
<strong>System&nbsp;Maintenance troubleshooter </strong>and check. Please follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the search box on taskbar.<br />
b. Click <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the search results.<br />
c. Click "<strong>View all</strong>" and then click "</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">System&nbsp;Maintenance</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">".<br />
d. Click "<strong>Next</strong>" and follow on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2: </strong></span></span></p>
I would suggest you to perform a complete security scan to make sure that your computer is free from security threats. Make sure that the antivirus program you are using has the updated virus signatures installed.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You can also download the Microsoft Security scanner and run a security scan. You can download it from here:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is not a replacement for using an antivirus software program
 that provides ongoing protection.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></span></span></p>

 install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hey, guys! This setting is gone because it is now simply a part of the operating system, and cannot be turned off. Since this setting is only for when using Instant On and not while in Energy Mode, to have the games not Resume Quickly, you will simply need to change your console's power settings to Energy Mode. :)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Surface Pro heat issues can be due to several reasons. Heat build up may increase if you're using the device flat on a Surface since the chassis is part of the cooling system. Also, running programs that demand high CPU usage and using your Surface while
 plugged in may result to heat build up as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the fan kick off right after you power the Surface on, and has your device ever shut down due to heat? Also, did the issue emerge only after a recent update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Well the fan starts in almost 30 to 40 seconds while I start it. The most heated part is back of the upper right corner. It is unusual heating which was not happening earlier. The fan is always constantly on. I am not using an major CPU heavy apps except
 Photoshop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well it has not shut down due to its heating but it is not comfortable feeling at all. This has happened after and auto update of window 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also going to check with my vendor about the problem tomorrow.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This no longer happens</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am missing vital communication as Skype closes. Why can't it work like before - you close a conversation window and Skype still stays on.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 will not boot, black screen and blue screen&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>For no apparent reason everytime I now boot my laptop (Acer aspire)&nbsp;the bios loads, and I then get a black screen for 5-10 mins, usually it just hangs and I&nbsp;need to turn off via the power button. It then starts up fine. This now happens everytime I start
 my laptop, it was happening for the last couple of week infrequently,&nbsp;but has gotten worse. If I leave the machine a couple of things happen, I got a weird screen one time saying windows was "Checking Security Options", and then a blue screen, Or windows will
 eventually start and will freeze every couple of seconds so I need to restart anyway (also if this happens, the hard drive light is on constantly, but with&nbsp;no significant processes show in the task manager). The other thing that will happen is it goes straight
 to a blue screen saying something about shutting down because of security reasons. I have done a virus scan, a system restore and it still persists, and haven't installed anything recently. Any ideas why this would happen and how I can fix it? Other solutions
 on this site seem to refer to new upgrades&nbsp;of windows 7 with problems pertinent to graphics cards. I have had windows 7 working&nbsp;ok for 8 months now. I have an nVidia 9700M GT, and the driver version&nbsp;is 8.17.11.9716</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<h3> anciana malhumorada  say:</h3>
<h2>            Which of the many duplicates shown in File Manager that appear in Windows 10 may I safely delete&#63;</h2>
                    Since getting Windows 10, I find that the File Manager has many, many duplications.&nbsp; Under my user area there are two empty DOWNLOADS folders, an empty PICTURES folder, an empty MUSIC folder and an empty VIDEO folder - in addition to my own folders for
 the last three, with my pictures, music and videos in them.&nbsp; I had deleted these empty duplicates before, but they reappeared with the Anniversary update.&nbsp; Additionally, DOWNLOADS, MUSIC. PICTURES &amp; VIDEOS (the real ones) also appear immediately below the
 DESKTOP folder under the heading THIS PC.&nbsp; Fortunately, my C, D &amp; E drives only appear once, but my four of my five card drives appear as F, G, H &amp; I - as USB ports!&nbsp; They are NOT USB ports, they are card readers (and if I click on one, I will be prompted
 to insert a CARD not a USB device).&nbsp; After the first listing of F, G, H, &amp; I (why only four?&nbsp; there are five card drives...) the LIBRARIES appear and pretty much duplicate PICTURES, MUSIC &amp; VIDEOS.&nbsp; And there is a new library which has an empty folder in it
 - CAMERAROLL. &nbsp; Below the LIBRARIES, the four "USB Drives" F, G, H &amp; I appear again above NETWORK, HOMEGROUP &amp; RECYCLE bin.&nbsp; This makes for a really humonguous file manager window.&nbsp; Oh, and the RECYCLE bin is not where it is shown; for some reason, since the
 anniversary update, it is on the D drive.&nbsp; If I start deleting the empty items, will they keep coming back?&nbsp; What happens if I delete the duplicate letters assigned to the card drives?&nbsp; How can I eliminate the duplicate listings of things like MUSIC, PICTURES,
 etc.&nbsp; Getting rid of some of this clutter would be an immense help and time-saver.&nbsp; Thanks for any help you can offer!<br />

            <p>Hi Anciana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To better assist you regarding your concern, we would like to ask some questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Where do you see the duplicated folders?</li><li>Have you tried deleting it again? If so, what happened? If not, kindly delete it and check if the issue persists. Before doing so, kindly back up first your folders.</li><li>Have you tried restoring the location settings to default?</li></ul>
<p><br />
If not, kindly do so. It seems that the reason why it is being duplicate is that there is an existing shortcut created. To restore it to default, kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>File</strong> <strong>Explorer</strong></li><li>Click <strong>This</strong> <strong>PC</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Local</strong> <strong>Disk</strong> <strong>(C:)</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Users</strong></li><li>Click your <strong>Username</strong></li><li>Right-click the folder that is being duplicate (ex. <strong>Pictures</strong>)</li><li>Click <strong>Properties</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Location</strong> tab</li><li>Click <strong>Restore</strong> <strong>Default</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> and then, <strong>OK</strong><br />
</li></ol>
<p>Do the same steps with other folders that are being duplicate. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For your concern regarding your card drivers that appears as USB ports, updating your card drivers can help you resolve your concern. To do so, follow the steps below:</p>

            <p>Umm, no screenshot as that would show a bit more of my identity than I wish to post in a public forum</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp; I undertook to re-organize and cleanup some of this mess. Why does Microsoft think it needs to create folders for me (I can do this, it is easy!). The reasoning behind the naming and placement of the folders they create eludes me.&nbsp; PICTURES
 does not mean the same thing to an artist that it means to Microsoft.&nbsp; Must I have two listings of my USER folders (one up top and one under USERS)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have removed, one by one, most carefully, all the empty duplicate folders.&nbsp; This made things a lot neater.&nbsp; Now I am puzzling over what appear to be multiple short-cuts, to My Documents, for instance.&nbsp; Because I never could find my purchased e-books
 when I wanted them, I (long ago) renamed the DOCUMENTS (under my USER folder), so I suppose these shortcuts have nowhere to go. These shortcuts&nbsp; first appeared in Windows 10.&nbsp; When I click on them, I get the "Access denied" message.&nbsp; Why are they there then,
 and why so many?&nbsp; I will attempt to delete these, again, one by one and very carefully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the Device Manager and proceeded to attempt to update the drivers for my card slots.&nbsp; Windows tells me that the drivers (all five) are up-to-date, and though the device manager lists these as disk drives (closer to "card reader" than USB, I
 guess), they still show up in the File Explorer as USB drives, again, twice.&nbsp; Once right below my D drive (CD/DVD) and again below Libraries. Isn't there a facility for assigning drive letters? &nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About Libraries.&nbsp; I would like to trash them, too.&nbsp; They appear at the tail end of the list (above the second listing of four of my card slots) and right above Network, Homegroup and Recycle Bin.&nbsp; I used to find them quite useful when they were high
 in the list, but now they just waste space --- and I cannot find any instructions for dealing with them anymore!</p>

            Hi Nancy -
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstall WIndows but sheds corrupting factory bloatware, saving your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You may follow these methods:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Let's update the Direct X and check.</strong> <br />
The latest version of DirectX is available for free download.<br />
Here is a link to download the DirectX:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=2DA43D38-DB71-4C1B-BC6A-9B6652CD92A3&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=2DA43D38-DB71-4C1B-BC6A-9B6652CD92A3&amp;displaylang=en</a>
</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Also I would suggest you to update the chipset drivers and check. You may contact the computer manufacturer for the drivers.<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 10 takes a really long time to boot up. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andy.ayun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 takes a really long time to boot up.</h2>
                    <p>I know there have been similar questions that has already been asked but i just can't seem to find a solution for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had Windows 10 for quite a while now and it always loads within minutes but a few days ago when I booted up my computer it took a few hours to boot. I have dual boot with windows 7 but I really don't think it's the problem. My machine starts up normally
 until i get to the dual boot manager screen. I select Windows 10 and then a blue screen comes up (not the BSOD) with the loading pattern thing (You know the circle thing that spins around with many circles following it). It stays on that screen up to three
 hours. Then it finally boots and i'm greeted with the login screen. I have a simple Pin set up for login but it appears to have disappeared and now i have to type my full length Microsoft password each time to log in. Of cause I thought I only have to go to
 settings to fix that one particular problem but I also find that the 'Sign-in options' doesn't stop loading. I can access 'Your account' 'Work access' and basically everything under 'accounts' in settings except for&nbsp;'Sign-in options'. I also think its worth
 mentioning that logging on takes the same amount of time it always has and my computer runs normal after the login screen.</p>
<p>I haven't tried going into windows 7 get because I really don't want to wait 3 hours to load 10 back (assuming 7 isn't affected. If it is then i'll probably have to wait SIX hours (that's right I typed the number six for the sole purpose of 'shouting' it)).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.<br />

            <p>Hi, Thanks for your reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have only run a full scan with Windows Defender and Malwarebytes as by the time my computer boots I don't have time to chase down the problem have have to get straight to work. I will run any Troubleshooting steps you recommend</p>
<p>2. I didn't make any system changes that I can remember. I have edited the hosts file in C: drive but unfortunately I can't remember whether I did it before or after the problem started. I should also mention that in order to edit the hosts file i had to
 change some permissions to '<em>C:Windows</em>'</p>
<p>3. No the option isn't greyed out. I click it and it starts loading (the dots following each other just under the title) but it stays like that and never loads (never as in 30min, i didn't wait any longer). I think I should note again that all the other
 options like 'Your account' and 'Work Access' all load fine.</p>
<p>4. No I do not get any error messages when booting into Windows 10 but I think I should mention that every time I load Windows 7 it runs a NTFS check and after it completes it, it restarts my computer. After choosing Windows 7 again it runs the NTFS check
 again. Only when I abort the check I load into Windows 7 with no issues at the correct time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume the troubleshooter will need to be run on Windows 10 obviously so I will load 10 after I post this (and wait 2-3 hours) then run all the troubleshooting options i can think of including the link you provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I see you included a 'Reference' to a 'troubleshoot &nbsp;blue screen errors'. You might have just included it as a friendly tip but if not I don't get any BSOD or blue screen errors. Its just a normal Windows 10 Loading screen with nothing but the blue
 screen and the loading animation in the middle of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be unrelated but in the permission properties of a folder or file, there are 2 administrators and 2 of 'User' (I think). I don't just mean there are 2 administrators because there is only one account on Windows 10. There are two
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>&lt;USERNAME&gt;/ADMINISTRATORS</strong></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for that reference link, I understand that you had mentioned that it was not a blue screen issue rather&nbsp;it was the Windows 10 startup loading screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still face the same&nbsp;issue after trying the suggestion given in my earlier post.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may run the SFC and DISM by following the below link and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>SFC: System File Checker</span> is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>DISM: It detects incorrect manifests, cabinets or registry data, it may replace the incorrect data with corrected version available.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue still persist after performing SFC and DISM, I suggest you to run Startup repair from Advance boot option.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It may ask you to insert the Installation DVD/USB while doing startup repair.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You have to create an installation media for that.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may download an ISO from the below link:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once your media is ready follow the steps.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>After you boot your computer using Windows 10 CD/ DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD". Press any key.</span></p>

</p><p>I understand your concern about DVD/CD player drive&nbsp;in Windows 10.</p>
