<h2>            Cannot open Access files created in Microsoft Works on Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>I have been using Microsoft Works for years without a problem. A Windows 10 update removed MS Works. I had to subscribe to Office 365. Now I cannot open my files created on MS Works.</p>

<p>Hi Marc,</p>
<p><br />
Please check whether Access is included in your new Office 365 suite. If so, the Works database can be opened by importing to Microsoft Access. Here’s an

                    <p>I just upgraded from Tech Preview 9879 to 9926 and Netflix stopped working. Netflix said its a compatibility issue. I can use any browser and get into Netflix click on a show and I get the Netflix Instant &nbsp;Watching Compatibility page,

<h2>            Pc power speed - is it a virus&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am not sure about pc power plus and i wanted to stop it coming up on boot. With this in mind i ran windows defender to disable the service rather than add/remove programs. Windows defender will not start and comes up with a hex address and a failure to
 start message.</p>
<p>are the 2 things related ?</p>

<h2>            SAPGUI for Java on Windows 10 after installing Java 8 version 66 does not display Start Screen when ICON is initiated</h2>
                    I have installed Java 8 version 66 on Windows 10 and since installing the Java 8 version 66 stopped working.my SAPGUI for Java 7.47rev4 has stopped working. On initiating the ICON for SAPGUI for Java the 1st flash screen appears and immediately is dropped
 and the&nbsp;SAP Logon Screen does not appear. The SAPGUI for Java used to work on the previous Java version. I have re-implemented both Java 8 version 66 and the SAPGUI for Java 7.40rev4 a number of times without any success. What can I do?. How do I get back
 to the old version of Java or are there any other solutions.

<p><span>Now what I need to do is warn the user someway (new worksheet report??, using conditional formatting?? Gantt Chart??) that there are
 missing days where the car is off hire - between entries 1 and 2 from 13 Jan 12 to 24 Jan 12 - which need to be recorded and that there has been entered an overlapping period between 10 Jan 12 and 12 Jan 12 (Entries 1 and 3) - in other words we are double
 counting for 2 days.</span></p>

            <blockquote>Yes I have tried this and it works but it is not what I am looking for. Perhaps I have not made myself clear the way my initial question was placed.
<div><br />
<div>The user enters the Car Reg No, the Start Date and the End Date in a table.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If he&nbsp;inadvertently 50 rows down for the same car he enters overlapping days this will mean that there will be double counting for the days the car was rented. This overlapping needs to be highlighted so that he can correct the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If at the same time the dates that he enters&nbsp;are not continuous so that Off Hire days are also recorded as an item this needs to be highlighted as well.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this&nbsp;clarifies&nbsp;my whole problem . I do not think it is an easy one to solve.<br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
</blockquote>
<br />
The first "If" above I think the proposed Conditional formatting formulas take care of. Do you agree?<br />
<br />
<b>The second "If" above I am not sure that I understand. Please explain a bit further what you mean by "Off Hire days are also recorded as an item".<br />
</b><br />
I think the proposed formulas take care of "gaps" as well as "overlaps" in the dates per car ID.<br />
<br />
With the dates in your example the following four dates will be highlighted:<br />
<br />
<b>2012-01-12 (in cell D2)</b> because this is not the latest end date and there is no start date at 2012-01-13 for the car ABC 1234 (there is an overlap here)<br />
<br />
<b>2012-01-25 (in cell C3)</b> because this is not the earliest start date and there is no end date at 2012-01-24 for the car ABC 1234 (there is a gap here)<br />
<br />
<b>2012-01-10 (in cell C4)</b> because this is not the earliest start date and there is no end date at 2012-01-09 for the car ABC 1234 (same overlap as described above)<br />
<br />
<b>2012-01-15 (in cell D4)</b> because this is not the latest end date and there is no start date at 2012-01-16 (same gap as described above).<br />
<br />
Are there any of these dates that should not be highlighted?<br />
Are there any other dates in your example that should be highlighted?<br />
<br />
Highlighted dates indicate possible errors and it is among these highlighted dates that some correction is needed.<br />
<br />
By changing e.g. the highlighted 2012-01-10 in cell C4 to 2012-01-13, the highlighting of both cell D2 (2012-01-12) and cell C4&nbsp; will disappear since these two dates now fit.<br />
Similarly, by changing either (or both) of the highlighted cells D4 (2012-01-15) or C3 (2012-01-25) to make the date in C3 to be one day after the date in D4, the highlighting of these two cells will disappear as well.<br />

    <title>Continual issue with Visio error 128 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Continual issue with Visio error 128</h2>
                    Hi All,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a user who has a fresh install of win 7 64-bit. With the original deployment we deployed Visio 2010 pro 32-bit. Within 3 weeks the user started getting continual errors of 128 and unable to save. The user was very agitated because the issue would
 not occur until she would want to save all the work she had completed. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling from both our network ISO and from the physical CD. The user hasent had any issues with any other programs other than Visio. The error happens
 almost every time she creates or opens a diagram no matter the version or what it is saved as. If anything I guess the next step would be to reimage the PC just wanted to know if anyone had this issue or a fix before I do this to our new HR director.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi patton456,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get the 128 error once in a while when saving a file.&nbsp; Most of the time there is no problem.&nbsp; I have not noticed a pattern for the times that I get the error.&nbsp; I'll just be doing ordinary editing of a file that has been fine for a long time, and then poof!
 the file cannot be saved and I get the error 128. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you heard from anyone about how to prevent this from happening?</p>
<p>I'm using Visio Premium 2010, Version 14.0.6023.1000 (64-bit), on Windows 7.&nbsp; I usually work on the files located on a network share.&nbsp; I wonder if it is safer to work locally and then copy files to the share.&nbsp; The problem is extremely annoying, especially
 when the file has several complex drawings on multiple pages.</p>

 currupts the file. poof all gone. &nbsp;Says you can get the hidden file in the directory but its also currupt. &nbsp;Microsoft fix this ASAP

            I have agree. There has to be fix for this error. I have very large org charts and recreating them because you believe the file is corrupted is very time consuming. I&nbsp; even had the software removed and reinstalled thinking that might fix the problem. No.
 This&nbsp;error&nbsp;persist and it very annoying. It causing me to be late on my deliverables. Please fix.

<p>Hi, honkou. Welcome to our community forum.&nbsp;Can you give us more information about your concern? When you say you can't use the Facebook app, are there any error messages when you try to use it? Have you tried switching connections between cellular data
 and Wlan connection? You may try these steps and let us know the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll be waiting for your reply.:)&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your issue with accessing Microsoft Edge on your phone, were you able to make changes on your phone (like updating the phone) prior to this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend that you soft reset your phone by pressing the Power and Volume down button for about 15 seconds. Release your hold once you feel that the phone vibrates. Afterwards, the phone would automatically restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as the phone completes restarting, try opening your Edge and check if it would work this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Message us back once you were able to do this.</p>

<h2>            Turning on proximity sensor slows down the connecting of a call on XL</h2>
                    Hi guys...<br />
I use Nokia XL. When I try calling someone, it takes 'too much' time for the call to connect when the proximity sensor or the loudspeaker is on. But if I simply hold the phone without turning on the loudspeaker or without using the proximity sensor while calling,
 the call connects instantly. When in hurry, this problem just kills me. Please help...

<p>For clarification,&nbsp;<span>the touch screen is disabled automatically during calls when you place the device next to your ear. However, if you move your phone away from your ear, the proximity sensor will also detect it which will turn on the touch screen
 on the phone for you to be able to key in your selections (in your case, you have activated the loudspeaker). The antenna of your Nokia XL is located below the speaker of your phone. While on loudspeaker, it generates some vibration and this might affect your
 antenna thus, disrupting the your call to be connected immediately. If decreasing the volume will not make any changes, I can suggest that you try to reset your phone first or check for updates. Otherwise, you may have to bring your phone to the nearest Nokia
 Care Point in your area for a thorough assessment.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Non of those tips could solve the problem.. It still takes so much time for a call to be connected. I went to a Nokia care with this problem., they rejected me saying that there should be a problem with the operator.. But I use the same operator (i.e.
 Aircel) on my lumia. And it forwards the call instantly.. Please help me.. This is the worst problem when in hurry.. Even sometimes the call connects after 2-3 attempts, each holding for at least 1 minute and getting finished in vain..<br />

 a call. It seems that this is a completely new account. Please can anyone help and explain how I can access my old account/contacts and credit.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Dragon 5 for Mac and Word 2016 problem</h2>
                    <p>I have Dragon 5.05 for Mac and have the Word 2016. And it is driving me nuts that Dragon will hop all over the place in my Word 2016 document. I start writing and then it just jumps to a different paragraph highlights and when I talk it overwrites the paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I switch to Word 2011 and no problem. So what is it with Word 2016 and Dragon 5 not playing well together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any settings I can switch?</p>

<h2>            SharePoint list</h2>
                    <p>I'm using SharePoint list as a Tableau data source.&nbsp; Everything has been fine until I met this unusual list data. This list data is a data table style and can be pulled from Tableau desktop. But it does return null and delete all the existing data when pulled
 from the Tableau server.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I traced this data to the SharePoint with the explorer and found out that the list data folder was empty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary</p>
<p>- I can see the list data when I access with the browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I can pull the data from Tableau desktop by selecting the list name</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I can't pull the data from Server (return the null data)</p>
<p>- I can't see the list data when I access with the File Explorer.</p>

<h2>            Developer checkBox greyed out in Excel Preferences</h2>
                    <p>I have 20 students, half of which downloaded the student version of excel before I realized that the developer feature was not accessible in the student version. The other half downloaded the full version from office.com after we changed the setting and
 gave them access to the full version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The students who never downloaded the student version and downloaded the full version have full access. All of my students have the same setting on office.com. Yet, when I try to switch the students who downloaded the student version first the ribbon menu
 is greyed out. To be clear I am on a Mac and I go to Excel --&gt;Preferences --&gt; Ribbon &amp; Toolbar and all of that screen is greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried doing the updates, </p>
<p>as well as Removing Office (including the com.micrsoft files in the library) restarting and reinstalling direct from the web and it still stays greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need my students to have access to the developer feature as I teach them VBA in excel.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for replying. I think that worked, (still need to check with a student laptop, but this looks promising). I was able to turn the developer tab on and off, however, the Ribbon and Toolbar option screen is still completely greyed out like in my earlier
 pic? It is odd because this issue is only with students who installed the student version first, anyone who downloaded direct from office.com and installed the full version sees that screen normally (and every student has the same office settings).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            The administrator of your school's IT department can turn certain features on and off in their configuration files. You might want to contact your IT department and explain to them that they should not turn this feature off. I am pretty sure they can control
 this setting, but I am not 100% sure.

<h2>            Fresh Start on Windows Insider Program</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought a new tablet for travel/work (the work part being to use it to remote desktop into my actual workhorse computers). I just updated to the new fast track edition and I generally like to start fresh (i.e. get the manufacturer stuff hiding in the
 background off the computer). This being an Atom processor, every little bit counts. It also makes sense to do so now before I start installing everything and have to do it over again. Before I do so though, it took A LONG TIME (again, Atom processor) to get
 to this point of having the latest Fast build installed- if I opt to do a fresh start with a clean install of Windows (from the built in settings/Windows Defender options), will I keep the Fast build or will it put me on the regular release version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
When it comes to performing a clean install, your computer goes back to whatever pre-installed operating system you have. Therefore, you need to download
<strong>Windows Insider Preview</strong> again after the said process. You may check on this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows Insider Preview Downloads">
<strong>link</strong></a> for more information about the download.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance and we will be glad to help.<br />

<br />You mean to say that you want to change sheet names to some random number and then sort the sheets as per their names from largest to smallest number.

            Ciao Gretchen, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, it's not clear at me your goal. If you want to randomize a list, you can create another field in the list (that can be hidden afterwards) with RAND() function, then sort the list by the hidden fiels (so it will be randomly sorted). Then you can sort it again by your relevant field.

            Hello Gretchen. Here is a 30-second video I just made on Randbetween. Randbetween will keep changing numbers so you have to copy and paste values which is shown in the short video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjqWy3Os_kU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjqWy3Os_kU</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/hjqWy3Os_kU?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/hjqWy3Os_kU?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>

            Create a simple as possible scenario, column A as 3 numbers, column B random number, generate by this formula and as shown in the screenshot below:
<br />
<br />B2:  =RAND()
<br />
<br />If you sort the data on column B in ZA order, the result is that column A becomes 2,1,3 which is correct.
<br />
<br />But a sort forces Excel to recalculate the formulas in column B, therefore you get new random numbers. That can be irritating.

<h2>            transfer multiple email accounts to new computer</h2>
                    My laptop went into a continuous re-booting mode after a windows update today. It finally let me into safe mode (after about a dozen tries). It will not load outlook (starts to open, but&nbsp;closes after giving a message abouit not being able to validate),
 so I&nbsp;copied the outlook data file from the 'users/././. etc.' directory, and moved it to another laptop. It has all the emails, but does not have any accounts or address book loaded. I had to enter the information on one account to get going, but I have over
 30 email accounts (personal and business) and I don't want to have to re-enter all those POP3 accounts again unless I absolutely have to (took me several hours last time something like this happened). Is there a place where windows stores the information on
 the accounts (and can I copy it and get it to work on the other laptop? Thanks....

            <p>System restore is the best bet - you can't move accounts to a new computer, you need to recreate the accounts. The account info is stored in the registry, but it uses GUID and file paths unique to each computer and exporting the keys to use on another computer
 doesn't work well. </p>
<p>Address book is just a view of the Contacts. Right click on contacts, choose properties and verify it is enabled as an address book.

            Have you checked to make sure the Lumia 520 you got is compatible with the frequencies/bands your carrier uses? I learned that there are different editions of the 520 with different supported bands.

            <p>Thanks for answering. So can you plz guide me how I will be able to know which frequency is supported by my Lumia 520 and my carrier ?
</p>
<p>while I had tried the field menu (##3282#) but unfortunately It also didn't work for me ☹ when I select the 3g only mode it gives no service message.</p>

<p>Rm-917 running on Cyan OS. Currently I am in Pakistan, and Denim update is available for Lumia 520 but not for my phone.

<p>
</p><p>Can you provide me the way to set up to 3g? </p>

THIS</a> page, Denim is not available for this handset and after such a long time it is quite safe to assume that it will not become available, as T-Mobile US have lost any interest in supporting further this model</p>

THIS</a> page, the Lumia 521 has NO hardware support for 3G services, therefore no software updates will make any difference - you CANNOT have 3G on this handset.</p>

            AOL supports POP and IMAP, but not Exchange ActiveSync or Exchange Server, so you'd be able to sync email and folders (using IMAP), but not Contacts or Calendar.&nbsp;

Thanks, Palcouk. I'm getting a little confused with this issue. I'm amazed that Microsoft doesn't have a straightforward way of syncing between major MS software and a Microsoft Windows phone...

<h2>            Excel 2007 Pivot Table &#34;drill down&#34; &#40;double-click&#41;on individual cell brings up all records for the group and not these individual records</h2>
                    
<p>I have created a pivot table where there are several markets with status for each market.&nbsp; When I double-click on a status cell (example: Northeast, Complete "2"), I don't get just those 2 data points, but all 100 data points for that market.&nbsp; Is there something
 about how I may have set up my raw data?&nbsp; I had to use a formula in the raw data to determine if a site is complete.&nbsp; Will it display everthing&nbsp;because the "complete" data has a formula for each site?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Try putting a copy of the Complete field in the Row Labels area as well as the Values area.&nbsp; Then double click the 2.</p>
<p>I'm not sure of what your data looks like, but if there are 100 rows in the Northeast region then double-clicking the 2 in your original example probably brings back 100 records all the records that contribute to the line of data even if they have nothing
 in the Complete field.</p>

    <title>Powerpoint section zoom&#58; Automation options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> venkr00  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint section zoom&#58; Automation options</h2>
                    <p>Section zoom seems to be a great feature. However, I think that the necessity to use the mouse pointer to click on a section preview seems quite prone to failure. Especially when making a presentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is as follows, if I make a slide with say 3 section zooms, can I automate the navigation behavior? For example can I configure that once I am in this summary page, the first right arrow, or mouse click will take me to a specific section (and
 show all slides within it), return to the overview again. Now the 2nd mouse click should go the another pre-configured chapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi venkr00,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, we suggest you insert section zoom into the slide according to your own needs. Then when you click the
<strong>Slide Show</strong>, you can automate the navigation behavior by right-click.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you can click the section zoom which you want directly, this also can meet your request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to know more about the function, please refer to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-zoom-for-powerpoint-to-bring-your-presentation-to-life-9d6c58cd-2125-4d29-86b1-0097c7dc47d7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Why does sharepoint search sometimes NOT show filename&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use the sharepoint search feature, most often the title of the file displayed is NOT the name of the file. Sometimes it is, sometimes it is a header from the document, and sometimes it seems to be the last word added?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All a bit confusing. Can anyone explain how this works and is it possible to ensure search returns file names as titles?</p>

            <p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Search Results Web Part uses a query that is specified in the Web Part to show search results. By default, this query uses the query variable {searchboxquery}. The query variable is a placeholder for a value, which means that when you run the query,
 a value replaces the placeholder.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>W</span><span>hen </span><span>you type</span><span style="font-weight: bold"> logins &amp; passwords</span><span> in the Search Box, the {searchboxquery} variable in the Search Results Web Part searches for all items that contain
 the phrase </span><span>login &amp; passwords. So you can try typing </span><span style="font-weight: bold">title : logins &amp; passwords</span><span> or
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">"logins &amp; passwords"</span><span> to check the outcome.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an example for your reference.</p>
<p>When I type<span style="font-weight: bold"> PowerShell</span>, the result is as follows.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c160eedb-63d2-452d-9f97-70a400478a43" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c160eedb-63d2-452d-9f97-70a400478a43" /></a><br />

<p>
</p><p>When I type <span style="font-weight: bold">title : PowerShell</span>, the result is as follows:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, you can click the gear on the upper right corner of the page you provided -&gt; edit page -&gt; edit search result webpart -&gt; change query -&gt; edit your query text as below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dcc3110a-6951-4dfd-99e7-477940c477a7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dcc3110a-6951-4dfd-99e7-477940c477a7" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this time, if I type PowerShell, the result is as below:</p>

            <p>Hi Sky</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the information. But my main question was why the title of the document (result) that is returned in the search results is not the FILENAME.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I search for "certificates". There is a word document called "Bob certificate". But the result returned by sharepoint is titled "May" which is a word in the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would expect the title returned by sharepoint to be the filename. Or perhaps the search string. But it seems to return a mix of titles. Sometimes the filename, sometimes a title in the document (not related to the search string at all) and sometimes it
 seems to use the last word added to the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your screenshots it seems to work fine, but not in my tests. For example, it would be as if you searched for "powershell" and you had a word doc called "powershell.doc" but the title returned in the search results was "February" because that happened
 to be a header in your word doc.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have done a test based on your description and the following methods delivered in my first post work. Please see below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method1: Type <span style="font-weight: bold">title : filename</span> in the search box.
</p>
<p>For example, if I search PowerShell, it returns three results including February

            <p>Hi Sky</p>
<p>
</p><p>But why is it returning "February" in your example? You searched for powershell, why does it not return FILENAME? What is the relevance? I assume February is just one word in the file? But NOT the word you searched for.</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real file name of the Word document is
February</span> into it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can add different headers into Word. I select the third header as below and set the value of the header(document title) as February, then upload the document to SharePoint.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82d397a4-8074-4fb7-a0f8-1c8d753e0dd9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82d397a4-8074-4fb7-a0f8-1c8d753e0dd9" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we check the properties of this document, we can find the value February in the title column.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc3d27c5-f37b-45c9-8d4f-3aea774a10e1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc3d27c5-f37b-45c9-8d4f-3aea774a10e1" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as there is value in the title column, the search result of the document will use the value of the title column first. If there is no value, it will then display file name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check it on your side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sky </p>

            <p>Hi Sky</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is automatic metadata from the word document. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>How does SP decide which value to use as title? Any header? The highest level one?</li><li>Can we set the title in Word or only in SP list? IF we want to edit it. I prefer titles are normally the name of the document, not a header decided by SP.</li><li>What other data can SP list get from word? Can we map other text blocks to SP? e.g. other headers or styles?</li><li>Can we make title default to filename?</li></ol>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not Any header. Please see the screenshot of my third post, I insert the third header which has a [Document Title] in it. It matches the title column in SharePoint Online. So if you give a value to
 the third header of the document and upload it, you can also find the value in the title column in SharePoint Online. The search result of the title will return the value of the title column prior to the name column. It is by design.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, if you use the first and second header in Word, the value of the header will not render in the title column in SharePoint Online. So search result of the document will return the name of
 the Word file, as there is no value in the title column. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Text blocks are not mapped to SharePoint Online. In this case, it is the Word Properties [Document title] mapped to the title column in SharePoint Online.
<a href="http://www.denisstadler.com/sharepoint-2013/tips-for-ecm-in-sharepoint-2013-from-word-properties-to-sharepoint-columns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
This article</a> introduces some Word Properties which can map to SharePoint Online column. You can have a look.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you set the value of the title column as none or as same as the value in name column. The search result will return filename as title.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case, I would suggest you do a test on your side using different headers to see the behavior. (e.g. the first header and the third header)</p>

            <p>Hi Sky</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have some docs where the title field in sharepoint is coming from a normal text field. It is NOT a header title. Just normal text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I cant see a way of displaying the <strong>title field in a browser in a OD library</strong>. It is in a OD library shared with me, and even on old UI I cant change the view to see this field in the browser, so I have no way to edit it in browser view
 or in the document itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only workaround I can see is making a new title in the document and using that instead, but it is surely a bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The incorrect title is only displayed in the "shared with me" view in browser, not the direct library view. See below. File name is logins and passwords. There is no title in this document.</p>
