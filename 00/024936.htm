    <title>Windows Defender is highly intrusive, and very unhelpful. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Defender is highly intrusive, and  very unhelpful.</h2>
                    <strong>I didn't buy a copy of windows expecting not to be spied on, that would be unrealistic.</strong> With that out of the way, almost everything about this OS is fairly good, except that my downloads are constantly deleted.<br />
<br />
<strong>Please allow users to opt out of windows defender, but don't make it require a sign-up process!<br />
<br />
</strong>I recently got a lot of Malware on my computer by quite honestly being an idiot and clicking the wrong link, though I rarely have this sort of issue,<br />
other people who are not as tech-savvy may do this more often than not. Thus the reason windows defender was there (and did not help at all).<br />
A few days later, after resolving that mess. I went to download some Pen-Testing tools (yes, I have other machines with Linux on them, but I wanted to experiment on Windows for once)<br />
<strong>Download Failed...</strong> So, I turned defender "off"&nbsp;<strong>Download Failed... Again.</strong><strong><br />
</strong>I was shocked, Defender had blocked a familiar application I was trying to install, but would not block the real Malware, seriously Microsoft?So unless I modify the registry (which likely won't be an option come the next update) Brutus,
 a web-based password cracker, and other tools of similar nature, are utterly useless on this OS. Even after a successful download, Defender likes to delete my newly acquired files as soon as they are on the disk.<br />
<br />
<strong>I have seen many posts like this in the past, all I am hoping for is that our voices are heard.</strong>

<p>Hacking tools have been suppressed by Microsoft security applications since the very first versions became available around 2006.&nbsp; I know because I was using these in a professional capacity at that time and often had to work around or disable the detections
 for these tools at the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Microsoft security applications are provided free with Windows 10, 8 and for download&nbsp;with earlier Windows versions, these are assumed to be used mostly by consumers or in businesses where the use of such tools would be considered against policy.&nbsp;
 For that reason, I'd never expect the Microsoft security applications to stop detecting this type of potential malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can wish and spend the time making requests via feedback and other methods, but I personally prefer to examine the reality behind such decisions and use simple logic to decide whether such a change might make sense to Microsoft and so ever receive&nbsp;serious
 consideration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This situation is obviously nonsensical from the point of view of Microsoft and most of its customers, so I wouldn't bother to waste my time or effort, instead looking for a more potentially valid&nbsp;solution such as choosing a different commercial security
 application that is designed to be more&nbsp;configurable.&nbsp; This is what any commercial security services organization using such tools would expect to be required to do and so the only truly viable solution for individuals wishing to use these&nbsp;tools as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note, from your description I suspect that the blocked downloads were actually the result of monitoring by the SmartScreen filtering application embedded within the current web browsers and now also Windows itself.&nbsp; Since this monitoring often
 hands off the malware detection process to Windows Defender, it can appear from the notifications that Defender real-time protection is involved, when in truth it's actually SmartScreen performing that part of the process.</p>

<p>I appreciate the detailed answer, as further input, I will add this.<br />
I don't know as it is possible to completely disable Smart-screen, and as a person who needs "cracked" installers to modify certain single player games, irregardless of them being legally purchased or not, it does get in the way at times. Although I don't like
 the idea of piracy myself, sometimes these cracks just work better, so long as one takes their time to do research and commit to proper configuration.<br />
<br />
An example would be "TESV - Skyrim", I could hardly work with the original steam version for mods and third-party addons, but switching to a cracked version could very well spell issues later. this is bad from a gaming perspective as well as anything else.</p>
<p><br />
Seems to me Microsoft is prohibiting users from their own better judgement. For business environments, there are administrators that are meant to do this job, but in this case it is being done for them. This is in no means a professional way to do things.<br />
It is a double edged sword, as doing it for them creates a more "standardized" involvement, but telling the admins who bought the software in the first place to do it themselves would be a bad choice, most just don't have that time, or money.<br />
So, back to what I have suggested, If the customer is bound to do it themselves, then why not release all legalities in the Terms and such? Let the user decide what they do with their machine.</p>

<p>That's a perfect&nbsp;example of one small portion of Microsoft's dilemma, which as the malware and other attacks have become more vicious and global in scope, the default&nbsp;security settings including those within Windows Defender have consistently tightened in
 order to try and aid the typical consumer&nbsp;user more as time has passed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first started helping with the Windows Live OneCare product in 2005-6, the configurability of such items was more available and liberal by default, giving the user more control over the situation.&nbsp; However, as time went on, the mistakes that consumers
 often made taught Microsoft that they needed to remove or restrict many of these settings, since it was clear that no matter how simple they seemed to be some number would still manage to misunderstand their purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add to that situation the use of application cracks and other technically illegal choices, many of which often contain malware as well and there was little reason left for Microsoft to hold back in their efforts to protect the consumer from himself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's exactly why I suggested the option of choosing a 3rd-party security&nbsp;application, since even with the free versions of these, the additional configuration options these provide can often allow a workaround to some of these less easily justified situations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the fact that Microsoft's security apps are intended for the use of family's often including children, their choices must be designed to best protect even these less&nbsp;aware users, so this is another reason I'd never expect to see these general trends
 change significantly.&nbsp; Yes this makes it appear that all users are being handled like children, but as a long-time helper in these forums I can state this appears to more skilled&nbsp;users to be appropriate in many cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My point is that Microsoft isn't prohibiting anyone from making other choices, they simply aren't always available within the free security product included within Windows and instead require the use of either a free or paid 3rd-party option.&nbsp; Since the
 abuse of what Microsoft and many other commercial software providers feel is legally appropriate use of their software is involved, this seems completely fair to me and many others in the wider community, so you aren't likely to find a lot of sympathy for
 the illegal or questionable use of such software regardless if that software itself is truly at fault.&nbsp; From my own standpoint, I'd avoid such shoddily designed software from the start, since this is typically filled with the types of vulnerabilities which
 can be used by attackers to infiltrate a system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what the future for such games running on Windows might be, since the obvious direction that Windows 10 is now taking is towards the leaner Windows Core, which will remove the legacy API sets that include the vulnerabilities most often abused
 by malware.&nbsp; Once this occurs, the only remaining ability to run such code will either be within an emulator or using one of the older legacy Windows versions, either of which will likely have a lifecycle&nbsp;that will eventually come to an end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless the developers of these games take the effort to port to the newer Windows platform, there may be an end date to their lifecycle.&nbsp; I can't say how difficult that might be, but it's what I've seen coming ever since the fast development environment
 of Windows 10 first became available.&nbsp; I just don't think&nbsp;some number of developers really get what's actually going on.</p>

            I think what he's asking is exactly what i'm wondering... &nbsp;When you use any email service you have to add an opt out link that people can click to opt out of future emails. &nbsp;I have used several email services in the past that automatically put that link
 at the end of your template, but with outlook there is not one, nether is there a merger field that enables you to add an opt out link... &nbsp;I know how to add hyperlinks, but i need outlook to provide me with an option to place an opt out option in my mass emails
 that i send out, is there a way to do that using outlook 2013?

    <title>Cannot upgrade to build 10240 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jevangil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot upgrade to build 10240</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: I, as well, cannot upgrade to build 10240 </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to start off, my system is a Surface Pro 3 i5 with 256 GB storage. I am enrolled in the windows insider program and my computer is signed in using the same Microsoft account that I used to enroll. I am not part of a domain, if that matters, and everything
 seems to be working on the system. I am currently running Windows 10 TP build 10162 and it is activated. I have seen some errors in the store app, but beside that, the system seems okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After looking through the forums here, I have not found a definitive answer other than reinstalling Windows 8.1. Let me explain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been in the insider program for a while now. I started downloading earlier builds and became frustrated with the poor performance of my system (lockups, crashes, lack of apps that would work etc), so I reformatted and reverted to 8.1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I waited a while to try again and had updated to the 10049, if I remember correctly, maybe not. I had since continued the upgrade process until 10130 which is where I thought I would be okay to use on a daily basis, but I kept seeing a pop up in windows
 update for a "Firmware Update - 5/14/2015". Every time I tried to install it, the system would hang and I would have to do a hard reboot or forcibly close the windows update window.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was fed up and frustrated because I could not find an answer, or data on the internet of the situation, as it appeared that only a few people had the problem and no one had answers for them either. A new build came out for fast ring users and I was happy
 that I could possibly upgrade and move on. Windows update showed the OS build update as well as the dreaded firmware update. Alas, I could not upgrade because the firmware update would still hang. I could not even de-select the firmware upgrade from what I
 could tell. So, I had to revert to reformatting and reinstalling 8.1 again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then remembered that Microsoft was offering the .iso files for 10162 and proceeded to download hoping that I would install then upgrade to 10166.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No such luck. Windows update would not even show an OS build update to 10166, so I decided to wait and see what would come down the pipe next.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lo and behold, now 10240 is upon us and I once again thought I could upgrade and move on. Guess what, no luck, either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been waiting and checking windows update for hours and no OS build update. I have went through two different windows defender updates, but still no 10240. So, it looks like keep 10162 until the 29th or go back to 8.1 again.</p>
<p>I have tried a few "fixes" like repairing windows update, switching from fast ring to slow and back while rebooting between switches, checking the HKLM entry in the registry and nothing has worked as of yet.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, this does not work. The Windows Update Troubleshooter does not find any problem. If you try to reset the Windows Update components manually. using the Administrator Command Prompt, running the first command (net stop bits) returns "The service
 is starting or stopping. Please try again later." If you try to stop the BITS service from the Services window, the following error message is displayed: "Windows could not stop the Background Intelligent Transfer Service service on Local Computer. Error 1053:
 The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion." Stopping dependent services (like&nbsp; Nero Update) does not help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this should not even have been necessary if Windows Update had worked properly.</p>

            As a update, I had to revert back to windows 8.1 due to no solution working for me. The firmware update continued to appear even after a complete OS reset. This kept the OS update from showing up as windows update would time out every time I attempted
 to check for updates.

            When Microsoft announced Windows 10 two or three years ago everyone wondered what happened to Windows 9. If I am not mistaken Microsoft said Windows 10 would be the last version of Windows in the old form. However Windows would keep being developed and
 will add new features as services. They said there would be constant upgrades. How long Microsoft keeps the Windows 10 name it is anybody's guess.

            <p>Windows 10 is the most tested operating system since Microsoft starting build operating systems since the MSDOS days, probably in the world. With over 5 million Insiders, all the feedback Microsoft has received in nearly two years from all over the world,
 it's own in house programmers, manufacturers and partners you can't do better than that. Keep in mind Apple has a tiny beta tester base. &nbsp;Also Microsoft Windows runs on millions of computers and multiple components all over the world from different manufacturers.
 Microsoft cannot physically check every computer system in the world. Apple makes virtually all its own hardware so they can be certain as possible everything work as much as possible when they have an upgrade. Even with their smaller footprint they come across
 bugs when a complex operating system is updated. Windows 10 Anniversary Edition is ready as it can be.</p>

            In my opinion Windows 7 was the best tested system ever produced.&nbsp; True 10 had more people testing it but on the other hand it was being tweaked perilously close to release dates.

            <p>Because a mobile phone contains a lot of subcomponents like capacitors, a microphone might have more states than working and non working. Which network operator do you use, in which country? Are you using an (original) Nano SIM? Please,</p>
<ol>
<li>remove the microSD,</li><li>apply the <a href="http://download-fds.webapps.microsoft.com/supportFiles/phones/files/recovery/WindowsDeviceRecoveryToolInstaller.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recovery Tool</a> via a Windows computer, and</li><li>do neither add Wi-Fi nor your Microsoft account.</li></ol>
<p>Now, you ruled out all configuration issues. If this issue persists, I would give the phone to my retailer, because there is not guarantee Microsoft knows about your issue, is able to find the cause, or even when they resolve it. Your retailer in turn sends
 the phone to a local but authorised repair facility. If possible attach a not that you applied the recovery tool already. Furthermore, try to add a
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/using-bug-reporter/problem-detail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
qualified bug-report</a>. This avoid (un-repaired) send-in/send-back cycles as much as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, you posted this question in the category ‘Continuum for Phones’ which is about the new big-screen experience for some Windows 10 Mobile based phones. Therefore and to increase the visibility of your question, please, edit your post and change

            <p>I have a Lumia 930 and found the microphone problem 13 months after purchase. Just when I entered the Windows Inside program and upgraded to Windows Phone 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that the microphone (camera, skype, whatsapp, SoundHound etc) did not work anymore.<br />
</p>
<p>The repair was more than 50% of the amount paid on the purchase.<br />
</p>
<p>I decided to downgrade to Windows 8.1 again. Now the Camera already record videos with audio again, but other applications do not work (does not listen).<br />
</p>
<p>THE GREAT question now is: I update to the final version of WP10 or leave the WP8.1?</p>

<p>The simplest solution is to put a shortcut to the document on your desktop or your Start menu, and use that shortcut to start up Word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next simplest is to pin the document to the Office button's list of recent documents, and use the shortcut Alt+f and then the number assigned to the document in the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you really must have this specific document open automatically <strong><em>every</em>
</strong>time Word starts (and I have trouble imagining such a requirement, since it prevents opening Word by double-clicking any other document without the automatic document also opening), record a macro while you open the document. Name the macro AutoExec
 and save it in Normal.dotm. You'll then have to open the macro in the VBA editor (press Alt+F8, select the AutoExec macro's name, and click the Edit button) and add the full path of the document to the file name, or otherwise Word will look for the document
 in the Program Files folder where Word's EXE file is.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 515 Bluetooth Tethering</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
For a long time, at least since Nokia C3-01 I'm using a Bluetooth tethering feature (Bluetooth PAN, I guess). My iPad is WiFi only, and this is a VERY useful feature! My newer Nokia 206 is also supports tethering via Bluetooth! So, I have never expected that
 the newest and luxury Nokia 515 will lack such a basic feature!?<br />
I really like my brand new 515, but I'm desperately missing Bluetooth tethering!<br />
Is it possible that you'll add PAN to Bluetooth spec in next firmware update?<br />
If it's physically not possible, what can I do? Do I need to purchase a special cable or other accessory to friend my phone and iPad?<br />

    <title>Access 2010 accde error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aosterloo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2010 accde error</h2>
                    <p>I created an .accde file of my split database. The data is on a server in a shared folder with system wide permissions. The FE&nbsp;is what I want to create the accde of to limit users being able to modify desgin.&nbsp; Every time I try to create the file, it's created
 without any errors or issues.&nbsp; But, upon opening it up on the same computer or any other computer (win7 &amp; XP machines) I get this error:&nbsp;&nbsp; the database cannot be opened because the vba project contained in it cannot be read the database</p>
<p>This database has a few simple macros, nothing complex and all from built in "stock" code.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I've read that sometimes this happens when working on 64 bit and 32 bit machines and something about service pack 1.&nbsp; Well, all our machines are 32 bit and it's a group licensing from Microsoft, so there's absolutely no difference between one client machine
 and another as far as Access is concerned.&nbsp; Except for some being win7 and others XP, but all are 32 bit.</p>
<p>I even tried to make an accde file from a fresh database with 3 tables, no data, no macros, no VBA and guess what... same error.&nbsp; The error even says something about vba and on that attempt, there was never any to begin with.</p>
<p>How can I get past this issue?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Adam</p>

            <p>You could try "Repair" of your Office installation. See help file for details.</p>
<p>Personally I would repeat your steps on another machine. This is not normal.</p>
<p>Also note that KB articles like <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2533794" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2533794</a>&nbsp;speak about the bitness of Office, not Windows. It is NOT recommended to install the 64-bit version of Office, unless you really, really know what you are doing. Of course if you truly have Win-32 you won't be on
 Office-64.</p>
<p>Is your database in a Trusted Location?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply Tom.</p>
<p>The database is in a trusted location.&nbsp; I even tried it with the sample "Northwind" database and the same error came up.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When I make the accde file, I copy it to a server directory. After that I opened it on my machine (win7) with no error.&nbsp; When I go to open it on a XP machine I get the error.&nbsp; Then when I come back to it on my win7 machine, and open it again,&nbsp;the error comes
 up on my machine as well. </p>
<p>The database operates as normal with the other accdb file extension.&nbsp; No problems at all with either FE or BE on any machines&nbsp;in the building.</p>
<p>Our version of Access is 32 bit - 14.0.6106.5005</p>
<p>How would I go about a repair on Office?&nbsp; I would have to do that to 40 machines...&nbsp; Personally I doubt that's the issue as we haven't had Office 2010 for much more than a year and no other problems have been reported.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>2533794<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Error message when you run a compiled Microsoft Access MDE, ACCDE, or ADE file in Access 2010: "The database cannot be opened because the VBA project contained in it cannot be read"</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to this, what happens if you actually try and compile your database file before you make it into an ACCDE file?<span>&nbsp;
</span>To do this, you can do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>+&gt;Open your Access database.</p>
<p>+&gt;Press Alt + F11 to open your VBA window.</p>
<p>+&gt;Click on the Debug menu and then select Compile.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>+&gt;After you do this, recreate your ACCDE file and test.</p>

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, I didn’t see the article listed in your post, my fault.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I understand an ACCDE file compiles the application, but I have also seen this similar behavior with a few different customers now and we were able to get around the problem by manually compiling the file first.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In this scenario, they were able to create an ACCDE file on their machine, but were unable to use it on any other machine and received the same error message as Adam.<span>&nbsp;
</span>After we manually compiled it and then made an ACCDE file, everything seemed to work as expected.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It may not work in this situation, but it’s worth a try.</p>

            <p>Tom and Nathan,</p>
<p>Sorry it's taken me so long to reply. </p>
<p>I followed Nathan's suggestion of compiling the database before creating the accde file.&nbsp;The process worked without error.&nbsp; However, the result was no change.&nbsp; The accde file still returns the same error.&nbsp; As I've done in the past, I tried the same process
 on the Microsoft example database "Northwind" and that too returned the same error. ( the database cannot be opened because the vba project contained in it cannot be read the database)</p>
<p>I also reviewed the article that Nathan referenced. As far as I can tell, that article is referring to having two different versions of Access.&nbsp; Either 64 and 32 bit or 32 bit SP1 and 32 bit RTM.&nbsp; I am not aware of any of our machines that are different
 in any way with their Office 2010 install. Every machine in the building has the same installation of Office.&nbsp;All Office installs originate from the same setup and program directories on the server for&nbsp;existing and new machines regardless of operating system
 (win7 or XP sp3).&nbsp; I guess I could see where there might be a problem with the&nbsp;setup file&nbsp;or installation process and therefor the versions are all corrupted in this way, however no other errors or issues have ever been reported. I do not know of the existance&nbsp;of
 an original&nbsp;Office 2010&nbsp;hard copy disk. I wasn't the IT person at the time and I'm assuming there was a download directly from Microsoft along with the purchase of the licenses.</p>
<p>All that said, I just don't see how we could have two different versions (RTM or SP1) in this office if everything originates from the same place. If the version (32 bit - 14.0.6106.5005) reads the same on every machine that I've tested this on, how could
 we have a difference? And how would I check?</p>
<p>It doesn't seem to matter what the database is if the same issue arises from Microsoft's own flagship example database - I would assume there wouldn't be any errors in that one. So, I can reason out that there's a problem with the database itself.&nbsp; Next
 is the version issue, but as I said, I just can't see a way for that to be our problem.&nbsp; Then there's a possibility of the installation being compromised in some way and thus becoming corrupted, but I see that as rather low probability. What else might be
 going on here?</p>
<p>I'm stumped. lol</p>
<p>Thanks again for the replies, ideas and help.&nbsp; I really do appreciate it!</p>

    <title>Adding Editable User Defined Field to inbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eurbani  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding Editable User Defined Field to inbox</h2>
                    
<p>In an effort to make my constant mailbox cleanup a little more efficient, I added a User-Defined field called "Mail Priority" to my inbox.&nbsp; It is a field of type number (truncated).&nbsp; My idea is to add a number so that I can sort my mail and handle the most
 important ones first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can add the field, but I cannot modify it (ie cannot put a number in my new field).&nbsp; I'm assuming that this is because email items in the inbox are not generally editable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can add a category, flag, set a reminder, but those all seem clumsy for my purpose.&nbsp; Does anyone have a suggestion?</p>
<p>I don't think it matters, but FYI: I am using cached exchange mode.</p>

<h2>            Mysteriuos WiFi usage</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
every 30 mins my N82 Black connects to any available WiFi and downloads ~5mb of data even though there are no background apps running, only system processes. Here is the screenshot:

<br />
Can anyone explain what's happening and how do I turn it off?

            Must some background application doing it. Do you have automatic updates on for web feeds, podcasts or something of the sort? Which applications does App.mgr list as installed?<br />
<br />
If you reformat the phone ( *#7370# ) and memory card, and whatever it was, will be gone.

            There are no background processes running except _hidden_ ones that I'm able to view using Jbak TaskMan even though there are quite a lot of them.<br />
<br />
I have double checked everywhere that all automatic updates would be disabled.<br />
<br />
For now I have deleted all WiFi AP's to cut out the thing using them. Formatting is really not an option because I'm curious who is doing that.<br />

            Have you got Headlines set to auto update news etc?<br />
<br />
Some other dark horses i have found is worldmate if its set to update the weather and also antivirus applications you may have. But i cannot see that you have any of those in your listings.

            A bunch of apps on your list that I don't have or use, so I don't know if any one of them is the culprit.<br />
<br />
One way to find out is to uninstall them one by one and check the behaviour after each one. If the mysterious usage stops after uninstalling something, then you know what's causing it.<br />
<br />
To add to the pile, look up Nokia Energy Profiler from <a href="http://forum.nokia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://forum.nokia.com/</a> to see if it can provide any hints as to what app might be the culprit.

            I had the same issue, can't remember which application it was in the end that caused it, but I ended up reformatting to get rid of all. Afterwards I only installed more trusted applications and have not tried installing everything that comes my way.<br />
<br />
I also stay away from unsigned or other not so legal versions of programs.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I want to embed a Yammer feed on my SharePoint but I want to filter it by hashtag. There are two ways to embed a Yammer feed (the SharePoint app and the embed code). Is it possible to customise this feed to only display posts that have a certain hashtag?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<h2>            Lumia 920 - RM-821 - 4G&#47;LTE enabled&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was told&nbsp;by the Nokia Care Center that my Lumia 920 does not support 4G and it is a 3G variant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was curious as to how&nbsp;one identifies this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it the hardware revision? Mine says 6.0.0.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what is curious is that the box that the phone came is says that it supports 4G/LTE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Shane</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In software/firmware, it is possible to disable LTE. Some firmware variants do this; I do not know why. The firmware variant is identified through the Nokia Product Code – you have a variant for the network operator Movistar, Mexico. Both your&nbsp;hardware (RM-820)
 and that network (Movistar) support LTE band 4. Therefore, I am surprised LTE still is not enabled in your&nbsp;firmware variant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which version of the firmware do you have? Are you still with&nbsp;Movistar, Mexico?</p>

            Interesting. I am with a provider that uses the 1800 Mhz, Band 3 spectrum.<br />
<br />
Looking at the link you posted, I guess the RM-820 is not going to be compatible with band 3?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just bought an Ipaq 111.&nbsp; It's my first pda &amp; I'm ready to go back to a paper calendar &amp; to-do lists!&nbsp; How long should a sync take?&nbsp; The last time I tried to sync i canceled it after about 2 hrs.&nbsp; Right now i'm trying to sync again and it's been over 1
 hr.&nbsp; I don't get any error msgs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I'm wondering how you download something (games, programs, etc) onto the ipaq.&nbsp; When I'm in WMDC
</p>
<p>it only will download to my laptop.&nbsp; I can't figure out how to either get it from my laptop to my pda or how to get it from WMDC to my pda.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've already spent over 20 hrs. trying to figure out&nbsp;this stupid thing.... seriously...</p>

<p>It doesn't sound as if you have established a successful partnership - the sync should just take a few minutes.</p>
<p>When you have a successful partnership the sync will then also install your pocket pc applications to your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can afford to lose your data, I would first do a clean reset to take the device back to 'as new'.
</p>
<p>Then....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your PC ..........</p>
<p>with IPAQ cradled</p>
<p>click on Start, Control Panel</p>
<p>Double-click on System</p>
<p>Click on Hardware, then Device Manager</p>
<p>Click on '+' to left of Universal Serial Bus Controllers (Portable Devices in VISTA)</p>
<p>Click on '+' to left of Windows CE USB Devices (or Windows Mobile Device in VISTA)</p>
<p>Right Click on device </p>
<p>Select 'Uninstall'</p>
<p>Uncradle IPAQ</p>
<p>Reboot PC</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now run Windows Mobile Device Center, but do not connect the IPAQ till it tells you to.</p>

    <title>microsoft account for office 365 business - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            microsoft account for office 365 business</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>I had in 2014 an office 365 for business subscription. I signed up for a microsoft account for that and an office account as well. This year I wanted to renew it, but there were new kind of product. So I wanted to subscribe for this new one, but it told
 me, that I need a new office account for the new product. I made it, and paid for one year of office 365 business. On my office portal seems everything ok, I have paid till October 2016 and I can install the software.</p>
<p>But then, with office 2016 it asks me to sign in into my microsoft account, that is paired with the office, otherwise it wont work. It seems that I do not have it. When I signed up for the new office account, it did not prompt me to sign up for another microsoft
 account.</p>
<p>With Office 2013 on the other computer, it works, but in my account it says that my subscription expired.</p>
<p>I have windows 7 on all computers.</p>
<p>Please help me. Thanks</p>
<p>Gyula</p>

<p>Hi Gyula,<br />
<br />
If you installed the Office applications from the Office portal, please use the work/school account for signing in. It looks like ****@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com. On the other hand, for Office 365 Home, Personal, or University, you should sign in with the Microsoft
 account used when you purchased the products.<br />
<br />
To learn more, see <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Download-and-install-Office-365-Home-Personal-or-University-on-your-PC-7a28382b-7015-4b5a-9d9b-650d15742c95?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Download and install Office 365 Home, Personal, or University on your PC</a>. <br />
<br />
Office 365 Business is a plan from Office 365 for Business. It needs a work/school account with the related license for activation. You can sign in to the Office products such as Office 365 for Home and Office 2013 Professional Plus with a Microsoft account
 (e.g.&nbsp; ***@gmail.com, ***@outlook.com or other accounts signed up by yourself for personal Microsoft services). They need to be activated by product keys.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, I’d like to confirm the following things:<br />
1.Was “Office 2016” also installed from the Office portal?<br />
2.Was “Office 2013 on the other computer” installed from the Office portal?<br />
3.The screenshot for the version of Office 2016 and Office 2013. Open one of the Office 2016 and 2013 applications, then click
<strong>File&gt;Account&gt; Product Information</strong>.<br />
4.The screenshots for the pop-up when you sign in to Office 2016 and 2013. Also the screenshots for any error messages you got. To post pictures, click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong>&gt;<strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong> in the thread page.
<br />
5.The accounts you used to purchase the Office 365 products. The previous one and the current one.
<br />

            What version of Windows?&nbsp; On Windows 10 you'll need to use the Microsoft Movies &amp; TV app to download and watch them.&nbsp; On Windows 8.1 you'll need to use the Xbox Video app to download&nbsp;and watch&nbsp;them.
