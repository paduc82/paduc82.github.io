    <title>Legitimacy of security update in the &#34;suggested&#34; apps section - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Legitimacy of security update in the &#34;suggested&#34; apps section</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two days ago, I noticed a suggested app that said "Security update pending. Install the update". As it&nbsp;was in the start menu, I thought there is an update pending. But when I clicked on it, edge opened with a URL that to me, seems very dodgy. Is this suggestion
 legitimate or as a result of a phony app being suggested. I am saying this because I only see app suggestion in that section. I have never seen it suggest an update. I have attached screenshots of the suggestion and the resulting URL that opened upon clicking.
 Am I being paranoid for no reason? </p>

<p>Hi Harshad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a good thing to be aware of the notifications you're receiving especially with the updates. As we have checked on the URL link that comes with your screenshot, it is a legitimate website from Microsoft. You can also check for your updates manually
 by clicking&nbsp;<span>the<span> </span></span><span><strong>Start</strong> button, then select<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Settings</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update
 &amp; security<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Windows Update</strong><span> &gt;
<strong>Check for updates</strong>.</span></p>
<p>Hope this helps and if this helps, don't hesitate to post back.</p>

<p>Hi Jomel_Santos,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I was paranoid was I am almost always upto date with the software. Worst case I am behind in updates by a day. When I open the linking website, the page stays on the loading screen and doesn't do anything.&nbsp;Furthermore, when I checked the updates
 page in the settings, there wasn't anything. So why would it suggest I install security updates when there aren't any updates?
</p>
<p>I initially clicked on the suggestion thinking I might be finally getting the anniversary update since my laptop hasn't got it yet whereas other people have had it for more than a year. For some reason anniversary update doesn't work on my laptop and&nbsp;my
 laptop is&nbsp;less than 2 years old.&nbsp;Main things I am missing a lot is skype and extensions on edge. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Appreciate the information. Since it is only a suggested link, you can disregard it if your device is already up to date. As for Windows 10 anniversary update, can you confirm which version of Windows 10 are you using? You may need to go through a different
 process in getting an update for Windows. Also, the latest update would be the Windows 10 Creators Update. Both of those updates can be obtained by one of the ways which are by checking
<strong>Settings</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update &amp; security<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Windows Update</strong><span> &gt;
<strong>Check for updates </strong>but your device should be compatible with the updates. For that, you would need to contact the manufacturer of your device to see if the device you're using is compatible with the said updates. For details regarding Windows
 updates, you may want to check this link <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4018124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows update history</a>. It would show there that the anniversary update is Windows 10 Version 1607 and the latest one would be Windows 10 Version 1607 which is the latest update for Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps and if you have other concerns, feel free to post back.</p>

<p>Sure thing. I will disregard the suggestion for a security update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still on version 1511. I had started a separate thread a while back regarding the OS not updating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/cannot-update-windows-on-my-laptop-stuck-on/648dcf9e-a979-44e7-96ba-9c62e357d419</p>
<p>So far, I have no idea why when I use edge in the newer OS versions, large amounts of data is being continuously written to the disk (something to do with the cache as pointed out in my previous thread) bringing the laptop to a crawl despite having an SSD
 in it. I don't want to update using update assistant to try a fix only to have to roll back because the fix didn't work. Therefore I prefer to collect a few possible fixes and test them together if they are fixing my problem to save me time. I haven't found
 a fix so far. Windows update doesn't show me OS updates after the first time I rolled back from anniversary update to version 1511. Regarding my device being compatible with the update, I am pretty sure update assistant give all ticks when checking for compatibility
 an installing an update.</p>

    <title>size of the file history drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamescmcneill  say:</h3>
<h2>            size of the file history drive</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a USB drive that is 29.8 GB in size for the File History drive. The system says that&nbsp;the drive&nbsp;is full even though the Documents directory on my hard drive is only 4.64 GB and I have limited the file history to the latest version of all files.
 As is, there isn't a drive on the planet big enough to backup every version of every document.
</p>
<p>It seems it would be more economical to turn off File History and just copy the Documents directory to the USB drive at the end of the day, but then that's not automatic.
</p>
<p>The feature certainly doesn't work as expected. I've read countless articles on this subject and if I'm doing something, it's not obvious. Is this a problem that some of you have solved?</p>

            <p>File history is at best a poor substitute for a real backup.&nbsp; It does not just back up the document directory hence its size.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">File History only backs up copies of files that are in the Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, and Desktop folders and the OneDrive files available offline on your PC.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Just realize if your OS is unbootible your file history will be essentially useless</strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">.&nbsp; A real backup is a much more reliable option.</span></em></p>

            I gave up on file history and the whole Microsoft backup scheme. Norton has a program that will backup everything and that's the route I went.

    <title>Windows 10 Freezes while playing games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swaminathanramasubramanian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Freezes while playing games</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am running Windows 10 Build 10240 with all the latest updates. Initially everything was running fine. When I was trying to install Visual Studio community 2015 the whole OS crashed and was unable to boot. I had to reset my PC to Factory Settings and now
 I updated again from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. Now, when I try to play games, it locks up with just the music playing in the background. Mouse pointer is moving. When I press Ctrl + Alt + Del, the screen goes black, with just the mouse moving and the music
 playing. The only way to recover was to do a hard reset. But instead, what I did was to put the computer to sleep by pressing the power button, and then waking it up. It lead me to the lock screen from where I restarted my PC. This does not occur when playing
 Windows Store Games. It occurs when playing Win32 games such as Euro Truck Simulator 2. When this issue happened for the first time I was playing Euro Truck Simulator 2 1.20.1. The next time I was playing Disney Interactive Typing. Windows 8.1 had no problems.
 I tried to update the graphics driver with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC Specs:</p>
<p>Intel Core i7-4770</p>
<p>8GB DDR3 RAM</p>
<p>2TB Seagate HardDrive</p>
<p>16GB SSD</p>
<p>NVidia GeForce GT640 with 4GB DDR3 Graphics RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running the graphics driver released on 22nd September. I think the problem lies with the OS. I am now afraid to play any games on it. How can I recover it? (I cannot afford to do a Reset of my PC again to Windows 8.1 or loose my files).</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Swaminathan.</p>

            <p>Hello, this is Blake and I have a few questions for the Microsoft Developer Team. I have been experiencing performance issues with Windows 10 ever since I've acquired it. (hours within release) And the performance problems of my concern include a very large
 variety of games, from Euro Truck Simulator Two, Project Cars, Rocket League and Spintires, the list goes on and on. Every single time, I get a frozen screen for 5-10 seconds, then the sound resumes, but the screen(s) remain black. I can navigate menus and
 drive around with feedback, but cannot see the navigation on the screen. It continues until I Ctrl + Alt + Del and open Task Manager to force close the game(s). I am confident my PC specs (listed below) are not the concern, as they are well above the minimum
 required system specs listed in game information. I have followed all of the above instructions, but with no avail and a year later, I am looking into greater pastures, as Windows 10 is not suitable for 'Gamers' a year and a half after launch. Though I am
 on a tight budget as I am awaiting conclusions from a recent Job Interview. Since the problems showed themselves post-Windows 8.1, I can conclude that the OS it'self is at fault. I really appreciate you spending the time to reply/read this post, and may you
 have a great weekend.</p>

<h2>            BSOD - Sony VAIO SVS13AA11L - Memory Corruption and ntoskrnl.exe</h2>
                    Hello, I am having problems with one of our computers that I can't seem to pin down. The user will be using the laptop and out of nowhere the wireless will stop working and then minutes to hours later they will get the BSOD. I have checked the unit when
 the wireless isn't working and according to Windows the wireless card is working but no wireless networks will display. I have looked into the minidump file and I see two errors listed but BSODView and WinDBG.<br />
<br />
1. NToskrnl.exe&nbsp; - BSODView<br />
2. Memory Corruption&nbsp; - WinDBG<br />
<br />
Can someone take a look at these error logs and see if they may be able to identify what is causing the issue? Is this the sign of a faulty RAM module?
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

This was related to your Kaspersky killing tcpip.sys.&nbsp; I would remove and replace it with MSE<br />

</b>- search Google for the name of the driver<br />
- compare the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to<br />
- visit the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).<br />
- if there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program<br />

<p>Yes, that is exactly what I'm trying to achieve. Sadly the optionalfeatures.exe workaround you suggested brought up the aforementioned blank windows features list. I appreciate the help&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Surface pro 3 powerpoint</h2>
                    How do I remotely conduct a powerpoint presentation with the Surface Pro 3. I have the adapter and can view it on a tv screen but cannot manipulate the presentation without being at the Surface. I need to be able to stand at the TV in front of the group
 and manage the display remotely. I am not going to buy a windows phone as I live where there is NO cell service so a cell phone is not practical. Thank you. Patty

<h2>            eSATA HDD drive keeps disappearing after sleep</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have a question about my new eSATA HDD Seagate
</span><span>Barracuda drive 2TB.</span></p>
<p><span>I am using it as a second hard drive and the problem is that it keeps
</span><span>disappearing after resume from sleep of Windows Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>The only way how to get drive back is restart of computer.
</span><span>It is really frustrating, I do not have any idea how to fix it.</span></p>
<p><span>Without sleeping it works OK, but I want to use sleeping,&nbsp;because it is faster during the day than turning computer</span></p>
<p><span>completely off.
</span><span>I have asked Saegate for help, but they claimed me that this is a Microsoft Windows issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your respond in advance.</span></p>

<p>Hi TheZaron,</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
I suggest you to try the following methods and check:</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
<strong>Method 1: Update Video Driver.</strong></p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;Select the Start button, typeDevice Manager, and select it from the list of results.</p>
<p>◦Expand a category Display adaptors to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select Update Driver. For example, to update a graphics card driver, expand the Display adapters category, right click your graphics card, and
 select Update Driver.</p>
<p><br />
◦Select Search automatically for updated driver software.</p>
<p><br />
◦If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</p>
<p><br />
•If these steps don't work, try reinstalling the driver: Open Device Manager, right-click (or tap and hold) the name of the device, and select Uninstall. Restart your PC, and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Run Troubleshooter.</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the taskbar, type control panel in the search box. Select Control Panel from the results.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the View by menu, choose Large icons&nbsp; or Small icons.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Troubleshooting &gt;View all &gt; Select Power.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Power select Next &gt; Try troubleshooting as an administrator and review the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
<strong>Method 3: Perform clean boot.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
This guided walk-through provides steps to <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Perform Clean boot.</a></strong></p>
<p>Important Clean Boot:</p>
<p>A “clean boot” starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs, so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program.</p>
<p>Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality while in a clean boot environment, however that functionality will return when you
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset the computer to start normally&nbsp;
</a></strong>after you have finished your troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Hope it helps.</p>
<p>Let us know if you got the help you needed by clicking Yes or No.</p>

<h2>            Skype name</h2>
                    <p>Hi have signed up on Skype around two years ago. It then took my Skype name automatically as live:r****.a*****</p>
<p>So whenever users tried to search me using this name they were able to search me but not through my email address.</p>
<p>Now from around a year, no user is being able to search me using my Skype name or by my email address. Neither my profile shows the Skype name field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should i do? What should i share with people so that they can search me on Skype?</p>
<p>

<p>You should not delete a program. You should use an appropropriate uninstall mechanism. Even using&nbsp; an appropriate mechanism can leave startup entries.</p>

            HI SS&gt;  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />These decisions are made by the Update Advisor which scans the hardware to see if there are known compatibility issues delays the Version upgrade.  
<br />
<br />The problem is that the Upgrade Advisor is notoriously wrong, interpreting a download in a folder as the installed app.  Probably 9 out of 10 times I've advised to go ahead and manually Upgrade - always the most stable method - there have turned out to be no such incompatibility.  
<br />
<br />I would manually upgrade to the latest version by opening the Media Creation Tool from this link:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>, choose Download Tool Now, then open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now.   This saves your files, apps and most settings in place, is the most stable method to change versions, brings your Updates current, resolves most problems.
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the Version has problems I will work with you to try to resolve them. If the problems are intractable, you have ten days to roll it back in Recovery settings.  
<br />
<br />Most problems are resolved by doing this gold standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> . So read it over and see if its something you want to learn to do. 
<br />  
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            It should tell you in the Advanced Options where the option is available to Reset. Its not a guarantee, some games and apps save data while some do not with the Reset.

    <title>Vista Media Center will not burn DVD of any recorded program - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dan59724  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista Media Center will not burn DVD of any recorded program</h2>
                    I've had Windows Media Center on my Dell XPS410 machine running Vista Home Premium for the last two years.&nbsp; I used to be able to burn DVD's of recorded programs in Media Center with no problem, until about a couple of months ago.&nbsp; Now whenever I try to
 burn the DVD's of a program, I get get the following error messages:<br />
<strong>"Burn failure - an error has occurred in burning the CD/DVD"</strong>&nbsp; This message pops up in Media Center.&nbsp;
<br />
Then, when I exit Media Center,&nbsp;I get the following message: <strong>"SBEServer has stopped working".&nbsp;
</strong>What does SBEServer mean?<br />
<br />
I did have to perform an In-Place Upgrade of Vista Home Premium (with help of Microsoft Vista technical support) prior to this issue because my system would not download Windows Upgrades.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I am able to burn data and photo files in other programs, namely Windows Photo Gallery and Windows DVD Maker, and Roxio.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;Windows Media Center will not&nbsp;let me burn anymore, which is quite inconvenient, since that is where the recorded&nbsp;televeision programs
 reside.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I am current with all Windows Updates and have tried various fixes such as disabling and removal of all the other burner software and this has not resolved the issue.<br />
<br />
Hopefully someone can help.&nbsp; <br />
Thanks, Dan&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Dan59724,</p>
<p>This problem occurs when the root of a drive is included as a folder in the watched list in Media Center Library Setup, and you try to burn pictures from this folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>Run the FIX IT TOOL.</strong><br />
Click on the “Run now” button in the below link to diagnose and repair problems with your CD or DVD drive when trying to read or burn media “Your CD or DVD drive cannot read or write media”
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/cd_dvd_drive_problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/gp/cd_dvd_drive_problems</strong></a></p>
<p>Refer the steps from the link: <strong>Error message when you use Windows Media Center to burn a CD or a DVD from a folder that represents the root of a drive in Windows Vista: "An error has occurred in burning the CD/DVD":
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/952983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/952983</strong></a></p>
<p>You may try the below steps and check.</p>
<p>Re-register these files jscript.dll, vbscript.dll and wmp.dll following the below steps.</p>
<p>1. Close Windows Media Center and any other windows.<br />
2. Click the Start Button, All Programs, and Accessories<br />
3. Right click "Command Prompt" and choose "Run as administrator".<br />
Note: Please click Continue if the User Account Control (UAC) window prompts.<br />
4. Type or copy&nbsp; the following commands in this order and press “Enter” after each line.</p>
<p><strong>regsvr32 jscript.dll<br />
regsvr32 atl.dll <br />
cd C:\WINDOWS\eHome<br />
ehSched /unregServer <br />
ehSched /service <br />
ehRecvr /unregServer <br />
ehRecvr /service <br />
ehRec.exe /unregServer <br />
ehRec.exe /regserver <br />
ehmsas.exe /unregServer <br />
ehmsas.exe /regserver<br />
</strong>Exit Command Prompt</p>
<p>The next steps are needed if you are going to burn a High Definition (HD) TV show to a DVD:</p>

<p>I had the exact same problem that you described, lost the ability to burn from within media center after an upgrade install of Vista. I always suspected Roxio software was to blame, I&nbsp;think it has to do with Microsoft using some Sonic Solutions (Roxio) code
 for Media Center. Although I can't prove it, it is my opinion that when Roxio software is loaded&nbsp;it changes those 'core' Microsoft OS code items that it got from Sonic... Just my opinion based on nothing. Anyway I had to do another upgrade install and although
 it did not fix the burn issue&nbsp;I started getting a new error saying that I needed to install Roxio Cineplayer. I had never unistalled Cineplayer so I checked in 'Add/Remove programs' in Control Panel and both Roxio Cineplayer And the Cineplayer codec pack where
 installed. On a whim I decided to do a repair install of both. I had to dig out my original Roxio install DVD and browse to the directory where the needed file was. After the repair completed I checked in Media Center and for the first time since my initial
 Vista upgrade install I was able to burn video DVD's from within Vista Media Center. I don't know if it will fix your problem, but it can't really hurt to give a repair install of Cineplayer a try.</p>

<p>One of the drawbacks of USB wireless keyboards and mice is that the dongle is serial coded to the devices. &nbsp;There are no replacements. &nbsp;You will have to toss it and get another mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never lose those, no matter what.</p>
