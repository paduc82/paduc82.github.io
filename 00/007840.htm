<h2>            very strange email disappearance.</h2>
                    I have noticed a strange behaviour in some email accounts. Some emails are being deleted from the inbox even before reading. And they dont even go to the trash folder, they simply disappear. It gets even difficult to be certain of whats happening

            Hi Silvio. 
<br />
<br />We know that the information that is received in the mail, for all of us is very important, but we must understand that the servers that administer the accounts, grant a limit of storage space, which can vary according to the use of the mail.
<br />
<br />As general information, we indicate that, a message to be removed from any tray of your mail, is moved to the deleted tray, where it remains for 30 days, before being permanently deleted. However, you can try to find the messages that have been deleted, in the different folders of your Outlook. You can also review the option to: Restore deleted email messages in Outlook.com, to try to recover them.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Restaura-mensajes-de-correo-electr%c3%b3nico-eliminados-en-Outlook-com-cf06ab1b-ae0b-418c-a4d9-4e895f83ed50?ui=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Restau...</a> es-ES &amp; rs = es-ES &amp; ad = ES
<br />
<br />An option to recover deleted emails is, if at any time you linked your email account with a mail administration application such as Microsoft Office Desktop Outlook, Outlook Express, Windows Live Mail, or another that fulfills the same function, and validate that a copy of the messages stored on the computer is still stored, through the application.
<br />
<br />Another way is to check with the people who have sent you emails or those who have sent them messages, if they still have a copy in their mail trays, and ask them to please forward the messages to you.
<br />
<br />It is also possible that messages have been deleted by optimizing storage space in your email account. If you have not cleaned the messages you have received for a long time, the servers automatically perform a maintenance process to prevent your trays from collapsing and stop receiving mail, deleting the oldest messages from the mail account folders.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, we tell you that the elimination of information within an account is executed, when it is complete a year without presenting any movement. For you to validate more information about this process, we invite you to visit: The Microsoft Services Contract in the numeral "4".
<br />
<br />&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/</a>
<br />
<br />You need to keep in mind, that after the account information has been deleted, it is unlikely to be able to recover it again.
<br />
<br />What we can recommend is that you clean your mail. If the message has an attachment, you can save the file to OneDrive and delete the message. Remember that, through OneDrive, you enjoy 5Gb of storage, which is different from the space granted for the administration of the mail account. If you need to keep a message, you can save a copy in OneDrive, right-clicking on the message, choosing "Save in OneNote", this way, a OneNote document will be created, with a copy of the message and it will be stored at <a href="https://onedrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com</a>.
<br />
<br />We invite you to visit the link Organize the Inbox with File, Clean and other tools in Outlook.com, which is a guide, that will help you manage and manage the trays of your email account.

<br />My name is Stefan, I'm an independent advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />Sometimes it happens when you access the mailbox using another device with a POP account. Please consult the information on this link so that you can verify it and determine if that may be the cause of the problem.
<br />

<br />You can try to recover the emails that have disappeared through these steps:

</p><p>If you have an Outlook.com or Office 365 business mailbox,&nbsp; you can try a Office addin called Email Recovery. It can recover mail that was permanently deleted, but you need to run it fairly soon after discovering the missing mail as it can be purged at any

</p><p>Its not my account, its of an relative. It happened in a matter of few seconds, I saw the message of incoming email as I was writing another for him. Then I returned to the inbox and it had disappeared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it happened several times before, but I couldn't check so clearly as this time.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;DaveNg2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes you will be able to make a call to Japan numbers while you are in Hongkong or in Japan using Skype. Just make sure you have paid calling subscription to Japan or Skype credits on your account. You can purchase a calling subscription or Skype credits
 on this link:&nbsp;https://secure.skype.com/calling-rates/Japan?language=en</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any questions, please done hesitate to reply!</p>

            Thanks for your reply. Basically, is the phone number used in Skype is the same as my mobile phone number? and may I know once I have the subscription, apart from making a call, can somebody call me back via skype as well? Thanks.

<p>Hi&nbsp;DaveNg2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Mobile number to sign in to Skype, yes it would be the same. Once you have a calling subscription, you will only be able to make outgoing calls to mobiles and landlines, if you need to receive incoming calls on Skype, you will need to purchase
 Skype number which is different from a calling plan. Skype number will allow you to receive incoming calls from mobiles and landlines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, can you please elaborate your question (<span>Basically, is the phone number used in Skype is the same as my mobile phone number?)&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Underlines look different in old files opened in Excel 2011 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jane young  say:</h3>
<h2>            Underlines look different in old files opened in Excel 2011</h2>
                    Thank you for your validating response!&nbsp; Sorry you are plagued with the same issue.&nbsp; I have no problem with the appearance of the gridlines at present; they are perfect onscreen and when printed.&nbsp; Plus I need them to separate the data in my cells and make
 for easier reading of the spreadsheets, but I do appreciate the suggestion!<br />
<br />
It's a shame to have to do a workaround of any type when everything worked perfectly before!&nbsp; No one should have to sacrifice much-needed gridlines within a spreadsheet in order to get a fine black border around all the cells!&nbsp; I have found several other mind-bogglingly
 stupid omissions or changes with Office 2011 that are of little to no use whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Like in Word, they changed the basic underline that we all are familiar with for centuries now, by reducing it to a fraction of it's former self.&nbsp; I can barely see it on the printed page.&nbsp; Talk about fixing something that wasn't broken.&nbsp; What's the point of
 underlining something for emphasis if you can't even see the underline?&nbsp; And the thicker underline option is way too thick; it's visually distracting.<br />
<br />
So now, when editing documents that were done in earlier Word versions, my newly revised printed pages are full of faint, almost invisible underlines, in amongst all the other pages with proper normal underlines from when I printed the document previously.&nbsp;
 As a result my work is not as professional as it should be or as it used to be, but I am not willing to kill off more trees by reprinting the entire document in Word 2011, so that all the underlines can be consistently invisible.<br />
<br />
We are talking about basic, elementary functions between Excel and Word that have been destroyed or compromised significantly.&nbsp; I have called into Microsoft about these glaring omissions but no update has been rolled out to address them to my knowledge.&nbsp;
<br />

            Thank you Jim, but that is not the case in my situation.&nbsp; My issue has nothing to do with gridlines.&nbsp; The gridlines are perfectly fine in Preview and on the printed page.&nbsp; They print out normally in Excel 2011 just like they did in Excel 2004.&nbsp; I have
 not changed my printer, nor has the driver been updated.<br />
<br />
The only thing that changed was that I installed Office 2011 to replace my previous Office 2004.&nbsp; And just like with all newer applications, there is no guarantee that your older documents will open up and display exactly the same way they did under the previous
 version of the same application.<br />
<br />
Excel 2011 does not reproduce the fine black border that outlines the perimeter of the spreadsheet cells on the page, when working with spreadsheets that were created in Excel 2004.&nbsp; It puts a faint gray border there instead which makes the spreadsheet look
 incomplete, as if it needs to go onto the next page or something.&nbsp; <u>Note</u>:&nbsp; When I create a
<u>new</u> spreadsheet in Excel 2011, the typical fine black perimeter outline is present.<br />
<br />
As for Word 2011:&nbsp; Microsoft decided to change the thickness of the basic underline in Word 2011.&nbsp; It is impossibly thin now by design.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with printers and/or drivers.&nbsp; It is a change that was made to the 2011 application.&nbsp; And just as stated
 above, when working with documents that were created in older versions, a change like that renders a visual inconsistency if you are not reprinting the entire volume of work.<br />
<br />
Underlines are supposed to draw the eye to the word or words, and add emphasis.&nbsp; That will not happen if the underline is ridiculously fine.&nbsp; Microsoft confirmed that they did reduce the thickness of the underline in Word 2011.<br />

<p>Thank you for your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried MS Support but we end up going round in circles. Support suggest Licensing/Subscriptions and they in turn send us back to Support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should be simple, we want to buy something, we can pay with a UK credit card (or receive invoices). Please provide Communications Credit license and we are ready to run our migration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only "answer" we have received so far is the mind-boggling idea that we "create a new tenant, migrate all the users and data to the new tenant and cancel the old tenant."</p>
<p>
</p><p>We only just migrated this user from Google G Suite, the idea we would have to perform a tenant migration just to buy one license is unacceptable.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Export Powerview report from Excel Online to Powerpoint</h2>
                    <p>I'm learning how to use Powerview to create dashboards from some online videos. I'd like to export the dashboard into powerpoint. Can anyone help me find that functionality in the current version of Excel online. FYI, I have Excel 2016 and excel online with

            <p>Ravinath, you are posting the same canned response about checking the recent activity page, which I've obviously done or I would not have known the IP that was generating the unusual sign-in activity. &nbsp;The specific question is why Microsoft corporate IP
 addresses are generating suspicious activity? &nbsp;I contacted support directly yesterday and received this response this morning:</p>
<p>
</p><pre><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Good day! I understand the situation you are in and let me do my best to help you. Please be informed that IP addresses from Microsoft are generated from when your account is accessed by our system to apply updates to the account. This is the system accessing the account, not any particular individual from Microsoft accessing the account. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</em>
</pre>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So, according to this response, &nbsp;Microsoft itself is generating this activity as part of server(account?) updates. &nbsp;If this is true, Microsoft should make some adjustments to the security logging routines so that Microsoft created administrative activity
 does not trigger these alerts. &nbsp;I have spent at least 2 hours changing my passwords, setting up 2 factor authentication, updating all my devices that access hotmail, searching support forums and contacting MS support, just to learn at this point that there
 is not a problem because Microsoft is triggering false alerts through upgrade/administration activity.</p>

            <p>This is very worrying, and it is hard to take it on faith that this is just server and account updates.&nbsp; Especially with all the threats and possibilities.</p>
<p>Microsoft does have written solutions to filter through, but all this takes so much time to sift through when all you really want is verification of what happened and a feeling of security instead of morbid fear that the company you put all your trust in,
 that has the best security, has not faltered or is not going to make you run a maze full of gauntlets for no reason... to ensure your information is safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said and the obvious fact that there are many people that have been experiencing this: it would bode well that information on this specific situation
<p>After all, it is a MS Redmond IP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that it is not (quick to find)&nbsp;implies that we are being cattle prodded to move to two step verification (TSV)&nbsp; as it is the path of least resistance... despite that it&nbsp;feels a little like free falling.&nbsp;
<br />
Despite that I have set it up... so far it seems like a very good idea... and the next time I may not have to worry at all.<br />
<br />
Of course now Facebook is telling me someone has tried to access my account from Seattle.&nbsp; That could be due to resetting Outlook.com and allowing it access to facebook.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, perhaps I was hacked and now some of my passwords are out there.</p>

            Hi H_nas,<br />
<br />
Which Outlook 2016 client version are you using? Please provide us with the detailed information about this. See
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-version-of-outlook-do-i-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c#ID0EAABAAA=PC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What version of Outlook do I have?</a><br />
<br />
May I know whether you are trying use Speak to have text read aloud in the Outlook?<br />
If so, you can add the Speak command to your Quick Access Toolbar by doing the following Outlook:<br />
<br />
Next to the Quick Access Toolbar, click <strong>Customize Quick Access Toolbar</strong>.<br />
Click <strong>More Commands</strong>.<br />
In the <strong>Choose commands from</strong> list, select <strong>All Commands</strong>.<br />
Scroll down to the <strong>Speak </strong>command, select it, and then click <strong>
Add</strong>.<br />
Click <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
<br />
After you have added the Speak command to your Quick Access Toolbar, you can hear single words or blocks of text read aloud by selecting the text you want to hear and then clicking the Speak icon on the Quick Access Toolbar.<br />
<br />
For your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-the-speak-text-to-speech-feature-to-read-text-aloud-459e7704-a76d-4fe2-ab48-189d6b83333c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Yes it is... whenever I try to save PDF both under Save As and using the Adobe Add-in I always get the same error message - 'we could not find anything to print'. This is only a very recent problem, after the latest updates.

            <p>The "average" US citizen still uses Fahrenheit on a daily basis so that is why it is the default for the en-us localized version of Outlook. If you were for instance to install the nl-nl (Dutch) localized version or the de-de (German) localized version of
 Outlook, then the default is Celsius.</p>

            <p>What about <strong>en-gb</strong>, en-ca, en-au, en-nz? I'd LOVE to install one of those for Office 2016!</p>
<p>But can I?</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Language-Accessory-Pack-for-Office-2016-82ee1236-0f9a-45ee-9c72-05b026ee809f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Language-Accessory-Pack-for-Office-2016-82ee1236-0f9a-45ee-9c72-05b026ee809f</a></p>
<p>Can you show me evidence (other than fiddly spelling code settings dialogs deep within Microsoft Word that MS Word keeps reverting back to "en-us" on new documents for no apparent reason — perhaps I should dig deep into document templates to fix that, every
 time I install MS Office); can you show me any evidence apart from that (and I seem to remember noticing that Microsoft is still using spelling code data files or 3rd-party spell-checking technology from 1997 in Word 2016), can you show me any other evidence
 that anyone at Microsoft is even aware that other spelling codes/conventions exist in the English speaking world, apart from en-us?</p>
<p>Apparently, even being in Britain, with my Windows locale set to GB/UK, and my timezone set to London (in both my Windows clock and my Outlook settings); won't do it! If that meant nothing to the coders, they also didn't think to ping a server that could
 tell me my external IP address; using that to look up my location.</p>
<p>When you include India (where the GB-varient of English is the standard among the educated classes); there is absolutely no dispute that the needs of more than half of the English speaking world are being ignored by Microsoft!</p>
<p>I once encountered a bizarre SQL error (a blocker issue) in Access / ODBC / SQL-Server, that only occurred when the date format was set to something other than MM/DD/YYYY (which is also a near-exclusive convention of the United States of America!) That issue
 was much worse than this one (and it wasted days of my working time, finding out what the problem was); but the overall recurring theme here appears to be one of cultural chauvenism — and that too, with backwards standards and conventions that have been abandoned
 long ago by every other industrialized and third-world country on Earth! A similar bug exists in MS Excel — where unless you go through a fiddly "Import" menu, Excel presumes that all dates in a CSV file are stored in US format MM/DD/YYYY — unless that would
 be impossible for a given date entry (on an individual record basis, apparently). So it mucks up all your data, unless you spot what's going on, or unless you just happen to be one of the chosen few living in the USA and working only with US standard data!
 (So much for opening a CSV file in Excel using the Windows context menu, directly from Windows Explorer! We'll leave that feature to LibreOffice, thank you very much!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If MS is going to force en-us on the entire English-speaking world, then will Microsoft at least push out an update (and modify the next version) so that we don't have to put up with all of this other nonsense as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even on my own tiny business Web site, at <a href="https://aaabit.com/products/lang-selection-ergonomic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
AAABIT.com</a>; I offer three to five variants of English! This is mainly done as a courtesy to my US and Canadian users!&nbsp;Give me a little more time, and I'll offer British Imperial (ahem, US Customary) units of measurement on my calculation tools as well as
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/metric-system-faq.txt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Metric System FAQ">
metric</a>! Granted, I'm offering specialist software for customising language options on Web sites; but the point remains: if I can do this, then surely Microsoft can?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I should mention pricing too, which is discriminatory against Europeans, and inordinately nice to Americans! For example, MS Office perpetual licenses: £389 GBP including taxes of 20% (so that 1/6 of the here total is tax). US price: $399 USD without
 sales tax! (Note that the GBP is very low compared to historical forex rates, when similarly discriminatory pricing has been in place!)</p>
<p>MAPS subscriptions: without even comparing prices (which are again cheaper in USD), you can have a business spread across 50 states, and one MAPS license. But if you have a business spread across Europe (a similar land-mass with a similar number of people),
 you need ONE MAPS LICENSE FOR EACH COUNTRY YOU OPERATE IN! With 28 countries in the EU (supposedly a "common market", though that doesn't yet stop companies like Microsoft from artificially carving the market up for intellectual property or "price customisation"
 purposes); is this fair and equal?</p>
<p>So they're charging us much more money, despite the "average" US citizen earning 50%–100% more than we do; and then not providing any customisations for our region, when by contrast they do all the necessary configurations for the USA! I gather that MS Office
 is proportionally more popular in Britain than the USA (it has historically enjoyed higher relative market share), and we have low rates of piracy here; yet MS doesn't seem to respect that! Instead they seem to be taking advantage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It Is RIDICULOUS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one saving grace here for MS is that I had EXCELLENT TECHNICAL SUPPORT from MS in India for a stalled installation process! I do applaud Microsoft's work to make their software more robust, but hope they won't take their eyes off the ball over the other
 things we need…</p>

<p>Yes, it happens every time when I first type into the search box.&nbsp; Notice I said the first time.&nbsp; The second or subsequent attempt works correctly,&nbsp; but only if I click the desktop before starting typing.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I remember that it is going to happen, so I can prevent it by typing each letter with a long pause between hitting the keys.</p>

                    <p>Hello, how do I change my Skype voicemail greeting?&nbsp; The current greeting is generic/system default.&nbsp; The options I see when I google this question are not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example under Tools, Options, Calls, there is not a specific option for voicemail.&nbsp; There is only an option for Forwarding and Voicemail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option under this to change voicemail greeting.&nbsp; When I go to My account settings there is only the option to forward calls or to go to voicemail but no option there to change the greeting (as the on-line versions show).&nbsp; I receive voice-mails
 and can retrieve them so I have this feature.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

<p>Why would you remove support for this? I'm completely amazed. I thought my old custom greeting got lost during an update but not to have a BASIC feature that has been available since Skype's inception is just foolish. I now can't change my message if I'm
 on vacation or travelling on business or anything. This is a major step backwards in terms of functionality. I'm pretty sure Microsoft is trying to let Google take over the world.</p>

</p><p><span>"We designed the default voicemail greetings to all users to standardize the feature across all Microsoft services."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>through.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>First, having a standard voicemail greeting cannot possibly work for someone who uses Skype for business. Or whose computer is set up to work in one language but expects callers using a different language. Second, what other Microsoft service uses a voicemail
 greeting? That may be the most blatantly made-up answer I've ever seen from Microsoft. It's completely unbelievable. This policy only makes it easier for Microsoft. It provides exactly zero benefit to the Skype user. To get voicemail a user has to pay for
 a Skype number. These are revenue generators you're running off. If I need a number in a particular place I am going to want to have that message customized for that place, not some generic folderol that Microsoft thinks is best. Microsoft should be ADDING
 voicemail customization features, not taking them away. My Skype number expires in a few months. About a month out I'm going to check again and see if I can customize my greeting. If not, I'm gone.</p>

<p>It is absolutely STAGGERING - although not at all surprising - that Microsoft continues to use its quasi-omnipotence to totally disregard the needs of its customers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I echo the above comments by JamesWEwing&nbsp; - a generic greeting is totally INappropriate for my Skype account, including the phone number that I PAY for, and I have never received Word One about my carefully prepared greeting being changed. As it is I have
 already had to "downgrade" - back to a working version (for others in need, it is 7.41.0.101) that actually rings when Skype calls come to my desktop, an issue with the latest, greatest update that "our technicians are working on: - and now the potential clients
 who call me will get a generic greeting that doesn't confirm they have reached me and my business?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft continues to ride roughshod over people who have been users&nbsp; - at not inconsiderable expense - for YEARS.&nbsp; Skype itself is NOT free to use (even leaving aside my paid phone number) because it wastes hours and causes anxiety and frustration, each
 of which has a cost. Skype was never perfect but it had some degree of honesty before it was swallowed up by Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Too bad that a march of the disgruntled thousands in this case is not going to help.&nbsp; I have many ideas for banners.</p>

<p><span>Microsoft is spending MILLIONS on removing useful functionality (like the custom voicemail greeting) and adding features of questionable benefits (Real time word count, or Deselect tool) just for the sake of change
 and, most importantly, to make maintaining the cumbersome juggernauts they're trying to pass off as user software, easier for them. I've found Skype to be incredibly useful and jumped on the Skype number service as soon as it was available. While the Skype
 number has been made less expensive over the years and an hour of call time is included in my Office 365 subscription it's gotten to the point where I am actively looking for a solution. Absent a change from MS on this voicemail debacle, I'll be migrating
 some of my services over to my free number on Google Voice and then using Skype only where it's free or where Google Voice doesn't have good support (like international calling). It's pretty clear that MS didn't bother to ask any users when they make these
 changes and judging from the number of complaints about this "improvement" wouldn't real give a flying-rat's patootie if they did.</span></p>

            How dumb can you be Microsoft? This is obviously a way to get people to abandon Skype. Voice messaging is such as basic feature and you aren't going to let us customize this. I'll be looking at alternative options that allow me to customize my greeting.

<p>I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GOT RID OF MY VOICEMAIL GREETING!!!&nbsp; WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU THINKING??? Skype doesn't work on my S7 EDGE and is a steaming pile of poo on my desktop without voicemail greeting. I find out today that people aren't leaving business messages
 because they don't know it's my voicemail. They think my phone has been disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot you mindless, faceless, Borg.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>As Windows 10 Technical Preview is still in developmental stage, you may expect some compatibility issues as of now and some features or settings might not work as expected.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>You can unpin and re-pin the folder in the Quick Access section. You can also hide the frequent files however there is no option as of now to get back the hidden frequent files.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>I recommend you join the Windows Insider Program to get more frequent preview builds and send your feedback straight to the people building Windows.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Once you’re an Insider, use the <strong>Windows Feedback app</strong> to tell us which features you love, which features you could do without, or when something could be better.</span></span></p>

            Hi Bob,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your answer. You are correct that rows and columns cannot be deleted but they can be hidden. My problem was that I wanted to hide rows 12 to 1 million, or however many rows exist beyond 12, and same for the columns. I just wanted to retain a tiny
 bit of visible data. <br />
So on a Mac, what you do is place your cursor in the row below the last one you wish to retain, and hit shift, command, and the down arrow. Then you right click to open the options menu and click hide. All the rows below your range disappear.
<br />
For columns you do the same thing, only using the right arrow instead of the down one.
<br />
<br />
Solved!<br />

            &nbsp;Hi Haukurso,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your information.<br />
Based on my experience, to assign the permission of a calendar, we use <strong>Add-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity
<em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em>:\calendar -User <em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em> -AccessRights Author</strong>. From the PowerShell command you are using, it seems not to be the default calendar of the room mailbox. So I'd like to confirm how you customized the
 calendar "Marketing".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. Please let us know how you created that customized calendar and how you accessed it in OWA.<br />
<br />
2. I understand that you have on-premises AD integrated with Office 365, but do you have on-premise Exchange server or Exchange Hybrid? &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Moreover, to confirm if the issue is related to the customized calendar or permission, please perform the following tests:<br />
3. Assign the same user an author permission to the default calendar of the room mailbox to see whether he can edit it successfully in Outlook and OWA.<br />
4. Assign that user the “owner” permission to the marketing calendar to see whether he can edit it successfully in Outlook and OWA.<br />
<br />
Please let us know the requested information when you have time.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alison

<p>
</p><p>1.The user opens another users calendar or uses the "open share calendar" to open the calendar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.There is no On-premises Exchange. </p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The user has now owner permission on the default calendar of the room. Still only works in OWA. Not in Outlook.

            Hi Haukurso,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
Could you share the screenshot of the result after running PowerShell? (Include the command you typed, especially the “identity” part)&nbsp;<br />
<em>Get-MailboxFolderPermission -identity <strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***:\folder</strong></em><br />
<p><span>I would like to know the structure of your calendar folders, because granting permission to those sub calendars is complex.&nbsp;</span><span>And also please remove that permission and then assign it to that calendar again to see whether it works.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, please let me know whether other users who grant the same permission to that folder encounter the same issue. &nbsp;And was the user who has this problem synced from local AD?<br />
<br />

    <title>OneNote screenshot -&#62; Annotate picture -&#62; Paste into one note - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daphoenix555  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote screenshot -&#62; Annotate picture -&#62; Paste into one note</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to do the following?<br />
<br />
I use microsoft onenote to take many screenshots of work that I am doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My general workflow is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Take notes</p>
<p>2. Take snapshot of my screen (i.e. pictures on the internet)&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Copy to clipboard</p>
<p>4. Add to page</p>
<p>5. Use microsoft One Note's built in draw tool to annotate image</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I really don't like using Microsoft's built in draw tool to annotate an image. I tend to get many formatting issues when my images are shifted around on the page, rendering all my notes useless because the annotations aren't lined up correctly to
 my images.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Between steps 3 and 4, I want the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.5 Modify the image directly with annotations in the clipboard. This means the final image going into a microsoft onenote page has drawings/ annotations on it already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I know you can do this with microsoft paint, but then you'd have to add 2 more steps</p>
<p>3.4 open up microsoft paint</p>
<p>3.6 screenclip completed image with annotations on it</p>
<p>3.7 close microsoft paint</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I would like the final workflow to look like this</p>
<p>1. Take notes</p>
<p>2. Take snapshot of screen, automatically goes to clipboard, <strong>annotation app opens up automatically</strong></p>
<p>3. Do edits to image</p>
<p>4. Save image and copy back to clipboard , <strong>annotation app automatically closes</strong></p>
<p>5 Paste wherever I want in Microsoft OneNote</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure this is possible to do with some edits in Windows with a 3rd party app, but I don't know how this is done.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>So I did a little more digging , this feature does not exist. Although you should still check out onenote addons like "Onetastic" or google search and maybe it'll pop up</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just do the following instead:</p>
<p>1. Open up a new blank page, add 2 columns</p>
<p>2. Take notes on left column, insert screenshots of videos on right side</p>
<p>3. Hotkey and use my penmode to annotate</p>
<p>4. go back to text mode and type text</p>
<p>
</p><p>gets the job done for me</p>
<p>
</p><p>otherwise I use either imgur or snag.gy to do image editing</p>
<p>(many solutions exist0</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Yes I am reluctant to switch to OneNote as in so many ways it is not up to Evernote, (Tho it does have a few "cons")</p>
<p>
</p><p>However this should work;</p>
<p>Install "Skitch for Evernote", do your screenshot &amp; annotate it there,</p>
<p>Do a Onenote Screen clip of that and send to onenote?</p>
<p>Close Skitch app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Haven't tried it yet - I was looking for good way to do this simply in OneNote - but given this shortcoming this would seem reasonable "work-around"</p>

            I complete agree. &nbsp;I am currently using both, but not being able to annotate image natively in OneNote is a real problem compared to Evernote....

    <title>Preventing users from deleting calendar items created by others in a - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Preventing users from deleting calendar items created by others in a calendar of a shared mailbox</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p><br />
We have created a shared mailbox for a public calendar use. But anyone can delete any items on the calendar. We want to limit users to be able to delete an item only if they created themselves.</p>
<p>For example; User1 and User2 have got permissions on the shared mailbox, it's added in their Outlook clients as well. User1 and User2 can create items, appointments, etc. on the calendar of the shared mailbox. We want User1 to be able to delete only the
 items he created. User2 must also be able to delete items he created himself. But User1 must not be able delete a calendar item created by User2 and vice-versa. Is it possible at all?</p>
<p>Here's what we have done so far:</p>
<p>1- Created a security group of the people who have got permission on the shared mailbox (*** Email address is removed for privacy *** for example)</p>
<p>2- Assigned the group <strong>NonEditingAuthor</strong> right for the calendar by using the cmdlet below:</p>
<p><strong>Add-MailboxFolderPermission *** Email address is removed for privacy ***:\Calendar -AccessRights NonEditingAuthor -User *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong></p>
<p><br />
<br />
Users can still delete items created by others. Is it because system determines the shared mailbox itself as the creator of the items instead of picking the users seperately? Is it feasible at all to achieve what we need to do?</p>
<p><br />
Looking forward to hearing your advices.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
Bruce</p>

<p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>Not possible. User can delete items created by others. It's by design Shared mailboxes can use to provide a common calendar, allowing multiple users to schedule /view/delete calendar/email items.</p>
<p>About this feature requirement go to the customer Feedback for Microsoft Office 365 site.</p>
<p>1.Select the feedback forums from the list </p>
<p>2.Check out the ideas others have suggested. If you have a suggestion that’s not listed yet, submit your own.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Racksn</strong>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If an option or setting isn’t retained when Excel has restarted, it can be due to conflicts with the installed add-ins of the application. As an initial troubleshooting step, I’d suggest that you
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">install any available Office updates</a></strong> and check if it resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you may try to launch or <strong>open the Excel app in safe mode</strong>. This will help us isolate if the issue is caused by an incompatible add-in. Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the shortcut icon for Excel.</li><li>Press and hold the <strong>CTRL</strong> key and double-click the application shortcut.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> when a window appears asking if you want to start the application in
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, I’d recommend that you <strong>run a repair</strong> for the Office application. This is usually being used if Excel or other Office apps won’t work correctly. Click
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">here</a></strong> for the instructions.</p>

<p>Either in the query behind your report or in the report itself, you can use the NZ() function to display something in a control if the value is null... An example is:</p>
<p>=NZ([Last_Name],"No Name Available")</p>

<p>=NZ([EMP_MIL_RANK],[EMP_LAST_NAME])</p>
<p>FYI... Not sure if it matters (or is correct)&nbsp;but I am counting the number NonBlank EMP_MIL_RANK records in the Page Header section with&nbsp; ... =DCount("EMP_MIL_RANK","qCIVexception","[EMP_MIL_RANK] &gt; 'A'")</p>

<h2>            Outlook contacts sync issue in android &#40;v7.0 &#47; Oneplus 3&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've moved from Lumia 920 to oneplus 3 a year ago &amp; while the initial set up outlook account was added &amp; the contacts were synced flawlessly. New contacts were saved in phone &amp; one fine day outlook contacts were missing. I checked the accounts &amp; confirmed
 that outlook was present. I've deleted them &amp; added the account again but still not getting synced. I am not 100% sure, but I might have noticed this after some updates. It was running on 6.x &amp; later updated to 7.0. Any ideas??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rohit</p>

<p>Hi Rohit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a possibility that an issue occurred after installing the update on your device that's why you're having issues with your Outlook contacts. To look more closely into this issue, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Just to clarify, which Outlook contacts are missing? Is it the newly saved contacts?
</li><li>Have you checked if there is an available pending update for Outlook for Android?</li><li>How many email accounts were connected to Outlook for Android?</li><li>Have you tried logging into your account using a web browser to check if the contacts are visible there?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hey Paola,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please find my responses below.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Just to clarify, which Outlook contacts are missing? Is it the newly saved contacts?&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rohit: All outlook contacts. I've gone to contacts filter &amp; enabled/disabled outlook alone &amp; confirmed.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you checked if there is an available pending update for Outlook for Android?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rohit: I am not using outlook app right now. During the attempt of restoring the contacts I've removed them. I am adding outlook via 'Add accounts option'. So no explicit outlook app installed at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How many email accounts were connected to Outlook for Android?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rohit: When I was using outlook, 2 accounts were connected. Live, Gmaiil, Office 365. Contacts were synced at this point. One fine day all were disappeared. Calls were coming with no names &amp; I noticed that it was all from outlook contacts. As part of
 multiple attempts I've removed &amp; added outlook app. All possible combinations were tried.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried logging into your account using a web browser to check if the contacts are visible there?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rohit: Yes they are visible via people.live.com; I know that workaround is to export them from web portal to gmail as csv or something. But I don't want to clutter gmail &amp; just wanted to use live contacts as it is. I wish windows phone market was active
 so that I could have stayed!! :( I still miss my Lumia 920. The only issue was with battery. Unable to get healthy one too. Tried getting one from a battery online retailer based out of China via ali baba but it doesn't last too. And I was forced to move to
 a different eco system &amp; now I am here. With android :|</p>
<p>

    <title>Lost Excel file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomas o&#39;connor iv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Excel file</h2>
                    I have been using Office for about nine months. I have an Excel file called To_Do_List 2016 which I update daily and save. Several days ago I tried to open it in Excel (file, open) and it showed it was there under yesterday but when I tried to open it
 I got a message it must have been erased, moved or renamed. I then looked for it in File Explorer but it does not appear in the folder although 2015 and others are still there. Even if I lost the latest copy, i.e.; yesterdays save, the original should be there
 from the prior day. I tried using File Explorer and right clicked on the folder but there was nothing to restore. It has to be on the drive somewhere, any ideas? I find it hard to believe I would have deleted it as I have not inadvertently deleted a file in
 about a decade! Thanks in advance.

<h3> briangregor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 - email doesn&#39;t send when using address book entry, but does when address is typed in directly</h2>
                    Originating emails are getting stuck in my outbox. &nbsp;I can reply to emails from other senders just fine. &nbsp;I've found that this occurs only when I use the address book to input the addressee(s). &nbsp;An email does not get stuck when I type the email address
 directly into the 'To' entry line. &nbsp;I used to be able to use the address book for inputting addresses. &nbsp;Is this a problem with the address book? &nbsp;Any suggestions on how to correct?

            <p>The fix is to make a new profile.&nbsp;Before I'd do that, I'd clear the autocomplete cache -&nbsp;File, Options, &nbsp;Mail - about 2/3 down the page. That might fix it and is less hassle (IMHO).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you make a new contact, does that contact work? You can use a fake address (you can use your name @ my domain) - if it leaves the outbox, it worked and you should get an ndr back.
