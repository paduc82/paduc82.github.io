<h2>            Access 2016 Combo Box auto expand issue</h2>
                    I have a form in Access 2017 with a combo box tied to a user name table. &nbsp;When I start typing the name of a user into the form auto expand works but if I tab out of the box it blanks out instead of keeping the name of the user. &nbsp;I have another combo box
 on the form that works perfectly fine. &nbsp;Any ideas as to what could be going on here?

            What are the RowSource, BoundColumn, ColumnCount and ColumnWidths properties of the control?&nbsp; If the RowSource property is the name of a query, what is the query's SQL statement?<br />
<br />
Note that personal names are unsuitable as keys, as they can legitimately be duplicated.&nbsp; People should always be identified by a distinct numeric key.&nbsp; The following is an example of how a combo box to select an employee by name might be set up:<br />
<br />
ControlSource:&nbsp;&nbsp; EmployeeID (for a bound control; leave blank if the combo box is an unbound 'navigational' control)<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName &amp; " " &amp; LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the unit of the last one to inches.&nbsp; The important thing is that the dimension is zero to hide the first column.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can concatenate the names so that the last name is first, which would be better with a large list of names as it allows the user to enter the initial characters of the last name and progressively go to the first match as each character is
 entered:<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT EmployeeID, LastName &amp; ", " &amp; FirstName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;<br />
<br />
However, selecting a person purely by name is not really satisfactory, as personal names can be duplicated (I worked with two Maggie Taylors).&nbsp; To differentiate between them, further details can be shown in another column or columns of the combo box's list,
 e.g. job title, department etc.<br />

                    <p>I am having a problem with OneNote 2010 where its&nbsp;memory usage spikes to over 1 gigabyte and slows my computer down and freezes OneNote.</p>
<p>OneNote 2007 worked much better than this.</p>
<p>I did convert all of my notebooks to 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there any fixes for this?</p>

            <p>That is not possible for XP.</p>
<p>The XP version of that solution is this:</p>
<p>1. In OneNote, click on the File tab,</p>
<p>2. Click on Options,</p>
<p>3. Click on Save &amp; Back-Up,</p>
<p>4. Click on 'Optimize All Files Now',</p>
<p>5. Wait for a few minutes to finish,</p>
<p>6. Close OneNote &amp; re-open,</p>
<p>7. Open Task Manager &amp; watch memory usage for ONENOTE.EXE.</p>
<p>Dramatic difference!!!</p>

    <title>Issues Opening Word In IE11 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d-tech15  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues Opening Word In IE11</h2>
                    <p>Question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a technician at a small school system and I am having issues opening up Word documents from IE 11.&nbsp; When I click on the link, I am presented with the ribbon along the bottom of the screen, asking if I want to "Open" or "Cancel".&nbsp; I choose Open and Microsoft
 Word opens, but nothing loads.&nbsp; I am presented with&nbsp;an empty Word window.&nbsp; &nbsp; There are no blank documents, no pages, nothing.&nbsp; I can switch over to Chrome or Firefox and everything works like it should.&nbsp; The documents&nbsp;download and open right up.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can also
 right click the link and chose to "save the target" and it saves to the hard drive and opens just fine (in IE 11).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent a good couple of hours (over the course of a few days) researching to see if there are any available solutions.&nbsp; I contacted our state help desk and this is the first time they have heard&nbsp;of such issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have checked the settings on IE,
 the settings for Microsoft Word, etc., and nothing works.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I the only one who has had issues with this?&nbsp;&nbsp;My Google search results are&nbsp;telling me that I am all alone in this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please Help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<p>IE 11.0.96</p>
<p>Windows 7 Professional SP 1</p>
<p>Microsoft Office 2013 Professional </p>

<p>
</p><p>If these were all 64-bit systems, I would suspect this is a variation of the problem that 64-bit systems had with PDF files a few months ago. This was apparently fixed by an update from either Microsoft or Adobe (not sure which.)</p>

    <title>PROBLEMS AFTER 5800 XM UPGRADE TO VERSION 40 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nithinsbt  say:</h3>
<h2>            PROBLEMS AFTER 5800 XM UPGRADE TO VERSION 40</h2>
                    
<p>Yesterday,I updated my 5800 with FW 40.0.005. I really impressed with the new easy way of move in touch screen but this version has a big problem that I considered.</p>
<p>First,you have&nbsp;to&nbsp;set as a ring an .mp4 file or any video file and then lock your mobile 5800.</p>
<p>When you have an incomming call the screen isn't working normally and it stops for miliseconds and starts again! sound also !</p>
<p><br />
Does any one having two moving bars on down side of screen while a call comes in while in lock mode one saying answer and another unlock , I think this is the problem for screen and sound not working normally, Is there any way to stop this bars</p>
<p>With regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nithin</p>

<p>The two moving bars is a new feature. You slide your finger across the bar with the option you chose. I am not experiencing your problem, however it might be due to your phone having little RAM left and it unable to cope with both the graphics animation
 and a video of a particular size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no way to remove the bars. What you can do however is to optimize your RAM. You will need either JB Taskman or KillMe, and Memcheck. All three are apps.</p>

<p>Let me explain my problems since updating. The alarm clock....wakes you up but the STOP didn't work on prior versoin too well BUT this is much worse you get the snooze to work only. It is the same on reminders for the calender. You have to do about 5 snoozes
 before eventually it dies giving up on you pressing whatever secret button it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also the Contacts&nbsp;Bar on the top is really hard going&nbsp;- the contacts didnt migrate too well either, all my telephones swapped to main contacts instead of mobile which will no take all week to sort out. OHHH and the slide thing is pure luck if you get it
 to slide to new contacts let alone the one you want to call (if by chance the dont have a mobile that is!!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Camera continues to be totally **bleep**, too much flash man!! why they don't understand a choice of 1 or 2 LED's at Flash settings would be a LOGICAL thing to do real soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sortcuts on the bottom are great but could be even better if there were less times the torch (bright lights) I use was activated while I just finished a call putting it in my pocket forgetting to first lock the screen. Hours after feeling my leg was
 on fire there it was leaving me a dead phone before even getting to work in the morning...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel NOKIA has employed idiots on the testing phones OR just don't care!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure I could go on but all makes sence to buy something else that does exactly what it says on the box. I am feeling stupid that I did not read the problems pages before I bought this BEST of BEST during my search for a good investment on a cel phone.
 NEXT has to be something beginning with EYE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those who are interested why I chose to purchase this **bleep** read on. ON+ON!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first phone was a SONY Mars Bar 1992, it was way too big and eventually fell into the toilet whilst I was&nbsp;being nice at a girlfiends house by lifting up the toilet seat, The thing slid out my&nbsp;shirt pocket. It did me the great favor of opening the door
 to a smaller and way more powerfull Nokia. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It lasted 2 years and I killed it slowly with the abuse of sitting on it, dropping it, but one day the centre button had a heart attack. I decided to upgrade again and got a Nokia GSM with camera, was pretty poor also but it was a low resolution thing but
 works to the day and in fact my wife is using it and still loving it. She didn't like the pink sony I had bought on holiday that unfortunately had 12 languages but not Spanish - how wierd is that??? Nor French either come to think of it Froggy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhow I do feel truly ripped off. It's no wonder the company that sold this phone is out of business. I feel guilty after buying one let alone selling so many.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are my thoughts - probably worth that penny</p>

<p>Odd i dont have those problems neither do a million or so other users .</p>
<p>Did you do something wrong in the upgrade&nbsp; or have a conflicting app on your memory card .</p>
<p>Best advice would be to copy off any data and&nbsp; format the memory card&nbsp;&nbsp; . Reinstall firmware&nbsp; /probably find that V5 is our for your phone&nbsp; now .</p>

<p>Whenever an appointment is created and attendees invited, the attendees themselves cannot add further resources to the appointment. Is there any way to change settings in Exchange or Outlook that will enable invited attendees to add more attendees or resources
 via the scheduling assistant?</p>

<h2>            what&#39;s the disadvantages of a huge table having 70 &#43; fields</h2>
                    <p>hi everybody i have a database which main table having 70+ fields with mix datatype except memo datatype</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>after i will finish this database i will split it in front-end and back-end and will share on the network</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as i haven't that much experience so is there anybody who could please tell me the disadvantages of a table with 70+ fields on it to share on the network for various functions such as reports , queries , pivot tables, crostab queries etc, &nbsp;is there more
 chances of crashes or ............</p>
<p>though in the queries and forms properties i have select the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Records Locks = Edited record&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which will help me not to crash the database if the users are trying to access a particular record at the same time&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>This depends, but 70 is rather large and would make me think that your data is probably not properly normalized.</p>
<p>Normalization ensure optimal performance, ease of querying/reporting...&nbsp; so it is crucial to get the structural design, normalization, right before anything else.</p>

<div>[AgentName] &nbsp; &nbsp;text</div>
<div><br />
<div>[Date] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; date/time</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>second table is [File_Details] where i have more than 70 fields but the fields are not repeating and i have joined both [FileNo] and [File_details] with foreign key [FileNo] which is common in both tables</div>

            You should not be using field names to define the data being held in them. This is a horizontal&nbsp;structure&nbsp;where you should have a vertical structure. You should, at least be trying for 3rd normal form.
<div><br />
<div>Your details table should look more like this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>FileDetailsID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>FileID (FK)</div>
<div>DataTypeID (FK)</div>
<div>Value</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, instead of 5 fields you should have 5 RECORDS Use the DataTypeID to identify what data the record stores.<br />

            I gave you the example. Practically any data can be modeled that way. You create a table of data types.&nbsp;

<div><br />
<div>The links Daniel gave you on normalization also explain this concept.&nbsp;</div>

Well, this looks like a good spreadsheet - but a good spreadsheet is rarely a good table!</p>
<p>It would appear that you have two (probably many more) Rates - MED rates, MAK rates; that suggests that you have a many to many relationship: each File has many Rates, and many Nets; each kind of Rate can apply to many Files.</p>
<p>Also, the MedMakTotal field sets off some mental alarm bells: if it is indeed a total of the values of other fields, then it should
<em>simply not exist</em> in your table! You will almost never store a field which can be calculated from other fields. Doing so wastes disk (trivial these days); wastes time (an addition is MUCH faster than a disk fetch); but most importantly risks storing
 invalid data. If a field MedMAKTotal is a sum of a Med field and a Mak field, then if either one of those fields were to be edited, you would have a total which is
<em>wrong</em>, with no easy way to tell that it is wrong or why! Just store the base data and calculate the total in a Query on the fly.</p>

<h2>            SharePoint Online and eDiscovery compliance managmeent</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I've created an new site collection with eDiscovery template, described in:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-an-eDiscovery-Center-in-SharePoint-Online-a18f8975-aa7f-43b4-a7d6-001d14744d8e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-an-eDiscovery-Center-in-SharePoint-Online-a18f8975-aa7f-43b4-a7d6-001d14744d8e</a></p>
<p>I'm able to&nbsp;adding one of our sites (as example the sales site (<a href="http://customer.sharepoint.com/sales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://customer.sharepoint.com/sales</a> )) into de eDiscovery center and i see the site in status placed in "hold status" then i'm able to download
 the full conent including this site</p>
<p>But, when i delete the site "sales" (also deletes from first and second recycle bin) we are'nt able to restore this&nbsp; site, (site is definitely gone)</p>
<p>How could i restore this site&nbsp; ? Because the site was placed in HOLD status.</p>

<p>Thank you </p>

<p>hi adriaan,</p>
<p>given the situaiton, i have sent you a pm to collect some information. you can check and reply to it at
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations.</p>
<p>we may try to determine the situation based on the above, while please be aware that the contents that we deleted from the site collection second-stage recycle bin would be generally unrecoverable.</p>
<p>and, i would explain that the in-place hold is for preventing us from directly deleting the specific site, after we apply it and it finished ediscovery in-place hold processing.</p>
<p>therefore, if the site which&nbsp;we have enabled in-place hold can be deleted,&nbsp;we can first&nbsp;re-check&nbsp;the configuration and the status of the in-place hold on the site.</p>
<p>for your references, we would received a message as the following when we try to delete a on-hold site.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6f6ebd85-fb00-4ad9-bef0-bd29a745891d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6f6ebd85-fb00-4ad9-bef0-bd29a745891d" /></a></p>

<p>Hi Adriaan,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>Yes, it is not feasible to directly delete the site that has been applied in-place hold to.</p>
<p>Regarding the "attachment in shared documents folder", if the case is that you deleted a file from the library which is at Site contents &gt; Document, after in-place hold being enabled, the original files will be saved as a copy in Preservation Hold Library.</p>
<p>The Site collection administrators can access the library &gt; Site contents &gt; Preservation Hold Library to recover the files.</p>
<p>You may further share the details on your actions for us to determine the situation and we may continue to discuss the case.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Rene</p>

<p>- Style libary</p>
<p>- Exports</p>
<p>- Forms</p>
<p>I see only in the subsite customer.sharepoint.com/sites/ed/req (is ediscovery center)</p>
<p>the options</p>
<p>- Add an app</p>
<p>- Ediscovery sets</p>
<p>- Savers</p>

<p>hi adriaan,</p>
<p>could you please specify which "option" you are trying to find? appreciate it if you can share some screenshots with us for our references. to insert a screenshot, please click use rich formatting &gt;&nbsp;<a href="http://community.office365.com/tiny_mce/plugins/insertmedia/img/insert_image.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcommunity.office365.com%2ftiny_mce%2fplugins%2finsertmedia%2fimg%2finsert_image.gif" /></a>
 insert/edit media &gt; browse... &gt; insert.</p>
<p>i would assume&nbsp;you&nbsp;are trying to access the preservation hold library. it is located in the site which is "in-place hold", instead of the ediscovery center itself.</p>
<p>for example, if we put the sub-site of http://<em>organization</em>.sharepoint.com/sites/sales "on hold", and, underneath it, we deleted a file in a document library, we can find the copy in the preservation hold library which is at "~/sites/sales" &gt; site
 contents.</p>
<p>in addition, i would explain that the blog you referred to is applied to sharepoint 2013 server, which may be not exactly applicable to sharepoint online.</p>
<p>please feel free to post back at any time.</p>

<h3> kenburnett  say:</h3>
<h2>            when will free dvd player download&#63;</h2>
                    <p>i did windows 10 testing on my windows7 &nbsp;/ vista by doing a clean instal over Vista</p>
<p>subsequently in august i upgraded the windows 7 pc to windows 10 and also did my laptop which was also on windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>both were windows 7 home premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>on my laptop when i had a problem with apps i was told to do a reset? great it removed all my windows 7 programs but problem was resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i cam across the info about the windows 10 dvd player app whilst searching for a soundbar on a review site so i went to the store and it wants to charge over £11 for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have not even tried it on second windows 7 laptop upgraded to 10 or my quad core desktop that was dual &nbsp;boot that went to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i use different microsoft accounts on each pc to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so can i get the free dvd app via download as going back to windows 10 is not option on 3 pc's if they are all the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please advise as currently using VLC free dvd player</p>

            <p>one of the problems i was having was reported as event viewer error messages for media player that was supposed to be removed by windows 10 update</p>
<p>extract of forum</p>
<p>========================================================================</p>
<p>Hopefully, you can see my replies to your kind response but after successfully unticking "Windows Media Center" as you instructed, I am still getting the 20 - 30 WMC warning messages every time I boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely, you (the software people) can trace to the point&nbsp;where these messages are generated and then deduce back how&nbsp;to &nbsp;ensure that they are&nbsp;not&nbsp;trigger by whatever is causing them to occur, or have I missed something (being&nbsp;an ex-programmer myself)?</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the below steps and check if it helps in resolving the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>In search tab type "Turn Windows features on or off" and click on the link when it prompted.</li><li>Now look for "Media feature" and expand it by clicking on it.</li><li>Under media feature you can find "Windows Media Center", un-check the box by clicking it.</li><li>Next, you will get a little warning box. Just click "yes" because it's asking if your perfectly okay with disabling it.</li><li>The last step is to<strong>&nbsp;reboot.</strong>&nbsp;A message saying you must restart the computer will pop up. Just shut it down or restart and log back in.</li></ul>
<p><span><span>I hope this information helps. Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Thank You.</span></p>
<p><span>==========================================</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>i id this and yes error messages went away but having ticked it to enable media player it has not been suggested as windows update after re-boot</span></p>

            Hi <strong>Melissa</strong>,&nbsp;<br />

<strong>Outlook.com UserVoice</strong>. This way, our developers will have an idea of what features we can work on next. Please proceed
<strong><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/284136-outlook-com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.&nbsp;<br />

<p>I just received a firmware update that resolved all my issues. The Surface Pro 3 works great now. I never had to reinstall or update drivers. Windows Update fixed my problems. Battery life was amazing, and worked well for an event where I ran it all day
 long without charging. Very happy with the firmware update. My issue is resolved now. Thanks!</p>

            Skype syncs your contacts with the People app in Windows 10, so Microsoft is expecting users to edit any contact info there. Your best option if you want to see this a built in feature of Skype is to submit feedback:

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot this issue, I'd like to suggest you try online repair to see the outcome. You can follow the steps below to do that:</p>
<p>1. Click Win+E to open file explorer.<br />
2. Type this path to open app list: Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Programs and Features.<br />
3. Right-click Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus&gt;Change&gt;click Online Repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still can't open all Apps, please share with me more info as below to let me have a better understanding of your scenario:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;The detailed version number of your OS(Click Win+R&gt;type CMD&gt;OK e.g. 10.017763.1) and Office(you can find the version number in&nbsp;Programs and Features e.g. 180x build xxx).</p>
<p>2. Does this issue happen to other users in your organization?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neo</p>
<p>

<p>Okay, so this morning everything opened fine and is working. I believe it might have been an update not working quite right with Office 365. I will keep you posted though.</p>
<p>I did change one setting yesterday and it seems to have worked for now.</p>
<p>Thank you for the help.</p>

    <title>Publisher &#39;Fill colour&#39; not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tony ja  say:</h3>
<h2>            Publisher &#39;Fill colour&#39; not working</h2>
                    Good morning<br />
From what I can see, I am running Pub. 2002 on Windows XP professional.<br />
I have been trying for months to use this laptop [Compaq Evo N620c] with Publisher.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;PS.I have used it successfully for many years on other computers.<br />
It works well, but now I am wanting to use it a lot more, especially with graphics etc for education,flyers etc..<br />
After weeks of trying, just by myself [I have little knowledge about these things and searching the internet for HELP sites for Publisher, either my problem wasn't mentioned or didn't work for me.<br />
<br />
Basically the problem is in the 'Fill Colour' mode. I make up my poster / flyer / presentation and go to fill colour where I need it.<br />
[I've done it for years as I said, so I know what I'm doing]........ on other computers.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
After sorting colours /&nbsp; textures etc. etc. I click on 'Fill' and nothing happens. The box / shape stays white/&nbsp; and I don't what has happened - if anything???????????...........on this computer.<br />
<br />
BUT........If I transfer what I save onto a memory stick and plug it into my other computer, lo and behold, we have the appropriate boxes / shapes filled with colour of one of the colour choices I made.<br />
<br />
So it appears to work but I can't see or monitor it in the process<br />
Frustration x infinity!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
I would really appreciate it, if some one out there could solve this for me.<br />
Much appreciated in advance<br />

=====================================================<br />
If the same exact steps produce the expected results on a different system...<br />
I would wonder if the Video Driver on the failing system requires an update.<br />
<br />
One way to test this would be to reduce the Graphics Hardware Acceleration.<br />
If you reduce the Acceleration as per the instructions in the following article <br />
and realize an improvement...it is a strong indication that the video driver needs
<br />
to be updated.<br />

            <p>In addition to Volunteer J's advice, try changing your printer to a different printer and if that helps then reinstall your default printer. Try changing to the XPS printer.&nbsp;Printer drivers can go corrupt and can also cause these sort of problems.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, is your default printer a color printer?</p>

            Thanks J, but my issues were not to do with videos and the more I delved into the site you gave me, the more I felt it was not what I required or relating to my problem. It was very technical.<br />
Thanks anyway<br />

            Hi David,<br />
Thanks for your response.<br />
I am not using nor do I have a printer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 'Fill Colour' function and in fact the line colour function - which I have now discovered doesn't work either [visibly]&nbsp; ,should work without a printer, just like my other computer does.<br />
I don't know where to go from here, really!!!<br />

===========================================<br />
The video driver is not just about video as in movies...it's about <br />
text, colors, graphics, resolution... The video driver controls <br />
everything you see on a computer screen.<br />
<br />
Maybe the following article would shed some light:<br />
<br />
driver - technical definition<br />
<a href="http://computer.yourdictionary.com/driver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://computer.yourdictionary.com/driver</a><br />
(be sure to read the section..."Drivers Can Drive You Crazy!")<br />
<br />
I would still suggest that you reduce your graphics hardware <br />
acceleration and see if it improves the issue. If no improvement<br />
is realized it will be no problem to return the acceleration to full.<br />
<br />
If reducing the graphics hardware acceleration improves the issue <br />
in Publisher...a video driver update would be the next step.<br />
<br />
If you notice in the Introduction section of the following Microsoft <br />
KB article...it says "Colors do not appear on the screen as expected"<br />

    <title>How do I reduce the &#34;size&#34; of a photo in MB without changing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toneml  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I reduce the &#34;size&#34; of a photo in MB without changing the physical dimensions of the photo&#63;</h2>
                    If I take photos with my BlackBerry, I have the option to email them as Original, Large, Medium, or Small. For example, this takes a photo through a range from 1.7MB down to 109.8KB. The dimensions of the sent photo remains the same full size.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Transferring these same photos to my computer gives me the full size dimensions and MB, but if I use Microsoft Picture Manager to make them smaller for emailing, I get a tiny thumbnail in the middle of the page. What other options do I have?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need to do this because Outlook takes a long time to send when 2 or more photos exceed a total of 4MB.<br />
<div><br />

            You have identified the 2 variables that affect the image file size, the dimensions (number of pixels) and the resolution (amount of detail in the picture).
<br />
<br />
Tools like picasa can be used to modify both variables.&nbsp; You can also find free online download tools to do that for you.<br />
<br />
Another option is in your Image Viewer application to save as JPG file type and modify the "resolution" or "image quality". You'll have to play with the settings to find the quality and file size mix you can live with.&nbsp; Make sure to keep your original file
 separate so you still have option to print high quality.<br />

                    <p>I cannot sync calendar and contacts between outlook 2016 on my PC and outlook.com on the web.</p>
<p>
If I examine the account on Outlook 2016 on my PC (by going to 'change') it says the sever is *******m.hotmail.com (I am not sure if the characters are confidential).<br />
<br />
If I sign into my email account on the web application it has no new messages or calendar entries. &nbsp;The address in the browser address bar seems to indicate a different server. &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Is this the root of the problem?</strong></span><br />
<br />
In recent days I have added and removed an alias in my outlook.com account. &nbsp;I created another outlook.com email address and deleted the old one. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is it possible to delete everything from outlook.com and start again with a new outlook.com address? &nbsp;(I have most of the email, contacts and calendar data in a pst file on my hard drive).</p>

<h2>            LiveTiles App Installation Error - Correlation Id</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A long shot, but I'll try. We're installing LiveTiles Design Manager App for one of our clients. Created a new app catalog site and uploaded the app there. Now when I try to install the app into the main site collection, it is returning the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26186b27-413a-40ed-8fa1-6ae006e33361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26186b27-413a-40ed-8fa1-6ae006e33361" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The request is not being created (checked the app catalog site). The account is a global admin, the site collection's administrator and a member of the site owners group.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did anyone have a similar problem with an app installation? LiveTiles support turns to be quite useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is even more frustrating is that&nbsp;you can't get the error details from the Correlation Id. I know the reasoning (SharePoint Online is a multi-tenancy environment, blah blah blah) but it's bloody stupid. I can't even create a support ticket directly with
 Microsoft - under O365 &gt; Support &gt; New Service Request &gt; Sites and document sharing, I only have two options for third-party support companies. Hopefully MS support engineers are reading this forum and can look up the error:
</p>
<p><span>Correlation ID: e0***fc1</span> </p>
<p><span>Date and Time: 5/07/2017 4:58:54 PM</span> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help and ideas are greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Word 2016 will not print envelopes from the center paper tray</h2>
                    <p>Word 2016 will not print envelopes to the center paper tray on my Epson WP-4023.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have envelopes set in the rear paper tray. That tray feeds from the center. Envelopes printed perfectly from there with Word 2011. I did not have to select the rear paper tray or anything special.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word 2016 will not automatically select the rear paper tray. I have to select it from the Mac "Print Settings" menu, but Word just prints in the blank space on the right where there is no paper. How do I know that it is printing there? I know because I hear
 it printing but nothing is printed on the envelope, and when I print from the main paper tray, it always prints to the right no matter which of the customs settings I use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the custom options as well as the "Use settings from your printer" option. Nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word 2011, the "Use settings from your printer" option works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Outlook - sent PDF files damaged</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Office 365 and some time ago I run into a problem, my sent PDF attachments were damaged. But this problem occured only to some PDF files. It means that if I sent 3 PDF files it might occure only to 2 files. At first I got it resolved by manually adding
 attachments (before that I just dragged files), but now is problem back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strange part is that, if I look sent items mail then there are all PDF files fine.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi I’m Linnell I'm a Independent Advisor here to help. 
<br />You might run a quick office repair to see if that resolves the problem.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair...</a>
<br />Click on Select operating System and follow directions.
<br />The only other thing that I have come across is the COM add in can cause problems 
<br />If repair does not fix problem 
<br />Please try these troubleshooter: 
<br />Start outlook In Safe Mode
<br />Open Outlook in safe mode and then try to attach an attachment: 
<br />1. Close Outlook. 
<br />2. Press the windows key + R on the keyboard to open the Run window. 
<br />3. In Run window and type outlook /safe (space between 'outlook' and '/'.) 
<br />If you are able to work with Outlook without any problem then the issue might be due to add-ins. In order to disable the add-ins follow the steps given below: 
<br />
<br />1. Open Outlook, click on File &lt;Options&lt; Add-ins. 
<br />2. Under Manage select COM Add-ins. 
<br />3. Click on GO options beside Manage, uncheck all the add-ins and click Ok. 
<br />4. Try to open Outlook and add Attachment and check if it works fine. 
<br />Then add the COM back in one by one to figure out which one is causing the problem. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Please feel free to ask questions and let us know how it goes. 
<br />Regards

    <title>Excel 2016 Automation Error after Office updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> surazal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 Automation Error after Office updates</h2>
                    <p><span>I have a workbook that uses CheckBox controls. Recently I started getting an Automation Error every time I open the workbook.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If I copy the workbook to a non-trusted area, open it and enable macros it functions without any errors until I save it and try and open it again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I ran the Office Online Repair and it all started working normally until after the next reboot or Windows Update – not sure which.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have tried unregistering and re-registering mscomct2.ocx as well as dereferencing and re-referencing it&nbsp;in the VBA project – which does not help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am running Office Professional Plus 2016 (standalone version – installed from DVD) on Windows 10 Pro (Version 10.0.10586).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The same problem occurs on another PC that is running the same versions of Office and Windows.</span></p>
<p>
<span>I believe that this is probably caused by one of the Office or Windows Updates that have been applied, but would appreciate any help in finding a permanent solution.</span></p>
