    <title>Excel 2016 &#40;a&#41; won&#39;t apply fill cell colour initially. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel 2016 &#40;a&#41; won&#39;t apply fill cell colour initially. then after save, exit and re-open previous selection flashed black once and reverts to no fill.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background:</p>
<p>- We run Windows 10 + Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business 2016</p>
<p>- All updates are current</p>
<p>- All worked well until this morning.</p>
<p>- Problem affects any of the excel documents previously created (Yesterday, last week, last month etc..) irrespective if saved on desktop, shared folder, documents folder etc.</p>
<p>- Does not seem to occur with new excel documents created today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Problem:</p>
<p>When selecting a cell or range of cells in previous excel documents (created before today), we can't seem to fill cells. i.e after fill cell is selected, cell colour remains unchanged.</p>
<p>In some cases, when you save, exit and re-open, the cells we previously attempted to fill with colour "yellow" is highlighted/filled black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Attempted solutions:</p>
<p>* Checked conditional formatting</p>
<p>* Cleared all other formatting</p>
<p>* Re-started PC</p>
<p>* Checked "High Contrast Settings" in control panel as suggested in another forum.</p>
<p>

    <title>Microsoft coloud bang problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hoshang verma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft coloud bang problem</h2>
                    I bought Microsoft's nokia coloud band md1c. After 8 months of purchase it malfunctioned and when i took it to service center, they refused to repair that saying the device only had 6 months warranty. i showed them the broucher which came with the device
 clearly mentioning 1 year warranty. I contacted every possible person of microsoft to resolve the issue but in result i got only bunch of complaint numbers. I am not writing here to bother you Microsoft people again, but i only ask you one last time before
 throwing my device in trash, the device is not charging, when connected to charger it charges for 1 minute only then shuts off charging automatically. If there is any thing which i can do myself at home that would be a great help. Kindly don't ask me to go
 to your so called customer service center. They are only some thugs hired by you.

            I am not asking for any warranty issue, your service center has taken care that i don't claim that. I am asking, is there any soft troubleshooting method which i can apply on my device so that it works fine. Device charges only for a minute then stops
 charging. If you have faced the same issue with other device and know how to troubleshoot then kindly mention it,otherwise simply deny that you can&nbsp; help. As mentioned earlier i am already out of hope of your service center and won't buy any hardware device
 from microsoft and also avoid any other product from microsoft.&nbsp;

            Is this your solution? I bought this product thinking it's Microsoft's product. Now you are trying to avoid me referring me to third party seller? If i buy your surface laptop and its processor dies, then am i supposed to contact microsoft or intel? Does
 microsoft has any liability regarding its promises? Your service center treated me the same way they kept on referring to some other dealers. What kind of strategy is this of yours to harass your customer to this extent? Heard of your poor support earlier
 but experiencing it felt very bad and feels like your customers matter nothing to you.

            Different resolutions apply to different products and scenarios. Some devices can be taken to a Microsoft Store where a Store professional can diagnose the device and perform the appropriate actions to resolve the problem.
<br />
<br />
For your situation, if the device doesn't charge after ensuring that the power source and cables are working, the only other factor we can look into is the hardware. Although the product can be used with Windows mobile devices, the Coloud hardware itself is
 not supported by Microsoft. This is why we are suggesting you check with the Coloud support team.<br />

            Alright, contacted coloud support and they denied any support. They asked me to contact microsoft regarding the issue. What am i supposed to do now? Contact the company which made the battery of the speaker? Or the company who made the plastic casing of
 the speaker?

<p>They may be denying you support regarding the problem because the item is outdated. References may not be available to troubleshoot the issue, or no steps can be performed to resolve the situation. This happens for products that have limited support. You
 can try using different cables and power sources to see if there will be a difference when charging your Coloud Bang. Also, if it applies to your device, you can perform a reset. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Connect a standard audio cable (3.5 mm) to the audio connector on your speaker.</li><li>Press and hold the multi-function key, and at the same time, connect the speaker to a computer using a compatible charging cable, or to a compatible charger plugged into a wall outlet.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting your speaker preserves your pairings and other settings.</p>

    <title>Blank white screen instead of my homepage and homepage icon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gandj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blank white screen instead of my homepage and homepage icon doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>When I click on the IE11 icon on my Desktop, the address bar; menu bar; &amp; toolbars appear and all work OK, but the page for the home page does not appear-there is just a blank, white screen.</p>
<p>But I can type in any other Webpage address in the address bar, press&nbsp;'Enter', and it comes up OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect this is because the "Startup" section of Tools/Internet Options has been greyed out-which I assume means it's disabled.&nbsp; This section contains 2 options-one of which is 'Start with Home Page'.&nbsp; Everything else is not greyed out and works fine -
 as I said above, I can even type in any different Webpage address in the address bar and it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only things that don't work are the Home Page and the home page icon&nbsp; (I get an error message when I click on this icon-"navigation to this webpage is canceled").
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody help?</p>
<p>

</p><p>( Obviously, I'm glad it's working now, but I still don't&nbsp; understand - if the problem was add-ons affecting 2 websites (that we know of - yahoo. ca &amp; yahoo.com], why were the 2 sites not affected when I was in MMF29? Everything worked perfectly in MFF29,
 but not in IE11.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the combination of either of these 2 sites (and maybe others); the add-ons; &amp; IE11 may have been the cause-in other words perhaps IE11 doesn't react well to add-ons. ). &nbsp;

<p>Hi Chau,</p>
<p>Do you mean the .PST file size limit in the Outlook client? If so, please refer to the information below:</p>
<p>1. The default .PST file size limit in Outlook 2010 and Outlook 2013 is 20GB.</p>
<p>2. When the file size is greater than 20GB, you will be unable to open the .PST file.</p>
<p>3. When the file size reaches 20GB:</p>
<p>a. Reduce the size of the .PST file (maybe delete some mails) with these steps:</p>
<p>1) Start Outlook 2010 or later with a profile that contains your original .PST file that is larger than 20 GB.</p>
<p>2) Click <b>FILE</b>-&gt;<b>Info</b>-&gt;<b>Cleanup Tools</b>-&gt;<b>Archive</b>.</p>
<p>3) In the <b>Archive</b> box, enable the <b>Archive this folder and all subfolder
</b>option.</p>
<p>4) In the list of folders, select the .PST file that you want to archive.</p>
<p>5) In the&nbsp;<b>Archive items older than</b>&nbsp;drop-down list, specify a date during which a fairly large number of items will be archived.</p>
<p>6) In the <b>Archive file </b>box, select the destination .PST file for your archive messages.</p>
<p>Or you can refer to the following article to enable the archive mailbox in Exchange Online:</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984357(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984357(v=exchg.150).aspx</a></p>
<p>b. Configure the size limit of .PST files described in the article below:</p>

            A reviewers name comes from the setting in Word &gt; Preferences &gt; User Information. It sounds like possibly your husband and you are sharing the same login id on your computer(s)? If that's the case then there is only one copy of user preference files on
 the system and it's in your name?
<div><br />
<div>If each of you had your own login id on the computers, then Office would setup unique preference files for each of you.</div>

            Are you referring to Login ID of computer or office software. ? He has his own login on his computer. But when he goes to Word- preferences- &nbsp;user information as you mentioned above- it has my name on his computer. He tried to change it and it keeps my
 name and gives a message about Office database utility. Frustrating.&nbsp;

<p>Not sure if this is a known issue.&nbsp; I am running Norton Security on a ton of Public Release W10 and on a Pro and Enterprise at 14316.&nbsp; This, to me anyway,&nbsp; is an new issue with 14316 and seems wide spread.&nbsp; No Norton issues for me&nbsp; on Insiders since July
 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As another matter of interest, I was going to run the Pro back to 14295 since I had prepared a 14295 ISO from the Install.esd file.&nbsp; This little gem offered no choice but to delete all prior data.&nbsp; I then looked at going back to the prior release using settings
 and this stated that necessary files had been deleted so dead end there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like Norton may have to go for now if it ticks me off enough.</p>

<p>I just wanted to set the record straight. I had a problem with Norton Security Suite also however I must have checked the like accidentally. I have been working with various computing systems and platforms since the days that large tapes recorded data and
 the really old punch card. I have nor had any intention of getting involved in a problem that is typical when running beta or preview software. I have noticed and even commented on some insiders that get angry sometimes if their apps or software doesn't work
 after a preview download. I don't think this is the case here. Frustration gets to all of us at times. We chose to be insiders and should expect snafu's once in a while. Without the Insider Program, Microsoft&nbsp;would be releasing a product that has many bugs.
 We as insiders should feel good about speeding up the release of the&nbsp;final product. &nbsp;I hope I didn't offend anyone if so I apologize now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You for your time and now my old arthritic fingers will quit.</p>

One would have thought so. Nowhere does it mention an option for this account listing or the management of such.

<h2>            Moving files from local PST file to OUtlook.com using OUtlook 2013</h2>
                    Hi <br />
<br />
How do you import / move emails from a local PST file save on your computer to outlook.com using OUtlook 2013. When I try the drag and drop option from the PST file to the Outlook.com file in outlook 2013, it gives and error saying that Outlook does not support
 what I am trying to do. <br />
<br />
This process use to work extremely well using OUtlook 2010 and the outlook connector for Outlook.
<br />
<br />
Please can anyone assist. <br />
<br />
Thanks.

            <p>That is indeed not supported. Either migrate via Outlook 2010 or upload your mail to an IMAP server instead and then, via the web interface,&nbsp;configure Outlook.com to download the emails for that account.</p>

<p>It is cumbersome, but currently the only supported method to migrate your data stored in a pst-file to Outlook.com. The Outlook Team is looking into this together with the Outlook.com and Exchange EAS team.</p>

Hi Roady</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, for the response. Do you have an ETA by any chance regarding the solution to this query. By the way the new Outlook.com website an Outlook 2013 are great products. They are very clean and well organised. I enjoy using them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I am currently having the following issues using this process in outlook 2013. Maybe, the outlook team can incorporate fixes for these into the solution as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cant use work exchange and Outlook exchange on one PC in Outlook (2007/2010): I have a work PC and a home PC. I used to previously, using the outlook connector, sync my email into one .ost file through Hotmail.com. All my folders, emails and categories
 synced automatically between these 2 PCs and further, my phone.</li><li>There is no backward compatibility for the new Outlook.com process: Currently at work I have Outlook 2007 and there is no way that this will be upgrading (or rather I don't have the option to upgrade). I therefore have to use the outlook version they provide
 me with (2007). I have the Hotmail connector installed, but this seems to be out of sync with the new Outlook.com profile. I see some of the emails, but not all of it. Further:</li><li>My work PC (Outlook 2007 using outlook connector) does not sync my emails, including the category it was assigned to, back to my Home PC (Outlook 2013 using Outlook.com ES).</li><li>Contacts don't sync the pictures back to Outlook.com: when saving and managing my contacts in outlook 2013 and Outlook 2007/2010, the contact picture I include in my contacts do not sync to Outlook.com and further the entire contact does not sync back to
 my work PC (outlook 2007) at all. (also categories don't work here either)</li><li>Is there a way to integrate or merge contact information into the outlook business card contacts using contact information and pictures from Facebook, LinkedIn and Outlook? This would be a handy feature such that I can maintain a complete backup of my contacts
 in my offline backup PST file.</li></ul>
<p>Thanks for the speedy response and the great work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>No, there is no ETA for that yet. Considering that it requires an extension/modification to the EAS protocol itself, it might actually take a while before we'll see this change. I'm not really expecting it to get supported in the next 6 months but maybe
 they'll surprise us ;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm not really sure what your question is here. For Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010, you'll need to continue to use the Outlook Hotmail Connector for Outlook.com accounts.</li><li>It is not really about compatibility here. Both methods still connect to the same mailbox and you should see the same content. Categories for messages should sync. Try removing and re-adding the Outlook Hotmail Connector account from Outlook 2007.</li><li>See 2.</li><li>Outlook.com doesn't support picture sync. It gets its images from social connector providers or what people have used themselves for their Microsoft Account.<br />
Categories for Contacts are not supported. See: <a href="http://www.msoutlook.info/question/759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.msoutlook.info/question/759</a><br />
As for the general synching issue: See 2.</li><li>Not directly in a single contact item but&nbsp;there is a&nbsp;Linked Contacts feature in Outlook 2013 and on Outlook.com to aggregate the contact information from various sources into a single contact info card. For this, you must set your Contacts folder to the
 People view.<br />

            <p>Hi, I wanted to share the issue since it's late 2015 and this is still a huge problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used Outlook (from O365) for years with my hotmail account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is the connector breaks and the 'solution' is to uninstall and reinstall the connection to the online account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that in my case, I didn't realize it was broken as the inbox continued to sync. I had moved 2000 emails to folders, some new some existing (yes this is extreme but I hadn't done this in a long time and was cleaning up).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have 2000 emails and multiple new folders that are only in an OST and will not sync with my hotmail account, I have no idea which emails are which, net very frustrating. I didn't realize this when I was heads down moving the emails and creating folders,
 as new emails continued to come into my inbox throughout the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have saved them as a backup, and dropping the hotmail and reconnecting makes it work again, however I have two copies of my mail and I really want one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution would be I could drag my backup folders to the new working hotmail, however this doesn't work (can't even drag individual emails).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions on how to move these so I can combine them at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have outlook working with hotmail again for all folders (even new ones I create), I also have a backup hotmail that didn't sync and thus it is all a mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dan</p>

<p>Hello Rudolph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have determined that the reason why your subscription of&nbsp;<em>Unlimited US &amp; Canada 12 months&nbsp;</em>did not renew is because the payment method associated with the said subscription was not updated. Although you have added a new credit card on your account,
 this will not automatically update the payment method used by your subscription. You have to manually update the card by following the steps below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sign in to<strong> My Accoun</strong>t.</li><li>Under your profile picture, click the subscription you want to change the payment method for.</li><li>Click <strong>Change payment method</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note: Your account is still active, however your subscription is unfortunately expired. The&nbsp;</em><em>Unlimited US &amp; Canada&nbsp; subscription is considered as a legacy subscription which is no longer available for purchase.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps! Let us know if you have further questions.</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting error message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office is busy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re sorry, [application name].exe can’t be used right now because Office is busy.&nbsp; We’re either updating or helping you add or remove some programs.</p>
<p>You can try using [application name].exe again after we’re done.&nbsp; It shouldn’t take long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried an Online Repair, Quick Repair, Full Uninstallation with registry entries removed using Microsoft Fix It and also attempting a second uninstall with Microsoft Clean Up Utility.&nbsp; The programs will work for a while (about 2-3 days), then the error
 message will pop back up and never go away.&nbsp; Office is up to date and this problem does not occur on any of the other systems in the office that use the same software.&nbsp; I have also tried ending the integratedoffice.exe process as well and the problem still
 occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>David</p>

<p>To resolve:&nbsp; I stopped the service, waiting 10 seconds, then restarted the Service.</p>

<p>Once I did this, the Office apps are now working again.</p>

<h2>            How do I re-sync Outlook 2013 with my Office 365 profile&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am having some difficulties maintaining my Office 365&nbsp;profile (for Outlook)&nbsp;between multiple computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Here is the use case that works (this is using the Office 365 version of all software on W8):</u>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I setup 2 email accounts in Outlook 2013 on computer A.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I install Outlook 2013 on computer B. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Associate MS account, open up Outlook on computer B, email accounts are now on computer B also. Perfect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Here is the use case that does not work:</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I add a new email account to computer A.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I open up Outlook on computer B.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>computer B does not have the new email account (and does not seem to check the online profile for changes).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to manually tell computer B to re-sync with the profile, thus pulling down the new account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I'd search this like a smart person but I can't seem to drum up the right search terms to address this scenario)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>-- Looked into this further. The computer that seemed to have all accounts associated as if by a server sync actually had an old outlook profile from a previous install. Home premium office365 does not support web outlook or the associated fancy features
 regarding accounts. </p>

<p>That said, what I'm experiencing is expected behavior.</p>

<h2>            One drive for business crashing with rolled out El Capitain on Mac</h2>
                    
<p>Ei Capitain OS system is now rolled out and low and behold OneDrive for Business sync client crashes. &nbsp;I updated my MacBook Air with the new IOS system and the app crashes on its attempt to open and on all subsequent attempts. &nbsp;I have not updated my iMac
 and that still works fine. &nbsp;I have seen the posts back when it was in beta and the issues but stupidly thought it would be fixed now 10 months or more later. &nbsp;It hasn't.</p>
<p>Will Microsoft be fixing this and if so when??</p>

<p>How do users know you are not supporting it when it is launched and there is nothing from Microsoft telling us not to upgrade the IOS as you are not supporting? &nbsp;I am signed up but nothing has come so how long will i now be unable to sync my Macbook on El
 Capitain? &nbsp;A timeline would answer this question. &nbsp;Everyone who doesn't check the forum is going to upgrade as you haven't made the position clear anywhere. &nbsp;I am so glad I only did one suspecting something might happen like this.</p>

<h2>            Sharepoint - Hyperlink to a shared drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm building a website for my team. And the hyperlinks to the server are not functioning.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The server location is in the following format: </p>
<p>
</p><p>\\ABCDEFG03\Server\Team&nbsp;Management &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using the hyperlinks in webpart pages. Every time when&nbsp;I&nbsp;put the hyperlinks in and publish the page, it works. But right after I refresh the web page, all the hyperlinks are gone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating. Any help would be&nbsp;appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi Lai W.,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We just tested inserting a Content Editor web part (<strong>Insert </strong>&gt; <strong>
Text</strong>) to the page so that we can add the text and hyperlink. After refreshing, the link still works as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97dee4dd-a790-413f-8ea6-802c8e7396ae?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97dee4dd-a790-413f-8ea6-802c8e7396ae?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>if this is not the steps you did, please provide us with the steps you used so that we can try and check out whether we are getting the same behavior on our end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, we suggest you try creating a new web part page to see if the same behavior is also present in the new page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Keep us updated!</p>
<p>

            <p>Sentences are supposed to start with a capital letter.</p>
<p>If you mean at the beginning of every line, you should not be pressing Enter at the end of the previous line.&nbsp; Word is far smarter than a typewriter and will start a new line for you automatically when the text will no longer fit on the line.&nbsp; However, if
 you deliberately want to start a new line that is not a new paragraph (which would normally start with a new sentence and hence the capital letter), use Shift+Enter instead of Enter.</p>

            <p><span>Yes, this seems to happen either because iphone is not converting the replies to MMS messages into an acceptable email format ‘OR’ if the ATT server is blocking these
 messages due to suspicious content.</span></p>
<p><span>You will have to check with them to figure that out.</span></p>

<p>Clarifying...The incomplete sync was happening in Windows and Android. The date of the error message was 1/15/18 and never changed. In addition to the error message, the problematic notebook was yellow with a red X for the last couple weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my actions yesterday:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Office, rebooted</li><li>Removed all Generic credentials</li><li>Closed OneNote. Ran as administrator.&nbsp;</li><li>Reviewing the page you sent me (I had done that before), the only categories that seem to apply are:
<ul>
<li>(I closed the problematic notebook and re-opened it)</li><li>Notes won't sync...I was able to open the notebook in OneNote Online. Everything seems to be there.</li><li>Sections won't sync...I don't see any indication that a section isn't syncing. I can't identify any missing information.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the sync status, the other two notebooks sync just fine (always have). The problematic notebook seems to complete (progress bar goes to the end-has always done that), but keeps on syncing over and over.&nbsp; I turned off the auto sync. Manually sync'd
 all notebooks. The problematic notebook says up to date, but is still yellow. I selected settings and noticed the color was yellow (I have never selected a color for any notebook) and set it to blue. There is no error message (I think that disappeared the
 last time I closed OneNote and re-opened it today). The red X is gone (not sure when that disappeared). I re-enabled auto sync and everything seems to be fine. The sync problem was showing up in android phone also. Checking OneNote on my cell phone, it now
 indicates successful sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems clear auto sync was having a problem today and turning it on/off solved that. I'm not sure what action resolved the incomplete sync because I was focused on the notebook color as the indicator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the assist!!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>OLE stands for "Object Linking and Embedding", so means a link to an external object. &nbsp;Can you open the workbook in desktop Excel and identify what that object is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thinking is that it falls under the general umbrella of External Data, which is not supported on the mobile versions, according to the page you linked to.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, OLE objects in Excel Mobile are not supported yet.&nbsp; I have taken your feedback and passed it on to the appropriate engineering team to let them know of a user hitting this limitation so it can be taken into account for prioritization of feature
 work.&nbsp; I am sorry to hear that you are hitting this inconvenience.&nbsp; Thank you for providing the feedback here and for using Excel Mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Steve</p>

</p><p>I run into this all the time, my employer sends out PI which I am unable to open because of OLE. Do you have an idea on when this will be addressed?

 XP SP2.&nbsp; The problem thtat I am having now is that almost every other time I either have to delete the partnership and re-create it or uninstall WMDC and re-install it in order for it to connect.&nbsp; Why is this and why am I having connection issues all the time.</p>

<h2>            set sync frequency and quiet times on outlook app</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,
</span></p>

<p><span>My company forced me to install the outlook app on my android phone to receive emails and use the calender.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Now I am missing some convenient features (known from VMware or even Touchdown) such as the ability to set sync times (every 30 minutes, every 1 hour…) and quiet times (times
 in which I DO NOT receive any work emails: during the night, on the weekends…) or edit the calender view to show a full week.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Could you please tell me how I can activate/access these settings?</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Thanks and best regards,
</span></p>
