    <title>Right or left align text on Y axis of an Excel chart&#47;graph - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Right or left align text on Y axis of an Excel chart&#47;graph</h2>
                    <p>I understand Excel doesn't allow for the Y axis label text to be aligned other than centered. Since that tends to look really awful, I wanted to offer a workaround that may help some by manipulating the chart in Word or PowerPoint, where many of these charts
 end up and where visuals matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's quite simple; by pasting the chart in Word or PowerPoint and setting the alignment from the Paragraph dialog box you can adjust the text left or right. Using the alignment options on the ribbon will not work, nor will right-clicking and trying to align
 from the little pop-up box. This works in Office 2010, I have not tested it in any newer versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To visualize-</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how Excel forces the text alignment:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7515ee4b-376e-4f5a-9d34-2e6260d76903?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7515ee4b-376e-4f5a-9d34-2e6260d76903?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the desired right aligned text:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/314f98c3-6fb4-462d-9e21-0105ba5bce79?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/314f98c3-6fb4-462d-9e21-0105ba5bce79?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What to do: Paste the chart in Word or PowerPoint and select the Y axis labels (click on any part of the text). Select the arrow at the bottom right of the paragraph section on the ribbon to bring up the Paragraph dialog box. Under "General", "Alignment",
 choose "Right" or "Left" from the drop-down menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this saves others some frustration, and perhaps offers Microsoft a way to enable this functionality more straightforwardly.</p>

    <title>&#34;forward it to people or public group&#34; option in &#34;Rules - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> epm consultant  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;forward it to people or public group&#34; option in &#34;Rules Wizard &#34; is not working..Help required&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guru,</p>
<p>I created a rule that forwards meeting invite to a person by using "forward it to people or public group" option in Rules Wizard in Outlook 2010. so all the&nbsp;users were able to see that meeting inviation in their outlook calendar. &nbsp;It was perfectly fine from
 last 2 months. Since yesterday, this rule is started forwarding meeting invitation as an attachment. That being said, those users are getting emails as an attachement but not itself a meeting invite.</p>
<p>It started acting as "forward it to people or public group in an attachment" rather than actual text message.</p>
<p>Do you know how can i fix this problem? This is an urgent request and needs to fix it ASAP. Please help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot in advance!</p>

            <p>Tested with same result. No updates installed as far as i know. The question comes to my mind why</p>
<p>"forward it to people or public group" option&nbsp;and "forward it to people or public group as an attachment" option is showing the same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried both options and both are&nbsp;forwarding meeting invite as an attachment which does not make sense at all. &nbsp;This "forward it to people or public group" option should forward meeting invite as a meeting invite (TEXT message) what it was doing before.
 so frustrated!</p>
<p>if I forward a meeting invite manually using "forward" NOT "forward attachment", it forwards correctly. Same thing i am trying to do using Rules but not working.</p>

            <p>I wll add one more thing. "forward it to people or public group" is working fine with regular email but NOT working with meeting invite. That being said, the system forwards meeting invitation to a user as an attachment not itself a meeting invite.
</p>
<p>As i earlier said, it was working fine not sending meeting invite as an attachment.
</p>
<p>I played with VBA macros in Outlook and was able to forward meeting invite without an attachment so the problem is happening ONLY in Rules Wizard.</p>

            <p>Just an FYI - There were some problems in Outlook (client)&nbsp;in making rule using meeting invitation.</p>
<p>After creating same rule on OWA (web client), the system started to forward meeting invitation correctly to the SharePoint Calendar. I figured out that some new patches apply on both exchange server side as well on client desktop that caused starting this
 issue so my recomendation to all if some rules don't work correctly what thet are supposed to, then, using OWA directly and most probably it will work again exactly what happened with me.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Not&nbsp;sure if&nbsp;we are the only tenant seeing these issues with Office 365 but our users are reporting email delays or non-delivered every week, external users with Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail, (you name it) not receiving emails our users sent them, safe senders going
 to junk folders even though I added the senders domain to the safe senders/allow list, and always constant Outlook profile issues such as missing subfolders, etc. These issues are taking up most 80% of my days at work and message traces like the one below
 are no help. Calls to Microsoft has not been helpful as it is occurring every week and no real solutions.

<p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>I would like to confirm the following information to better understand the problem.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Are you using custom (such as @contoso.com) or default (onmicrosoft.com) domain? If you are using custom domain then please try to check this issue via using default domain "onmicrosoft.com" -based email address
<em>(&lt;user&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;.onmicrosoft.com</em>) to see whether the problem still occurs.<br />
•&nbsp;Does this issue happen on both Outlook Web App and Outlook desktop client?<br />
•&nbsp;Regarding “<em>Outlook profile issues such as missing subfolders</em>”, which Outlook client version are users using (such as Outlook 2013 or 2016 for Windows)? How did users set up their Office 365 account on the Outlook client, via<em> Exchange/Pop or IMAP</em>?<br />
•&nbsp;When you say “<em>our users are reporting email delays or non-delivered every week</em>”, could you please provide us with the detailed error non-delivery (NDRs) report and message trace result via the private message for further analysis?<br />
•&nbsp;I notice that you have already contacted the Microsoft support. Do you receive any SR number? If so, could you please also provide us with the SR number which you got from our support via the private message?</p>
<p>I have sent you private message and here are the link to access it: 
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations</p>
<p>Your patience and cooperation are highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Shyamal</p>

<p>hi bruce,</p>
<p>thanks for your private message.</p>
<p>for the issue “our users are reporting email delays or non-delivered every week”, i need some information to further troubleshoot it:</p>
<p>1. regarding “when this happens and they call me, i have to delete their outlook profile and recreate their outlook profile”, does the issue persists after re-creating their outlook profiles? meanwhile, please test if the delay persists when the users only
 connect to their accounts using&nbsp;<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook web app</a> (disconnect their accounts on any other devices/desktops when testing it).</p>
<p>2. i notice there is a transport rule ‘add bcc recipients’, please confirm if both the recipients in the
<b>to</b> and <b>bcc </b>field are encounter this issue.</p>
<p>for the issue external users cannot receive emails form users in your organization, please confirm some information below:</p>
<p>1. can they not receive all emails from users in your organization?</p>
<p>2. check if your domain type in eac (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">exchange admin center</a>)-&gt;<b>mail flow</b>-&gt;<b>accepted domains</b> is internal relay. if it’s
<b>authoritative</b>, change it to <b>internal relay</b> and then check if external users can receive emails from them.</p>
<p>for the issue emails from safe senders going to junk folders, i have checked the dns settings of your domain and found that the spf record value isn’t correct for office 365. so please change it to
<b>v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com –all</b><b> </b>at your dns hosting provider by referring the article below and then check if emails still move to junk folders.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-dns-records-for-office-365-at-any-dns-hosting-provider-7b7b075d-79f9-4e37-8a9e-fb60c1d95166?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us#bkmk_add_txt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-dns-records-for-office-365-at-any-dns-hosting-provider-7b7b075d-79f9-4e37-8a9e-fb60c1d95166?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us#bkmk_add_txt</a></p>
<p>about the missing subfolders issue, i need to collect some information below:</p>
<p>1. the latest outlook 2013 version is 15.0.4787.1002. please make sure their outlook client are up-to-date.</p>
<p>2. the detailed steps about configuring their accounts on the outlook clients.</p>
<p>3. how did you migrate to office 365 from your on-premise exchange server?</p>
<p>4. some screenshots about the subfolders list in the outlook client (where subfolders missed) and owa? to upload screenshots, select&nbsp;the
<b>use rich formatting </b>button in the forum, and then click&nbsp;<b>insert /edit media</b> like the picture shows below:</p>

<p>I have tried many fixes that I have found searching this same problem. I think Store is not even on my PC at all. I can not search for it thru my start bar. If I click on Flipboard (one of two I can see) it says youll need a new app to open this ms-windows-store.</p>

            <p>What was meant by the 'Preview' comment was about this forum, not your version of Windows 10. This forum is the 'Windows Insider Program' forum, meaning the users that get and use the pre-release newer versions of Windows and a place to discuss them. So
 the poster was directing you to a&nbsp;forum for general Windows 10 support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have brought this PC can you contact the supplier for support? Fixes for Store are not always straight forward and not always successful and the PC needs a Windows 10 reset. Be interesting perhaps to know what the supplier would suggest.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 365 - Email Message Format of Header</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using email from my Microsoft Office 365 Pro Plus account on 2 different devices, one a ThinkPad and the other BootCamp on MAC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My ThinkPad mail message header format appears as below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48f743ad-cffa-438a-948b-095ef9b8a697?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48f743ad-cffa-438a-948b-095ef9b8a697?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>While the message header format on my MAC appears as below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2a697b24-823c-49a7-8379-afcbabfc82d3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2a697b24-823c-49a7-8379-afcbabfc82d3?upload=true" /></a></p>

</p><p>I would like my MAC outlook to have the same layout format as my ThinkPad. What do I have to do on my MAC?</p>

<p>Hi Sb5683,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a matter of fact, the Office installation from your company account is controlled by the admins of the Office 365 tenant. The admins can control the Office 365 release channel for the entire organization. For your reference, see
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set up the Standard or Targeted release options in Office 365</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you can see the installation from your company account is Version 1808 in <strong>
Semi-annual Channel</strong>. While for the Home &amp; Business, it's Version 1905 in
<strong>Monthly Channel</strong>. To learn the latest version of different channels, you can refer to
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/update-history-office365-proplus-by-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office update history</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this scenario, if you'd like to change the channel, you need to contact the admin in your organization to help change it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note: All Office 365 for Business issues are supported in our forum, including Enterprise users. You only need to post threads in related categories. For example:&nbsp; Office / xxx / xxx / Office 365 for Business. Our related engineers are glad to help you.</em><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

<h2>            cursor in continuum using wireless touchpad jumpingi. around</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I'm using a wireless touchpad and keyboard with continuum on my Lumia 950xl but lately it started to cause problems with controlling the cursor.</p>
<p>The cursor jumps around and it's almost impossible to use. </p>
<p>when i use a mouse or the display of my phone it works well and The touch pad works perfectly on other devices "computers" as well.</p>
<p>besides I started to have problems with continuum like the sound goes on It's own and the display shows no signal and I have to disconnect an reconnect it to work.</p>

            Is your phone up to date? Also make sure that the Miracast adapter(or whatever) you are using to connect to the external display has it's firmware up-to-date.

                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue when a customer try's to book a room and marks the meeting as private the meeting is showing up on the calendar multiple times. This is a managed room. When you send the invite to the room it shows as tentative waiting for approval, then
 once the delegate opens the request it adds a Forwarded meeting to the room calendar, and finally when the booking delegate accepts the meeting, it shows up a third as a forwarded meeting and as accepted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this by design, since it is a private meeting and the booking delegate does not have access to view the contents of the actual meeting?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Virus has permissions over me and won&#39;t let me get rid of exclusions in Windows Defender</h2>
                    <p>I accidentally downloaded a virus and ran it on my computer. It started downloading a bunch of ads and programs onto my computer. I ran a Malwarebytes scan and it got rid of the ads, but I am still getting random blue screens with error message CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I checked Windows Defender exclusions and found this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a119a058-1512-4a24-8309-ea2d00d8725c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a119a058-1512-4a24-8309-ea2d00d8725c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I never added these exclusions -- the virus added them. As you can see, the "Remove" button is not available. Then I tried deleting the exclusions from Registry Editor:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82aa445d-a711-49dd-8a7e-db4a8f9903fd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82aa445d-a711-49dd-8a7e-db4a8f9903fd?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The virus has permissions over me and won't allow me to delete the exclusions. When I try to modify permissions on the folder I get an "access is denied" error message. Anyone have any ideas what I should do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Here's a screenshot of the permissions; I don't know what "Account Unknown" is. Still getting blue screens randomly when using the computer. windows.com/stopcode did not offer much help.</p>

<p>For anyone who has the same problem, I wouldn't worry about Windows Defender exclusions. Just use a better antivirus software. Here's what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Ran a Malwarebytes full scan (custom scan) (this one took around 5 hours to complete, 90+ threats quarantined)</p>
<p>2. Ran a AdwCleaner scan (I believe this was the most important scan. The virus did not let me install AdwCleaner at first, so I had to boot in safe mode (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode) to run the scan.)</p>
<p>3. Ran a Malwarebytes threat scan (this was just to be safe, but it did find and quarantine 40+ threats)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only time will tell if the blue screens will continue, but all other symptoms of the virus are gone.</p>

If you are just testing and do not have a large amount of programs installed you could always do a clean install.</p>
<p>I have done this in the past when things got fouled up.&nbsp; Some was my doings just pushing the wrong key at the wrong time.&nbsp; It does not bother me as I have 3 test computers.</p>

            <p>Oh yeah! but it got fixed by itself. One day I left my laptop on some torrent downloading and after 4 hours when I came, the installation of the latest build was running. I don't know how but it got fixed by itself.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But one thing I'll suggest you is that don't ever forcibly stop the downloading/installing process of Windows Update. Because it'll always lead you to this mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps, hope it'll help you. </p>
<ul>
<li>Run and perform the <a href="https://www.cmcm.com/en-us/clean-master-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
CleanMaster </a>software </li><li>check this short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9QNAxsczaU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<div>and follow as it says (also after each latest build you install cuz it'll erase the old build files which often interrupts the downloading/installation of latest build)

<p>Hello Kennia,</p>

</p><p>Thank you for letting us know. You may encounter issues opening PDF files on Microsoft Edge after the latest Windows 10 Mobile update. We are aware of this and our developers are working on it. Rest assured that Microsoft will provide
 an update to resolved it. Alternatively, you may download and install any available PDF reader apps from the

            I have tried to download alternative PDF reader apps, but there is no option to use them. Windows mobile automatically opens all PDF files with Edge browser, leading to a blank page. There is simply no way to read PDF files since the update.<br />

<h2>            Recurring calendar invite decline</h2>
                    Hi, when you send a recurring calendar invite (say a weekly meeting for 6 months) to multiple people and someone declines the invite for one of the sessions (in the middle of the six month period) how do you know which meeting they have declined?&nbsp; I just
 get the standard decline response - it doesn't show the date of the session they have declined.&nbsp; If anyone can help please let me know.&nbsp; Thanks, Hazel

<p>Thank you for your kind and thoughtful remarks _Pe_.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I know that you investigated and that YOU found that when you click on the 1st link in the article I posted that it brings you to
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.microsoft.com/family#/.</a> And I know that when you did that and read the page you saw a variety of things (like adding a child) but particularly you saw the last sentence on that page which said:</p>
<p>"<strong>We’ve made some changes to family features, and more are on the way. <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>And I'm also sure you clicked on the "<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Learn more</span></a>" which brought you to this FAQ (<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/family/faq/)</a>
 page. After you read that I know you found it very interesting and particularly helpful. Particularly if you have younger children, you can make sure they’ll only visit sites you’ve decided are safe.

<p>It does not seem to be easily set up. After setting everything up on the family site the phone still show the message that My Family has to be configured when trying to get a free game from the Store.</p>
<p>I agree to that this does not work on WP8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still claim that it does work, show the difference in configuration between straightforward with WP10 and alternative configuration to get it going with WP8.</p>

</p><p>Hi Toby, I have the same issue. The user has been moved from on-premises to Online, they have been assigned a Cloud PBX license, they have a voicepolicy, voiceroutingpolicy, dialplan, LineURI&nbsp;and show as EnterpriseVoiceEnabled&nbsp;however they are unable to
 make or receive calls. The forwarding options appear to be missing from the **** client so it looks like they are not being classed as EV/Cloud PBX enabled.</p>

    <title>Gmail&#47;Google Apps problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drdavidsandstrom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gmail&#47;Google Apps problems</h2>
                    <p>Major headaches with the Calendar, Contacts and Mail app(s) in build 10162.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gmail account: account configures without a problem and does an initial import of calendar, contact and mail items. &nbsp;After the initial import, mail is the only thing that will sync. &nbsp;When I go back into the accounts menu and select the Gmail account, the
 calendar and contacts switches for sync are completely missing, and only the email switch is present and on. &nbsp;Manually syncing mail works. &nbsp;Deleting and adding the account yields exactly the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Apps account: account configures without a problem and does an initial import of calendar, contact and mail items. &nbsp;After the initial import, nothing syncs ever again, manually or otherwise. &nbsp;When I go back into the accounts menu from Mail and select
 the Google Apps account, all of the sync item switches are present and turned on. &nbsp;When I go back into the accounts menu from Calendar, the Google Apps account shows that attention is needed, but the settings are not in any way incorrect. &nbsp;Manually syncing
 mail does not work - I get a message telling me how long it has been since the initial sync, but no error message (either on the screen or in the event viewer). &nbsp;Deleting and adding the account yields exactly the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>(1) Using Powershell to remove the app and reinstall it from the Store. &nbsp;No change, behaves exactly the same.</p>
<p>(2) Scorched earth - completely wiped the machine and reinstalled 10 from an ISO image, ran through all the available updates and then configured. &nbsp;No change, behaves exactly the same.</p>
<p>(3) Tried configuration with (on the Google side) 2 factor authentication on and off. &nbsp;No change, behaves exactly the same.</p>
<p>(4) Tried configuration with both the master password and a per-app password. &nbsp;No change, behaves exactly the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My setups:</p>
<p>(1) HP Spectre x360 with i7, 8GB and 512GB hard drive, only OS installed. &nbsp;OS = 64 bit version.</p>
<p>(2) Apple Macbook Pro Retina (early 2015) with i7, 16 GB and 256 GB hard drive, Parallels 10, VM configured with 8 GB and 256 GB disk. &nbsp;Only VM running. &nbsp;OS = 64 bit version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, I have not tried this on the 32 bit OS. &nbsp;Not really interested in doing that, either. &nbsp;If I can get this to work, I will be installing Visual Studio and will be developing 64 bit apps, so...</p>
<p>
</p><p>...So I am at a complete loss here. &nbsp;Gmail - mail only - works but no calendar or contacts beyond the initial sync. &nbsp;Google apps, nothing at all beyond the initial sync and no error to track down - it just doesn't work. &nbsp;This leads me to assume that Calendar
 and Contact sync is not supported on regular Gmail accounts, and that there is a showstopper bug for Google Apps accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I try next? &nbsp;I am out of ideas. &nbsp;Yes, I know I can use the web interface, but that really isn't the point. &nbsp;Either the app supports Google or it doesn't, and at the moment it is heavily in the "doesn't" camp. &nbsp;I can't find anyone else who has the
 same problems - most mail or calendar issues relate to the app not even loading in the first place, a problem I have not had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas? &nbsp;Pretty please?</p>

            <p>Thank you, Vinz. &nbsp;With all due respect, unfortunately that is absolutely no help whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reported it through the feedback app, but since that is pretty much one-way communication the intent of these forums (at least what I think the intent should be) is for the community to offer suggestions to solve the problem. &nbsp;I had hoped I was not
 the only one who had this issue, and even if there is no solution at the moment, a hearty round of "me, too" would at least give the community as a whole an idea that a problem or limitation exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thank you for your suggestion. &nbsp;The question still stands, and is there anyone else out there having the same problem? &nbsp;Can anyone validate that this is NOT a problem but rather a known limitation (Gmail accounts only sync email and not calendar/contacts)?

            <p>So maybe something is working now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) I wiped the accounts locally. &nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) I went to the manage accounts page online and removed all accounts (Facebook was still there as was one of my Google accounts).</p>
<p>(3) Rebooted my laptop.</p>
<p>(4) Went into the Mail app and created my Gmail account (not the Google Apps account).</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point it seems to work just fine UNTIL I change any setting outside of the account name. &nbsp;As soon as I change (for example) the sync frequency from "Based on my behavior" to "As items arrive" or how far back to sync items (from 3 months to any time)
 - any 1 configuration item changes, sync breaks and I cannot get it to work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Leave everything as-is after the setup and it works - at least, it has for the last 2 hours. &nbsp;I did change the account name, though, and that seems to be OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now added my Google Apps account and other than renaming the account, settings are as-is. &nbsp;This has been running for at least an hour now with both accounts &nbsp;No issues yet. &nbsp;Have not rebooted yet, though - don't want to push my luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the moral of the story is accept Microsoft's settings completely or no mail/calendar for you.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the info, Mark!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been an ongoing problem for me since 10074. &nbsp;I am currently on 10166 and that is where I noticed that if I change any settings other than the name the ability to sync breaks. &nbsp;Frankly, it did not occur to me to try this out prior to this last week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it is possible that things are better in 10166 in that if I leave settings as-is everything works. &nbsp;I just can't tell you definitively at the moment. &nbsp;Either way, there is a path to explore now - I can reproduce the problem every single time just by changing
 literally any setting. &nbsp;I would guess something is being corrupted because setting back to the base settings does not correct the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to me the likely place to start researching a solution is in the settings save code...</p>

</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Since Windows 10 Technical Preview is still in development stage. Some functionalities might not work in the usual manner. Hence you may face some issue with Windows
 10 Technical preview. We are looking forward to improve it.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We’re very close to our public release and we’re working very hard to get everything just right. I suggest you to wait for the final release of Windows 10 which is going to happen on July 29th, 2015.</p>

            <p>Hi Anil,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the assurance , as&nbsp; I feel lot of issues and problems have been taken care off . At the same time this issue has been pending since 10130 ,I did open ports 993 and 465 for the sync and disabled security but alas no luck.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would also like to state that the wifi shows only the currently connected router , I have to disconnect WIFI and then the other routers are seen . This exercise is time cosuming and not automatic .<br />
&nbsp; Addition <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Gmail account there's a label called as "ALL MAIL" where all the mails ie. of Inbox , sent and other folders are accumulated as one , its the only folder which gets updated albeit manually .</p>
<p>&nbsp; Also if you delete 10 -15 mails continuously then the mail crashes since you cannot select multiple mails as selecting individually mails which are unread is time consuming .</p>
<p>&nbsp; There is no right click to to empty SPam or Empty trash , again selecting them individually is time consuming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rgds</p>

            Hello Melanie D, yes I am desparate to get my email/life back.<br />
I tried your suggestions. I normally use Firefox. So I copied the reset passowrk link into Safari. Same temporary error message.<br />
I already opened it in a new window. Same problem.<br />
<br />
I have requested an account reset. I have recieved a message from microsoft saying that my account has been verified and to click on this link to reset my password.<br />
<br />
Then I get the same 'temporary error' message.<br />
I am going to try on another computer and report back.<br />
Hopefully you are available to assist, because I don't know any other avenues to fix this.<br />
<br />
I replied to the microsoft email with the account verified/reset passord link and that just comes back as a delivery failure.<br />
<br />
Just out of curiousity. Is there any other ways to get assistance with this broken hotmail account? Feels a bit lonely with no one to help and my life on hold.<br />
<br />
I am vulnerable and dependant on my hotmail email unfortunately.Thanks,<br />
Roman.<br />

            This is starting to feel like an unfair cruel joke.<br />
I'm not getting any real support. My messages in the 'private escalated support' area are not being replied to. I was asked for the email address affected and an alternative email address to contact me. I supplied those days ago.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your intent. But I used the reset password link straight away. Before it expired. I will try to do the validation process again as you suggest.<br />
But my assertion is that there is a fault where the reset password link never lets me reset my password. As I have explained. It always says 'temporary eror please try again later'<br />
Then many days later I am told it is because the reset password link has expired. It hadn't expired when I used it.<br />
<br />
There is an issue here and I am getting toothless responses from support. Or so it feels.<br />
<br />
I will go attempt to revalidate my account now as you suggest. But I am not expecting a different result.<br />
<br />
I need a real solution. I am certain I am going in circles. If it doesn't work this time then it can't be an expired reset password link. I don't believe it ever was an expired reset password link because I have been attending to these messages regularly in
 desparation to get my important life back on track.<br />
<br />
Please I need real support. Real solutions. Live support would be best. This is 10 days so far since the email went down.<br />
<br />
I will&nbsp; report back. I am going to try to get another reset password link generated.<br />
<br />
Thanks for some attention.<br />
Roman.<br />

<h2>            Xbox Video - Buying a TV Series Season Pass or Just an Episode&#58; Expiration&#63;</h2>
                    <p>this question may seem silly</p>
<p>
</p><p>i was thinking of buying, not renting, a recent law and order episode, or maybe even a season pass, from the Xbox video store. the question is will i lose ownership after a certain time (12 months, i read someone had an issue with [unsolved but claim it
 might be a media license thing]) or will be able to keep it to watch for whenever as long as my Xbox/Microsoft account or the availability of the show on Xbox Video is not deleted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the same apply with movies?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you</p>

            <p>Hello ARomero:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding your question about video content purchased on the Xbox Video marketplace.&nbsp; This is certainly a valid question and one I would be happy to clarify for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When content is purchased you will have ownership of the rights to this content as long as it is available on the Store.&nbsp; In some cases a show or movie may have a limited shelf life.&nbsp; If that is the case you would see this in the description of the content
 when you make the purchase.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get a message related to content availability and a expiration date, this tends to be centered around the removal from the store.&nbsp; What this will do is prevent you from further streaming or downloading the content.&nbsp; If you have the content downloaded
 to your device, you would be able to continue to enjoy the media whenever you desire.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this clarifies things.&nbsp; If you continue to have questions, please post again and we will do our best to better clear things up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>

<p>We recently&nbsp;installed office 2010 on a desktop with Windows 64 bit OS.&nbsp; In Outlook ONLY, it flickers as if it is constantly losing and regaining focus, and when it flickers to a "lost focus" status, I cannot enter text, edit text, or select any menu commands.&nbsp;
 It happens regardless of whether I'm writing an email, setting up a calendar entry, or setting up or editing a contact card.</p>
<p>Again this happens in Outlook 2010 ONLY.</p>

<p>I'm finding Office 2010 very buggy:&nbsp; MS released this version way too soon.&nbsp; :/</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 encrypt email addresses - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carmelabraxton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 encrypt email addresses</h2>
                    <p>I am a consultant who has to appear as an employee for a lot of companies. &nbsp;I have 6 pop3, 4 IMAP, 7 microsoft exchange, 2 outlook.com, 3 gmail, 1 kerio, a few other assorted email accounts. &nbsp;The only REPEAT THE ONLY email "anything" out there that can do
 everything I need to do, while still being able to access all the addresses, the way I need them accessed is Outlook 2010. &nbsp;2016 is not compatible with 5 of my emails and won't even acknowledge they exist, and Microsoft Mail does not have all the capability
 I require. So 2010 is it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>September 27, I woke up and Outlook would not even open on my Sony Vaio model VPCL212FX. &nbsp;It just hit profile and looped or cycled or whatever they are calling it now. &nbsp;Worked with microsoft tech for 3 days and the computer finally crashed. &nbsp;Reloaded Windows
 7 and upgraded to 10, &nbsp;reinstalled everything, still wouldn't work. &nbsp;Installed 2016 wouldn't work. &nbsp;Crashed again, started over and got outlook 2010 to work again, but it now will not allow my one email address that is associated with my PKI medium token certificate
 (a Pop3 earthlink.net account) to show up in the dropdown address book. &nbsp;When I try to send encrypted, it will not let me because it can't find my certificate in in the address book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been dealing with this since September 27th and it ain't getting any better, and nobody can tell me how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening on all my computers and when I run the outlook diagnostic it just tells me to upgrade to 2016, but of course I can't because it will not access all of my emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the email address profile box is checked for it to "Show in Address Book" but it is still not there, at all, anywhere. &nbsp;Trust me I've looked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please understand, I have been using Outlook 2010 since I downloaded Windows 10 on that computer in December of 2015. &nbsp;I had the PKI medium token certificate set up to encrypt from 10 different email addresses, Outlook.com, exchange and g-mail as well as
 the earthlink.net pop3 and it was working just &nbsp;fine without issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the same time the Vaio quit, Outlook 2010 on my Dell Inspiron 5759 stopped encrypting as well. &nbsp;I was able to get one of my emails addresses to properly encrypt from the Kerio, but my pop 3 from earthlink won't work on the laptop and even though I have
 gone in and checked all the required boxes in the properties for the pop3 email it will still not show up in the drop down for the address book, and can not see my certificate even though it is in the contact of the correct account. &nbsp;I must have encryption
 on this account using this PKI medium &nbsp;token certificate in order to correspond with certain offices required to do my job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My exchange addresses and 1 outlook.com address along with the Kerio are the ONLY address books that appear in the dropdown for Address Book show up in the address book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get a new PKI you say? &nbsp;No, this one is a 3 year token, and it costs over 300 dollars, you fix Windows 10 and Outlook 2010 instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my keyboard and mouse have all but quit working completely on the Vaio, I have purchased a new Dell. &nbsp;But have not hooked it it up yet. &nbsp;I want to know how to set it up so my POP3 emails account contact will be in the address book from the start.</p>

            You're talking to company IT, company employee, company HR, CFO and company Owner. &nbsp;I'm it! &nbsp;I have 5 computers. &nbsp;That's it, just 5. &nbsp;I was able to get the new Dell Desktop to work by creating the initial profile using the POP3 email to start Outlook.
 &nbsp;In the past you were not able to add a Microsoft Exchange account to an Outlook profile that was initiated using a POP3 account, but now you can. &nbsp;By initiating my first access to Outlook using the POP3 account, and maintaining that account as my default,
 I was able to keep the POP3 contacts in the address book, recognizing my certificate and allowing me to send encrypted. &nbsp;I fixed it, but it will take me a little time to get it working on all 7 computers.

    <title>IE 11 Menu &#38; Fav Bar Colours - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            IE 11 Menu &#38; Fav Bar Colours</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is just so much white on my Internet Explorer 11, something I could change with a theme for Chrome. Is there a way to do this? I have my menu and favorites bar showing and I'd prefer to keep them that way.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Karl</p>

            <p>I am not certain if changing anything within the <strong>Control Panel/Personalization and appearance
</strong>page will allow you to alter the colors of Internet Explorer's various toolbars but there is an&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Color intensity slider&nbsp;</strong>and an&nbsp;<strong>Advanced appearance settings</strong>&nbsp;which seems to imply that you can do something to the Windows by messing with the Basic 7 theme.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In addition, you can check this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/ie-accessibilty-options?ocid=IE10_ignore_colors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/ie-accessibilty-options?ocid=IE10_ignore_colors</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, <strong>Tools/Internet Options/General (bottom of page)\Appearance colors&nbsp;</strong>allows you to mess with various colors by:</p>
<ul>
<li>unchecking the default<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li>then clicking on the&nbsp;various buttons.&nbsp; This&nbsp;will bring up the color chart so you can then modify the color for that particular button's appearance<strong>&nbsp;
</strong></li></ul>
