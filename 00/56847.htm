<h2>            Xbox control&#33;</h2>
                    Xbox said they hear you and decided to screw their customers anyway. Control Control Control! That's what they want! When you purchase a game that game should belong to you, and you should be able to do whatever the heck you want with that game! You bought
 it, it's yours! Or so you thought! Xbox no longer for me!

<p>There seems to be a problem with the guide button. It flashes 6 times then stops and then guide button doesn't work anymore. All the other buttons work but the guide doesn't. I also have a second controller but that has the same problem.</p>

<p>I'm having a similar issue. &nbsp;At first they wouldn't connect to the xbox one. &nbsp;I was able to get them to connect via the sync buttons on the console and the controllers. &nbsp;Once on and working, everything seems fine until you press the guide button. &nbsp;That still
 doesn't work. &nbsp;I tried updating the controllers, but it had no effect. &nbsp;The only thing out of the ordinary was that immediately before this started happening, I tried streaming to my laptop. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Cumulative Updates Wreaking Havoc with my Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmolynn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Cumulative Updates Wreaking Havoc with my Office 365 Programs--also affecting Adobe Acrobat Reader DC</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I am having issues with my Word and Excel both just "Not Responding" after a Windows cumulative update. This has been going on since the January cumulative update on my system. After the update, everything works fine for a few hours then when I try to print
 a document from Word, it hangs and doesn't respond. When I shut it down and try to open it up, it just hangs or tells me that Word failed to open correctly and would I like to open it in Safe Mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a major issue for me the last month. Today I got the latest update around 3 pm. I had two documents open and when I tried to print them, nothing. I tried reinstalling Office 365 to no avail. Thankfully, I've been creating a System Restore point before
 these updates and have managed to restore back to BEFORE the update, then I use a Hide Updates Tool to hide the update.
</p>
<p>So effectively, I have uninstalled every Windows 10 update on my computer dating back to December. I'm sure that's probably not good but I can't afford to be dead in the water when I'm trying to work on documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note, this is also happening to Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. It does the same thing. I uninstall it then try to reinstall it and I get an error message saying it's ALREADY installed!!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling Office 365, which really hangs up the system. I've gone through this FOUR times since January. It's very frustrating because I just don't have time to keep dealing with it. I'm tempted to ask my IT person to bump me back down to my
 Windows 7 installation which is a major pain. I was loving Windows 10 until this started. It really cuts into my work day and means that, like today after 3 pm, my computer is unusable because I spend an hour minimum doing a system restore on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now every time I see that Windows has done a major update, I cringe because I know that within a few hours, my MS Office 365 will not work and I won't be able to print pdf documents from Adobe Acrobat Reader DC because it will be out of whack again. I
 had NO issues with Windows 10 before January's updates. I was using a hard copy of MS Office 2007 until January and my boss wanted me to start using MS Office 365, so I deleted all of the hard copies of Office on my PC.
</p>
<p>Again, this ONLY happens after a Windows Cumulative Update, no other time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is Microsoft doing to fix this problem???</p>

            <p>Well, me and my IT person agreed that we should do a clean install on my computer with Windows 10. He's convinced I should go back to using Windows 7, but I wanted to give Windows 10 a chance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We first tried to do a Reset, which didn't work. Windows said it couldn't do it. So we did a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice that when I first had this problem, it happened when I received a MAJOR update around Jan 9. At that time, I was using Microsoft Office 2007 on my machine. After the update, I checked the box to receive Microsoft product updates and Windows
 started downloading a MASSIVE amount of MS Office updates. From that point on, I had nothing but issues. Printing, Adobe, my Quickbooks. It all seemed related to when I tried to print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I honestly don't have time to try and figure out what was going wrong with a clean boot. I'm pretty computer savvy but this would've been like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know that doing a clean install for me at work was a major aggravation because all of my network drives had to be remapped and my Quickbooks and a few other problems had to be reinstalled along with some of my data files I backed up. Thank goodness
 the QB data is on a server. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If something happens again after another update, my IT person says he's taking it back to Windows 7 which I'm in agreement with. There should be a way to turn OFF updates in Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My major gripe with the constant updates is that it often happens on my computer while I'm working on something. That shouldn't happen. On Jan 9, the update happened then my computer was down for over an hour doing a major build update (equivalent to a reinstall
 of Windows). That really need to happen when I'm not using my computer. I have the option to install them later but the updates themselves need to take place in the off hours then I can choose when to install them. There is NO CONTROL over updates. They happen
 willy nilly, often slowing down my computer. When that happens, I'm not sure if it's an update or my computer having an issue, then later I check and sure enough, some updates have happened and are ready to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft really needs to address the control over updates issue. I should have COMPLETE control over that, not MS.
</p>
<p>I feel like they're being forced on me and then I have work to do and whoops, an update is happening and my computer is SLOW as a result. Yes, I can choose when to INSTALL them, but I should have control over when the initial update downloads in the first
 place. I had this control in Windows 7. That way I could research any issues on the updates that were listed and choose which ones I wanted to load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is really bothering me about Windows 10. I like the new look and interface but updates are really turning me off of Windows 10 and making me want Windows 7 back.</p>

<p>First off, stop shaking your xbox... you're going to break it and shaking is not covered under warranty. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the sound, I get that noise sometimes. &nbsp;It's the vent cover for the hard drive that is rattling. &nbsp;Just touch it for a second and the sound will stop.</p>

<h2>            upgrading to build 16.4.3522.0110</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded windows Movie maker to the latest build <strong>( 16.4.3522.0110) from (16.4.3505.0912</strong>) and right away I noticed that all of the transitions except for 5, disappeared . At the same time Messenger Live got installed... I thought this was
 no longer around ? I am contemplating doing a restore . Any suggestions.</p>

            <p>Offline installation means you download the full installer [135Mb] ONCE. When you run it, it does't download the applications; it has everything it needs with that one file. It makes the installation go faster because it's not dependent on your Internet
 speed.</p>

            <p>I would do the restore and go back and ensure you have deselected the Messenger option; that application is dead. It might have been a faulty install.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>If you'd like to download the full installer for Microsoft Windows Essentials 2012 for offline installation [includes all Windows Essentials apps], you can use this link to download it…<br />

            Hi Thomaz
<br />
<br />etwB is basically the logging that is going on in Windows in the background
<br />
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Privacy
<br />
<br />In there you will find a multitude of different logging options that you can turn ofr like:
<br />
<br />'Feedback &amp; Diagnostics' tab and set 'Feedback frequency' as 'Never'
<br />
<br />another is 'Send your device data to Microsoft'
<br />
<br />And many others
<br />
<br />By disabling some of those you should reduce the RAM being used by etwB       
        </p>

<h2>            How do I pin websites to start in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I want to pin a web page from Edge&nbsp;to the Start screen, Taskbar and desk top but when I click on the "More" option and "Pin this page to start", &nbsp;I get a pop-up saying "This app is trying to pin a tile to start", which stays on the screen for 2 seconds,
 then disappears and nothing happens.

    <title>Flight Simulator 2004 Airspeed Indicator Glitch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> osterizer8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flight Simulator 2004 Airspeed Indicator Glitch</h2>
                    For some time I have been having this problem. My airspeed indicators will jump up and down in airspeed readings- even when I'm not moving! this is quite annoying, as the jumps can skip over as many as 10 knots. They appear to be random. The reading jumps
 both above and below my actual (I think) airspeed. Is there any way to fix this, or will I have to just live with it? Thanks in advance!

            Hey Dyfeil,
<br />
<br />That totally isn't ideal, it could be possible that you're experiencing discarded tabs.
<br />
<br />To make sure, enter this into your Chrome's address bar: chrome://discards/
<br />
<br />See if there's a check in the Discarded column next to the tab you want not to be discarded, like that Facebook tab.
<br />
<br />People on the Google Chrome Help Forum may also have an idea on what to do, probably better to ask this there since they probably know better than me: <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/...</a>
<br />
<br />Good luck on fixing your issue, let me know of the results with the discarded tabs.

            Dyfeil,
<br />
<br />Thanks for the information, sorry about the late response. Another thing I can chalk this up to, though it isn't definite, slow internet speeds and/or latency.
<br />
<br />When you go to <a href="http://fast.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://fast.com</a> what speeds do you encounter? I'd also like for you to open up a Command Prompt session and enter a command, then provide the results: ping 8.8.8.8
<br />
<br />That should ping Google's DNS and test for latency. Just some troubleshooting steps to narrow down in finding a solution, let me know.

</p><p>In September or October I upgrade Skype. The result was that I now have what appears to be the earlier version Icon that's pops up along with the old screen.&nbsp; If I'm using the text function I get both screens showing the current text.&nbsp; The old versions screen
 also comes up along&nbsp; never version.&nbsp; Kind of a pain. Does is there an easy way to get rid of the old one?</p>

<h3> bri_ryche  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 boot loader changed to windows 7, but there is no windows 7 on system</h2>
                    <p>This issues is somewhat of a conundrum. Somehow while uninstalling Windows Server 2012 from my system (it was on its own partition) it deleted the windows 8 boot menu from start-up and replaced it with two Windows Seven options at the start-up. They only
 thing I can come up with is EasyBCD did some changing on its own and now I have a system that tries to boot to windows 7, but does not have that OS installed. Now, I do not know what to do here. I figured I lost the Windows 8 OS and went ahead and tried to
 install Windows Seven from an installation disc, and this freezes at the start-up page for windows 7. I then tried to install windows server 2012, 2012 Essentials, and both either ask me for the key, which I enter only for it to tell me my key is not good,
 or it will just flat out not give me the option to enter the key and report an error message of "Key is not valid" I have tired running ISO images to try to install windows 8 and 7 and tried to install from a boot-able flash drive I created for both the 7
 and 8 OS. The flash drive will not boot and they are created correctly. plus I did change the boot menu to the proper order for each type of media. I can get into the BIOS of my computer, which is a HP Pavilion P7 1439.

</p><p>SO...is there any possible way to recover Windows 8 that I do not know about, or is this an issue with the system looking for 8 because the files are still intact and the boot loader just needs to be corrected with the right Windows 8 information? This is
 not my area of specialty, and a little help would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE...I was able to get an ISO image of Windows 8 to boot, and on the "Where do you want to install Windows?" page I can see my original drives. So this leads me to believe I did not lose all of my original Data (or possibly I did). I wonder if I can
 install this ISO image to the partition that I had deleted Windows Server from, and in doing so, I would be able to gain access to the old system itself because that system was on a different partition, or at least be able to correct the issue from within
 a file...Or is this wishful troubleshooting?</p>

            No...this system had windows 8.1 installed. It still has all my files on the system but not the windows 8 bootup option at start up. I installed windows 8 essential to the partition that had server 2012 on it. I can see my files but cant access them. The
 files are on another drive, and the essentials is on a different drive. I need to know how to recover these files, or if i installed windows 8 in the drive with my original files will it retain the files or wipe the drive clean. I need to get the boot option
 for the original system back at startup and try ti keep my original files.

            I was able to solve this issue by using easyBCD and deleting the windows 7 boot-loader that somehow was present, and then making the original Windows 8 boot-laoder visible to the system through easyBCD.

    <title>Microsoft should still buy Bioware. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> healthierthree4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft should still buy Bioware.</h2>
                    
<p>I know it's been thought about before, but with how the fans want new IPs and the success of Mass Effect and future installments. Microsoft should fork out a couple billion and shred EA from Bioware. I would rather see Microsoft Game Studios on the game
 cover than EA. It would give them something for the long time fans of Mass Effect going into the future with Microsoft and the next generation Xbox. I mean, who is seriously proud of EA publishing the game?</p>

<p>I agree, mass effect 1 was awesome under microsoft, then i'm guessing EA came along and pushed bioware into making it more action to appeal to the action shooter fanbase.</p>

<p>Who knows what would've happened if MS had hung onto the Mass Effect series.&nbsp; While I'm really enjoying ME3, as it does bring back some features of the first game... it still lacks something.&nbsp; I can't really put a finger on it, but for all of it's positives..
 it's weighed down by things like - the Journal, virtually no one on the Citadel you can actually interact with, and zero planet exploration.</p>

<p>Yes, positives are: In game characters mocking Garrus and his calibrations, In game characters mocking Shepard's dancing. Garrus and Joker telling jokes to each other, the Salarian *** analyzer, Blasto 6 Partners in crime. Jack being awesome.</p>
<p>Let down's so far are, No Krogan team mate, Jack doesn't rejoin the crew, The powers are horrible, Combat is a grenade fest. No exploration, no random conversations. Side missions are a joke. Weapon upgrades don't do jack.</p>

    <title>How can I set which folders are expanded by default in Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saschamarc  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I set which folders are expanded by default in Windows Explorer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I guess I am not the only one having this problem:</p>
<p>Windows Explorer always expands "Libraries" and other items directly under Desktop at startup. This is really annoying, as I never use libraries, do not want the control panel expanded, nor what they think is my home directory.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to customize it or just stop the Windows Explorer to expand at startup at all? (The latter would be less desirable but still better than the status quo.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much in advance!</p>
