<h2>            Office 365 Home premium</h2>
                    I&nbsp;purchased Office 365 Home premium for $99. I can install this on 5 devices. When I install I pay a $99 fee. Does thsi cover all 5 devices or do I need to pay again for each device?

            You only have to pay that once (a year) to allow you to use it on up to 5 machines at the same time.<br />

<p>
<span>The key thing to remember is that the 2013 license is associated with 1,
</span>presumabley<span> yours, email address.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may use the license to install on up to 5 devices at the same time, including both PC’s and Macs. The Macs still get Office 2011 for Mac, until it is eventually upgraded.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Once you install Office 365 on a computer using your email address, you may share the installation with other Windows user ids created on that computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>That first email address is considered the “administrator” of the license. It can “uninstall” the license from a given computer if you want to transfer the allowed installation to another computer.

<p><em><span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">In the case of Office 365 Home Premium and Small Business Premium, if you stop paying for those
 SKUs after a year, you'll have a grace period to figure out what to do with your stored information. In the case of Home Premium, users will be able to download their saved SkyDrive- and/or locally-saved data, open it with Office Web Apps and read/print it
 for some set period of time. (Microsoft isn't currently specifying how long that will be.) In the case of Small Business Premium, you'll have some kind of currently-unspecified grace period, as well, when you can access, read and print data stored in SharePoint
 Online.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">For users with an Office 365 Home Premium subscription, as the expiration date of that subscription

<p><span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">Once the subscription expires, the Office apps will enter a "read-only reduced functionality mode."

<h2>            Mac Outlook 2016 - Inbox list disappears after minimize....</h2>
                    <p>Every time I minimize my Outlook, upon maximizing the inbox view is blank and the ribbon is often changed to the "search" tab. The list view can be brought back again by toggling through folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can view the problem via a quick video I put together and put online: http://quick.as/0vg4srqp5</p>

            <p>The 15.8 update resolves the core issue, the update must have been just released because I checked for updaters prior to posting my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although it resolves the 'blank inbox' issue, the programming seems kind of hack. Take a look at this second video I have uploaded:&nbsp;http://quick.as/92vxspjqa</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see that yes, when you minimize/maximize the inbox is correctly displayed - however the two following issues appear:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The inbox flashes in upon maximize. No, not a deal breaker by any means, but for enterprise level software this feels pretty janky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second issue, and probably more of a concern from a usability perspective...if you have selected any email other than the email that was highlighted when the app was minimized, upon maximizing, the ribbon is thrown into the search tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, these are not deal breaker issues and they don't stop the app from being useful, but I would expect these sort of things to be sorted out for enterprise software.</p>

            <p>By Flash I mean that the contents of the inbox appear to be loaded after the window is maximized.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Watch this video: http://quick.as/lbbjhlj8d</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll notice that the contents of the inbox window are loaded after the window is re-maximized - compared with say PPT where the contents of the window stay consistent with the window during the transition from min to maximized. Again, not an issue that
 I would say is critical by any means, more just a visual peculiarity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is anything I can do to help source the search tab issue, let me know.</p>

    <title>6280 built-in IM application - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dyonas---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            6280 built-in IM application</h2>
                    I know that the phone has a built-in IM application because of the icons and the fact that it's described in the user manual I have, along with PTT. However, the firmware I have doesn't have it available. Is there a way to activate it or maybe even install
 it if it isn't included in firmware? I've tried to search for information on it but nothing came up. I know there are other applications around (such as IMPlus) to do something similar but they're generally not free or limited to one IM service. I hate that
 the networks take out useful applications like this, Nokia hear my prayer and help me activate / install this on my phone! :P

<p>MYOB says that it is something to do with the MAPI function .</p>

<p><br />
MYOB is either using Outlook to send messages or it is sending it directly - there is no requirement to use Outlook so have they explicitly stated that they are using Outlook (specifically OOM - Outlook Object Model)?</p>
<p>Would be curious to know what MYOB is doing differently for O'2010 as compared to other versions if the suggestion is that an earlier version of Outlook would resolve the problem. ContactGenie programs have an "email thiis report" function that works identically
 for all versions of Outlook - O'2000 thru O'2010. At the same time, under specific circumstances - messages can also be optionally sent &lt;without&gt; using Outlook at all and those messages will not appear in the Outlook sent items folder. All comes down to how
 things are done - not whether Outlook works or not.</p>

<h2>            Nothing working</h2>
                    I had a look at my storage and decided to delete a few apps that were on phone storage and to try to send some from phone to SD storage . As usual it looked like it was going to take forever to do my requst so I just left it doing its stuff . I came back
 to it after a while and now all apps have no icons on the start screen and none will open . I cannot open any inbuilt apps either like photos and&nbsp;contactswhich means I cannot use it as a phone . Only settings and the Net work . I have not backed up for a few
 weeks and factory reset will lose everything . This is the third time I have had mega problems since I got the phone in February .

</p><p>The video file that you are trying to play is not supported. This is why you are getting the error indicated in your initial post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern can be resolved by converting or saving your video to the supported video file formats listed on
<strong><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh986969.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Supported audio and video formats (Windows Runtime apps)">this link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an alternative solution, there are video player apps that you can download from the
<strong>Store</strong> which can play any video files. You can look for such an app in the
<strong>Store</strong> under the <strong>Photo &amp; video</strong> or the <strong>Entertainment</strong> category.</p>

            Office for iPad is still Office Lite. Often it will honor formatting created on the desktop, but you can't create the same effects in it.

<h2>            Clarification on Excel Macros with Office 365 2013</h2>
                    I had been running Office 2003 and new it was time for an upgrade. I was trying to decide between the desktop version of Office and Office 365. Since I had several PC's I wanted Office on, 365 made sense, but I heard somewhere that there might be an issue
 with Excel Macros on Office 365 so I need some research. One of the links I found was&nbsp;<a href="http://community.office365.com/en-us/forums/148/t/136922.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://community.office365.com/en-us/forums/148/t/136922.aspx</a>.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In this community forum post, Edward Qu MSFT Support writes: "...<span style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">Office 365 doesn't support Excel Macros...</span><span style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">&nbsp;"</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)"><br />
</span></div>
<div><font color="#43515b">I was frustrated and infuriated. I needed to run Excel using Macros on at least one PC. I could not figure why MS would do this, but for only $9.99/month for up to 5 PC's, it kinda made since that not all features would be&nbsp;available.&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font color="#43515b"><br />
</font></div>
<div><font color="#43515b">So I bought a stand alone 1 PC License for Excel. I signed up for Office 365 and installed it on 3 machines. I also installed the Excel stand alone onone machine. I thought to see a&nbsp;separate start menu item for each version, but no.
 Then I found that macros were working ok on my other machines. I went back to the message above, the full paragraph says "</font><span style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">Office 365 doesn't support Excel Macros. Office 365 Web Apps support most of the features of
 an Excel workbook, but not all.". &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">So now I am thinking one of two things.</span></div>
<div>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">Mr Qu did not mean that Office 365 did not support Excel macos, but that the Web Apps accessible from a browser from any computer through skydrive.com don't support macros. &nbsp;</span></li><li><font color="#43515b">Maybe when I put in my Product Key for Excel it activated macro&nbsp;capabilities&nbsp;on all the downloads from my 365 account.&nbsp;</font></li></ol>
<div><font color="#43515b">I am not almost positive item 1 above is the correct answer but please confirm.</font></div>
</div>
<div><font color="#43515b"><br />
</font></div>
<div><font color="#43515b">If indeed item 1 above is correct, now I have a copy of Excel I don't need. Is the license transferable if I sell it?</font></div>

<br />
1) You are correct. Excel 2013 indeed supports macros while Excel Web doesn't.<br />
You may check the following supporting articles:<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/create-or-delete-a-macro-HA102749033.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/create-or-delete-a-macro-HA102749033.aspx</a>

<br />
2) You may return Excel standalone. Check the following links for information regarding the same:<a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/DisplayHelpReturnsRefundsPage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />

<h2>            Word 2016 is unusable because of trial Word 365</h2>
                    I just bought and installed Microsoft Office 2016 Home &amp; Student on my new computer with Windows 10.&nbsp; It seems there was a trial Office 365 already on Windows 10 that interfered with the installation of Office 2016.&nbsp; For a fix I uninstalled all Office
 2016 and 365 (I thought), But when I downloaded 2016 again, Word 365 is still there and will pop up for a few seconds and then disappear and I can't fund Word 2016.&nbsp; How do I get rid of this trial Word 365???&nbsp; Thanks,

            Hi,
<br />
<br />If you purchase Office 2016, if you ever need to re-install or install on another PC, that will be no problem. When you purchase Office it will be registered to your Microsoft Account and you can simply use that to reinstall any time
<br />
<br />If it is a trial version on your computer , you need to uninstall the trial version and then install the one you want. 
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />For online purchases product keys are not provided. To download and install Office 365 or 2016, you may login to the My Account page on Office.com with the Microsoft account you used to register or purchase. 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/myaccount</a>
<br />
<br />If you have purchased Office 365 or 2016 from a retail store (Product Key Package), then you may register the purchased product key with the Microsoft Account and then download and install Office. Refer to the following link to sign in or create a Microsoft account to download and install Office 365.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://setup.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://setup.office.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Can't find Microsoft Office in your list to uninstall?
<br />You may have pre-installed Microsoft Office StoreDesktop Apps (Centenial Version). This version doesn't appear in the Control Panel (nor is there a Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app for Outlook in this release)
<br />
<br />Go to Settings --&gt; 
<br />Apps --&gt; 
<br />Apps &amp; Features --&gt; 
<br />scroll down the list looking for &lt;Microsoft Desktop Store Apps&gt; --. click on it --&gt; uninstall
<br />

<h2>            classic skype version &#40;7.59.37&#41; work arounds&#63; No longer working.</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,<br />
<br />
I was using&nbsp;classic skype version (7.59.37) until today when all of a sudden i randomly got logged out and have now not been able to log back in... I have tried everything to re access this skype with out having succcess</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
The only way I am able to log in now is if i update to the newest version&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Are any of you guys still having success using classic skype on a mac? if so how? I really prefer this old version as i have had all of my contacts sorted into "lists" so it was easy to contact certain groups/ lists of people when i was looking for something..<br />
<br />
Now my skype is a giant contact pool with no organization what so ever!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Any suggesting or advice would be much appreciated!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Support for phones running 8.1 ended mid 2017.&nbsp; Not being able to upgrade does not keep your phone from working. We have phones running 8.1 and 10.</p>
<p>The only Windows phones you will see now are from third party.</p>

<h2>            Word 2010 blacking out numbering for Heading 3 in body and TOC</h2>
                    <p>My boss gave me a document to fix. Word 2010 has started blacking out (black box) the number for Heading 3 headers in the body and the TOC. I make the blocking go away by modifying the style numbering, but I can't get the numbering to work properly (won't
 let me set the numbering at X.X.X for Heading 3).</p>
<p>Has anyone seen this black-blocking on header level numbers (and do you know how to fix it)?</p>

            <p>And actually, here is a solution which works. </p>
<ol>
<li>Find a document which has the correct formatting in it. </li><li>Save it as a template </li><li>In the corrupted (for that is what it is) document go to the styles dialog box. The easiest way to do this is to use CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+S, otherwise you have to find your way through the poxy ribbon
</li><li>Hit the manage style button at the bottom of the box (right hand one of the three)
</li><li>Hit import/export </li><li>in the right hand window of the box which appears, hit close file </li><li>Now navigate to the uncorrupted document and select it. </li><li>In the scroll box above navigate to the style you want to fix and click on it (single click)
</li><li>The copy arrow should now poin to the right, toward teh corrupt document </li><li>Hit copy </li><li>Say yes to everything </li><li>Close all dialog boxes</li></ol>
<p>This fixed it for me, hopefully it will work for you.</p>

            <p>Hi RahulVadgama</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are having an issue to locate your recorded videos on your Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should find your video recordings in Photos&gt;Camera roll on your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also want to make sure that in settings&gt;swipe to applications&gt;photos+camera&gt;Auto upload is selected to OneDrive&gt;Best quality (needs WiFi)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
