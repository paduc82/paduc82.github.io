<h2>            Office 2011 for Mac not opening files from network</h2>
                    I&nbsp;have a MAC user running MAC OS 10.7.2. After a period of time Office 2011 (both Word and Excel) will no longer open a document if it is on a network share. It used to work but now it doesn't. If she copies the file to her local drive it opens. We tried
 opening a document that is in the root of the share thinking that the path name was to long but that didn't work either. Her Adobe apps have no problem opening files from the network only office. She has all of the latest updates of office and the OS. Does
 anyone have any ideas?

<h2>            Reinstallation of paid apps after a Windows 10 update &#40;note update, not upgrade&#41;</h2>
                    <p>When I log in into my Microsoft account, regardless if it is account.microsoft.com or windowsphone.com I can get</p>
<p>a list on purchased apps. But how to reinstall them? Note, once during the updating I had to do a hard reset.</p>
<p>Neither site allows reinstallation,&nbsp;account.microsoft.com has no mention of reinstallation whatsoever. WindowsPhone.com</p>
<p>as an item marked Reinstallation but in all tries I did it could not find the phone. It states that push notification is necessary but in the latest Windows 10 update (November) there is no push notification anywhere.</p>
<p>Thus; How to reinstall apps?</p>

            Windowsphone.com is only used for windows phone 8.1, windows 10 uses apps.microsoft.com but to reinstall apps go onto your store, press the hamburger button then press library you can then scroll through all your apps installing the ones you want by pressing
 the install button next to the app name

                    <p>I am using Word 2016. Every time I update my TOC, a graphic I created with Smart Art gets pulled into the table. There is no heading style in the graphic. What could be causing this to happen?&nbsp;</p>

            The heading Style need not be 'in' the graphic. Your issue will be due to the Smart Art being in, or anchored to, a paragraph formatted with the heading Style.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Click on the paragraph to which the SmartArt image is anchored, or, if it is inline, then the paragraph in which it is located. Note that when you select the SmartArt itself (so that the selection handles appear), the Styles gallery on the Home Tab is greyed
 out--you cannot set those conventional Word styles to SmartArt diagrams, although on the SmartArt Tools--Design Tab, there are SmartArt styles that you can use, which are entirely different "things."</p>
<p>So if the diagram is not inline with the text, then click on the diagram to select it, and note the paragraph to which the little anchor is attached in the margin. That is the style that you want to check.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if it is inline, then click just to the right of the diagram, so that the I-beam will be flashing just right of the diagram. Now check the style of the paragraph in the Styles gallery of the Home tab. If you don't see it there, that may be
 because of your gallery settings, but for your purposes, the simplest way to get that information may be to press Ctrl+Shift+S to have the small Apply Styles dialog appear--it will tell you the style.</p>
<p>The simplest fix, if you aren't really using styles, is to make that paragraph Normal style.</p>
<p>If you are using styles, I would argue that the paragraph should be Body Text style.</p>

            <p>I've checked it and it does not appear that the heading style is anywhere near the smart art graphic. I am using styles and replaced the normal style with body, yet the graphic continues to show up in my TOC when I update. When I view the TOC advanced properties,
 it seems to want body 1 as part of the TOC. I remove the 1 next to Body 1, so only Heading 1, 2, and 3 should be dragged into the TOC. Those are the only 3 styles listed for TOC, yet the graphic is still dragged in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must be missing something hidden. Other ideas?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ok, that tidbit of information was helpful.</p>
<p>First, note that Body 1 is not the same as Body Text.</p>
<p>Second, am I right in assuming that you have Body 1 as the style for the paragraph in which the Smart Art diagram appears?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this:</p>
<p>Again, note my instructions from before to make sure you are in the paragraph in which the diagram appears, without having the diagram selected.</p>
<p>Again, open the Apply Styles dialog (Ctrl+Shift+S). Tell me the name of the style there.</p>
<p>Then, click on the Modify... button to open the Modify Styles dialog. There, select Format (bottom left) and then Paragraph...</p>
<p>I am anticipating that the Outline level listed on the Indents and Spacing tab is set to&nbsp;Level 1. Change that to Body text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't solve the problem, them maybe sharing the file on OneDrive or providing some screen caps would help.</p>

<p>What's important is not where the object is but what it's anchored to. Click on the object and look where its anchor appears. If that's a heading, move the anchor to somewhere else. If it's not a heading, click on the paragraph concerned and check its Style
 - which should not be a Heading Style.</p>

    <title>Biologist, need help making interactive animal kingdom tool in excel. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Biologist, need help making interactive animal kingdom tool in excel.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am a biologist and I am interested in making an interactive animal kingdom tree using excel. I know there might be better tools to accomplish this, however my department head made it very clear
 that he needs it be an excel workbook. Here is how I would like it to work:</p>
<ul>
<li>In one column there is a variety of animal classes such as mammals, birds, fish, etc.</li><li>Clicking on one of these animal class buttons/cells will bring up a brief list of corresponding animals. For example, clicking on fish will bring up a list next to it (it MUST be on the same spreadsheet) that includes salmon,
 tuna, bass, etc.).</li><li>Clicking a specific species of animal on this adjacent list will bring up an image next to it of the corresponding image of the animal. For example, clicking "Tuna" will pull up an image of a tuna next to it&nbsp;(I would like
 to have the images stored on the workbook, perhaps in different spreadsheets).</li></ul>
<p>Another problem I am facing is that the end product must be somewhat protected, for example, I don't want end-users to be able to select cells.</p>
<p>I tried using slicers but that didn't turn out too well. I'm currently trying buttons with limited success...<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>EDIT: I have included a process diagram of what I am envisioning. Ideally I would like the second column which contains examples to change depending on which class from the previous column is selected.
 I would also like the image(s) hidden by default until a particular example is selected. I'm ok with having a reset button, but I would really like this tool to be dynamic - allowing you to click through multiple classes/examples without having to manually
 reset the page each time.</p>

            <p>The code in the Excel workbook at the&nbsp;following link was written hastily and needs polish. It's just a suggestion. It is currently set up to automatically delete the 2nd column of rectangles and picture after a 5 second delay unless the mouse pointer is
 over the picture. This is optional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=EF0F2C9B12F325A0!1786&amp;authkey=!AB6nUpcJEqTc8kc&amp;ithint=file%2cxlsm</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second column of rectangles shown&nbsp;in the below picture&nbsp;is populated from a named range&nbsp;intended to include the names of the animals.&nbsp;The rectangle captions will be the same as the names in the range.&nbsp;In other words, the top rectangle that was clicked
 should have the name "Seal" in it. I just didn't take the time to set it up right. The number of rectangles created is depends on the number of names in the range.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2759014f-bb94-4958-98ec-3630fbda13b2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:&nbsp; Note that you will have to download the workbook at the above link. Excel Online does not display shapes or allow code execution. I changed the workbook to include some animal names in the Mammals range&nbsp;to serve as an example of how to set it up.
 So the above column of rectangles will list "Seal", "Ground Hog",&nbsp; "Polar Bear", "Kangaroo" ... instead of&nbsp;Mammal1, Mammal2 etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit No. 2:&nbsp; I&nbsp;fixed it to be compatible when opened using Excel 2003. I also added a demo feature that lets you toggle the picture size by clicking it. Clicking it expands the size. Clicking it again returns it to original size.</p>

<p>If someone sends me a NEW meeting invite it shows up in my inbox and I am able to accept. This is working fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;However, if they send another update or cancel the same meeting, then the&nbsp;revised calendar invite does not come to my inbox but goes directly into my Deleted Folder. Due to this, I am not able to see if a future meeting is canceled or rescheduled until
 I go to the calendar view where I see the changes.</p>
<p>Is there a setting/option due to which a cancellation or an update to an invite is directly going to the deleted folder and bypassing my inbox?</p>

            <p>On a UserForm you can use the ControlTipText property of the control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in a sheet it is not so easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need a hidden / invisible control for the tool tip.</li><li>Each "user" control must have a MouseMove event routine. Inside that routine make the "tool tip" control visible and move to an appropriate point.
</li><li>Unfortunately the sheet hasn't a MouseMove event routine, so you can not hide the "tool tip" control when the mouse leave the "user" control. As workaround, use the Worksheet_SelectionChange event routine and hide the "tool tip" control when called.</li></ol>

<h2>            Excel keeps crushing</h2>
                    <p>I'm using MS Office nearly daily from over 15 years, from basic things to VBA etc . My Excel (2016, on Win 10, all updated etc.) started to crush 2 -3 weeks ago:</p>
<p>1) It crushed over 20 times with the same file, until i finally worked some very simple tasks (5 min work took like over 1 h). It crushed form everything, like enter a sum(), moving a cell, entering a string. From the next day it worked ok for 2 weeks. In
 that period i've done some serious tasks, like running macros for a couple of hours each, in files exceeding 70 MB, doing maps from results etc. So IT WORKED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Sunday 9.04.17 the crushes returned and i have installed OffCAT (no problem detected), then reinstalled the office. Now there is absolutely no fun to work on Sundays, it certainly didn't helped to spend like 3 hours doing practically nothing. BTW reinstalling
 did NOTHING.</p>
<p>In the Event Viewer log i've noticed this:</p>
The description for Event ID 2011 from source Microsoft Office cannot be found. Either the component that raises this event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted. You can install or repair the component on the local computer.<br />
<br />
If the event originated on another computer, the display information had to be saved with the event.<br />
<br />
The following information was included with the event:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Application: excel.exe; IdentityType: Unknown; HasToken: 1; AutoLoadIdentity: 0; SessionLicensing: 0; LvuxSqm: 36; SppReady: 1; CurrentHr: 0x803d0013; CorrelationId: {D3B9217D-BB2A-4C3A-8C2A-216D867B3223}; OlsErrorCode: 0x407; CurrentProductReleaseId: HomeBusinessRetail;
 AllProductReleaseIds (from store): HomeBusinessRetail
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3) 10.04.17 - 12.04.17 Excel worked. Again i've using it with different files, including dynamic simulation results, maps etc.</p>
<p>4) 13.04.17 Excel completely useless. It crush when inserting a line etc. It crushed for more than 20 times. Multiple PC restarts, scanned it with 2 AV + 1 anti malware. OffCAT - no problem.&nbsp;Event Viewer log: no entry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p />

            When you install programs you should ALWAYS choose to install on the storage card if that option is available.&nbsp; Some programs need to be installed in Main Memory but you should choose those programs sparingly.<br />
<br />
Pocket Mechanic is something to look at if you want to move some items from Main Memory to your Storage Card.&nbsp; Here is a piece to read on their website that you might find interesting:<br />

            It means you have unread events - usually meeting requests. You can right click on the folder and choose Mark all Read or search the calendar for unread items if you want to see what they are.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Just wondering if the free version of Office 365 MDM is available to anyone with Exchange Online (plan 1) subscription?. I noticed that the "mobile management" portal is available within my&nbsp;Office 365 admin default screen but I don't seem to have the ability
 to enrol a mobile device for some reason.</p>

<p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>It’s not feasible to add the devices directly to Office 365. Users in an organization must complete the enrollment and activation steps to enroll their devices in Mobile Device Management for Office 365 (MDM). For the details, please see&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enroll-your-mobile-device-for-work-or-school-c8ac722d-dcaf-4135-8345-3e6327f5d3c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Enroll
 your mobile device for work or school</a>.</p>
<p>Before that, we need to follow the step 1 to step 3 to set up in the article below to configure some settings in the Office 365 admin center:<br />

            Yes I still get that weird message and one more thing the message appears once the homepage completely loads and if I try to set through Internet Options when I go to programs tab Make Default option is always available once I click that option Make Default
 button is greyed out and when I close and reopen Internet options and go to programs tab Make Default button is blue. I think I should do a data backup and do a factory restore but again any help will save me from doing a lot of work and will save my time

<h2>            Outlook 2007 - Archive folders are empty</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I hope I'm not repeating anyone else's issue here, I've done some searching but haven't found exactly what I'm looking for.</p>
<p>We've recently upgraded our Server to SBS 2008. We are running a mixture of Outlook 2003, 2007 and 2010 on the client machines and a mixture of Windows XP and Windows 7. Since the upgrade AutoArchive of emails does not seem to be working. The Archive Folders
 is there, as well as the folder structure each client has but no emails have been archived - all folders are empty. Also the Archive.pst file seems to be very small in size (obviously as it has nothing in it). Anyway does anyone have any ideas on how to get
 this working?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Because of the migration, the modified date on the messages have been changed which is what AutoArchive uses.<br />
For Outlook 2007, you can archive based on the Received date via a hotfix and a registry change. For details see;<br />
<a href="http://www.msoutlook.info/question/541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.msoutlook.info/question/541</a></p>
<p>Otherwise, archive manually by moving the items which you want to archive from the Exchange mailbox to your pst-file or wait until the AutoArchive date is reached.</p>

            <p>Thanks Roady. </p>
<p>That Outlook considers the " modified" date rather than " received" date threw me off track as well. The work around was to :</p>
<p>1. Make a new set&nbsp; archive folders. </p>
<p>2. Delete files from the "Inbox" which are within a desired range date and move them into the respective IN and SEND subfolders of the Archive Folders.
</p>
<p>3. Archive the "Archive folders" containing all its subfolders by selecting it .
</p>
<p>4. On the pop up screen on archiving requirements, indicate the current date.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is most practical since not&nbsp;sure &nbsp;as to when any of those selected emails were last modified. This is the key!.
</p>
<p>5. Once that is done and a file name assigned, click OK. The archive will produce a pst file with all your emails in their respective named subfolders . In fact the archived folder will appear in the folder list.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>6. To check for the pst file, just go to File - Open - Outlook Data File. You should find it there. Works for me.</p>

<h3> z ez y  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender wont turn on after malwarebytes trial</h2>
                    <p>Windows8.1</p>
<p>I just noticed the Action Center alert in my notification area today and it says that my spyware/antivirus programs are turned off. I go to windows defender and it says that it is turned off so I open windows defender and press the "Turn on" button, defender
 then grays out for about a minute and gives me the error code 0x800705b4 Real-time protection couldn't be turned on. This operation returned because the timeout period expired.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accidentally accepted the premium trial version of MalwareBytes when I downloaded it a while ago. I have since uninstalled it and used their full uninstallation software&nbsp;<a href="https://helpdesk.malwarebytes.org/entries/25291497-How-do-I-uninstall-Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not used any other antivirus programs other than that. I was only planning on using Malwarebytes for their system scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One odd thing about this is that on the Home tab of Defender it says Real-time protection:Off yet Virus and spyware definitions:Up to date and then I go ti the settings tab and it says that real-time protection is checked, Screenshots attached</p>

            <p>Something fundamental to the operation of Windows 8.x&nbsp;is broken on your PC and has been for months, so the potential that malware has crept in since this began is high, though there's no way to be certain at this point since it's been far too long without
 protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though this error message can result due to license validation issues, there apparently can be other causes, so you might want to take a look at the post marked as the Answer in the following thread to determine which service(s) are failing.&nbsp; Though that
 thread is old and functionally dead at this point, you can return here and post what you found so everyone helping here knows what the situation is.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-security/im-getting-fault-0x80070426-on-windows-8-what-can/5f8e51e4-bceb-4be7-9a89-7cda134c25f9">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-security/im-getting-fault-0x80070426-on-windows-8-what-can/5f8e51e4-bceb-4be7-9a89-7cda134c25f9</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the service that is failing might be critical to the operation of Windows as a whole, I wouldn't trust it for any use other than a toy until the true problem&nbsp;is found and fixed.&nbsp; So installing another anti-malware product is no guarantee of security
 and thus not a safe solution by itself&nbsp;at this point.</p>

    <title>Table in Mail Merge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fgbdrum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Table in Mail Merge</h2>
                    <p>I am doing a mail merge from Excel 2007 to Word 2007. My Word doc has a table in it that looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merge Field 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merge Field 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merge Field 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merge Field 4</p>
<p>
</p><p>Program 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Program 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Program 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>Program 4</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Excel source is such that not every employee will have participated in every program, however, when they do participate in a program, every merge field will be filled in. For example, John Smith participated in Programs 1, 2, and 4. All four merge fields
 for these three programs will be filled in. I would like the merge to have a condition IF statements in it to say something to the effect of:</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF Merge Field 1 is blank (which will only happen if they did not participate in the program), then delete that row in my table.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in the example, John Smith's table would only have 3 rows. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to accomplish this without using VBA? Thanks for any and all help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fabio</p>

            <p>You can number equations without using a table, but if you number them with a caption using
<strong>References | Captions | Insert Caption</strong> and then want to cross-reference the caption, you'll find that you get the equation with it, even if you choose "Only label and number."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming a display equation (centered in its own paragraph), set a center tab stop at the center of the line and a&nbsp;&nbsp;right-aligned tab stop at the right margin. Tab to the first stop and insert the equation, then tab to the second stop and use
<strong>References | Captions | Insert Caption</strong> to insert an Equation caption. If you want just the number, check the box for "Exclude label from caption." If you want parentheses around the number, you'll have to add them yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way to number the equations is just to use a manually generated SEQ field: { SEQ Eq }, but you will not be able to cross-reference this unless you bookmark it manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have used the native Equation Editor in Word 2013 (as opposed to the old Microsoft Equation 3.0 object), you will find that adding a caption to a paragraph containing an equation applies the Caption style, which in Word 2013 is italic and smaller
 than the body text. You can get around this by modifying the style, or you can just use a table as described below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to cross-reference the equations, a table will be required. The usual suggestion, if you want the equation centered, is to insert a three-column, single-row borderless&nbsp;table. Make the third column just wide enough to accommodate the caption and
 the first column the same width, leaving the center column for the equation. Insert a dummy&nbsp;equation and caption and then select the entire table and save it as an AutoText entry (Quick Part, building block). When you want to insert another equation and caption,
 insert the AutoText entry, then replace the equation.</p>

    <title>Printer installer missing, can&#39;t start print spooler - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cherylchiarello  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer installer missing, can&#39;t start print spooler</h2>
                    Ran virus scan on my windows 8.1 laptop and now can't print. Initial msg was "print spooler is stopped" but when i tried to start it would not start and had msg "an installer is missing."&nbsp;
<br />
After MANY attempts to remedy, I did a system restore which i thought would resolve the problem but ir did not---the problem remains- still no installer and print spooler is stopped.&nbsp; I got consistant msg both before and after restore:<br />
<br />
c:\WINDOWS\system32\Peakoar64.dll is either not designed to run on windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media Error 0xc000012f.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Did i mention this is my work laptop and that I work at a tiny company w/NO tech support and therefore can't install the program again and don't have the original installation media. &nbsp; I am just about desperate to fix this problem. Help!

<p>Hi - this has cropped up before (not for quite a while) - a keyboard&nbsp;problem could be the cause but unless you are using a usb device that's probably unlikely.</p>
<p>Try the first two basic fixes shown here...</p>

</p>
<p>Don't try the registry one at this stage... see if either of those options get it working again. Update and we'll take it from there.... Ric.</p>

    <title>automatically add date to filename when saving a word document&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            automatically add date to filename when saving a word document&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would very much appreciate if you could help me with this!</p>
<p>I want to be able to manage versions of a word document by making an automatic suffix to the filename when saving the document.</p>
<p>E.g. "Master's thesis_[yyyymmdd].docx" would do great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some searching and it seems that there are several macros available to do the job. However, as this is really a quite simple task, and I feel that macro-documents are quite inconvenient when several people are working with the same document and you
 have to email it around and so on, I'm wondering is there really no way to do this without macros?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for help, any tips are well appreciated!</p>

            <p>You specified without macros. I'm tossing one out, anyway.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The following macros, if placed in your document will append a date to whatever is in the Title Property. Note, no provision is made for more than one version in a day.<br />
</p>
<p>These should run automatically whenever the document is saved.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
