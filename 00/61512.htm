<h2>            Unable to uninstall programs, can&#39;t view &#39;properties,&#39; CCleaner no longer works, Windows Explorer crashing constantly, multiple service host processes.</h2>
                    Hello all, I'm currently running Windows 8.1 on an Acer Aspire 5600U. There have been a variety of windows features that have simply stopped working for me and it's impairing my ability to do much of anything. I've looked online for solutions to these
 individual issues, and I've found none that work for me. There are no other posts (to my knowledge) that exhibit ALL of these symptoms.&nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here are the issues:<br />
<br />
<b>I can't install or uninstall certain things.</b> My friend installed Dragon so I could see if I like it, and I don't, so I tried to install it, and it claims to not have the security. I tried again while running the control panel as administrator; still
 no luck. Additionally, I can't install certain things, like Quicktime. It has the same security quandary. Other programs install/uninstall fine. I haven't found a pattern yet.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>I can't view the properties of anything. </b>For whatever reason, when I right-click on something and try to view the properties, it's just not happening. I click a million times, and nothing happens. It doesn't freeze, but it also doesn't do anything.
 So if the above issue (not being able to install or uninstall) is caused by a permissions issue, I've had no luck because I can't change permissions.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>CCleaner no longer works. </b>Not <i>totally</i>&nbsp;sure if this is related to the others, but CCleaner no longer works. I do a cleaning every week or so and now, no matter what I try to clean (useless files or reg files) it gets stuck at 2%. It won't
 move. I've looked up this problem online and other people have had it, but their solutions don't work for me at all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Windows Explorer freezes all the time.</b>&nbsp;If I click the windows button too soon after logging in, the entire thing freezes and I have to ctrl+alt+delete to log off, and log back in. It's not only the windows button: if I use the windows key on my
 keyboard at any time to do anything, windows explorer freezes and doesn't regain functionality. I have to open the task manager to restart it before it begins to work again.
<b>However, if I attempt to use the search function at any time, it freezes regardless of how long the computer has been logged in.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Finally </b>(and I think this is contributing to windows freezing all the time)<b>, there are a huge amount of service host processes running all the time, and hogging up the disk and memory.
</b>This happens particularly right when I log in, but even now I have multiple going at one time. Sometimes they get all the way up to 17 different processes, taking up around 96% memory. It's insane. I tried to screenshot a photo of the processes list, but
 the dialogue box keeps telling me that there was an error uploading when I try to add it to this post.<br />
<br />
Please note that every other program works fine. As long as I don't touch the windows key or any of its associates, it won't freeze. Currently I've been opening the task manager with ctrl+shift+esc and then running new tasks from that window. Otherwise windows
 freezes, and I have to restart it from the task manager.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any help would be amazingly appreciated. I need to work on a video for class, and because I can't install quicktime it's making it awfully difficult. I did not initially have any of these problems at all.<br />
<br />
<b>Current things I have already tried:&nbsp;</b><br />
Scanning with malwarebytes<br />
Running MSCONFIG and disabling any non-microsoft services at start up.<br />
Opening cmd and scanning with sfc<br />
Uninstalling most recent updates<br />
System Restore to an earlier date<br />
<br />
And a few other issue-specific solutions that didn't work and aren't worth mentioning here.</div>
<div>Thank you!<br />
<br />

            Hi Vijin,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I tried all three of your suggestions.&nbsp;<br />
<b>Method 1:&nbsp;</b><br />
On the suggested page, I looked under 'My computer hangs or freezes randomly;' its suggestions was to update my computer. My computer has the most recent available updates, so this doesn't apply.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Method 2:</b></div>
<div>This was the most interesting. I created a new user account, and it failed to create any semblance of a desktop. To reach the desktop I had to force the computer to pull up task manager using ctrl+shift+esc. Otherwise I could not reach the desktop (no
 button on the start screen or anything). I was still unable to search (froze, as usual), and there were still many multiples of service host processes.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Method 3:</b></div>
<div>I ran the suggested repair as you suggested. It said, "Automatic repair cannot repair your PC." There was one line of dialogue below that suggesting I look somewhere, but I've lost the piece of paper I wrote it on.<br />
<br />
Where do we go from here?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience,&nbsp;</div>

            Oh! Some good news, though: I left CCleaner running overnight; it took forever, it seems, but it ran all the way.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Caveat is, there's no change in anything else. CCleaner is still on the struggle bus; it appears it CAN run but only if you leave it going for a while.

    <title>Flickering Yellow Tint, Possible White Balance Issue on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Flickering Yellow Tint, Possible White Balance Issue on Windows 10 Apps and Features</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently experiencing display issues in several of Windows 10 apps and features. I am certain it is a software issue as the flickering yellow tint does not appear on white backgrounds in other apps. Here is an example of the yellow tint:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c32ec16e-108a-4b00-9fda-4373b4944e66" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c32ec16e-108a-4b00-9fda-4373b4944e66" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the flickering does not show as it is a screenshot. This same flickering yellow tint appears on all white backgrounds on Windows 10 apps like Mail above, Store, and Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another observation I found was that it sometimes went away when the window was not selected. Because of this, I was not able to capture a screenshot of the yellow tint on the Display Settings window with the Snipping Tool as it would return to normal when
 I attempted to. Instead, I was able to capture it using the print screen command as shown below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f411a2f5-0bb5-4014-bf2b-ed81ce957a15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f411a2f5-0bb5-4014-bf2b-ed81ce957a15" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Would anyone know any solutions for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Josh</p>

    <title>Activation of Win 10 after a recovery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim2839  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activation of Win 10 after a recovery</h2>
                    <p>My kid's computer was upgraded free to Win 10. Recently it went to "Recovery" and I loaded a stick with the win 10 files from my computer to get it going again. It restarted win 8.1 then uploaded win 10 and asked for a product key. From my reading it should
 be a digital key and automatically update, but doesn't. There is no way to get past the screen asking for the product key, which I do not have. Now what?? Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are sure there is no way to continue the process, (it will usually show Do this later, Skip or I'm reinstalling windows) then you may be using the wrong edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure the recovery "stick" from your computer is the same edition as was on your kid's computer. That is Home or Pro, Single Language. There is a good chance it should be Home, is that what you have installed on your computer.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are correct in that it shouldn't ask for a key as a digital licence registers the hardware on MS servers.</p>

    <title>Icon Label Text Color will NOT change and Drop Shadows will NOT go - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephen_c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Icon Label Text Color will NOT change and Drop Shadows will NOT go away&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have pored over these threads and other forums and done everything that has been suggested to get rid of drop shadows on icon label text and they just keep coming back!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The icon label text is white and I want it to be black. There is no setting anywhere in Windows 10 to change this! In previous versions it was possible to change the background color, even if you are using a picture background, and that color forced the
 icon label text to be either black or white based on that color. This is not possible in Windows 10. It is only possible to use EITHER a picture or background color, and the colors are VERY limited. And Windows decides for you the label text color.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a designer, and I find it important to keep mid grey tones in my background to make it easier to identify color casts in my work. And I want to set an appropriate label color. In this case BLACK with NO DROP SHADOW.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my background apparently confuses the hell out of Windows 10 when trying to automatically set the label text based on my background. I'm surprised the developers didn't even think about this. There NEEDS TO BE a manual option!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that sometimes after booting up everything is fine. This problem is very inconsistent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I have noticed that EVERY TIME&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I use the TaskView (or when I dock app windows at the edge of the screen, which also enables Task View mode) the text will change to white with
 a drop shadow. Then the only thing to do is to reboot and hope it changes back.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This points to the fact that there is something SERIOUSLY WRONG with how this works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>And BTW yes, I have gone to advanced system settings and disabled drop shadow on icon text, and yes, the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">registry setting "ListviewShadow" is set to zero.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there ANYTHING I can do?<br />

            <p>I've had the same issue too of wanting black text for my desktop icons when I switched a wallpaper that was light. I searched through forums and could not find any solutions to this problem either so I thought I'd post it here. The solution I found that
 worked best for me is to go into the Ease of Access menu. From there, there's High Contrast Settings, where you can customize the color of the task bar, text color, hyperlink, etc and save as a theme. There's a limited set of colors to choose from but it's
 working for me so far minus being unable to adjust the task bar color the way I want it. Hope that helps!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Xbox One Game Sharing Question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Game Sharing Question</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have a question regarding Game Sharing on the Xbox One.</p>
<p>I bought Far Cry 4 and my friend and I want to play co-op but he does not have it. He said we should Game Share it along with a few of his games that I do not own. That would mean he would have to set
<em>his</em> Xbox One as <em>my</em> Home Xbox and I would have to set <em>my</em> Xbox One as
<em>his</em> Home Xbox. I understand this option exists (according to the Xbox website) for multiple Xbox Ones in one household as part of a Family sharing plan. But the problems here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>He is my friend. Not a family member. </li><li>We do not live in the same household. He lives 15 miles away from me. </li></ul>
<p>Is this legal? I researched some but the answers were kind of hazy. They were all variations of, "pretty much."</p>
<p>Neither of us want to do it if it risks us getting banned.</p>

            <p>Right, for family members in the same household but outside of that there has been no clear directive given. There are many people who do this, but I have also seen some of them report having been told they will no longer be allowed to do this.</p>
<p>On the Xbox 360 this is clearly written into the Terms of Use as not permissible so while the official word has been incredibly vague it does seem like it's not worth the risk of potential action taken against you for doing this.</p>

<p>I have the same problem on a Lenovo computer. The card reader is actually working fine, it seems the manufacturer driver is installed and the device is correctly recognized and it appears in the device list. No idea why would Windows want to update the driver

<p>This Error could happen if your computer has ever plugged in some usb devices, Smart card reader or USB key fob of your bank, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open Windows PowerShell (admin) , then type <strong><span><em>set dvegr_show_nonpresent_devices=1</em></span></strong>&nbsp; and Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Open Device Manager,&nbsp; choose View, then activate 'show hidden devices'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Maybe You'll find three options related to smart card in the device list: smart card, smart card filter and smart card reader.&nbsp; &nbsp;Double click the 'smart card', then you'll see some hidden USB devices with grey font or icon, Uninstall
 device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Check Windows Update.</p>

            Your graphics card would need to support that resolution over the type of connection cable you are using.&nbsp; Make sure that it does (check the graphics driver manual/documentation) and that you are using their official driver.

<h2>            Microsoft Visual c&#43;&#43; 2005 sp1 Redistributable ATL Security Update Error 1935</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was having some issues with my computer so I decided to do a fresh install of Windows 10. upon trying to reinstall the autodesk building suite, the installer would error out due to the inability to install visual c++ 2005 sp1 redistributable atl security
 update. When I attempted to install this manually, it would then give me an error of 1935.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done some research on this error but I haven't had any luck, and the lack of fixit support has greatly reduced the options. Does anybody have a solution for this?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I apologize for not addressing you in a timely manner. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to inform you that if you receive a 1935 error when you try to install software, the Windows file system transaction log has become corrupted.
</span></p>
<p><span>To correct this install error, you need to clear the log. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest that you try the steps below and check if it helps</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Open an Administrator command prompt. To do this, press Windows key + X keys together and choose Command Prompt(Admin).
</li><li>Now type, <strong>fsutil resource setautoreset true C:\</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>This assumes that C: is the drive in which Windows 10 is installed.

            <p>I had run across that solution before as well, ultimately it did not work. I instead modified the setup.ini to exclude the check for the C++ installation, which ended up solving the issue. Thankfully there were no stability issues due to the lack of the
 ATL update, and the standard 2005 version installed instead.</p>

<h2>            Cannot play game error Shogun_CPP has stopped</h2>
                    <p>Original title : Game Problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a game, Shogun:Total War, which has worked on my system as recently as four months ago, but won't play now. It will play the intro, and I can play tutorials, but when I try to start a new game I get a "Shogun_CPP has stopped" message and the game
 shuts down. I haven't added any programing or changed anything in my system in the time frame. The only thing I can think of is that one of the Windows auto updates contained something the game doesn't like, because the updates are the only changes that have
 occurred. How do I troubleshoot this so my game will work?</p>

    <title>HP Envy Miracast problems. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HP Envy Miracast problems.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having trouble getting my HP Envy 15 j151sa to project to a wireless screen. This laptop comes with Windows 8.1 preinstalled so it is definitely Miracast compatible. I've had the computer since September and the option used to appear just fine, up until
 a few months ago at least. Now when I use the charms bar &gt; devices &gt; project it just takes me straight to the primary/duplicate/extend/secondary option screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reinstalled Windows yesterday hoping that would deal with the problem (as well as a whole host of other issues caused by HP's really irritating bloatware) but the 'add a wireless display' option is still not appearing in devices. I did briefly get it to
 identify an Amazon Fire TV yesterday through the settings app 'add device' option, but it wouldn't connect and then the option went away. I understand that these have their own Miracast problems with Windows laptops, but this is not the issue as the option
 to connect in the first place isn't appearing on my laptop where it should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand Miracast is a collaboration between video and wifi drivers, so I'll list all the relevant hardware and (drivers) I've got installed.</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD Radeon HD 8600/8700M (14.501.1003.0)</li><li>AMD Radeon HD 8650G + HD 8600/8700M Dual Graphics (14.501.1003.0)</li><li>Ralink RT3290 802.11bgn Wi-Fi Adapter (5.0.50.0)</li><li>Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller (8.19.726.2013)</li><li>Two bluetooth drivers that I don't think are relevant</li></ul>
<p>I've also got one remaining unknown device that I haven't identified or figured out which driver to install for it yet. And I checked, I have WDDM 1.3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help, this is really driving me crazy. I've seen a bunch of other people on forums having the same sort of issue but none with a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Media Center Freezes When I Watch Live or Recorded tv - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bomber916  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Center Freezes When I Watch Live or Recorded tv</h2>
                    
<p>I have been frustrated as my (soon to be) media pc is having problems playing live and recorded tv from Windows Media Center. When I click on either of these options, the screen goes black, the cursor disappears, and nothing happens. I have found that if
 I re-install the tv tuner driver, then restart, I am able to use these functions until the computer goes into sleep mode, then the problem re-occurs. I have the latest drivers for my tv tuner, graphics card, and sound card. My media center version is 6.1.7600.16385.
 I have run out of ideas and can't seem to find anything on the internet that solves my problem.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks, Bomber916.</p>

    <title>speaker setup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alisongye  say:</h3>
<h2>            speaker setup</h2>
                    Hi, recently bought new speakers - Creative Zii Sound T6.&nbsp; After hooking everything up, including the bluetooth, it all shows as connected.&nbsp; The problem is that Win 7 has decided that the speakers are Stereo and does not give the option of surround 5.1
 (which Creative says to use). The configuration for audio options has been set by Win 7 as Stereo (Sound/Playback [3 Creative Bluetooth Audio D1] / Configure).&nbsp; Consequently I have thumping bass and virtually nothing coming out of the satellite speakers.&nbsp;
 The sound card is not the problem because my former sound system was 5.1 and worked beautifully. I need to be able to change the audio channel but lack the option to do so.&nbsp; How do I get around this please?
                </div>

            <div>Hi,</div>

            Hi Biswa66, 
<br />
<br />Every system has a different method for booting from USB, generally it involves making changes in BIOS - what is the make and Exact Model No. of your PC/Laptop - that will generally be on a sticker on the bottom casing . . .

            Hello Biswa66,
<br />
<br />The ability to booting up from a USB or other media like a CD will vary from computer to computer. Some computer have a dedicated key that can be pressed to bring up a boot device menu while other computers will require some changes to BIOS.
<br />
<br />An example of an HP system with both Boot Device Options &amp; BIOS Setup:

            Hi Biswa66,
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you, To check if the USB is bootable, we can use a freeware called MobaLiveCD. It is a portable tool which you can run as soon as you download it and extract its contents.
<br />
<br />Connect the created bootable USB to your computer and then right-click on MobaLiveCD and select Run as Administrator. You will see the following interface.
<br />
<br />Note: Download MobaLiveCD from the developer‚Äôs website
<br />
<br />Guided Walk-through:

<h2>            Unable to save Kinect sign in data imtermittently with error 0x80a40008</h2>
                    
<p>I have spoken with MS Support over this, but the issue persists, where the data from the Kinect is unable to be stored, particularly if I try to change the data to update where I sit from the sensor (I often have to manually sign in to use the console).
 The error code I get is 0x80a40008, which comes back to connectivity on signin. sometimes it saves, but often won't. Another issue I discovered was during a factory reset, I noticed the Kinect sensor did not calibrate before I entered my gamertag info. that
 made the Kinect sensor to not read anything on the sensor assisted sign in.</p>

<p>MS Support suggested testing connectivity, which the network and multiplayer tests out fine. Removing the gamertag and user data and hard resets and factory resets work, temporarily, until the console is used, then it won't want to sign me in until I manually
 sign in. I don't want to put it at automatic sign in because I want to keep that data secure.
</p>

<p>This started yesterday to my knowledge. I have searched for solutions, but found no specific info about this particular way the code is used. Apparently, there is a problem with the Kinect info to be saved in the storage, which leads to a driver issue and
 how that driver saves information and communicates with the OS. </p>

<p>I suspect this is a software issue. Kinect does work otherwise, but seems limited in what it once could do.

<h2>            Download Tomb Raider not in English but in Frecnch&#47;german &#40;region Belgium&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>When I purchased and finished downloading the latest Tomb Raider game (39.90‚Ç¨), it appeared to be in French or German. As a&nbsp; Dutch speaking Belgian, I really want to have this game in the original version.</p>
<p>Is there any way, that I can get the English version on my XBOX.</p>
<p>After looking up fora for similar issues like this, it seems that Microsoft really has a big issue with Belgian users. Microsoft mostly provides only French version to Belgian users. Is there a way I can change my region settings to Netherlands so I will
 alway get the original version of the digital downloads?</p>
<p>To be honoust, with the current situation, I can say I've just waisted 39.90‚Ç¨. So hopefully I can still get the original version somehow.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any support.</p>

<p>Krollovic82</p>

<p>Your language of your dlc is usually set by the region of your account</p>

<p>Yes</p>
<p>But you gotta remeber that the language is listed in the game name like fable 3 fr or en or german</p>
<p>The game description is only listed as all supported languages available </p>

<h2>            Unable to change user account name. No option to in account settings</h2>
                    <p>I have a new laptop with Windows 8.1 installed. When setting it up I registered with my email address (which doesn't have my name in it). Now the user account name is just the 1st word of my email address and I would like to change it to my name. Unfortunately
 when I go into the account settings on my user account the option to change the account name isn't listed. It has the option on my husbands account and on the admin user account I set up but not on my account. Can I change this? Can it be changed? Many thanks

    <title>Tiny display in program - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> natalieneighbor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tiny display in program</h2>
                    <p>Recently I got a new computer and with that came an upgrade to Windows 10 - previously I had stayed on Windows 8. I like to draw and I primarily use the program Paint Tool SAI to do that, but the display on Windows 10 is&nbsp;<em>extremely&nbsp;</em>small, to the
 point where the program is practically unusable. I've seen others online have this problem and they suggested changing the compatibility settings to an earlier version of Windows, but that has unfortunately done nothing to fix the problem for me. I've tried
 troubleshooting the compatibility as well, and it doesn't fix it. The only thing that has helped is changing the resolution of my computer screen itself in Settings, but this is really annoying since I have to change it every time I want to draw and it affects
 my entire computer, not just this one program. Is there any way to fix this resolution problem? Below is what the program looks like on my computer.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Natalie.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Then adjust the Screen Resolution to what fits for your uses.  
<br />
<br />3) Make sure the Scaling in the same location is set at 100%.  If necessary try another scaling like 125% or more.  
<br />
<br />4) If this doesn't help then is the problem the same in any other programs?  If not I'd contact the program's Support to ask if it's a known issue and if they have a solution, patches, or a newer version to try out.  You may even want to buy their latest version since it's important to you.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
<br />If you receive a popup asking if this solved your problem please ignore it, as it will remove my ability to help you and others may also not help.  Please wait until after the issue is resolved to answer the popup or mark your question answered to help others.

            Hi natalieneighbor
<br />
<br />You have a high resolution screen, Windows uses a process called DPI scaling to make things bigger on a High Definition screen.
<br />
<br />Some older software is not programmed to be able to use DPI scaling, so while newer applications will look okay on your screen when it is scaled, older or badly coded software will not scale or will not scale correctly
<br />
<br />On the menu bar of Paint Tool SAI you can see 'Not Saved (new canvas.sai) is scaling correctly, but the rest of that application is not
<br />
<br />Go to the Paint Tool SAI website and check to see if they have an updated version that can use Windows 10 DPI scaling, if not, a monitor with a lower resolution would be the best option . . .

<p>Hi Greg,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for the reply! I really appreciate your help. I tried these things but unfortunately I think that it really is just that the program is too old. I'm not sure why the fix works on some computers but not mine, but since there is unfortunately
 no direct update to the program, I think I may just have to switch or continue to rescale my screen resolution whenever I use it. Either way, I appreciate your help! Thanks so much.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for this response. I think you're right, and since unfortunately the program doesn't have an updated version, I think I'll just have to make do or switch. It's a bummer but at least now I know.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Catalyst install manager has stopped working</h2>
                    
<p>I am running an upgrade Windows 7 HOME from Vista HOME ....</p>
<p>I am trying to run 3 monitors on my computer and manage to run 2 monitors. I am told that I cannot run 3 on windows screen resolution, that I would have to download CATALYST Suite ... When I try to install, I get the following window "CATALYST Install Manager
 has stopped working"</p>
<p>Thanks, Sam</p>
