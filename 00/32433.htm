    <title>Windows 7 Randomly Uninstalls Programs - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Randomly Uninstalls Programs</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Haven't been able to find a solution or any mention of this from anyone else, but I've had a rather odd problem with Windows. This is the second time I've noticed it happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially, Windows has apparently randomly uninstalled a program (a game) that I haven't used in a while (maybe for a couple of months). I even searched the OS afterwards and there is barely any trace of the game being there except for a shortcut that
 obviously now doesn't lead anywhere. This happened to me a few years ago, again with a game that I had not used in some time; the same thing happened, it disappeared without a trace except for the short cut. The games are installed directly, not via Steam
 or anything. I suppose it is not especially relevant, but the games in question were L.A. Noire and GTA: Vice City.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any comments or ideas on this would be greatly appreciated; I still have the install files and obviously they are just games, so it doesn't present a major issue, but it's just an annoying problem I would like to prevent happening in future if possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>AAM</p>

            <p>One possibility is if you use <em>System Restore</em> near the time you install the games.</p>
<p>System Restore has a button - <em>"Scan for affected programs"</em> that will show you what may get
</p>
<p>uninstalled when restoring to that time (you may need to use the <em>"choose a different restore point"</em></p>
<p>option for this).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option would be if you use some 'clean up/optimise your PC' software that has an option</p>
<p>to uninstall software you haven't been using recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, if the two games are from torrent downloads maybe they self destructs after X amount of time ? ;)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever the case, games/software don't uninstall themselves if due care is exercised by the user.</p>
<p>.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply, I haven't used System Restore at all for a long time, don't think it's anything to do with that. Certainly not around the same time that I found this happening to the games. Don't use any software like that either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the games was from a torrent (scratched the Vice City disc and didn't really want to have to buy it again). I've never heard of torrents deleting themselves though, any more information you can give me on that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of those seem to apply and please let me know what due care I can take to prevent this happening. I have just noticed it has happened to two other games as well.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The part about&nbsp; a torrent download was just a wild guess. I've never used a torrent version of a game.</p>
<p>Or, maybe you have a mystery malware ?&nbsp; Just another wild guess though as I've never heard of a</p>
<p>malware that uninstalls&nbsp; stuff either, but maybe....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The due care was in regard to if you use any system 'optimising' software that may uninstall
</p>
<p>or 'clean' registry entries for software, that is infrequently used. Or even simple things such as</p>
<p>double clicking on the title of a game when browsing Programs and Features (something I've done when thinking a particular software may have a 'repair' option) and having it uninstall in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions would also be wild guesses. Software/games just don't uninstall themselves,
</p>
<p>and their install folders don't just go missing,&nbsp; no matter how long it's been since you used them.</p>
<p>There must be something&nbsp;afoot, Watson. &nbsp;;)&nbsp; Either nefarious, or accidental . </p>

            Right, well I don't use any such software, and I haven't accidentally uninstalled anything (as I say, I haven't actually used either of these programs for some time).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I would agree that there is something afoot, but in the spirit of the detective you appear to be channelling, rather than twisting the facts to fit these theories, how about changing the theory to fit the facts? The facts are that I have not accidentally uninstalled
 them, have not used them in some time, yet now they are gone without my input. Any ideas (from anyone) on how that might happen rather than suggesting the problem I'm having is not as I describe?&nbsp;

    <title>Aero Peek not working now - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Aero Peek not working now</h2>
                    <p>Okay here are all the sordid details.&nbsp; HP 8760w mobile workstation with the Nvidia Quadro 3000M GPU, 8GB RAM, Windows 7 64-bit, 128GB SSD....etc. For 18 months of use, has been outstanding.&nbsp; Suddenly last week, Aero Peek stopped working. I have tried all
 kinds of things, including the following, to no avail;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) System Restore to at least three separate, earlier dates (No updates were applied prior to Aero failing).</p>
<p>2) Cleared the WIndows Experience Index cache and re-reun the rating at least a dozen times (it has to be cleared or it crashes) (7.1 -7.5 result)</p>
<p>3) Personalization troubleshooting of Aero reports no errors or issues.</p>
<p>4) Microsoft FIxIt Aero Troubleshooter says my video cannot run Aero (though again it has for 18 months).</p>
<p>5) Removed, updated, changed, removed, updated, changed....Nvidia drivers for the Quadro 3000M (even using HP's version on their website).</p>
<p>6) Updated BIOS and other firmware/drivers from HP on this laptop.</p>
<p>7) Opened a case with Nvidia (still pending - they keep asking me if I have uninstalled and reinstalled, even though I have told them I have 10 times).</p>
<p>8) Tried running without any Nvidia software installed at all.</p>
<p>9) Checked Registry entry for EnableAeroPeek per many other suggestions and articles. Even added some and then removed other.</p>
<p>10) Created a new Admin profile locally on the laptop.</p>
<p>11) Run an SFCScan and it came back fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aero options are missing from Visual Effects, and the Use Aero Peek opton in Properties of the Start Menu is greyed out.&nbsp; This has sent me down many, many articles.&nbsp; No resolution.&nbsp; Has anyone been through this pain?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am going to put my SSD's in another laptop just like it (we bought 4 of them at the same time) to see if it is hardware related...but nothing other the Aero seems affected, so I am skeptical that will do anything.&nbsp; I am just *hoping* I am missing something.</p>

            If you have Updated your Windows then uninstall the Platform Update for Windows 7 (KB2670838) and your problem should be resolved.
<div>Before I Updated my Windows this month I just checked whether Microsoft is still offering this update. It was there in the Optional list. I have IE9 installed so I thought of manually upgrading it to IE10 because it was not in the Update list. So I did
 manually and after that checked for updates again and to my surprise this Update disappeared completely. I have a Old PC as well and after installing all updates I still don't have any problem so far. I recommend that you upgrade to IE10 after uninstalling
 this update (if you did update with this and faced problem) to get rid of the update forever. But do this at your own risk because I never updated my machine with this faulty update and see if that caused any problem with my machine.</div>

            The responses to the question do allow one to access the graphics equalizer in Windows Media Player. However, the question asked about the old graphics equalizer that affected all sound sources, not just those that go through WMP. The WMP equalizer has
 no effect on input from YouTube or alternate sources of sound.&nbsp;

<p>Here I am, a month later, with this same issue. Your solution worked, every time. Last night my neighbor told me about the lower righthand corner, and it worked but only once. After I started playing music, it would only show the same menu that's across
 the top - File, View, etc. &nbsp;The primary redeeming feature for WMP is the Equalizer; otherwise, you can get some bass in iTunes! They should really consider putting it back in the VIEW menu permanently, as it was before. But thanks for your solution.&nbsp;</p>

            I noticed this features only available in Windows Media Player. I wish they would let other manufactures have access to this feature. Some of the YouTube Videos come out sounding like its coming through two tin cans and a string even through my Sound System
 I have to use an external EQ&nbsp;to compensate on the pour quality of the sound.

<h2>            Windows 7 operating system not found</h2>
                    <p>Okay so here's the story. Couple months back I upgraded to Windows 10 one night and i wake up to my computer saying operating system not found. I was very confused so i searched it up on youtube and many were saying i need a bootable cd or bootable usb,
 but i dont have any. Fast forward to now and i was curious to see if it worked but it didnt. I think its because my pc has a lot of dust in it or something like that. My computer is a HP pavilion p6-2103w. Any suggestions besides a bootable usb or cd, and
 something without taking it to the repair shop?</p>

<h2>            BSOD&#58; IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have home build a computer a few months ago and since have had 2 BSODs. The last time I had a BSOD it was when I was running VirtualBox and assigned a appliance more memory than my system had (assuming the system would have page swap) at the time.&nbsp; I deemed
 it that is was related. The second time it BSOD, it was idle, when I had returned and notice the box had restarted. I've already ran memtest and stability test multiple times and it doesn't
<em>appear</em> to be specific to hardware. Additionally, I also dual-boot with Linux and I don't have any issues there.
</p>

IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (a)<br />
An attempt was made to access a pageable (or completely invalid) address at an<br />
interrupt request level (IRQL) that is too high.&nbsp; This is usually<br />
caused by drivers using improper addresses.<br />
If a kernel debugger is available get the stack backtrace.<br />
Arguments:<br />

    <title>Keyboard stops working after windows update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> home chief  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard stops working after windows update</h2>
                    <p>I updated my HP pavillion 15 laptop two days ago (windows update). I downloaded all the updates (1.2GB), but installed up to 54%, cancelled the installation, switched off the laptop to get home from work. It prompted me to restart when I resumed the installations.
 After all the installations and finally rebooting, keyboard stopped working, never to come back again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following <strong>DO NOT </strong>work in my case...</p>
<p>(1) System restore - worked initially until I rebooted, then it stopped (evidence that its a software issue not hardware)</p>
<p>(2) Problem persists even in safe mode - system restore was done in safe mode when it initially worked, but eventually stopped</p>
<p>(3) Removing battery, AC and all peripherals, pressing &nbsp;power button for 30 seconds....pressing esc while rebooting...</p>
<p>(4) Clean boot....not working</p>
<p>(5) Updating keyboard drivers..restarting...not working</p>
<p>(6) Un-installing re-installing keyboard drivers, restarting...still not working</p>
<p>(7) Troubleshooting the hardware and scanning for changes..not working</p>
<p>(8) Editing the start value in registry,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\i8042prt</span></p>
<p>(9) Entering the BIOS gets stuck, mouse and keyboard &nbsp;not working so I cant do anything</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am typing from on-screen keyboard!! Am really tired of googling and trying to solve this?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So am now stuck, anyone with a solution?</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you meant that the USB used to work in the BIOS you would need to use the USB port that has legacy support. Most of the USB ports won't work until the windows loader phase

http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/11341.the-windows-7-boot-process-sbsl.aspx#BIOS_Initialization</a> which happens after the BIOS POST phase. They won't work because the function drivers haven't loaded&nbsp;so some devices can't function
 and the ones that could won't work unless they are plugged into a USB that has&nbsp;been initialized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would bet if the CMOS battery was removed or the BIOS jumper was used to reset it the keyboard would begin to work again</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business 2016 - Wont show my profile pic or meetings</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>have issue with my SFB, ironically I work in support and no other reports of this in company that I know of, only occurs for my Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue: Skype on my Desktop (Win10 x64) wont show my profile pic nor any of my meetings I have scheduled. I can still use it for chat, join meetings via Outlook meeting etc and use Meet now but wont show any I can join.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps tried to resolve:</p>
<p>-Reinstall - tried this twice, the interesting thing is when I do this, it seems to fix issue, for 1 day. I reboot and then issue occurs again.</p>
<p>-adding in SIP info manually - has no effect.</p>
<p>-Another PC - again interesting, I have a laptop that is Win7x64 for meetings too, and it has no issues at all, it is same version. This leads me to think it is my desktop only, however another interesting part is this was an issue before I moved to Win10.
 I had a Win7 desktop, same issue, then go a new PC, worked for 1 day, then again the issue...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could be my searching skills but not really seeing anything online specific to this issue and again no one else in company that I can find has ever reported this so cant say I have much to go on</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help be great.</p>

<h2>            Error 0xc0000225 when trying to boot from USB stick</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I have Dell 7537 laptop. I did a clean install of Windows 10. I made a USB stick out of an iso image. I created 2 partitions (1st is 120GB and the second one is ~380GB). Formated both of them. After the install i updated all the drivers i could
 find from dell for Windows 10 using their 'Detect drivers' feature:</span></span> http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/inspiron-15-7537/drivers</p>
<p>But after some time weird things started to happen. Since i needed to restart my computer a couple of times, i started to notice that the legendary blue screen started to popup from time to time (DXGKRNL FATAL ERROR). So i didn't want to uninstall/reinstall
 all the drivers again, and i just wanted to do a clean install of Windows 10 yet again, but it just so happens that i can't do that, because just as i try to bootup from USB stick, i get this screen:

 that in the future i can still do clean installs of Windows if i wanted to do so.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Mohamed, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. From where are you trying to Install Windows 7?</p>
<p>2. Are you upgrading to Windows 7 or is it a Clean Installation? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Error code <strong>0x80070017 usually refers to bad media</strong>. If this is happening on both your flash drive and your burned DVD media I would recommend that you download the file again as you may have corruption in the ISO itself. So if possible, download
 the file again. After you download the new copy, try to <strong>burn it on a lower setting 4x or 8x</strong>. After you burn the disk on a lower setting with the new ISO, then see if you can install Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, check the link mentioned below as a reference: </p>

    <title>Debate&#58; Gears 3 Golden Weapons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sonic scream 07  say:</h3>
<h2>            Debate&#58; Gears 3 Golden Weapons</h2>
                    
<p>Epic Game's Rod Fergusson revealed a <a href="http://www.examiner.com/console-gaming-in-national/epic-announces-gold-gnasher-unlock-for-gears-3-gears-2-xp-events-until-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
new plan</a> for <em>Gears</em> fans to earn the Gold Gnasher and&nbsp; other gold-plated weapons in
<a href="http://www.examiner.com/gears-of-war-3-in-national" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>Gears of War 3</em></a> for the Xbox 360. The reaction from&nbsp; players who achieved Veteran Gears status or got the Gold Hammerburst or Lancer&nbsp; in the second
<em>Gears</em> game has been negative as the official forums&nbsp; exploded in a fury of complaints.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Epic had previously promised that <a href="http://www.examiner.com/gears-of-war-2-in-national" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>Gears of War 2</em></a> players who earned the Veteran Gears&nbsp; achievement would receive the Gold Gnasher along with a medal and unique title&nbsp; in
<em>Gears of War 3</em>. However, Fergusson didn't feel like that was enough&nbsp; to reward such dedicated players so the promotion was changed to include all&nbsp; five gold weapons - Gold Gnasher, Gold Sawed-off, Gold Hammerburst, Gold Retro&nbsp; Lancer, Gold Lancer.
 Additionally, anybody that plays <em>Gears of War 3</em>&nbsp; within the first week of its release on September 20 will unlock a Gold&nbsp; Gnasher.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Fergusson's reveal of these new conditions for unlocking the Gold Gnasher and&nbsp; other unlocks resulted in thread that quickly grew to nearly 3,500 posts in less&nbsp; than 18 hours. Complaints generally revolve around the idea of unlocking the&nbsp; Gold Gnasher for
 anyone who plays the game the first week as that will likely&nbsp; make that weapon skin less unique as the number of pre-orders for
<em>Gears of&nbsp; War 3</em> topped one million all the way back in May.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Another complaint comes from those that were able to get their hands on the&nbsp; limited number of Gold Lancer and Gold Hammerburst skins in Gears of War 2.&nbsp; Owners of these skins are unhappy that Epic is now making these very distinctive&nbsp; skins open to those
 who achieve Veteran Gears status.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>A third complaint concerns the Gold Retro Lancer as that was previously going&nbsp; to be exclusive to those that participated in the beta, played 90 matches to&nbsp; unlock the Gold Retro Lancer and then get 100 kills with it.<br />
<br />
</p>

<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>So what do you guys think?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>I personally don't think they should just give out the golden weapons. Only give it to people who worked towards the harder achievements.</strong></span></p>

<p>Am confused what weapons do I get. I had the golden lancer in Gears of war 2. I did not get to level 100 on Gears of war 2. I did get 100 kills with the retro lancer in the beta. I also have my gears of war 3 limited edition pre ordered. So am guessing I
 get the gold lancer, Gold Gnasher and the Gold retro lancer.</p>

<h3> jonfountain  say:</h3>
<h2>            No roads on my maps&#33;</h2>
                    <p>A simple but infuriating problem I can't seem to solve. There are no roads on my maps. Road names yes....roads no. I have downloaded the European map pack but that has changed nothing. Oddly when I select the aerial view roads &nbsp;correctly overlay the map.

            <p>Thanks for the response. Unfortunately the steps suggested have not altered the problem or to be more precise:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Maps is allowed through the firewall and in any event I have the off-line pack for Europe.</p>
<p>2. The option to uninstall Maps is grayed out in the Apps and Features settings screen so there is no possibility it seems of reinstalling it.</p>
<p>3. The graphics drivers are the latest windows 10 64 bit drivers from AMD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            I had the problem a while back, but it has resolved. One day&nbsp;I went back and opened it and it was normal. There have been updates to maps and my graphics card driver for W10. I assume one of them fixed the problem - my guess is the graphics card driver.

    <title>Zoo Tycoon 2 Ultimate Collection - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Zoo Tycoon 2 Ultimate Collection</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>I have the game Zoo Tycoon 2 Ultimate Collection for Windows 10 Dell PC. I’ve had this game for 9 years and all of a sudden, while I was playing, it crashed and now it will not launch. It also will not let me uninstall or install
 it. Whenever I try to uninstall it says “Zoo Tycoon 2: Ultimate Collection cannot install running setup.exe. Type autorun.exe, or double click autorun.exe on the game CD.” Then right after that the InstallShield Wizard pops up saying “The wizard was interrupted
 before Zoo Tycoon 2- Ultimate Collection could be completely installed/uninstalled. Setup is not complete. If you quit setup now, the features you requested to add/remove will not be installed/uninstalled.” So then I try to run autorun.exe by going to the
 CD files and double clicking it, and when I do the game menu pops up with the options, “Play, Uninstall, Website, Exit.” Whenever I hit play, I can hear the computer trying to run, but then after a few seconds the computer will stop running and nothing happens
 on screen. So I again go to the game files and I click on the ‘Startup’ application to see if that works. Whenever I click on that, the game will try to launch and the screen will turn black and the mouse cursor will appear like it’s about to start playing,
 but pretty much instantly the game will stop running and will go back to my desktop like nothing happened. I don’t know much about computers so I have no idea what else to do. Is there any fix to this, or is my game file corrupted and I can never play it again
 on this computer? I can’t even get the game off of my computer by uninstalling so it’s not like I can start fresh. If anyone can help that’ll be greatly appreciated.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens when you click on <strong>Uninstall</strong> when you get the options "<strong>Play, Uninstall, Website, Exit</strong>" from the CD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the below methods and see if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Update Graphics Drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are seeing a black screen and the mouse cursor when you launch the game, it might be that the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-10-update-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Graphics Drivers</a> are outdated, so we suggest you to update the Graphics Drivers and check if you are able to launch the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Clean Boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perform a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Clean Boot</a> and see what exactly is causing the issue and check if you are able to play the game in a Clean Boot State.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: A ‘Clean Boot’ starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs, so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality
 while in a clean boot environment, however, that functionality will return when you reset the computer to start normally after you have finished your troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Clean Boot works, then don't forget to place the computer to normal boot by going to 'Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting' section in the Clean Boot link.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Fix problems that block programs from being installed or removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the steps mentioned in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fix Problems That Block Programs From Being Installed or Removed</a> and try to uninstall Zoo Tycoon 2 Ultimate Collection game from your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Insert the Game CD into your computer when trying to uninstall the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

    <title>&#91;HP Stream 7 - Windows 10&#93; Performance, Wifi, and Bluetooth - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#91;HP Stream 7 - Windows 10&#93; Performance, Wifi, and Bluetooth Drops</h2>
                    <p>My HP Stream 7 tablet has been constantly dropping performance, WiFi, and Bluetooth when in use. The CPU performance would drop to extremely low levels, and most of the RAM would always be in use. I've mainly noticed these to be problems after the free upgrade
 from Windows 8.1 with Bing to Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/715f3cbf-b6d3-46f2-be36-326a0f18dc37" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/715f3cbf-b6d3-46f2-be36-326a0f18dc37" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The CPU speed drops and ramps back up for games, including those in the Store. The CPU especially slows down while the tablet is plugged in through a USB connector. It's worth noting that some chargers don't supply enough power for the tablet to charge properly,
 where the battery drains instead. The RAM is almost at max.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13469c2a-fa27-4dcd-8540-46ad20efff7f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13469c2a-fa27-4dcd-8540-46ad20efff7f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Even on the desktop with no programs running, most of the memory is in use in the background, with 702MB out of 951MB in use. Most of these turn out to be important processes for Windows, Java, and device drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5b60650-f39b-41dd-a37f-146cff68fb8b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5b60650-f39b-41dd-a37f-146cff68fb8b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The WiFi connection would drop while the tablet is in use. The WiFi would stop working with 3 resulting variations - the WiFi could stop working entirely while it's still 'running fine' (shown above), stop working entirely with a 'POWER-FAILURE' or similar
 status, or just mark the current connection as 'no internet access'. Bluetooth just stops working or lags, with the setting sometimes stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/78b6753b-bdf1-4ce4-8e66-99ff90fa87ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/78b6753b-bdf1-4ce4-8e66-99ff90fa87ba" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already installed the appropriate drivers from HP after the reset and have been looking for information on these problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate it if there is a fix for this or at least a way to reinstall. I haven't made any backups, and this came with a compressed OS image when it was first manufactured. Thanks.</p>

            <p>The Windows 10 pop-up had already confirmed that the specifications meet the minimum requirements. However, I think I'm now getting somewhere with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stumbled across a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDtCHdnGjVw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">video on the Intel Compute Stick</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/fDtCHdnGjVw?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/fDtCHdnGjVw?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;the user stated that the device appeared to suffer from connectivity issues when using WiFi and Bluetooth at the same time, mentioned 2 minutes exact into the video, and that device coincidentally has the same Intel Atom processor as the Stream 7.
<p>
</p><p>The lower clock speeds happen due to the lack of a cooling system, due to the tablet form factor, and the fact that USB chargers (apparently) supply less power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The CPU is 1.33GHz, and the RAM is 1GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all seems to be a hardware related issue, and I can't fix the issue as none of the components are upgradable. I can't take it apart.</p>

<h3> thetechnorecord  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I sign in or manage my microsoft accounts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I can log on through my internet browser, but I am unable to login on the windows store or through the settings on my computer. I first noticed this issue when I tried to download an app in the windows store, but I was unable to. What would happen is
 it would ask me to choose an account and when I chose mine from the menu it would bring me back to the app page and nothing changed. If I tried to login in to my account in the app store it would do the same thing where I would choose my account and it just
 doesn't actually log me in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed this problem isn't just in the windows store. If I type in manage my account and go through that menu in windows 10 then I face the same issue. I can select my account to sign in, but it doesn't actually sign me in. I have no idea on how to fix
 this issue and any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mail app how to change reading pane to bottom view - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robhcom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail app how to change reading pane to bottom view &#40;horizontal orientation&#41;</h2>
                    <p>VERY SIMPLY,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>How do you change the reading pane orientation in the Windows 10 mail app (the default app) from the standard&nbsp;left-right layout to a top-bottom layout??
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;The left right reading pane SUCKS!! and not having the option to change it to top bottom is unacceptable!!</span></p>
<p><span>I have been using the Feedback Hub as I'm sure other have as well, BUT many people may not take the time to do that and just get use to the way the program is set up, so it may not look to the Feedback Hub as if this is a huge issue, BUT IT
 IS!!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Please, finally add this to the list of things to do, it's FAR past the time of Feedback, it NEEDS to be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a thread from 2016, (that would be THREE years ago)&nbsp; notice it was imeadtly locked, with a "not available AT THIS TIME" response, with no room for discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-outlook_mail/windows-10-mail-app-how-to-change-reading-pane-to/376e1e29-56f1-4552-b173-18d1fef70083?auth=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't know what's happened to you Microsoft you use to be a top level company, but this type of stuff is making you look like a joke, a bad joke.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I've done that like 50 times, apparently that is useless if there isn't a lot of requests for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll just be forced to use it in it's broke-**** current form. It literally works like a piece of trash on a PC. It's slow (although with the last few updates it has gotten faster) and clunky, the user interface is a bad joke, NOT intuitive at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a damn shame that Microsoft scrapped some of their ONLY email programs that worked properly and were actually intuitive, Microsoft Mail that came with Vista was AWESOME, so of course they scrapped it. Windows live mail a great email app.....scrapped
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>pathetic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank GOD I only have to use it at work.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>OUTLOOK, the true MS Outlook is a perfect example of what and email app should work like. FULLY controllable, FULLY customizable.&nbsp;</p>

            Well, I just tried it with the new release today and still the same problems: you have to run it as admin, but even when you do that, it never actually loads. Oddly enough, Halo 2, which vehemently insists it's for Vista only, will work after futzing with
 the now nonexistent Games for Windows Live. So any thoughts on getting Freelancer to work?

            The Feelancer game itself will work on windows 10.&nbsp; It is the macrovision secdrv.sys driver that will not load in windows 10.&nbsp; This is the addon that checks to see if you have the original disk installed and if not will shutdown the freelancer.exe program.&nbsp;
 If you have a version that .exe that does not do the CD check it will run fine.&nbsp; There were a few legit copies released that did not have the check.&nbsp; Otherwise you are forced to other means to get these older microsoft games to work.<br />

            Yes thank you all for responding to my question. I agree with parts or all of all the reply's. I had a few problems with the transition from Win 7 Ult.&nbsp;Freelancer wasn't that bad though. Fortunately I&nbsp;installed the copy that didn't need the CD, for I have
 both. I had it installed on Win 7 prior to upgrading. When all was accomplished I decided to&nbsp;give it a try. I right clicked on&nbsp;it and ran as admin and I got the dialog box telling me with the option to download the appropriate file. Took about 15 seconds.&nbsp;Yeah
 Freelancer was the 1st action computer game I ever played. They really need to remake it, nice to roam around interacting on one's own after the missions. I haven't noticed any problems with Freelancer Mod Manager yet either. Right now I have Rebalance 3.56
 Rc3 on&nbsp;and it runs great. Thanks Microsoft, even if you don't do another with the same concept at least they made it possible to play this version.

            Rob, Sorry I could not be more specific.&nbsp; What I mean is without modifying or replacing the freelancer.exe program it isn't going to work in Windows 10 unless Microsoft fixes Windows 10 so it can.&nbsp; You will have to be creative in finding your own solution.&nbsp;
 Possible solutions, revert back to 8.1 or 7, find a different freelancer.exe file, or find a patch, etc.&nbsp; One place for more information would be freelancer game forums.&nbsp; One caution beware of possible viruses if you go downloading.

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the nudge in the right direction. I was able to obtain a different .exe file and am now able to play Freelancer again. Apparently, the secdrv.sys compatibility issue is a big problem for lots of games out there. This was the only one I had out
 of a couple of hundred that would not run. Thank goodness for Steam, otherwise I would probably have more to deal with.</p>

            Hi Dan, always Run As Administrator when installing or launching and the OS will automatically find the file online for you. It did for me. You can play&nbsp;Freelancer on Windows 10, even better than the other OSs. Win 10 is user friendly in that aspect. Same
 goes for FLMM &amp; Freelancer Companion.&nbsp;

            <p>I know that you are asking about Windows 10, but I am trying to get the word out to those of us who still play Freelancer.</p>
<p>There is a Security Update for Windows 7 that apparently breaks the game.&nbsp; When you click on the icon, the cursor 'spins', but you never receive the Freelancer splash screen / intro.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I went through all my recent updates that were applied just before the game broke.&nbsp; I narrowed it down to the Security Update KB3086255 - which is related to the system's graphics:</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3086255</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps somebody else, but it drove me nuts figuring it out.</p>

<h2>            Computer doesn&#8217;t work after system reset</h2>
                    <p>I recently reset my windows 10 surface pro because I had little space, very slow, and kept freezing. I heard resetting was the best method, so I did. Afterwards I put in my email and phone number, which seemed normal, and logged into my computer. Now, almost
 none of my programs do not work except for the run command, file explorer, microsoft store, and the mail app. When I tried to open microsoft edge with the run command it said:</p>
<p>microsoft-edge://</p>
<p>File system error (-2147219196).</p>
<p>Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any luck with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am coming from almost the same scenario as yours:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to reset the Surface Pro 5th gen to re-sell</p>
<p>After reset, I come into a broken version of windows 10</p>
<p>-windows button doesn't work (doesn't do anything)</p>
<p>-can't get into settings at all</p>
<p>-clicking on wifi button to go online doesn't do anything</p>
<p>-microsoft edge doesn't even exist.</p>
<p>-I can't even type winver to see what version windows I have.</p>
<p>- few irrelevant apps work like email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Eventually after booting from surface pro recovery usb that I created with another computer, windows wouldn't even start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only boot via usb or into the UEFI</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to creating a regular windows 10 recovery usb flash drive from the support site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>... but the USB would not even boot. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently trying the last build of the three different build of surface pro 5th gen recovery, I doubt it will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at my wits end and I am welcome to any further suggestions.</p>

<p>I'm having exactly the same issue.&nbsp; I tried to reset my surface to give to my grandson and now I'm stuck with a brick.&nbsp; Nothing works.&nbsp; Tried the recover image process listed in the chain several times and now all I get is the BIOS/setup screen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?&nbsp; My surface is a little over a year old and ran absolutely flawlessly before this.<br />

<p>Got mine running again. I think one of the things that was keeping me from recovery was the fact I was using an external hard drive instead of a USB flash drive. It would create a recovery partition and would work for a bit but could never finish recovery
 successfully. I also tried to create a windows image from the MS supports site in an 8 GB flash drive. It won't boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally went in best buy and bought a 16GB flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Formatted it FAT32. Didn't bother with a full format. Just a quick format as I was ready to toss this thing in the garbage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already downloaded 3 different builds for my surface pro at this point so I just uncompressed one of them into the hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't bother to create recovery (using another computer). I just straight uncompressed the files of the surface pro image into the root file of the newly formatted flash drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went into Surface UEFI</p>
<p>Under Boot Configuration make sure you are only booting from USB storage</p>
<p>Under Security&gt;Secure Boot (change configuration)&gt;change to "None" (when I had this enabled I couldn't get my surface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to boot from my flash drive even if the Boot configuration was set to USB only or USB first)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once you are able to boot thru your USB flash drive</p>
<p>after you choose keyboard layout</p>
<p>Troubleshoot&gt;Recover from Drive&gt;wipe clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please take these with a grain of salt. I am not very tech savvy. All these come from a week of nightmare poking around in forums and at one point I seriously considered throwing the surface into the wall. (Glad I didn't). Just thought I'd share what I think
 finally worked to get this damn machine working again. Good Luck!</p>

            What I just figured out was to make sure your are downloading the correct imagine file.&nbsp; I have a Surface pro 2017 edition and when I went to download the new imagine there were 3 files to choose from.&nbsp; My first choice failed and the computer went to the
 BIOS screen and no further.&nbsp; I downloaded the second imagine file and BAM, everything is back to normal and running perfectly.&nbsp; Unfortunately there is no way to verify which version is on my surface since it wasn't operational.&nbsp; But attempting the wrong imagine
 files did no harm.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, trying the next imagine file.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows Updates</h2>
                    <p>I have a situation where, as I write this post, Security Update is "stuck" trying to, I guess, download an update for Excel 2010. Now, It supposedly downloaded it, but it is "sitting" at 100% but it is not doing anything. And it does not matter if I restart
 the laptop, it will stay there after restart. &nbsp;It has happened in the past, but I guess it corrects itself. But it makes the laptop rather slow. I have a Toshiba Satellite L875D. Can someone lead me in the correct direction in this?</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply Navneet. Well, let me tell you, it happens randomly with any Update, not with this one in particular. I ran the Windows Update Troubleshooter and it did not solve the problem. So I guess the question is: &nbsp;What next</p>
