                    <br />
Halo Onenote Users,<br />
<br />
I have experienced this onenote crash at least, if I am not mistaken, three times this month.<br />
<br />
I think this problem occurs when I go back to onenote after leaving it active at the background for long time (30 minutes or so) .<br />
<br />
On my computer, Windows and all microsoft applications are always updated.<br />
<br />
I find this annoying. Could someone tell me what to do?<br />
<br />
<br />
This is is what the error message said:<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Band Feedback and Feature Requests</h2>
                    <p>I don't know where to leave feedback for different products so I'm going to post here and will accept guidance for a better location to post this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I love this Band!&nbsp; It is everything I hoped and expected it to be.&nbsp; I'm using it with an iPhone but I've been watching for months for a new 5" or smaller Windows Phone flagship for AT&amp;T.&nbsp; I think that might happen today.&nbsp; I sure hope so, I am in love
 with Cortana.&nbsp; I've been using a Nokia Lumia 520 as a WiFi only device for a while and I'm very excited about the direction Microsoft is heading in.&nbsp; I've had multiple Windows Mobile and Windows CE devices in the past and I'm looking forward to get back on
 a Windows platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have some criticism though and it is in the actual design of the Band.&nbsp;&nbsp;I bought the&nbsp;medium band and it fits well as long as I'm wearing short sleeves.&nbsp; However, when&nbsp;I put on&nbsp;a dress shirt, the width of the&nbsp;display is enough that it doesn't fit the
 contour of my wrist and it makes it very difficult to get my cuffs buttoned.&nbsp; I work in a server room most of the time so I generally unbutton it so I can&nbsp;see and operate the Band but when I go out on a call, I have to button it.&nbsp; I have tried it with the
 display on top and on the bottom of my wrist.&nbsp; It seemed a little better on the bottom but still prevented me from using it with my cuffs buttoned.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;becoming a frustration point and with&nbsp;Winter approaching, I know it is going to get worse as I'll want
 to add a few layers.&nbsp; For this reason, I do wish&nbsp;the Band had come as more of a watch.&nbsp; Personally, I think it would be cool if it was square like the Windows logo but have&nbsp;slightly rounded edges&nbsp;so there aren't any&nbsp;sharp corners.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That aside, I think you all did a great job on the Band and I suspect the Band 2 or whatever it will be, will be even better.&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially if you also offer it&nbsp;with a more watch like display.&nbsp; Just call it&nbsp;a tile or something.&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, there isn't a category for the Band yet so I chose Windows Phone 8, Cortana because I mentioned her in my post.&nbsp; {shrug}</p>

            <p>It would be fantastic if the MS Health app would have a section to show the heartrate / pedometer activity throughout the day, disconnected from any workouts.&nbsp; Like in many of the current fitness applications - simply an ongoing tracker of your daily values.&nbsp;
 In the current version you have to start a workout in order to record this data - which should be considered a secondary "segment" of data and not the only visible log.</p>

            <p>I know that Band has the ability to integrate with both Health Vault and Microsoft Health. One of the major problems is with medication compliance, making sure people remember to take their pills, especially with certain populations where such things are
 critical (TB patients, AIDS patients, elderly, teenagers on ADD or antidepressant meds, and so forth). It seems to me that this information could be uploaded to the Health Vault and then the Band could buzz when it's time to take your pills and the display
 screen could indicate which meds you need to be taking.</p>
<p>[I know this should really be in a different category, but there is no Band category).</p>

            <p>Again am posting this comment here for lack of a Microsoft Band category and ask the forum moderators to move the thread to the Microsoft Band category if it's ever created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find myself changing a number of settings, e.g. Do Not Disturb, Airplane Mode, Haptic Feedback, and Location services on my Windows Phone, depending on what use environment I'm in.&nbsp; I'd like to suggest that Microsoft create Usage Profiles for Microsoft
 Health and these usage profiles would be able to change multiple setting at once on the Band depending on the activation of a Usage Profile on the phone.&nbsp; The band itself is probably too simple a device to support usage profiles by itself and GPS eats Band
 battery life and is only active during a run exercise.&nbsp; However, a phone GPS could be used for geofencing (activation of services based on location) and the phone could decide when settings changings should be synced to the Band (and could alert you if you
 manually need to take the Band OUT of airplane mode for the phone to communicate with the Band via Bluetooth, etc)..&nbsp; A phone could also use time of day to activate a usage profile, too, on the Band.</p>

            Thanks for the suggestion, Benedito. I had already done that and was just posting here as well so that other MS Band users might have some chance of reading my suggestion. I recommend that other users interested in the same idea use the Support link that
 you suggest as that seems to be the only official way to give Microsoft feedback about the Band.

            <p>I'd be interested in such a feature, too.&nbsp; I think with the Calendar Tile and/or Cortana (if you have a Windows Phone), you can set reminders.&nbsp; Just tested it dictating a reminder to my WP8.1 (Nokia 1520) to go vote at a specific time and the reminder showed
 up both on phone and on Band.&nbsp; One nice feature about Microsoft calendars is that you can have separate calendars and events with reminders that can appear on a Windows or Android device overall calendar (don't know about iOS).&nbsp; The Band can receive reminders
 from diverse calendars.&nbsp; You can have a separate Pill calendar and you normally wouldn't have to have events on the Pill calendar cluttering up your usual main calendar view, if you didn't want to see your Pill "events.".&nbsp;&nbsp; Just tested it and I can receive
 a reminder from my "Meal" calendar on my Band.&nbsp; One might have to make sure the Band is synched up with the phone your're using.&nbsp; Worked after I did a sync after creating an event with a reminder but not if I just created an event on a secondary calendar and
 didn't sync to the Band.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A dedicated Pill app might be nice because then you could have a data record of whether or not the pill was actually taken at the appointed time (or how soon before or after) whereas with the Calendar, the reminder just goes off on the Band but no record
 of whether you actually took the pill.&nbsp; OTH, the current Band is a limited device as dictated by considerations of battery life, etc.&nbsp; So maybe when Li-ion technology turns the next corner or we get down to 7 nm processor technology we'll have bands with smartphone
 power on our wrists!!</p>

            <p>Any band with buzzing alarms already does this - I just set a new midday alarm for my pill time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think what you're suggesting is having it tied to a prescription / doctor created and entered in Health. That sounds like you wouldn't have much choice in setting your alarms. My pill, for instance, is taken "sometime in midday - the doctor doesn't specify
 a time. He doesn't know what time I get up either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a great reminder to take your pill, but the onus is on the patient to do so. Easiest to just set your own alarms.</p>

            <p>The battery indicator on the MS Band needs to provide a numeric indicator so we know when it is ok to stop charging.&nbsp; At the LEAST we need some way of seeing the battery icon status while charging, since the current version only shows a small plug when charging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first version of the companion Health application showed a numeric indicator under the "My Microsoft Band" page, but that has been removed in the developers preview.&nbsp; Regardless, having to&nbsp;open the Health app should not be a necessary step to confirm
 battery charge status.</p>

            I've since learned that you can get an indicator when using the "Watch" mode.&nbsp; It would be nice if this was possible without having to use the "Watch" mode.

            it seems to be only excel, this is on my work computer, I use excel and outlook pretty much all the time, I rarely use word, power point, etc.&nbsp;
<div>Spell check seems to work in word when i paste a paragraph with misspelled words it detects them right away. Spell check also works in Outlook.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>1, currently excel is installed as "run all from my computer"</div>
<div><br />
<div>2, i don't see an override folder/key in the registry in the location you mentioned.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>3, I ran excel in safe mode, opened a file with words I'm sure that's not in the office dictionary and clicked the spell check button, nothing happens.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>4, The only COM add in is the Adobe PDF 'printer', I disabled it and spell check still does not work.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for trying though, do you have more things I can try to fix this?&nbsp;</div>

            Oh, I have excel setup to generate a new window every time I open another document, could this cause the problem? I think it's something to do with DDE in Excel Options window.&nbsp;
<div>When I started to heavily use excel I found the lack of SDI (like Word) made working with multiple spreadsheets open at the same time difficult and confusing, so I have excel now open a new copy of excel every time I open another document.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi Mary,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did your Office Home and Student 2010 include a trial of Access 2010 (Office Pro 2010)?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Most of the time they do include a trial and if this is the case, I would recommend doing the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>+&gt;First uninstall the standalone copy of Access 2010 from your machine.</p>
<p>+&gt;Remove the trial version of Access 2010 by going through the steps in the following article:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>+&gt;Install the standalone version of Access 2010 (last set of steps in the article above).</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>a) Press <strong>Windows and X
</strong>key together and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>b) Locate the <strong>

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>c) Select <strong>Update driver software</strong>.

            I had this exact same problem on 21st March when Windows Updates installed Synaptics Pointing Device Drivers Version 18.1.45.6 on my Acer TM8371G. The mouse pointer freezes, and then jump to random positions with noise coming from the speakers. I rolled
 the drivers back to the standard Microsoft mouse drivers, and everything has worked perfectly since. Windows Updates is also trying unsuccessfully to install Realtek HD sound drivers which I do not require as the sound is working perfectly. Bring Back Hide
 Updates!

            You'll need to use the Xbox Video app on the Xbox One to stream the movie.&nbsp; Due to DRM, you won't be able to play the movie that you transferred to a USB drive.

<h2>            Error code&#58; -18500 in Outlook 2011 on Exchange 2010 when accepting meeting invites</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>After a recent upgrade to Exchange 2010 and moving our Mac users from Entourage 2008 to Outlook 2010, some of these users&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;send acceptance emails for meeting requests. The steps to recreating
 the issue in my&nbsp;environment&nbsp;are as follows:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Meeting invite sent to affected Outlook 2011 user on Exchange 2010 from another user either through Outlook 2007/2010/2011,OWA,or ActiveSync Device</li><li>Affected user accepts&nbsp;(with or without comments) or declines&nbsp;meeting invite&nbsp;</li><li>Meeting gets added (or not if declined) to the affected users calendar and denial/acceptance email is queued locally in Outlook 2011</li><li>Affected user gets the following error : <b>HTTP error. The server cannon&nbsp;fulfill&nbsp;the request. Mail could not be sent. Account Name "EXCHANGE" Error code: -18500</b></li><li>Acceptance/denail never makes it to the user sending the invite.</li></ol>
</div>
<div>I've tried researching the issue but i havent gotten any good leads,&nbsp;especially&nbsp;since the issue only affectes a 3 out of our 15 Outlook 2011 users. When i checked the mailboxes and AD account of&nbsp;theses&nbsp;users i dont see anything out of the ordinary. Any
 suggestions would be greatly&nbsp;appreciated!&nbsp;</div>

            <p>You're probably using the United States - International keyboard layout. In this layout, `, ~, ^, ' and " will be combined with the next vowel to create an accent (if possible): 'e becomes é and "u becomes ü.</p>
<p>To prevent this when it's not appropriate, type a space after the `, ~, ^, ' or ", and then type the vowel.</p>

            <p>According to the crash report it appears that your installation of Microsoft Office is not in Applications &gt; Microsoft Office 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you moved or renamed the <strong>Microsoft Office 2011</strong> folder. If that's the case, simply put the folder back into Applications or rename the folder back to Microsoft Office 2011. Restart your Mac and all should be well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that's not the case, before you mess with Mac OS X, perform a complete removal and then reinstall Office following these instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Reinstall</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you have deleted system fonts, restore them before proceeding. Make sure your Mac has a live internet connection.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go to the Apple menu and choose Software Update. Install Mac OSX updates before proceeding.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to have a successful reinstall of Office, you must first completely remove Office by carefully following
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>these instructions</span></strong></a><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then reinstall, making sure your Mac has a live internet connection while you install. Allow AutoUpdate app to bring Office to the current update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then use </span><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Font Book</span></strong></a><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>(it’s

 Mac and empty the trash to get rid of the unneeded fonts and free up disc space.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Use </span><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Disk Utility</span></strong></a><span> (it’s

                    <p>I had MS Outlook working on this computer before. My computer had become so slow, I reinstalled MS Windows7 on my computer. I then reinstalled MS Office 2010 on my same computer. I tried setting up Outlook 2010 connected to my Verizon FIOS service. I get
 message "Unknown Error 0x8004011d" trying to install MS Outlook 2010. It then states "Configuring e-mail server settings." Then "Establishes network connection" followed by "Searching for 'my e-mail address' server settings." It tries encrypted connection.
 Result is "not available". It then tries connecting unencrypted. Result "verify settings".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried contacting Microsoft support, they said my 6 months of support had expired and want $49.00 to assist me. I am currently unemployed and can not afford the money MS wants. It would be helpful to have Outlook working for my current job search. Thank
 You for any help or advice.</p>

                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I'm in a strange position.. I've my college administration work to be done..&nbsp;</p>
<p>The files look something like this&nbsp;</p>
<p>Student details&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sl No.:</p>
<p>Enrol_no :</p>

<p>Enrol_no :</p>
<p>Student Name:</p>
<p>DoB :</p>
<p>Mobile:</p>
<p>Gender:</p>
<p>
</p><p>and goes on..</p>
<p>Now I wanna make a separate list (Excel doc) which only contains the student name and the mobile number..</p>
<p>I did some search.. it seems that I've to use Macros on excel but I've no clue how to use them..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>also I found another answer similar to this one <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2003-customize/extract-only-certain-lines-from-a-lengthy-word/d89752d0-4fec-4316-b7ee-1f2f1c8664a0">

<p>Hello StevenAustreich,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do understand the inconvenience you have faced. I'd be glad to&nbsp;help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the first issue, are you trying to search the email address while signed in to the same account? If so, its not possible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can ask someone to check for the email address and see if they can search it on their end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the second issue, did this happen while on a call or when you are about to make a call? Please provide us the OS version and Skype version of your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and I look forward to your reply.</p>
<p>

<p>I am using Skype 7.58 (501) &nbsp;It is a MacBook Air OS is El Capitan last version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am signed into my Skpe account and put in a valid aol address to add to contacts. &nbsp;When i search by name it does not find the right name either and I know this party has the valid name on skype. It finds tons of people with same name but not the one I
 am looking for. &nbsp;When I used Skype on my old regular pc with Windows it always worked. &nbsp;I put in the email address and it worked fine. &nbsp; There seems to be a problem with the version of Skype &nbsp;for Mac. &nbsp; I was able to put in another person's name and actually
 contacted them last night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The message that video is off is while I am making the call. &nbsp;However, I called someone last night and when they answered the video comes up. &nbsp;Is this message mean that the person I am calling the video is off? &nbsp;Since I was connected last night to someone
 in South America I am assuming that is what it means. &nbsp; &nbsp;My video is working fine.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad that your Skype video is working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you search using "username" of the person you're trying to add in Skype as it will generate just one result.</p>

<h2>            Macro to extract data from multiple files and paste to different tabs in a master file</h2>
                    Hi all, <br />
<br />
I need a macro which is able to extract data from seven individual workbooks into a master workbook. The details are as follow,<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>The master workbook consists of seven tabs named after the days of the week i.e. Monday to Sunday.&nbsp;
</li><li>The individual workbooks also have days of the week as part of their name (e.g. Monday .......... . xlsx/xlsm).</li><li>All the individual workbooks are saved in the same folder.</li></ul>
<p>The goal of the macro is to copy a fixed range in the individual workbooks and paste them into the master workbook accordingly. For example, I need to copy range "D1:AB143" in tab XYZ from a workbook with the name beginning with "Monday"&nbsp; and paste them
 to same range ("D1:AB143") in the Monday tab of the master workbook.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Sun.<br />

            <p>OK.&nbsp; Like here in this screen copy, the sparkline graph would be in column V.&nbsp; So my question would be that can it be set-up to show a vertical line cutting across the graph to denote the period associated with it?&nbsp; Because right now what I did is just insert
 several horizontal columns with no data, to denote a break in the graph so I would have a relative idea of the time zone in the graph.</p>

    <title>Scheduling Resources Based on Actual Equipment Hours - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j civilla  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scheduling Resources Based on Actual Equipment Hours</h2>
                    <p>I am fairly new to scheduling resources within MS Project but use the software extensively to track progress vs. baseline for construction projects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been tasked to create a Preventative Maintenance schedule for our equipment that is based on the actual equipment hours for each piece (i.e. at 20,000hrs, specific items are replaced or rebuilt).&nbsp; The GM also requests that the schedule be cost-loaded
 so forecast information can be pulled from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have the equipment set up as the tasks and the potential replacements/rebuilds set up as the resources and now I am stuck.&nbsp; Because the maintenance schedule is contingent on the usage, I am not sure how to actually schedule the PM's.&nbsp; A specific
 haul truck may be in operation 365 days out of the year, but I only want the schedule of the maintenance activities.&nbsp; The maintenance activities are based on the hour readout from the equipment and may vary based on breakdowns and downtime.&nbsp; I would like to
 set up a resource to assign itself based on the equipment hours (which may need to be hard entered at the end of each week).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main driver for this task is developing an accurate forecast for cash flows but this is entirely based on the actual equipment hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

            <p>J. Civilla,</p>
<p>Unfortunately Project can't be set up to auto-assign resources, at least not without the use of some VBA. However, it seems to me that it you will have to enter the equipment hours each week anyway, manual entry of maintenance tasks is probably the best
 way to go, and since the exact timing of maintenance is variable due to breakdowns, downtime, etc. it will be very hard to forecast any maintenance cost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you might want to do is to take a look a historical data with respect to your maintenance cost and then try and develop some type of forecasting function. As time progress the model can be updated for more accurate future projections.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The schedule of the maintenance is determined by the operation.</p>
<p>A truck can be running for a max in a year of 365 days x 24 hours/day = 8760 hours.</p>
<p>Actual hours will be less because:</p>
<p>1) the truck will not run 24 hours/day every day</p>
<p>2) the truck will not be running during the maintenance. (how ling does that take? 2 days?)</p>
<p>Assume/estimate actual 8000 hours max per year.</p>
<p>Assume a service every 1000 hours, so approximately 1 service every 6 weeks, or every 42 days, and round it down to 40 days.</p>
<p>Make tasks called "operate truck stage 1",&nbsp;"operate truck stage 2" etc, duration = 40 days.</p>
<p>Make tasks called "maintenance 1", "maintenance 2" etc, duration =20 days.</p>
<p>String them together as FS0 predecessors like this:</p>
<p>operate 40</p>
<p>maintain 2</p>
<p>operate 40</p>
<p>maintain 2</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Make a work type resource named "truck", assign it to all of the tasks at 100%.</p>
<p>Then figure out how to apply the cost, depending on what you need to know.</p>
<p>If you only want the maintenance cost and you know already what it is, you could assign it as a fixed cost to the the tasks in the cost table, or alternatively make a cost type resource and assign that, and just leave the std rate of the truck = $0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then track the actuals and adjust and re-schedule as required. You would expect actual truck hours to always be fewer than scheduled, so that when you input the actual operation hours (task usage view) the duration of "operate" should increase. Choose the
 right combination of task type and effort driven to make this happen. fixed work, I think, but check first.</p>
<p>This then pushes out the following "maintain" and so on and so forth down the chain.</p>

            <p>Still working on the development of the schedule. I am out visiting other sites to see how they track and develop schedules. The multiple variables, this schedule is not cut and dry as I hoped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can durations be assigned to resources or only to tasks? &nbsp;If we assume an engine replacement takes 1 week and, to only bring the equipment offline once, schedule the PM (which occurs every 14 days) for 1 day, with the engine replacement... Can the resources
 adjust the task duration to 8 days based on assigned resources?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The shifting of replacements based on the scheduled PMs are decided on a 2 week lookahead and are throwing some difficult challenges into the development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I must admit I do not nderstand the scenario but let me answer the pure Project questions:</p>
<p>Can durations be assigned to resources or only to tasks? No, sorry</p>
<p>Can the resources adjust the task duration to 8 days based on assigned resources?&nbsp;Probably yes, but as I do not understand the scenario, not sure.</p>

            I think you might be making it more complicated than it is. What's wrong with my suggestion?<br />

            <p>Just to through a spanner in the works, what you are trying to do is not a Project schedule. So apart from displaying a graphical image of timing, Project is of little use to you. Everything discussed above is easier and quicker to do in Excel.</p>
<p>In fact it should probably be in a database.</p>
<p>I would review what outputs you need to produce then review which tool meets those needs most easily.</p>
