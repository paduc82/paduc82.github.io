<p>Hi NehaPA,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your Windows 7 question is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums. It is better suited for the IT Pro audience on TechNet. Please post your question in the TechNet Windows 7 forum</p>

<p>Just cancel out of the message and we'll deal with the problem manually.&nbsp; You say it's a PC keyboard controller.&nbsp; Did you just install&nbsp;oee or install a new keyboard or make any hardware or driver changes at all on your system?</p>
<p><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers (specifidallly the keyboard or keyboard controlller).&nbsp; Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box
 and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; Especially look at any devices related to the keyboard.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers,
 but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should for the&nbsp;keyboard and the keyboard controller&nbsp;and as many others as you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond
 just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></a>. Proceed as follows to get the drivers:
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>.&nbsp; Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>That should resolve the problem.&nbsp; If&nbsp; it doesn't or you can't find drivers for the keyboard controller post back with as much information about the keyboard
 controller as you can find.&nbsp; Is your keyboard working fine without this "new hardware"?&nbsp; Tell me what you see in Device Manager concerning keyboards or keyboard controllers.&nbsp;Go to Actions and click Scan for New Hardware and tell me EVERYTHING it says it it
 says it found new hardware.&nbsp; Keep clicking and copying down everything it says until you get to the point where it asks for a disk to install a driver (before you reach that point it will probably ask if you want to search Windows for a driver - answer yes
 and see if that works (it probably won't but it's worth a shot).&nbsp; Either you added something or something that was already there became activated or something that was already installed got corrupted and lost its driver and so it's acting like it's a new piece
 of hardware.&nbsp; In any case we need to IDENTIFY this hardware so we can get drivers for it (or you're going to keep seeing that message every time you startup).</span></p>
<p><span>If you're sure you installed nothing new, then I suggest you contact the computer manufactuerer's technical support department by phone or online chat for assistance
 in identifying the hardware and locating device drivers for it.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good lluck!</span></p>

    <title>Tablet problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#9734; mercy&#9734;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tablet problem</h2>
                    <p>I purchased an adesso cybertablet t12 around 6 months ago and it worked fine on my old windows xp laptop. I recently got a new windows 10 toshiba laptop and now with the same program its been making dots at the start of strokes which really affects how much
 i can draw.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its been like this for about a week, I restarted, unplugged the tablet, reinstalled paint tool sai (the program i use) and the drivers many times but nothing seems to be working. I tried using the disc that came with the tablet but it didnt do anything either.
 I'd really like to be able to draw and i believe the issue lies in the drivers, i figured someone here has also had this problem? I emailed support three days ago but they havent gotten back to me and I have a commission to do so I'd be really happy if anyone
 has a solution!</p>

            The Tablet simply might not be compatible with Windows 10 and there is no way around that. You can maybe try compatibility to reinstall the driver software, but the reality is, its not guaranteed to work.

<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes.
<br />
<br />You should contact the hardware vendor and find out from them about their support for WIndows 10.

<h2>            KB4051963 Issue with the installation&#58; locked up at 30&#37; during configuration of update</h2>
                    Recycled power in order to force a restart.&nbsp; Curiously enough, the build now indicates an update to 16299.94 despite the windows update status of requires a restart to complete installation.&nbsp; After restarting, nothing changed.&nbsp; Using the Windows Update
 Troubleshooter did not resolve the issue.&nbsp; I then tried powershell in admin mode to run the following commands: dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth (no problems reported); sfc /scannow (no issues reported); rundll32.exe pnpclean.dll,RunDLL_PnpClean
 /DRIVERS /MAXCLEAN (returned a prompt--no activity) and a chkdsk /f just for good measure at the next restart.&nbsp; Restarted again (no evidence of anything other than the chkdsk cmd being executed); checked the windows update history, which still indicates a
 restart is necessary to complete the installation of the update.&nbsp; Windows Update continues to update Windows Defender definitions, but the status still remains the same for KB4051963.

            I tried to reinstall manually from the download through Microsoft Update Catalog; I received a message stating the update KB4051963 was already installed.&nbsp; Windows Update still states that a restart is required to complete the installation, so I remain
 confused.

            I think in this case, since the issue is pretty much cosmetic (when viewing the installed update history, KB4051963 shows as 'requiring a restart to complete the installation'), I'm going to quit while I'm ahead and wait until the next major release.&nbsp;
 Right now, my system is operating without any other problems (that I am aware of, to date) at version 1709, build 16299.98.&nbsp; Thanks for the feedback, though.<br />

I found my answer : set it up as a local printer, create a port, name it "\\computer\printer" and it works!!!!!<br />

    <title>No SATA Hard Drives - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markdunckhorst  say:</h3>
<h2>            No SATA Hard Drives</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought and put together a new computer. It was running on Haswell with Windows 10 just fine. When I finally got all the parts I needed to make a bootable USB drive. My only option for such was Windows 10 1803. Installed off a UEFI USB with Windows
 10 WHQL enabled. I installed on an MSI&nbsp;Z370 Gaming M5 with an Intel I5 8600K. I had purchased a Samsung 970 EVO M.2 NVMe. Install went fine then my two 2TB Western Digital drives began disappearing. One Gold Enterprise&nbsp;Edition the other a Black drive. The
 would also disappear&nbsp;out of BIOS. POST would hang, took a minute sixteen seconds to boot and it never found my&nbsp;HHD's. The motherboard has Debug LED's they would sit on A2 (IDE Detect). Once booted I checked Disk management, nothing. After an hour or two a
 message would appear out of the right lower corner stating that they were found. I would have to go back into Disk Management and Import the Foreign drives. I should note that one drive was Basic and the other was Dynamic. After a bit, they would disappear
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking that it was a hardware issue I had my NVME and motherboard replaced. I can't go back to a previous version of Windows as there is nothing pre-1803. The drives had games and programs on them. Reappearing and disappearing made the Black Drive too
 corrupt to be able to use anymore and would bring up health warnings on the Gold drive. I removed the Black drive and replaced it with a WD Green 1TB drive (Dynamic) and when that drive comes online I must always Format it before I can use it. I am not alone
 a quick Google search brings up&nbsp;over&nbsp;4000,000 results</p>

<p>The install went without a hiccup. No problems when installing, no error messages, so none of that will help. Appreciated though. Now yesterday I spent a good amount of time searching for Windows Fall Creator's&nbsp;Update 1709. I could never find a Microsoft
 source. Finally, I downloaded and installed one. My computer ran just very funny. I set Semi-Annual Updates to wait 365 Days, but there was something wrong with this version of Windows. So now unless it is NOT from a Microsoft source I will not use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed, re-installed, re0downlaoded the Media Creation kit soo many times that I have lost count. Right now I leave my&nbsp;SATA HHD's unplugged, boot in seconds and am waiting to buy a Seagate drive as this problem seems to be unique to Microsoft April
 2018 Update and Western Digital</p>

                    <p>I am unable to run a device because of a driver issue. I read that you need the Mini Dump for info to help me with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the mini dump files in the One Drive Sky Drive as a zip file. I am not sure how to insert it here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my laptop info:</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows 8.1 - 64 bit</p>
<p>Toshiba Satellite C55 series</p>
<p>AMD A6</p>
<p>RAM 4.00</p>
<p>AMD A6-5200 APN with Radeon HD Graphics 2.00 GHz</p>
<p>
</p><p>Antivirus is Avast Free Version</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a new computer and the only thing that we have downloaded was the Avast and the software for Spooky2 from
<a href="http://spooky2.com/downloadsPage/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://spooky2.com/downloadsPage/index.html</a>&nbsp;Spooky2_04082014_Setup_17910. and the drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>The application and software ran fine when using driver CP210x_VCP_Windows but then I added new devices to run with the</p>
<p>the Spooky2 software which was&nbsp;PL2303 -&nbsp;Prolific DriverInstaller_v_1_8_0. This is the older version because the newer version will not
</p>
<p>work at all. The software would not even open with the newer driver so I researched and saw that alot of people were having problems</p>
<p>trying to use that driver on Windows&nbsp;8.1. That is the reason that I have instead this other version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did also have to use a Vista_Installer.exe to download the driver on the 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also wanted information from a MSinfo file but the computer says that there is not one. I will check to see if I have typed it correctly</p>
<p>but I have to a previous screen to see that information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The software worked great with the CP210xVCP but ever since I downloaded the older version of the PL2303 I now get the
</p>
<p>WDFViolation (SER2PL64) error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I will add the Mini Dump zip file as soon as I know how to insert it here and I will go back and look to see if I have typed the MSinfo
</p>
<p>incorrectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help you can offer will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Sort by Date Doesn&#39;t Work on SubFolders in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012</h2>
                    <p>Hi There!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've an issue in my Windows 10 and also in Windows Server 2012 in my Local Server. I've thousands of Folders and I need to Sort these by Date whenever I made any changes in the folder and SubFolders inside. So I'm getting the Folder Sorted by Date whenever
 I do modification in the Main Folder, but when I made any changes within the Subfolders of that Folder, it is not showing Main Folder on top of the List. How can I do this in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012? Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            NDIS usermode io protocol service missing</h2>
                    <p>Hi All, Im having a real issue with my network connections but unable to find the answer on any blogs. Any help would be very much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a Dell Lattitude E6230 - 64bit - Windows 7 professional</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I first had an issue where my hard drive had slipped out of place and was unable to boot, but resolved but reconnecting</li><li>I then found I was unable to connect to the internet either through Wifi or LAN
</li><li>Found the cause to be a bunch of network services which had not started. I resolved this by changing the user right in the RegEdit files for each svc</li><li>This enabled me to connect to remembered networks </li></ul>
<p>Current issues</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I am unable to connect to any new network (Wifi, LAN or Dongle) </li><li>Connection status in the taskbar says not connected (even though I am)&nbsp;</li><li>I can right click Open Network and Sharing Centre (which takes ages to load) and it displays "The dependancy Service does not exsist or has been marked for deletion</li><li>Had a nose around services and I seem to be missing&nbsp;<strong>NDIS usermode io protocol
</strong>service completely (although it is showing in&nbsp;<span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Ndisuio) &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So I am thinking this may be the
 issue?</li><li>Also could be due to the driver, Window updates wants to download Ericsson - Mobile Broadband GSM - Dell Wireless 5560 HSPA+ Mini-Card Network Adapter but it will not allow me as it says "Windows Encountered an Unknown Error"</li><li>Windows Event log displays "The Network Connections service terminated with the following error: The system cannot find the file specified."</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>sfc /scan now has been run - no issues picked up</li><li>ran malwarebyt, combofix, McAfee Scan&nbsp;</li><li>Winsock fix tried</li><li>sc config Ndisuio start= demand</li><li>Changed startup mode for the NDIS service</li><li>I've tried reinstalling windows but im getting UNKNOWN_ERROR</li><li>I have no restore point to backup to</li></ul>
<p>Thought I would see if anyone else has any advice before I do a clean install</p>

<h2>            Can we still play COD4 &#38;amp&#59; WaW online&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hey, I heard that the XBLPET team will ban people who continue to play in public matches on Call of Duty 4 &amp; World at War and will ban people who hack in those games. The problem is that I
 may want to get those two games; but because these games are hacked, they are UNPLAYABLE on Xbox LIVE and even if I do want to stay, I'll probably get banned for staying in those lobbies. So because of this, I probably can't play COD4 or WaW online anymore.
 Anything? (Can a XBLPET please reply to this?)</span></p>

<p>Hello gamerXpress. You can still play on them, you just can't hack on them. One of the rules says to not intentionally play with a person for hacks or cheats, so as long as you don't follow them game-to-game, you'll be fine. Hope this helps! :D</p>

<p>Hi GamerXpress I play COD:Waw and COD4 online still and find that yes there are a few who have hacked/modded the game. but aslong a your not doing so your fine just remember playing in a modded lobby might be fun but you may run the risk of getting banned
 as you could be mistaken for a modder.</p>

<h2>            Password&#47;security problems</h2>
                    Strange problem:<br />
Suddenly started one day. Can log in ok to windows 7 pc on starting up. Should the screen lock out, the same password is no longer recognised. Equally when I try to remove or change the windows user password, it is not recognised. The only solution I have come
 up with is to shut down and resart any time screen locks. Any ideas what could have happened. No new hardware or software installed. But recently fingerprint device has stopped working and is not recognised or reinstallable<br />
Thanks<br />

            Thanks. Nope. In safe mode still says password not recognised on password change page despite having logged in with same password 10 seconds before. My best guess is that the use of strange characters that use a different language setting (accented characters)
 is not being recognised inside the windows control panel despite being recognised on initial login<br />

            <p>Thank you for your response. I looked thought the link but the problem I have is I cannot do anything under the security tab. When I click on the security tab, I see 'object name' and the path, And then there is a message saying, "you must have read permissions
 to view the properties of this object".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file is in my downloads folder and I am the sole user of my computer with full administrative privileges. I have not encountered this problem anywhere else on my computer so it is specific to the downloads folder.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Corrupted download &#40;Halo&#58; Reach&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. Since the game was available through Games with Gold I'm trying to download it but every single time it show as corrupted. It even appeared for a brief moment on my games but it disappears. I live in Brazil and my account had the original region as
 USA because at the time I created it there was no Live support here and I wanted to play Gears of War on my PC. Anyway, here's what I've done so far without success:<br />
<br />
- Deleted the corrupted file, cleared system cache, restarted the download =&nbsp;CORRUPTED</p>
<p>- Deleted the corrupted file, restarted the download =&nbsp;CORRUPTED</p>
<p>- Changed my region to Brazil and even bought a game (the download was successful). Tried to download Halo: Reach again = CORRUPTED</p>
<p>- After changing my region, I deleted the corrupted file, cleared system cache, restarted the console and restarted the download =&nbsp;CORRUPTED<br />
<br />
I noticed that the game files had increased a little when I changed my region. It was 6.57 GB before the account migration and now it is 6.60 GB, but it might be some localization files.<br />
<br />
I don't know what to do anymore. I already downloaded some other games (free to play ones) and played it online, but I can't download and play Halo: Reach! What else can I do to fix this? Thanks in advance for the attention.</p>

<p>You need to not download from your download history and then download from the games for gold menu</p>
<p>Your migration must be performed before actual download you should always have Your account region matchc your actual region</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. I waited for the account migration to be completed to start the download again and had no success. I download it from the game with gold menu, never from the download history. Thanks for the attention anyway :)</p>

<p>Well the thing is you queued the US content which would be the one that is still queued
</p>
<p>Your only real option</p>
<p>Click download from the Brazil website </p>
<p>Rather then the US website</p>

<p>But, as I said, I deleted the game from the console and cleared the cache. After the account migration, I tried to download again through the console (new download, not resumed). I'll try to start the download through the website to see if this will fix.
 Thanks again for the attention :)</p>

<p>Thanks, but it didn't worked. I tried to queue the download from the site but it didn't worked. I'm on the correct region! My account and console are on Brazil region! As I said before, I changed the region to the correct one to see if this would fix the
 problem. I guess I'll just give up. Thank you so much for the attention.</p>

<p>It's a long shot but have you tried deleting your profile (profile only), re-downloading it and trying again?</p>
<p>My story: I'm having a similar problem but without the region thing, I'm in the UK. I got a message saying 'game can't start, try downloading again' or something close to that. I tried deleting the game, clearing the cache and restarting the console to no
 avail. &nbsp;I noticed that my gamerscore was 0G, which is a few thousand less than what I thought it was, and I had played no games and had no history. I looked at the profiles on my Xbox and it said my profile was corrupted. I deleted it, cleared the cache, downloaded
 it again and started the Halo: Reach download. I'm currently at 20% and the last few times I tried it stopped working at 10% so I'm hoping the issue was just my profile.</p>

<h2>            Gra Fortnite nie chce mi się uruchomić&#91;Fortnite game does not start&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Gram w fortnite już od około 1,5 roku i wszystko mi działało ale od miesiąca nie mogę grać. Mam też fortnite RŚ i nawet w to nie mogę grać bo jak uruchamiam fortnite to ładuje się ale po chwili wyskakuje mi komunikat ,,Xbox jest lepszy z Xbox live Gold"
 a wcześniej mi to nie wyskakiwało, pisał z tym do epic games ale po dłuższej konwersacji napisali mi że z tym problemem mam się udać do was więc liczę na pomoc bo teraz są fajne, łatwe wyzwania do wykonania a ja nie mogę grać</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Boot-up problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iainaf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Boot-up problem</h2>
                    I have 2 WD 'My Book' external HDs&nbsp;and a card reader all USB connected. I have no problems with boot-up if all external devices are powered down or disconnected. However, if any one of them is powered up or connected, the boot up hangs after the first
 "DOS" screen, and I have to power them down and restart. I have checked the boot sequence (F2, Boot) and it is correct. I have also tried disabling the boot of USB devices with no success. USB Legacy is off.<br />
I would appreciate any advice.<br />
Thanks.

            Some BIOS's are quite funky when it comes to booting from USB devices. A&nbsp;few of things to try: Change each USB related BIOS setting one at a time, rebooting and testing after each change. I do mean each and every BIOS entry that mentions USB. Try all the
 settings for each entry. Use the disk managment console to check if there are any Active partitions on the USB drives. If there are, remove the Active attribute. Be careful not to remove this from any internal drives as the system won't boot if you do that.
 Remove all other USB devices including disconnecting any internal card readers, printers, cameras, scanners, phones, etc. With one external drive and no ther USB devices connected see if the computer boots OK.<br />

            Hi, Socspop
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend using SFC. During the analysis carried out by SFC on the files of the system, it will check the versions of each one of them and in case it finds one that has been overwritten or is damaged, the tool itself will proceed to recover a good version of that file to replace it. It is a tool based on the command prompt that offers several commands to perform these tasks of file analysis and recovery.
<br />
<br />Check this link, it is to run (Scannow and Dism) that are used to repair Windows system files.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />
<br />If the above does not work. Follow these steps: 
<br />
<br />1) launch powershell 
<br />2) Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3) Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

                    <p>I am using offline files and when I am offline, CPU goes high&nbsp; (40-50% on quad CPU) after a little while and does not stup until explorer.exe process is killed. I already disabled all shell extensions and even offline files (sync) are disabled (though the
 files still exist).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked with procexp and see these threads in explorer.exe: </p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Double click on the top thread (12696) that eats all the CPU reveals the current stack:

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time and effort.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will certainly help you with this.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a folder that contains corrupted .wav files is opened, Windows Explorer calls the Media Foundation (Mf.dll) function to extract metadata from the .wav files. However, the Mf.dll function enters an infinite loop when extracting the metadata.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Try to start the computer in safe mode and check if the issue persist:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services.<br />

If it helps, try method 2:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Try to perform clean boot:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,
 or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> T<span style="color: rgba(51, 68, 68, 1)"><span>ry to run the Microsoft Safety Scanner:</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note: </span></strong><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Run System File checker to see if you have any corrupted system files.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files<br />

<h2>            How do I use DirectX 12 on my PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How do I use DirectX 12 on my PC?</p>
<p>(I have 2 GTX 780 (3gb) running SLI and PhysX to CPU (i7 4960X).)<br />
</p>
<p>I know that my graphics card is supported by looking at this page -</p>
<a href="http://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/dx12/supported-gpus?field_gpu_type_value=All" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/dx12/supported-gpus?field_gpu_type_value=All</a>
<p>(You can switch pages on the bottom to view more supported graphics cards.)</p>

<p>
</p><p>The sad thing is, it still says that I am running DirectX 11.2 on all of my games.</p>
<p>Can someone please help me?</p>

            <p><em>"it still says that I am running DirectX 11.2 on all of my games."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do you read DX 11.2 ? The System tab in dxdiag should show DX12, but the graphics part shows</p>
<p>the 'feature levels' your cards can use </p>
<p>(My GTX770 can use only 11.0 .&nbsp; Maybe it will also go to 11.2 if I install a newer driver ?
</p>
<p>I'm still using version 355.60 atm, but I'm not too concerned about DX12 just yet.
</p>
<p>DX12, and Win10, is still in it's infancy. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I don't believe the 700 series will support every&nbsp; DX12 in game&nbsp; graphics effect, but is does support
</p>
<p>the other features. You may need 900 series for the whole cup cake. </p>
(or wait for the next series, which will probably be coming fairly soon) -
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- You do not switch anything to DX12. If a game uses DX12 effects it will choose the appropriate DX 12 file,</p>
<p>but to my knowledge no final release&nbsp; game uses DX12 effects just yet.</p>
<p>When games that use DX12 effects are released they will very likely do as current games do with DX11
</p>
<p>and either offer a DX12&nbsp; .exe, and option in the games setup, or automatically implement DX12 settings when
</p>
<p>you choose the highest&nbsp; available option in the settings that use DX12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other DX12 'features' that are not graphics effects.</p>
<p>- DX12 promotes more efficient use of the cpu, and this should be functioning already, but you may not
</p>
<p>notice any improvement in your games atm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I'm not sure if it's fully implemented yet, but the VRAM on your two gpu's will also be combined,
</p>
<p>so your two cards will have 6GB rather than only using 3GB, as SLI has done to date.</p>
<p>If you have a game that can use more than 3GB VRAM you should be able to determine if this feature is</p>
<p>already working by checking the VRAM use with GPU-z , or similar monitoring tool.</p>
