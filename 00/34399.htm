<h2>            File folder still exists after deleting that folder&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I reformatted my computer because of this issue, but I still haven't solved it yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been deleting a lot of files recently because my computer was getting slow. Today, I created a folder on my desktop and put a whole bunch of pictures in it. When I was done, I dragged that folder to the trash bin. The folder icon didn't disappear, but
 the files inside that folder got deleted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I can't delete that stupid folder. It keeps giving me the "could not find this item" error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me with this? It's driving me crazy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox One - Troubles switching from Wired to Wireless Network Connection </h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I had my Xbox One originally plugged into my router via an Ethernet cable. However, having recently moved the television set, I decided to use the wireless feature on Xbox One. Having switched to my wireless network, I'm now unable to access any online game
 content. However, I am connected to Xbox Live, can stream YouTube, Netflix, etc. I have 100% wireless strength, 37 Mbps download, 0% packet loss&nbsp;and my NAT type is set to OPEN. According to the Detailed network statistics, my 'Detailed NAT information' specifies
 'Your network is behind a cone NAT'. </p>
<p>What would be preventing me from accessing any games online?</p>
<p>I appreciate any help!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jon</p>

            Hello,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>When you install Internet Explorer 11 for Windows 7, the installer program tries to automatically install prerequisite components. We cannot install&nbsp;Internet explorer 11 from 9.&nbsp;We have to install Internet Explorer 10 and upgrade to Internet Explorer 11.</p>
<p>
</p><div>I would suggest you to check whether this set of prerequisite updates is already installed. To do so, you can refer to the following link for the required set of prerequisite updates and verify them with the installed updates in your system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Prerequisite updates for Internet Explorer 11</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2847882/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2847882/en-us</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To check the installed updates, please refer to the following link:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>See which Windows updates are installed</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/which-windows-updates-installed#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/which-windows-updates-installed#1TC=windows-7</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After opening the window <strong>View update history</strong>, you can check with the KB numbers of the prerequisite updates that are not installed and install them manually from the formerly provided link.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>After installing updates, reboot your system. If you don't see Internet Explorer 10 download
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=39232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Update for Internet Explorer 10 in Windows 7 (KB2859903)</a> and install <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie-11-worldwide-languages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Internet Explorer 11</a>.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>If you still have the issue, then you may follow the troubleshooting steps as provided in the following link:</div>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Try entering Safe Mode to repair later.
<br />
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn‚Äôt applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Tell me how you are doing and let me know if the information has been helpful in solving your query.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You would need to contact your ISP to give you instructions on how to turn on bridge mode for your router. Doing a quick test it seems that everyone that's used this modem with either Comcast or your ISP W.O.W has been having problems specifically with the
 XBOX 360 S, it was meant to be corrected with a firmware update from the modem's manufacturer ARRIS but nothing has come from their side as far as I can see.<br />
<br />
Contact your ISP and inquire about turning on bridge mode on your Modem/Router combination, this will essentially turn off the router part and just enable the modem so you can connect your own router. Try that out and see if it works, I believe the reason you
 were getting an IP Address error was simply because you can't use the Arris Gateway with your router if you don't disable the routing functions of the Arris modem. At least, I believe that's how bridging on the gateways work, I'm sure someone will correct
 me if I'm wrong.<br />
<br />
Try that out and see what happens when you use your own personal router after the gateway has been bridged.<br />
<br />
Let us know :).&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Re: &nbsp;IE&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suppose I don't really have IE up at all. &nbsp;I have something calling itself that, which will allow me to search the internet, but it does not look the slightest bit like your screenshot. &nbsp;It has a tab bar and an address bar and that's it. &nbsp;There are no
 colors on it at all. &nbsp;And it does not produce a menu like you show.</p>
<p>

    <title>FSX and Saitek Pro Flight Yoke Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waynemcconnell  say:</h3>
<h2>            FSX and Saitek Pro Flight Yoke Issue</h2>
                    Hi, I seem to be having software issues between FSX and my Saitek Pro Flight Yoke Controller. &nbsp;Whenever I minimise FSX &nbsp;it stops 'seeing' the controller and renders it useless. &nbsp;The Saitek software still sees the yoke and I'm able to test it which shows
 that the yoke is working properly. &nbsp;But once I minimise FSX, it no longer sees the yoke. &nbsp;This is extremely annoying as I have to get information from websites to complete flights: Routes, fuel planner etc. &nbsp;I fly for British Airways Virtual and I'm unable
 to complete flights because the yoke freezes. &nbsp;I've called Saitek and they think it is a problem with FSX, not the yoke because it works in the test window. &nbsp;I'm running Windows 8, could that be the problem? &nbsp;Anyone else experiencing this and have a fix? &nbsp;Many
 thanks. Wayne

            Hi RebaHood <br />
<br />
It depends on the type files you have downloaded <br />
<br />
Open Windows File Explorer (folder icon on your Taskbar) <br />
<br />
On the left, click Downloads <br />
<br />
On the right, find the file you downloaded and double click it <br />
<br />
If that does not open the file, right click that file and choose Properties <br />
<br />
On the resulting dialog, at the top, what is reported as 'Type of File'?

<h2>            Windows 7 Stuck at 12&#37; install</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I wanted to upgrade from vista to windows 7 because i love vista and it works great on my computer but i hear windows 7 is even better, so i figured i would take the plunge and do it finally.<br />
<br />
I prefer to start clean with new operating systems and go through the reformat and clean install.<br />
<br />
so i popped the disc in and hit the reformat hardrive, after backing up my important files, and the install went suuuper slow at the " expanding files" portion.<br />
<br />
it is still in the expanding files part, for 6 hours now at 12%...<br />
<br />
hasnt budged, and now i have no vista, no windows 7, nothing!<br />
<br />
i basically have a laptop with a bios. and thats it.<br />
<br />
please help... someone... anyone... <br />
<br />
i have read on here similiar issues, but they all seem to be related to upgrades and everyone has logs and such, i have no logs, because i have no OS, im trying to install on a blank slate and its not working.<br />
<br />
i have an important design i need to have done by tommorrow evening, and i cant run photoshop from the bios!<br />
<br />
am i completely screwed?<br />
<br />
<br />
*cries*<br />
<br />
edit -<br />
<br />
installing 32 bit.<br />
<br />
have gateway fx laptop,<br />
<br />
advisor said it was compatible <br />
<br />
do not have windows vista or xp install discs anymore.<br />

            Try Repairing The Windows Installation to get either Vista or 7 back<br />
<br />
1. Insert the Windows 7 DVD and restart your computer<br />
2. Boot from the DVD.<br />
3. Choose your language and click Next.<br />
4. Click Repair Your Computer and then select the operating system you want to repair.<br />
5. Click on the Startup Repair link from list of recovery tools in System Recovery Options.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If that works to get Vista back try the steps below, if not (or if you want to) try booting from the Windows 7 DVD and installing Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Troubleshooting Tips To Solve Common Problems When Windows 7 Does Not Install<br />
<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and fix them.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</a>
<br />
<br />
2. Disable all security software including anti-virus and firewall programs.<br />
3. Make sure your computer has the most recent BIOS and drivers.<br />
4. Disconnect all external devices except keyboard and mouse before installing.<br />
5. If your computer/motherboard has integrated video use that and remove the dedicated video card.<br />
6. If you have a large amount of RAM (memory), try reducing the amount of installed RAM. 1GB if installing 32bit, 2GB for 64bit, then replace RAM if the upgrade is successful.<br />
7. If you downloaded Windows 7 and burned it to a DVD try burning it again at the slowest speed possible. It's also possible the download may have errors, you could try downloading it again.<br />
<br />
8. Check your RAM (memory) for errors. This may take awhile.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A) Insert the Windows 7 DVD and restart the computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; B) Boot from the Windows 7 DVD.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C) Choose your language, then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; D) Click on "Repair your computer" then select the operating system to repair.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E) Click the Memory Diagnostics link on the System Recovery menu.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; F) The computer will restart and your memory checked for any errors. <br />
<br />
9. Disable Startup Programs:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A). Click Start, type MSCONFIG in the Start Search box, and then press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK User Account Control permission and enter password if any<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If using XP: Click Start, click Run, then type: MSCONFIG and click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; B) On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C) Right below Selective Startup, uncheck the "Load Startup Items" check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; D) Click the Services tab, click the "Hide All Microsoft Services" box, then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E) Click OK, then restart the computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; F) Attempt the upgrade again.<br />
<br />
(NOTE: if the install doesn't work and you continue to use XP/Vista turn your security software back on, then also return to MSCONFIG and on the General tab, click "Normal Startup" then click OK to exit.)<br />

            i think i have identified the issue, <br />
<br />
i think my dvd drive is messed up and isnt reading correctly... <br />
<br />
after popping the disc in and out a few times i was able to get the install to run and it flew through the "expanding" portion very fast.<br />
<br />
i also think my laptop was overheating (it runs hot anyways) which was either caused by the dvd drive, or causing the dvd drive problems.<br />
<br />
<strong>BUT now it is hanging at "setting up your computer for first use" and has been for awhile... at least an hour.<br />
<br />
now my question is should i hard restart this? will it start from the complete beginning, or somewhere further in the install?<br />
<br />
should i hard restart and try install from a flash drive? would this make a difference?&nbsp;
<br />
