    <title>How can I revert from Windows 8.1 Pro back to Windows 8 Pro&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I revert from Windows 8.1 Pro back to Windows 8 Pro&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Center from Windows Store a few weeks. The computer became extremely unstable, with random crashes that froze my computer. I had to force-shut-down each time that happened. Before I disabled "Superfetch" and "Windows
 Updates" in services.msc, my computer was unusable, with my hard drive activity constantly at 100% with 10000+ ms average response time with next to no read or write speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This never happened when I was using Windows 8 Pro with Media Center. My computer is a Sony VAIO SVE14118FWX with 8GB RAM, 750GB hard drive, and Intel Core i5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed all driver and software updates before upgrading. I did not make a back-up before upgrading to Windows 8.1 Pro because I trusted Microsoft's software. I installed Windows 8.1 Pro through Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can obtain a copy of the Windows 8 Pro with Media Center .iso using the Windows8-Setup.exe tool and can burn the .iso onto a disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I heard that there was another method of returning to Windows 8 Pro: refreshing my PC. However, it states that all of my personal files and programs will be removed. This is another problem, since I installed Microsoft Office 2013 Professional while
 I was in school, and I do not want to have to spend an upwards of $200 because of the Microsoft team's ineptitude at creating reliable upgrades to their already-somewhat defunct software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any hope for my situation? Please leave solutions that will allow me to revert back to Windows 8 Pro with my files and programs intact (or accessible after I downgrade).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to ask me any questions as well. I am currently able to skim by with using this computer because I have disabled many Windows services.</p>

            <p>I forgot to ask some questions I had:</p>
<p>- If I were to reinstall Windows 8 Pro using the .iso, will my Product Key work or will I need to activate by phone? And if I were to activate by phone, would the Product Key work then even though I've used it?</p>
<p>- Is the Product Key listed in Control Panel for my Windows 8.1 Pro the same as the one I had for Windows 8 Pro?</p>
<p>- Will the Product Key for Microsoft Office 2013 work if I reinstalled Windows 8 Pro and then tried to activate Microsoft Office 2013? Will the phone activation method work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very frustrated at the lack of solutions for my problems. I still strongly believe that Microsoft should have ironed out all of the issues in their operating systems before releasing them to the public.</p>

            I also forgot to mention that I am able to install any new driver updates from Sony. When I try to install updates using Sony's Packaging Extractor, it gets stuck at around 95% progress and then my hard drive activity jumps to 100%, leaving my computer
 unresponsive.

            <p>Benjamin, </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can return the machine to factory defaults by hitting F10 during startup. Practically all laptops come with Recovery partition which can be used to return the machine to the state it was in when you bought it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>See this site for more details: <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/how-to/laptop/3462995/factory-reset-laptop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/how-to/laptop/3462995/factory-reset-laptop/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you restore the machine to Windows 8.0, you'll only qualify for updates and security patches until January 2016 after which all support will cease.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it would be better to try and sort out the problems you have now in order to get the machine running again properly. To start with, do the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click the Start button and go to&nbsp; Command Prompt (Admin).</li><li>Type (or copy/paste) <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and hit Enter.</li></ol>
<p>System File Checker will scan Windows for corrupted system files and attempt to repair any found. If it can't repair the corruption, you'll get a message to that effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the latter case, use the same command prompt to run the following command which I suggest you copy/paste:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>DISM.exe/Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The DISM tool downloads original system files from Microsoft's servers to replace those which the other tool was unable to fix. So make sure to maintain your Internet connection if you have to run it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a screenshot of both commands as I ran them on my own machine recently.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Let me know how you get on please. </p>

            <p>First of all, I would like to thank you for responding and attempting to help me with my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running the system scan. I will post a follow-up when I am finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my PC came with Windows 7 Home Premium installed. However, I would rather stick with Windows 8 Pro because of its revolutionary design and fluidity (not to mention its blazing start-up speed which was completely destroyed by Windows 8.1 Pro). Therefore,
 I'm willing to risk security flaws and stick with Windows 8 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A problem I'm having is that whenever Windows Updates (or whatever other Windows software) is installing programs in the background, the PC suddenly crashes or stalls for long periods of time. I doubt it is because of a failing hard drive since I got this
 PC rather recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my problem is not solved, I'm willing to provide any information about the system so that you have a better overview of what is wrong.</p>

            <p>Ben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st of all I won't or can't buy into the idea that 8.1 destroyed the fast boots. 2nd there is nothing wrong w/ the advice 'Xircal' gave. I am not very enthusiastic about shutting off Services... they are there run for good reasons. In addition to 'Xircal'
 I would point out you can do a REFRESH back to 8.0 w/out losing data or files. There are 2 Refreshes... one goes back to virgin the other leaves personal data intact. Ergo, I would do a Refresh then go grab 8.1 Upgrade from Store, again. Just re-install Office
 afterwards. That shouldn't need a phone call either. Since you, already, own it I'm not sure why you mention $200. Refresh should be tried before Recovery! Sony is not the only laptop that has stuff about ITS updates driver stuff. I have no more interest in
 that than some of the bundled&nbsp;junk OEMs include. When it comes to 'updates' just stick w/ Windows Updates... that knows what your machine needs w/out, involving (in your case) Sony. in that same light, 'Xircal' is right, we need to get you on 8.1 and not stay
 on 8.0</p>
<p>Now, let's tackle your licensing queries:</p>
<p>1. Your License Key for 8.0 carries over to the 8.1 Upgrade. A phone call should not be required.</p>
<p>2. The Product ID you see in the System window is not the (install) License Key. If you do have to phone to reactivate anything, that's, really, no biggie. Might give you a new Product ID. But, since no hardware changes, it's unlikely.</p>
<p>No offence in mentioning this... before one puts the 8.1 Upgrade in one should make sure the machine is as clean healthy as possible. Disc cleanup, security malware scans such before installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p><em><strong>Drew </strong></em></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>First of all, I am sure you've completely misunderstood the situation here. I simply replied to Xircal's comment, letting him know that I am running the scan to see where the problem is (which, may I add, the scan froze my computer when it got to 74%, so
 I have to do it over), not criticizing his suggested solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I HAD to disable the Windows services. With "Windows Updates" and "Superfetch" running, the hard drive is CONSTANTLY at 100% hard drive usage with 0MB/s read and write speeds and nearly 100,000ms of response time. There is a fine line between needing
 to disable certain features to actually have a "working" PC and deciding to disable features just to speed up systems. I'm nearly 100% sure that if you were in my situation, you would do the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thirdly, I do not have the activation keys for Office 2013 or Windows 8 saved. Who would have thought that I would ever have had to reinstall either? I could find them after assiduous searching, but I would rather not go through the ordeal. I simply want
 an easy way to fix the problem because I'm not wrong when I put the blame on Microsoft for releasing software that altered some PCs unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which brings me to my next point. It seems like you think that I am a complete newbie when it comes to technology. I made sure that all my drivers were up to date and that all software was compatible with Windows 8.1 Pro before upgrading. I've never had
 any problems before, and I know my computer is able to run Windows 8.1 Pro.</p>

            <p>My pitiful computer has decided that neither solution was good. The scan always froze my PC at 74% and the second installation fix stopped my PC at 20%. I've tried both options twice now, to the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All four times I had only a Microsoft Word document and a Google Chrome HTML page open. I honestly doubt that either would have such an impact that it would crash my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you know any other solution. At this point, it seems like the best option is just to downgrade to Windows 8 Pro. And stay there.</p>

            <p>No I didn't misunderstand.&nbsp; Sorry if I didn't express myself well enough.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I didn't think you were criticizing his suggestions, @ all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did understand &amp; appreciate why you were disabling some services.<br />
<br />
Nor did you strike me as a newbie, at all. The pre-install prep mention wasn't meant as any insult.&nbsp; Sorry, just threw it in out of habit.<br />
<br />
Were both Office &amp; the OS downloaded as opposed to having install discs?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Too bad they didn't get written down or something.&nbsp; You probably know there are ways to find it or if nothing else can buy a new one from MS.<br />
<br />
But, if a Refresh or Recovery is done Win8 will pull the key from the BIOS w/out needing to know it or enter it.<br />
<br />
Forgive if I'm again telling you things you, already, know.&nbsp; Just striving to be helpful.<br />
<br />

            <p>I will suggest either do a Refresh or probably, better, the Recycle option &amp; then, go get 8.1 from Store, again.&nbsp; That can be done w/out Key.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Unless, I'm completely misunderstanding, again, of course.<br />

Oh, right, the re-install Office issue.&nbsp; You could get a Key for it from MS.<br />

<p>Since Jan 2015, update for <strong>Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems (KB2990967)</strong>, download size: 30 KB,&nbsp; keeps as asking to be reinstalled even though I have

<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile I notice that I have <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">many overlooked Windows updates (at least 30) that do not load to Windows Update for update</span> and are not visible to the update process.&nbsp;

            Hi,
<div>Thank you for posting your queries on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>To help us understand better on what exactly is going on with the Windows Update, I suggest that you upload the Windows Update log files so that we can look in to it.</div>
<div>The Windows Update log files are located in the following location:</div>
<div>C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows</div>
<div>(replace username). Open the file WindowsUpdate.log with a text editor for the latest log entries
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the mean time please try these:</div>
<div>In Windows Vista Microsoft introduced component based servicing of Windows. The purpose of this is for example to get more stable installation and uninstallation of security patches, hotfixes and service packs. This is also the case in Windows 8. The only
 problem is that sometimes things get corrupt leading to problems installing hotfixes, security updates and service packs. In previous versions of Windows (i.e. Windows Vista and Windows 7) you had to download and run the tool System Update Readiness Tool to
 be able to fix these problems. As of Windows 8 this feature is built into Windows.</div>
<div>To run a health scan of the component store, start a cmd.exe with administrative privileges and run the following command:</div>
<div>Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /Scanhealth</div>
<div>The tool takes quite some time to run and will eventually return the status of the scan. If something has been found to be corrupt run the following command to the repair the problem(s).</div>
<div>Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /Restorehealth</div>
<div>Hope this helps. </div>
<div>Please get back to us with updated status on the issue.</div>
<div>Regards.</div>

            Hi,
<div>By studying the Windows Update logs that you have uploaded, I can see that there&nbsp;is one error that are recurring throughout the log and that is error 0x80070002.</div>
<div>This problem occurs when some files in the Windows Update are missing, even though the update is downloaded and extracted successfully.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In order to fix this I recommend that you run the Microsoft Fixit from this website:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please post back if the issue persists and we would be happy to help.</div>

</p><p>What is the make and model of the router?</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>You mean to say that when you changed the password of the router, you are not able to change it on the printer?</li><li>Did you try to remove the password and then check if the printer works fine? </li></ol>

            You'll have to run the set up for the printer again to change the SSID &amp;/or passphrase.<br />
Usually once wireless printing is set there's usually an option to change the details when running the set up again.

<p>I started to get this one two small Server which are running Server 2012 Foundation R2, they been working well for almost a year in two seperate companies. All of sudden they both started to get this error. The Server are Fujitsu, both Run the Fujitsu ROK
 OEM version both are authorised and registered with microsoft. They are both running in a "workgroup" envioment and both have 9/10 users (Foundation support 15 Users) I seen so many post on this but none give a stright forward answer as to what the problem
 is and how to fix? some point to it having a shared printer installed others to DNS, I checked both and both work fine. Both Server are the only server on the network and are configured as a domian server but not being used as such, the users only share 1
 or 2 folders and print nothing else is used. Any pointer appsiated.</p>

<p>Maybe if you dont want a picture, use mspaint to make a black or gray or any color jpg and save it - then change to it in&nbsp; Settings / Personalizations / LockScreen</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you dont want to use a login at all - if a local account visit Control Panel / User Accounts and change your password to a blank field.&nbsp; &nbsp;If a microsoft account, run&nbsp; &nbsp;NetPLwiz .</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi All,<br />
I have my HD formatted in fat32. (I'm old)&nbsp; I want to backup my system with the Microsoft backup program.&nbsp; Can I use the exfat format to read the fat32 on my external hard drive during a reinstall? The only options I have using the format in "MY Computer" is
 NFTS and EXFAT.&nbsp; Again, I am starting with a fat32 formatted hard drive.&nbsp; <br />
It is Christmas, I could use some GOOD news..... Thanks, JW<br />

<p>
</p><p>The .NET Framework is an integral part of many applications running on Windows and provides common functionality for those applications to run. For developers, the .NET Framework provides a consistent programming model for building applications. if you are
 using the Windows operating system, the .NET Framework may already be installed on your computer. Specifically, the .NET Framework 4.5 is included with Windows 8, the .NET Framework 4.5.1 is included with Windows 8.1 and the .NET Framework 4.6 is included
 with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The .NET Framework 3.5, however, is not automatically installed with Windows 8, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, and must be separately enabled to run applications that depend on it. This must happen through Windows Update, which is invoked in one of three ways.
 All of these require an Internet connection:</p>

    <title>English Windows 7 Pro in Russia - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robo40  say:</h3>
<h2>            English Windows 7 Pro in Russia</h2>
                    Hi all, can I get an English language version of Windows 7 Pro for activation in Russia? I do not wish to use multiple languages after installation, so I don't need Ultimate. The MS store in Russia only sells Windows 8. I have been told that if I buy Windows
 7 Pro with 'Russian Language' on the box, I can still choose English on set-up. Some clarification and help is needed please!

It is the product key that determines whether its an upgrade or full version. The .ISOs provided will work with either an upgrade or full version key.

    <title>windows 7 &#40;32 bit&#41; restore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> treborpowers  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7 &#40;32 bit&#41; restore</h2>
                    Hi.&nbsp; I have a Dell Optiplex 9010 with windows 7 (32 bit).&nbsp; After reinstalling windows twice my computer is&nbsp; working fine except that the F8 restore on boot up is does not work.&nbsp; When I get to the repair windows option the computer seems to freeze and the
 mouse is dead so I can not do anything.&nbsp; When this happened<br />
I turned the computer off and, thank God, I was able to restart windows normally.&nbsp; I believe if I had waited longer my computer would have been toast.<br />
It seems the restore programs in the computer are seriously corrupted to the point they destroy the computer.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried installing Dell Backup and it failed to&nbsp; make a backup.&nbsp; I installed Nova Backup on a trial basis and that failed to make a back up.&nbsp; It is clear that
<br />
the backup code in the computer is corrupted.&nbsp; My computer came with windows 7 64 bit and the staff at the University of Penn installed windows 7 32-bit<br />
at my request.&nbsp; I have written around 20 programs in Dos and that is why I wanted windows 7 32 bit.&nbsp; Now I have compiled all my programs so they<br />
either run in DosBox or the command prompt in windows 7 (64 bit).&nbsp; Also I have figured out how to run DosBox in full screen in windows 7 64 bit<br />
(To do a good job you have to know the possible screen resolutions of your computer).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dell is sending me a windows 7 64 bit install disk.&nbsp; My question is if I do reinstall with this disk will the problem be fixed?&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone says reinstalling takes a few hours but it takes me days.&nbsp; You have to update windows, update the video drivers, reinstall
 the printer and each program has to be reinstalled with<br />
product keys, (sometimes I have to call and be on hold), there are environmental variables to set and getting all my Dos programs to run takes days.&nbsp; So if I reinstall windows 7 64 bit and the problem is still there I will be very unhappy.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Also has anyone done restore with Windows 7 32 bit from the F8 start up or from a boot disk?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />

            <i>The F8 restore on boot up does not work.</i>
<div>-&gt; Mine does not either. Booting the machine with a Windows Repair CD is an easy way around the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div><i>Everyone says reinstalling takes a few hours but it takes me days.</i></div>
<div>-&gt; This is why I have been using a fully mature imagecreation program&nbsp;(Acronis True Image)&nbsp;&nbsp;for years. Its cost is moderate and it saves me heaps of time when something goes wrong.</div>

            Thanks for the replies.&nbsp; I have to admit I have been stupid.&nbsp; My backup drive was&nbsp; FAT32 and I noticed that you should use NTFS (or whatever is not FAT32).&nbsp; I tried my other drive and the NOVA backup worked so I think that was the problem.&nbsp; It&nbsp; only cost
 me two weeks of trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have deleted all my <br />
previous restore points so I won't risk frying my computer again.&nbsp;&nbsp; I lost a lot of sleep over this and<br />
I hope this is the end of the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

            I spoke too soon.&nbsp; I made a complete backup of my c:drive with NovaBackup trial version but when I went to restore using the CD rom boot disk I had created the program loaded and everything looked fine but I could not do anything.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no cursor
 and the computer did nothing&nbsp; when I moved the mouse.&nbsp; Also when I click the caps lock key the caps lock light did not turn on.&nbsp; I gave the computer a few minutes to find the mouse but then I turned it off because I was afraid the program would trash my computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear that the windows program that handles restore from F8 repair on boot up or when booting from a CD has problems.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to fix this?&nbsp; Thanks for listening.<br />

While it is preferable to use NTFS instead of FAT32, both file system will work on a backup drive. With FAT32 no ownership details are backed up.

<br />
I turned it off because I was afraid the program would trash my computer.<br />
<br />
It is clear that the windows program that handles restore from F8 repair on boot up or when booting from a CD has problems.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to fix this?&nbsp; Thanks for listening.<br />
</blockquote>
While in the WRE (Windows Repair Environment), you have several options:
<div>- Repair the boot environment</div>
<div>- Perform a System Restore, using a System Restore Point.</div>
<div>- Perform an Image Restore</div>
<div><br />
<div>These three processes work most of the time. From your post it is unclear which one you used and what role the NovaBackup plays. Is it an image backup? If you have a problem with it then the NovaBackup FAQs are a better place to obtain advice.</div>

<div>"Pulling the plug" on a PC is not a good idea. If you think that something is going off the rails then the damage is probably already done.</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can try some of these in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy
<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already
<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.</p>
<p>Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come
<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>

            Hi JF084n
<br />
<br />If your keyboard is wireless, check the battery in that keyboard 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that is not the issue: 
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot 
<br />
<br />Run the Keyboard troubleshooter 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this for you 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager 
<br />
<br />Expand the Keyboards section 
<br />
<br />Right click your keyboard and choose 'Uninstall' 
<br />
<br />Then restart your PC

<h2>            How to remove all windows 10 files and GWX from windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi All, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a brand spanking new dell precision 4800 running windows 8.1 pro I've only had it for a couple of months and unfortunately its been polluted by the GWX malware update we all know about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have successfully uninstalled GWX from my windows 7 machines but on my shiny new computer GWX just refuses to die. there are numerous files left on my machine even after installing the KB3035583 update and hiding it, there are files left all over my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will not update to windows 10 until privacy concerns are dealt with I'd rather pay for software and own it rather than give microsoft the right snoop around my system and share my data for advertising purposes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would like to do is</p>
<p>remove all updates &amp;files&nbsp; relating to windows 10</p>
<p>remove all updates&nbsp;&amp;files relating to gwx</p>
<p>remove all updates &amp;files that relate to tracking and telemetry feedback to microsoft</p>
<p>
</p><p>please help</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks Ben</p>

</span></li><li><span>Click the update <strong><span>KB3035583</span></strong> that you want to remove, and then click
<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>. &nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can refer to the below mentioned steps to hide an update.</span></p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop with two windows 10 OS and I want to remove one of them. Here is my story :</p>
<p>I used my laptop with a W10 installed on local disc and I recently bought a SSD to install windows on it so my computer will be faster. I bought a second W10 license, an installed it on my SSD.</p>
<p>Now when I start my laptop, they ask me wich windows I want lo launch. I choose the one on my SSD and it works but the other one seems to be still here... Even after formatting my local disc...</p>
<p>How can I "uninstall" this version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Hey there. Although this is for windows 7, it should work for 10 too so try this
<br />
<br />a)     Click the Start button and type MSCONFIG in the search bar and hit Enter
<br />
<br />b)     Click continue if prompted for confirmation
<br />
<br />c)      In the System Configuration Utility go to the Boot Tab, you should see two Operating systems listed
<br />
<br />d)     Select the Operating System entry (Old installation) you want to delete and click the option “Delete”
<br />
<br />e)     Click on Apply and Ok
<br />
<br />f)      Reboot your computer and verify the change
<br />
<br />Very Important: Ensure that you remove the old Windows installation and do not remove the Windows installation entry that is working fine and set as default.

<p><span><span>Hi d m,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>An ad hoc network is a temporary connection between computers and devices used for a specific purpose, such as sharing documents
 during a meeting or playing multiple-player computer games. You can also temporarily share an Internet connection with other people on your ad hoc network, so those people don’t have to set up their own Internet connections. Ad hoc networks can only be wireless,
 so you must have a wireless network adapter installed in your computer to set up or join an ad hoc network.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A software-based wireless access point (AP) sometimes referred to as a SoftAP that uses a designated virtual wireless adapter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>SoftAP and ad hoc networking are mutually exclusive on the same physical adapter. If SoftAP is running on the AP adapter
 and a user or application starts ad hoc networking on the STA adapter, SoftAP will be shut down. If ad hoc networking is running on the STA adapter, an attempt to start SoftAP on the AP adapter will fail.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 taskbar preview not working</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium, and my task bar preview isn't working.<br />

<br />
This is not the first time it happened, it happens every now and then. I ran the Aero troubleshooter, and it can't find a problem, and my Aero is activated. The only solution I found to it is restarting, but it gets annoying having to do it when I'm in the
 middle of something. So is there an actual fix for this&nbsp;that I don't know about?</p>

            <p>My graphics card driver is fully updated. I've had the problem with older drivers as well, so as far as I can tell, that isn't the cause. I should also mention that when I put my cursor over one of the icons, and then move it away, it reacts as though my
 cursor is still there (it glows, and&nbsp;I get the white box with text that displays more info, like on many links), but still no preview.</p>

            The problem is not constant, it just randomly happens from time to time,&nbsp;and it fixes itself with a reboot. It's simply very annoying to have the preview not working when in the middle of something, and having to reboot for it, so I have no idea on what
 causes it, and creating a new account to use for everything&nbsp;would just be a big hassle, as the problem sometime happens months apart, or other times, days apart.

            <p>It sounds like you could have a virus or other malware. Get your antivirus program up to date and boot into Safe Mode. Then run a full system scan. Forum moderator Keith has some suggestions along this line at</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3"><u>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3</u></a></p>
<p>If that fixes it, fine. If not you can open an administrator command prompt and run SFC if the above doesn't help. Click START, then type<u>sfc
</u>in the search box, right-click SFC.EXE and click <i>Run as administrator</i>. Then from the command prompt type<u>sfc /scannow</u><i>.
</i></p>
<p>I hope this helps. Good luck.</p>

            I regularly run full system scans, and my antivirus is completely up to date. Windows Explorer doesn't have any problems, it's just the preview that doesn't appear sometimes. I've already had it happen when my computer wasn't connected to the internet
 for a few months. I'm thinking it's probably some kind of glitch in the software, only I have no idea what could be done about that. As I've already said, I have no way of knowing if something fixed it or not, because it can take months for it to happen again.

            <p>Hi Steph,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you're describing is not normal Windows behavior but since it is random there could be another 3rd party program that is interfering with Windows and causing it to have this "glitch" as you put it. Troubleshooting at this point is kind of tricky since
 it doesn't happen on demand. One suggestion would be to try and narrow down what's running when this error occurs and see if you can pinpoint any other software that could be causing this issue.

    <title>Windows 8.1 &#126;&#126; Roxio PhotoShow stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grasshopper 125  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 &#126;&#126; Roxio PhotoShow stopped working</h2>
                    <p>I have used Roxio PhotoShow since 2003 (with xp, vista and windows 8 and windows 8.1).&nbsp; I used it successfully 3 weeks ago and when I went to use it this week got the message 'Roxio has stopped working - A proplem caused the program to stop working' and
 Windows would look for a solution and then close.&nbsp; It never stops looking and has not found a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw the following Q&amp;A on your site and wondered if they were related?</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_programs/roxio-has-stopped-working-a-proplem-caused-the/c9c377f5-4cfd-4248-a890-5445ae436da0?auth=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only problem is, I have no idea what any of that means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told by someone who upgraded to Windows 10, that their Roxio PhotoShow&nbsp;is not compatible with Windows 10 and thought that would be the case.&nbsp; That's why I have waited to do my upgrade until I finished all my PhotoShows.&nbsp; But they did say that Roxio
 was still up and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping there is a solution until I finish my projects.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Try running the Compatibility troubleshooter. You'll find it by right clicking the Action Center icon (it looks like a flag) on the taskbar and click "Troubleshoot a problem".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Immediately underneath "Programs" in the menu which opens, click the link to "<em>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</em>" and then follow the prompts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, uninstall it and then right click the setup file and go to "Properties". Click the "Compatibility" tab and then checkmark the box for whichever version of Windows is deemed to be suitable to run it in. That might be Windows XP, Windows
 Vista or Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further down the same menu, checkmark "Run As Administrator". Click Apply/OK and then run the setup file to reinstall it again.

            <p>Roxio Photoshow will not work with Windows 10. &nbsp;I reverted back to Windows 8/8.1 and it worked fine until I did the Windows Updates. &nbsp;Once I did the updates (156 of them) the Photoshow window would not open or Windows crashed. &nbsp;I worked on this all day and
 found the culprit, and Roxio support doesn't even know this one. &nbsp;DO NOT install Windows Security Update (kb3087040) &nbsp;It will kill your Photoshow! &nbsp;I tested it by removing it and it worked again. &nbsp;All other updates worked fine. &nbsp;So your solution is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Photoshow not working with Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;When reverting back, do not install Update (kb3087040)</p>

            <p>Hi Stephen, </p>
<p>
</p><p>You're partly correct. There was an issue with the security update KB3087040 for Flash player for Internet Explorer which caused this error:
<em>An ActionScript error has occurred</em>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the problem has already been corrected with the release of KB3089023. See this support article for more info:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3089023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3089023</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Without the latter update installed, you leave your system open to attack from the Flash vulnerability that the patch was designed to address:

<p>
</p><p>Since I thought Roxio would not work again, I finally upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; Is there a chance it could work with the correction in KB3089023 or Roxio will never work with Windows 10?&nbsp; When I did the compatibility check before deciding on Windows 10,&nbsp;
 all my programs were compatible and that included Roxio.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Difficult to say. I noticed that Roxio was acquired by Corel in February 2012 which may account for Windows not being able to find a solution which you mentioned in your OP.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The acquisition by Corel would change the update links, but because Photoshow hasn't been updated in a while, the new update server won't show.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've updated to Windows 10 already and found that it works, then hopefully it'll remain that way.

<p>
</p><p>I've spent about an hour trying to get PhotoShow 10 to run on Preview build 10565...</p>
<p>I haven't had any success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all Compatibility Modes as well as changing Permissions, and making my User Name the "Owner"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best I could do was to get the PhotoShow Logo to appear briefly before the error message appeared...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... None of the Windows Updates that have been mentioned are showing up for this Win 10 build... They are possibly incorporated as part of the OS..</p>

            This was the problem I had exactly. &nbsp;My only solution as stated in an earlier post was to go back to Windows 8.1. &nbsp;There are a couple of updates that you do not want to install&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">KB3087040.
 &nbsp;Someone said the correction&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">KB3089023 will fix that, but for now I am sticking to Windows 8.1. &nbsp;My photoshow works after removing Windows 10 and not installing the bad update.

    <title>Second mouse pointer in screen center in Windows 8 &#40;desktop and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmitriiloukianov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Second mouse pointer in screen center in Windows 8 &#40;desktop and Metro&#41; - Sony VaioT Ultrabook</h2>
                    After some uncontrolled MSFT updates or without any reason, the Win8 boot now shows the grey circle or circle with the mouse pointer in the center on login screen from touch screen. Attempt to move pointer with touch pad shows second pointer, and original
 one stays blinking in the center. When logging into Metro interface, the center cursor stays in the center, and it is possible to move metro tiles by swiping the screen.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When going to Desktop, the pointer in the center sometimes stays, sometime disappears; when it stays, opening and closing the Task manager without doing anything there removes the unwanted pointer. When the additional pointer in the center is removed,
 desktop does not respond to tap and double tap; and does not show the select area rectangle as it usually did. However, the touch screen digitizer apparently works as the touch and multipoint touch show the shadows at the touch points. It also allows to scroll
 the text in the browsers from swiping the touch screen. But zoom and taps do not work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also noticed that few seconds after the desktop appears on the screen, the touch screen works as it use before (tapping and area selection work), but after 3-4 seconds they stop working and one can only observe the touch points and scroll text in browsers
 (no resizing)...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The device manager shows the digitizer as "USB Input Device" USB\VID_04F3&amp;PID_0018; it is impossible to find the vendor or update the driver. The device also creates four child HID Device objects. The digitizer may be stopped and restarted from Device
 Manager; when restarted, the center pointer appears again or a white square appears. Touching the square reverts the pointer to an arrow shape in the grey circle of touch indicator in the center of the screen. Opening and closing Task Manager removes the center
 pointer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sometimes when moving "true" pointer with the touchpad the arrow in the center pointer is replaced by a hand or two-ended arrows,</div>
<div>It looks that there is an application or service that loads with desktop and grabs "touch down" messages, not letting them to be serviced by gui. However, I cannot find anything unusual in startup programs or services; Virus scan shows that machine is
 clean.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I thought that it could be a ClassicShell that may interfere, but removing it does not change the behavior. Nor the removal of all startup utilities from startup list.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It appears a software problem, any suggestions what could cause it or how to find the root cause of the problem are appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I saw a similar description of the behavior on Sony forums, but there was no resolution.</div>
                </div>

            <p>FIXED!!! My laptop had this exact problem from Day One. &nbsp;I found a thread where some people had fixed it by going into mouse properties, and either enabling trails (shortest trail setting was OK and hardly noticeable) or by changing the cursor display from
 standard to magnified (or, to black). &nbsp;But that did NOT work for me. &nbsp;Here's what absolutely worked:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned off the touchscreen. &nbsp;Who needs it -- it was a stupid Windows 8 idea, anyway, and the trade-off for fixing that "ghost cursor" issue was WAY worth it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Device Manager. &nbsp;Under Human Interface Devices there are 2 lines for USB input device. &nbsp;(If there are more, temporarily unplug wireless mouse receiver or other USB input devices). &nbsp;Disable the first one, by right-clicking on it and selecting Disable.
 &nbsp;And the problem is GONE! &nbsp;Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibly the screen had a defect that made it act like an invisible finger was tapping it, or more likely it's a Windows 8 bug that affects some machines. &nbsp;Anyway, it's a huge relief to see it fixed, as the laptop was horrible when this happened. &nbsp;Good luck!</p>
