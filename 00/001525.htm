<h2>            Unable to COPY email to other Folder AFTER Updates&#33; &#40;Web base&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update, I am unable to COPY email to other folder (by clicking move to, then copy to folder) like how it used to before the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know how do I copy to other folder? Right now it just MOVES the email, not copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am using the normal outlook email via web. Please guide me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>AND, if possible, how do I switch back to pre-update? I really prefer the older version. It has been forcefully updated upon my account. Thanks a lot!</p>

            Dear Dave,
<br />
<br />You are welcomed.
<br />
<br />If you want to move emails, you can just drag and drop them to the appropriate folder or use move to option. Unfortunately for this there are no other options. More about organizing inbox you will find here <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/organize-your-inbox-with-archive-sweep-and-other-tools-in-outlook-com-19eee6b9-09a1-4db6-b5d6-37644190884f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/organi...</a>
<br />
<br />As for other features that you used in Classic and you cannot find in Beta, please leave a feedback in user voice for the developers here <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/601444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/601444</a> .

<p>Hi&nbsp;Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The error message "Please contact your admin. It looks like they haven't assigned you a license for the Office desktop apps." usually happens if Office 365 for business or Enterprise is not activated. To make sure that there are no other Office apps installed
 on your laptop, I suggest that you completely uninstall Office using the easy fix tool. Use this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>&nbsp;and then follow the steps under option 2 to successfully use the easy fix tool. After
 doing so, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">start your computer in safe mode with networking</a></strong>, and then

    <title>Microsoft Band Data Different To That On Strava - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> biggers1972  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Band Data Different To That On Strava</h2>
                    <p>I have just started using the Microsoft band and I had difficulty connecting to GPS (I was running whilst trying to connect - something I have subsequently learned is a "no go"), so I had to run without it. &nbsp; The run in non-gps mode was recorded bu the band
 as 5.96m with a duration of 51.52 and av pace of 8.42. &nbsp;During the run I had to pause the band twice to cross roads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also just started using Strava for the first time and synced this run to it. &nbsp;The data was different. It recorded 5.8m, a time of 53.36 and an av pace of 9.09. &nbsp;Significantly different. &nbsp;It also recorded the last mile of being 10.48 which again is
 not correct. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this is all down to gps not being switched on. Is anybody else experiencing this? Was the last mile of 10.48 recorded because I paused the run and the data has not been recorded properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any comments and advice would be appreciated as I can see this driving me nuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>It looks like this is just the difference between starting without the GPS until it kicked in.&nbsp; Try looking at the runs on a map and see if they have different starting positions or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also just checked some of my runs out and they have slightly different data., even with waiting for the GPS to lock and then starting.&nbsp; Mine were mismatched, but only less than a tenth of a mile over 3.5 mile runs, so pretty close.&nbsp; I think it has to do
 with how they calculate moving time, time you aren't running, stopping at a light or something vs running time when calculating total time.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last time I went for a run I made sure that the gps was locked in before I started and there were still big differences. The data recorded by the band was 5.02m and a time of 45.25 with an av pace of 9.01. &nbsp;In Strava its recorded as 4.9m, 45.19 and an
 av pace of 9.12. &nbsp;The most inconsistent thing was the splits. &nbsp;They were all over the place, some 30 seconds out on some miles. &nbsp;I have raised it with Strava who are looking into it. &nbsp;Microsoft have just bounced it back to the forum - great help that.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have the same issue as you do. I ran with my Band on my wrist and my phone (iPhone 6 running native Strava App) around my arm. The 2 were in perfect sync throughout the run. When I finished both the Band (via Microsoft Health) and the Strava App showed
 the same distance and pace. When the Band uploaded it's data to Strava (the data was 13sec/mile off what it recorded using the app.</p>

<p>My assumption is that the Microsoft Band is either recording or sending to Strava fewer-than-normal data points and makes Strava "cut corners" on their distance calculation, especially in loops and windy roads. Possibly running in a straight line can solve
 the mystery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't complain if it was syncing more distance than the actual one since my Strava friends are really competitive. XD</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll appreciate the help.</p>

            I've only just taken delivery of my Band 2, but on my bike ride this morning I found excellent agreement with Strava logged on my phone and the Microsoft Health app.&nbsp; The heart rates measured by the band looked sensible too, but I have yet to do a proper
 comparison with HR chest strap.<br />
<br />
But my problem is that, despite connecting to Strava (being shown as "Connected" under the "Connected Apps" tab), my Band data is not being uploaded to Strava.&nbsp; I really need that to work, so any tips appreciated !&nbsp; I've tried disconnecting and re-connecting.&nbsp;
 Is there a big time delay before the workout appears on Strava ?&nbsp; Also I wonder if there is an auto-pause setting for the Band's Cycling tile ?<br />

            I had been having the same issue with Strava logging 0.2 to 0.5 miles less for runs, with no consistent pattern evident. &nbsp;However, since last week, none of my runs are syncing to Strava. &nbsp;It appears that I am not alone in this issue. &nbsp;Would appreciate
 any input or advice from Microsoft.&nbsp;

            The only thing that had me thinking is that I have privacy locations on at 200m around a couple of locations and even though I am not talking about runs in those locations could there be an issue with this?<br />

<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this is a MS issue / defect with their data being sent to Strava.</p>
<p>I don't see that MS is working on this with high priority. Maybe some of you should also open incidents with MS to make them aware of multiple users experiencing this...</p>

    <title>Conditional Formatting using a formula - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffbrown7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional Formatting using a formula</h2>
                    <p>I have a fairly large workbook template that I use regularly. It holds about a dozen worksheets. Typically I will have 25-40 lines of data. The data is copied and pasted into the Data Source table that feeds pivot tables in the rest of the WB.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I use conditional formatting to highlight text unique identifiers (names) in the first column based upon varying special interests. This is done in the first worksheet
</li><li>I use a macro to copy the formatting of the first column-first sheet to all the first columns of all the Pivot Tables.</li><li>Generally works fine... </li></ol>
<p>.....BUT, some, not all, the sheets will format the first row first column of the selected table regardless of the meeting the conditional formatting formula.&nbsp; (Basically it says that if a text value ="text value", format the cell in red bold font.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty straight forward. It is the first rule in a list of rules, so I don't think it is a priority problem, but will keep looking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My best guess is that I have a conflict going on that I can't see or don't know enough to look for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Difficult to comment/suggest without having a look at your file layout and your macro code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, it looks like some issue with the macro code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, cannot confidently tell that the issue is in the macro code only.</p>

<p>Thanks for the code recommendation! It is much cleaner and easier to follow. I tried sending screenshots of the file, but pasting a picture from word does not seem to do it. I may be willing to share the file if you will maintain it as confidential and proprietary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

Unless it's something added in OS X 10.7 or later I don't know what "mic icon" you're referring to, but I don't believe it's a part of Word or any of the other Office apps. I'm not aware of any microphone icon in the Office apps -- the speech feature has always
 been activated by a keyboard shortcut set in <span style="font-weight: bold">System Preferences - Speech</span>.<br />

    <title>Problem with Font Size in Microsoft Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> madeline8520  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Font Size in Microsoft Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi, I have Outlook 2013. My problem is that the font is too small on the screen. I have poor vision and it strains my eyes to see fonts that small. I think it might be a default but is there anyway to reset the overall font size for the program? It is pretty
 much the font for the whole Outlook program, from my address book listing to the messages that are sent... Th zoom only works when you preview emails in your inbox and such and I know that when you create a new email, you can change the font that you send.
 I was asking about the "template" (?) of the Outlook 2013 program.</p>
<p>Thank you and I would love some help! :)</p>

            <p>Have you taken the first step to verify when in fact the emails have arrived at HostGator for Outlook to be be able to download them? The assumption with the question is that it is automatically an Outlook related issue. If you can't see emails in your web
 account - then neither will Outlook in which case the next step is to contact HostGator.</p>
<p>The other possibility is that the "sending" email provider is delaying things so the other question becomes - do these emails all involve the same sender (or block of senders that may be using the same email provider on their end whatever that may be?)</p>

    <title>auto fill of contacts when I email has stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erich lewis  say:</h3>
<h2>            auto fill of contacts when I email has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>I went through my explorer to delete some invasive advertisement. I believe I deleted some kind of synchronizing program or deleted a profile of some kind by accident.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I write an email from my Outlook in Office 365 Online, the auto fill for my contacts does not work. When I select the People box on my Office 365 home page, my contacts do not appear. However, when I search a contact name, the contact comes up. On the
 email "TO" line I can search and find my contacts also, but no auto populate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what I deleted, but obviously it is something to do with my contacts not showing up or auto populating.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get this feature back?</p>
<p>

            Typing in the To field doesn't reference your contacts in any way. It references a cache of addresses you've used in the past, whether or not they're contacts. Once you've addressed a message to a contact, however, their name/address should appear when
 you start to type from that point forward. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            CANNOT MAKE OR RECIEVE CALLS&#47;TEXTS</h2>
                    
<p>Hi People-</p>
<p>I have a NOKIA N95 which i bought of a friend the problem is i cannot make or recieve calls and texts.</p>
<p>I can go on-line and use maps and&nbsp;everything else but cannot use it as a phone.</p>
<p>I tried phoning T-MOBILE to see if it has any kind of lock on it but it hasnt and is not recorded as lost or stolen.</p>
<p>I then took it to carphone warehouse to see if they could help but it is out of warranty and they wanted £85 to send it away for repair.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea what the problem could be as it is really annoying me now?</p>
<p>It has the latest firmware installed on it but a friend said it could work if you rollback the firmware-is this possible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any replies welcome-Thanks</p>

<p>is the handset reporting it is in offline mode?</p>
<p>try power button, choose general and if it asks to go "online" choose yes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if not what was the handsets original network?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also have you tried a alternate networks sim?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you could also try regenersis for a out of warranty repair quote as they may be cheaper than carphone</p>

            <p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means that either your scans or your updates are considered out-dated.&nbsp; If you open MSE, it should tell you which is the problem (or if it's both).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Piriform has programmed it for some reason to remove part of the MSE History files and it's deleting the files MSE checks to determine the last time a scan was conducted. This file removal has no effect on the antimalware protection provided by
 MSE.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Open CCleaner Applications Tab, then Under Windows uncheck MS Antimalware...that should prevent CCleaner from deleting the MS Antimalware scanning history files.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Per suggestion of <i>MartinHampton</i> you <u>may</u> also need to uncheck MS Management Console.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Do you use Advanced System Care? If so, see the following compliments of ahaap:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Update ASC to the most recent version which resolves most of the problems.<span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that isn't it, please check your system clock to make sure it is correct (even a few minutes can matter - but I've seen it say 1978 or 2286 for the year). Resync it with the internet clock. If it needs to be changed and keeps happening, change the
 CMOS battery on the motherboard as that's almost always the cause of a system clock problem.</span></p>

<p>I have an iPaq 1955 with Windows Mobile 5.0 working fine, but after synchronizing using Mobile Device Center I can't figure out where exactly the synchronized files (data) was placed on my computer. My settings
 require contacts, appointments, email and notes to be synchonized, but I can't find them on the computer, only on the mobile device (the iPaq 1955).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, a word of advice. I had to reset the PDA while connected in order to get going... I took me a while to figure this out.</p>

<p>There you go!&nbsp; That is the issue!&nbsp; You HAVE to have Outlook installed for it to sync correctly.&nbsp; The Pocket Outlook will only sync with Office Outlook not the apps that come with the OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Years ago, the vendors always provided a copy of Outlook ... I don't think any of them do it now ... so it is just another cost.&nbsp; But, it is a worth while expendature IMHO!</p>

            No-one (of the general public) knows if and when there will be an upcoming firmware update for the Nokia 200, possibly those features that you request may be rectified, or they may not. You can keep checking Nokia Suite for updates or these forums.

<p>Hi Derek,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked this error message in our database, this error message usually relates to a broken
<strong>EAS sync partnership</strong>. If you are using Outlook.com, Exchange or Office 365 Exchange Online mailbox, resetting the
<strong>EAS sync partnership</strong> via <strong>OWA</strong> or <strong>Outlook Web Access</strong> can resolve the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>(Note: If you are using Outlook.com, your accounts should already migrated to the new Outlook.com platform.)</strong></em></p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.Kindly logon to <strong>OWA</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://outlook.com -<strong> Outlook.com</strong><br />
</li><li>https://outlook.office.com - <strong>Office 365 Exchange Online</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click the gear icon at the top-right corner and locate <strong>Options</strong>
<em>(for Outlook.com)</em> or <strong>Mail</strong> <em>(for Office 365)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Choose <strong>General</strong>, then <strong>Mobile Devices</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click the pencil icon to find the sync partnership of your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. After finding the sync partnership, select the remove icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Confirm removing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your Mail app should be syncing after removing the sync partnership.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kindly post back if these steps did not fix the issue so we can look for other options in resolving your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>IE I need here to write &amp; save https credentials for my ASUS router - can't figure out how to do that in Edge.</p>

<p>What is "Flow"?&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case try to see if this will open an IE window and let it stay open.&nbsp; Run... (e.g. press Win-R and enter:)&nbsp;&nbsp; iexplore.exe&nbsp; -nohome&nbsp; -extoff</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the objective is only&nbsp; to have a window open and stay open.&nbsp; If you want to try to do something with it you may have to use the Stop command Alt-V p&nbsp; or start a new tab&nbsp; Ctrl-t.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is not enough to avoid the effects of&nbsp; "Flow" try doing it in a safe mode boot or otherwise figure out how to&nbsp;prevent that process from interfering with IE.</p>

<p><br />
In general you should adjust the largest number(s) rather than the smaller ones.&nbsp; That way the percentage impact of the correction is minimized.</p>
<p>Here's one example.&nbsp; Suppose your smallest number is 1% and the largest is 80%.&nbsp; If your total is 99%, then if you add 1% to the smallest number, you are changing it by 100%!&nbsp; And, what if the smallest number was 0%?</p>
<p>By contrast, adding (or subtracting) 1% from 80% will change it by 1.25%.&nbsp; Even if the largest number were, say 25%, changing it by 1% would change it by only 4%.</p>

            <p>Whether the "difference of the percentage sum and 1" is positive or negative depends on the order of evaluation, which you do not explicitly state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The macro below makes the appropriate adjustment, but I may have reversed the cases in which you want to subtract from the largest vs add to the lowest.&nbsp; In any event, you should be able to make the appropriate changes if it is not correct.&nbsp; Note that this
 macro alters your original data, so when testing, use copies of your original data.</p>

<h2>            How to install Windows Mobile Device Center 6.1 now available in &#34;SYSTEM CONTEXT&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,<br />
<br />
we are facing an issue with installation of application "Windows Mobile Device Center 6.1"<br />
<br />
I was tried to install the setup using command line <strong>"drvupdate-amd64.exe" /Q</strong> in admin mode, which is installing fine. But when i try to install this using
<strong>system context</strong>&nbsp;starts installing and after some time its got rollback, and installation is not happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later, i was extracted the files from the source&nbsp;<strong>drvupdate-amd64.exe </strong>
and installs using this command&nbsp;<strong>d</strong><strong>river_setup.exe /i&nbsp;drvupdate-amd64.msi .
</strong>Which is also failed in system context</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I was tried to delete the two DLLS (difxapp.dll&nbsp;difxappa.dll) and added the updated dll's ,as follows</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">1. open the msi package in Orca</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">2. goto the Binary table</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">3. delete the DIFxApp.dll and DIFxAppA.dll row</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">4. get the latest version of those two files from Win7DDK or WiX or any other source</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">5. add the two rows again with the new files</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">6. save the msi and close Orca</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">7. done, now it should install without any problems</p>
<p>Which is also not works for me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Could you please suggest me on this to install the exe or msi silently in SYSTEM CONTEXT. ??????</strong></p>

<p><br />
If you just saved as a workbook then I assume that you used Save As and selected Macro Enabled Workbook. (If not saved as Macro Enabled then will not work.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless you specifically changed the folder then it should be in your default Save folder. Following instructions to&nbsp;identify your default save folder</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Excel</p>
<p>Select File -&gt; Options</p>
<p>Select Save (Left column)</p>
<p>Look for Default file location:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have recorded code to open the SAP file and manipulate as desired then if you post the recorded code then I will add code to it so that you can simply open the workbook with the code&nbsp;and you will get a dialog box to allow you to navigate to the SAP
 file and select it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be able to email the workbook with the code to other users.</p>

            Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I think part of the trouble was that, although I named the macro, I did not save the workbook where I recorded the macro, thinking that the macro was separate from the workbook upon which the operation was being performed.&nbsp; I
 think this is not exactly true- right?<br />
I must save the workbook where I recorded the macro, then blank out that workbook (delete visible contents and formatting), and just use it to&nbsp; "house" the macro.&nbsp; Is that right?<br />
<br />
Actually, I tried this, and it did not work.&nbsp; <br />
Also, the "personal" macro workbook file does not show up as a macro option to run anymore.<br />
<br />
I really need a tip.&nbsp; I hope you can help.<br />

<p><br />
That is correct but ensure that you use "Save as" and in the field called "Save as type:" (just below the file name) ensure that you select "Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook (*.xlsm)"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish you can also change the filename to make it recognizable as the workbook with the code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said before, if you record the code to perform the processing and post it then I will add some code so that when you open the workbook with the code it will automatically pop up a dialog box where you can navigate to and select the file to be processed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also pls tell me what sort of file you are processing. Is it a .txt or a .csv or what is it?</p>

    <title>Lumia 635 upgrade to win10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrbigbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 635 upgrade to win10</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>I have been waiting to try win10 on a mobile for a long time,(ever since I joined the insider program last year)&nbsp;but finally a member of my family has upgraded and given me a Lumia 635.</p>
<p>Nice little phone but I expected very little from it,&nbsp;however I wanted something to try out Win10 mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to say I am amazed it works better than I expected, its very responsive and I have yet to find anything that does not work,&nbsp;but I have to say this is early days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was expecting to find lots of problems based on what I have read on this forum....</p>
<p>The install was very simple and very quick something like 20 minutes, configuration only took 5 minutes. I have found none of the reported overheating short battery life issues, all apps (that I have tried) work just fine my contacts etc. synced perfectly,
 my Microsoft account worked just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in all I am very impressed at this stage, I think that the apps I started took longer to "fire" up first time but now I really cannot complain about startup times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I am missing something&nbsp; but so far just great! and way better than I expected on such a cheap phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards David</p>

            <p>Just had my first issue, the phone restarted when I clicked on "This Device" in the Storage app.</p>
<p>I know I am getting low on storage as I keep installing apps, but I have just under 2GB left so wasn't expecting any issues.</p>
<p>I know there were about 15 apps active when pressing and holding the back key so maybe this caused the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other problems I have has are all down to the hardware ie no front facing camera etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I did not mention that others have had problems with is that Here Maps and Here Drive+ were not uninstalled on upgrading to 10 and work perfectly so that's a good sign for upgrading my 1320 sometime soon.</p>

            Hi elton 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Skype to Skype calls will be free. Skype to landline / mobiles will be charged. 
<br />
<br />Let me know following -
<br />- Are you making Skype to landline/mobile calls or sending SMS? OR what transaction are you doing where you are expecting money to be deducted?
<br />- Do you have any other subscription on your account?
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.       
        </p>
