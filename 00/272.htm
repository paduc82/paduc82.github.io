<h2>            Outlook 2013 signature getting messed up in recieved emails</h2>
                    <p>Signature formatting in Outlook 2013 goes awry when received by other providers other&nbsp;than Outlook 2013</p>
<p>
</p><p>Including a whole bunch of line spaces added&nbsp;when sending a msg to a Hotmail account</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are extra hyperlinks in text&nbsp;added when received in Gmail where they shouldn't even be&nbsp;i.e. outside of an email address&nbsp;in the sig file</p>
<p>
</p><p>This looks terribly shoddy and bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this would be greatly appreciated! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps. does anyone from MS actually look at these requests as I have a hunch a&nbsp;bug fix in Outlook is necessary</p>

<p>
</p><p>The sig is fine in sent file and when rcv'd by other Outlook users</p>
<p>I use Outlook 2013</p>
<p>It becomes wonky when rcvd by other email providers</p>
<p>
</p><p>This didn't used to happen with previous Outlook versions</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was actually able to reach a support person at MS and they are looking into it. It was beyond him as to why this&nbsp;was going on.&nbsp; I really believe that it is a MS bug and they have to work&nbsp;it out!</p>

            <p>I doubt that's the issue as everything was fine in previous Outlook versions. Also, it would&nbsp;be difficult to ask every single person I&nbsp;send to who does&nbsp;not use Outlook to check their settings.</p>

    <title>Office 2013 &#34;Sorry, we couldn&#39;t find ______&#34; when starting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dressi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013 &#34;Sorry, we couldn&#39;t find ______&#34; when starting Word or Excel.  Upgraded from 2003</h2>
                    <p>When opening Word or Excel, I have a user that is getting the message "Sorry, we couldn't find _____[document name]."&nbsp; Then asks if it it was moved, renamed or deleted.&nbsp; Well, I looked and found several things on the internet that didn't work, from starting
 in safemode (which did work but I found no COM add-ons that were active), to updating links with Skydrive (OneDrive) but the user doesn't use them.&nbsp; This was after upgrading the user from Office 2003 professional.&nbsp; A repair of the 2013 application did not
 address the issue.&nbsp; Neither has a uninstall, reinstall of everything office related.&nbsp; The user was also migrated from another computer using Symantec Deployment Solutions 7.5 PCT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... Word presents two errors, this "My.docx" and "C:\Windows\System32\Documents.docx"&nbsp; While Excel does the same thing except prompts for xlsx variants of the same files.&nbsp; If I open a file that's already been saved, it works without an issue.&nbsp; If I'm
 in a file already and go to create a new document, it works as well without error message.&nbsp; These messages only appear when launching Excel or Word from their shortcuts or from typing winword or excel into the Run command.&nbsp; PowerPoint doesn't have this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking it has something to do with templates, like the normal template is missing or has been sent awry somehow.&nbsp; I created a my.xlsx and put it where the error message wanted it C:\Users\Username\My.xlsx.&nbsp; Then excel would open (still complaining
 about documents.xlsx missing) but it would open My.xlsx even when just launching it from the taskbar or from Excel run command.&nbsp; If I saved my.xlsx, it would save it for the next time I opened excel.&nbsp; This again points me to the fact that the normal template
 for Word and Excel are missing, were pointed somewhere else to another file or something.&nbsp; File locations (Options &gt; Advanced &gt; General &gt; File Locations) seemed normal.&nbsp; We were saving to sever drafts on the computer, not in office document cache (though I
 don't think that was an issue anyway).&nbsp; The default personal templates location is blank, but so it is on mine and that's working just fine.&nbsp; Again, uninstall/reinstall as well as repair did not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user is mostly concerned with Excel given that I changed her word to always open Normal.docx and it opens just fine and says Document1 at the top, like how a template should work.&nbsp; Excel doesn't do that... it always opens my.xlsx when launching, and
 the user has to CTRL+N to get a blank workbook.</p>

            <p>I just experienced the same issue. &nbsp;Turned out to be some problem with the shortcuts themselves. (start menu, program files, quick launch).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can easily confirm this by going to program files\microsoft office\office15 and directly launching any of the applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this was caused by a misconfiguration in the Office Customization Tool under the "Configure Shortcuts" section.</p>
<p>I probably messed up the "Start In" field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, I simply deleted the links the installer created and manually created new ones.</p>

            <p>You could define a character style whose only property is the designated font color and then assign a keyboard shortcut to that style. Note, however, that a character style based (as it should be) on Default Paragraph Font will remove any other direct formatting
 (such as bold or italic) that is applied to the selected text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you'll be doing a lot of text in one run, a simpler solution is to use the shortcuts for
<strong>Copy/Paste Formatting</strong>. Apply the red font color to selected text and&nbsp;press
<strong>Ctrl+Shift+C</strong> to copy the formatting and then <strong>Ctrl+Shift+V</strong> to paste the formatting on any other selected text. The "formatting Clipboard" will retain the selected formatting until you change it or quit Word, so you can continue
 to paste it throughout a Word session, regardless of other intervening actions.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just before the new build started to install, Win10 said it was Preparing Automatic Repair and then it went into the endless loop of restarting.&nbsp; I was not able to stop this in the BIOS settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can't access Safe Mode, Setup or the Boot Menu.&nbsp; The machine is simply stuck on the Automatic Repair loop.&nbsp; I cold booted several times but it didn't change anything.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft office pro free download 32 bit&#63;</h2>
                    <div>I downloaded the microsoft office pro free download specifically for Access, BUT the trial I downloaded only works for 64 or 86bit computers, mine is a 32 bit... so i cant even install it on my computer. any tips or other places i could get a trial version of access that works on a 32 bit? Neither of the other office packages appear to include access... I really need to get access ASAP, please help!</div>

            x86 is 32bit (or at least that is what I've used on my PC).&nbsp; Install that one.&nbsp; If you choose to customize your installation, check to make sure Access is listed and selected for installation before proceeding with the actual installation.

            <p>The option is not when downloading, but rather when you actually perform the installation on your computer.&nbsp; During the installation you should at some point have an option to customize (pick and choose what gets installed).</p>

<p>I have checked your account, but the <em>two-step verification</em> doesn't seem to be enabled. In order to rectify this, I advise that you
<strong>two-step verification</strong>, and then create an <strong>app password</strong>. For more information and steps on how to do so, refer to these links:</font></span></p>

    <title>Mail Merge DLL error between Word and Excel in Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beadfairy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail Merge DLL error between Word and Excel in Office 365</h2>
                    <p>After the most recent Windows update on August 28th 2014, the Mail Merge function ceased to work between Word and Excel on Office 365 Small Business Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note, IT DID WORK BEFORE without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update, every time I try to mail merge, either using an old document or starting a fresh one, I get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error has occurred: A Dynamic Link Library (DLL) initialisation routine failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have unistalled and reintsalled Office 365 and this has made no difference. &nbsp;I have also done a full system restore to before the the update. This worked initially but, despite turning the updates off, a week later the problem is back and another system
 restore has not worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel is also not working properly and crashes every time I try to open a document - this is after freshly reinstalling it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EVERYTHING WAS FINE UNTIL THE LAST CRITICAL WINDOWS UPDATE which I now cannot uninstall, as my laptop has installed it despite my turning automatic updates OFF, and a restore point previous to this update is not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!!!</p>

            Many Thanks for responding, but I am not able to post on that forum as I am a "user" not an admin. Added to which, it is not an issue with the software, but with the latest Windows Update, as the installation of this is what broke everything. Please advise.

            <p>In most cases, this is simply a software glitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can simply do a soft reset by pressing and holding volume down + power down button till phone shuts off and restarts automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend trying a HARD RESET by going to settings&gt; system&gt; about , scroll down and tap on reset my phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please not hard reset will erase all personal files and apps from your phone.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Restarting is not helping. I'll try hard reset once I take backup. Will post here if it works or not.</p>

                    <p>So I´m still stuck in build 10166, and official windows 10 ISO got released today. Can I upgrade (not clean install!) my pc with that ISO and will it be activated or do I have to still wait for solution from microsoft to update 10240 via windows update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally my pc was windows 7 home premium and I installed windows 10 TP on top of it wia WU, never used a clean install.&nbsp;</p>

            I think you just need to remark out this line:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If MsgBox(strMsg, vbQuestion + vbYesNo, "Please confirm") = vbNo Then _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Err.Raise cERR_USER_CANCEL<br />
<br />
The error raised by this line is processed later by a Case statement in the error handler, but you don't need to remove that as the error won't be raised once the above line is remarked out.<br />

<h2>            Outlook Auto preview pane formatting was lost - how to restore&#63;</h2>
                    My Autopreview (pane with sender, date, three lines of text) converted to plain text after Outlook shut itself down due to a problem. Is there a method to restore it to default fonts?

            <p>OK - issue resolved!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did have a personal folders issue in addition to the formatting issue. I ran the repair tool scanpst.exe as recommended in a help note provided by Outlook when it ran into issues with opening Outlook again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, the autopreview formatting&nbsp;remained unchanged, and still not what I wanted. I went back into the customize view and&nbsp;"other settings" and adjusted the "other options" section to always use compact layout. Yes -&nbsp;it worked! It&nbsp;created&nbsp;the two line
 setting with From and Date on the top line and&nbsp;subject in gray font on the second line. I could add the autopreview three lines and format as needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the time and the ideas for&nbsp;restoring the formatting. Just having someone to share ideas with&nbsp;was encouraging!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 - is it possible to reduce the font size of the Sender in the Compact View mode without reducing the font size for the single line mode when the width of the message list is expanded&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that I can decrease the font size for the sender in the compact view in Outlook 2013 as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your message list, Outlook will now use a larger font to display the sender’s name and a smaller font to display the subject of the message. To decrease this font size and make it the same size as the subject, you can create an additional Conditional
 Formatting rule without any conditions but with its font settings to smaller.</p>
<ol>
<li>tab View-&gt; button View Settings-&gt; button Conditional Formatting…</li><li>Click Add.</li><li>Name the rule. For instance: Standard font size</li><li>Click the Font… button.</li><li>Set the size to: Smaller</li><li>OK yourself out of the open dialogs and confirm that you indeed want to create this rule without any conditions.</li></ol>
<p>

            <p>Dear Patil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below being the impact of the sender's font size (without applying the conditional formatting - smaller text) in compact view:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/744ef707-63b7-4992-a87b-f362e2b1a180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/744ef707-63b7-4992-a87b-f362e2b1a180" /></a></p>
<p>The compact view will change to single line view as below (where the font size is desirable):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/038dd184-9709-49c3-b350-ed33e5f1d5c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/038dd184-9709-49c3-b350-ed33e5f1d5c9" /></a>with
 the below option are selected:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d391699-10d9-419b-9ed3-c46eedfe2497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d391699-10d9-419b-9ed3-c46eedfe2497" /></a></p>
<p>I would like to reduce the font size of the sender's name in the compact view, by applying the conditional
 formatting as I stated in the previous message, I am able to get a smaller, desirable font size for the sender name in the compact view as below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c731b59-dbbe-4d29-a2cd-a0b11c2e8cef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c731b59-dbbe-4d29-a2cd-a0b11c2e8cef" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I expand the widths of the message list (which allow me to turn to single line view with more option available, which I found it is very convenient to have more option by simply expanding the message list width), I also got a small font size
 as below which too small and not desirable:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d390f48-0bd5-47a7-a4c5-69a55c3831e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d390f48-0bd5-47a7-a4c5-69a55c3831e8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>May I know are there any way to only reduce the font size of the Sender in the Compact view; while maintaining the original font size when the message list is expanded and turn to the Single line view?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Many many thanks in advance!</p>

                    <p>Since today morning I cannot unlock my phone with my regular security code.</p>
<p>That is strange as I opened up my phone last night and the password is still correct, and it's wrong today.</p>
<p>I tried 12345 and most suggestions I can find on the web, but they're all of no use.</p>
<p>I think it's time to give it a re-flash, as I have a backup on my SD Card on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>But I can't find anything to help me re-flash it, and moreover I cannot find ROMs for my model.</p>
<p>And so are there anything I could do?</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>We are sending invitations to Yahoo email addresses from our Outlook Calendar. Have tested accepting and adding a note from within Yahoo - nothing comes back to Outlook. Is this a common error where Yahoo and Outlook do not talk/connect?</p>
<p>Additional tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tested sending an invitation from Yahoo to Outlook. The email received had attachments which enable you to respond and add to your calendar in Outlook. Yahoo then receives the email accepting the invitation.</li><li>Have tested a gmail address and have no issues - receive acceptance email and status of attendee updates correctly.</li></ul>
<p>Would appreciate any responses!</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>

<p>Hi MobileAspectsAdmin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand Teams gets freeze about 3 seconds when sharing screen and the screen sharing get stuck in the attendees' PC, the issue persists if you re-share the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, please make it sure Teams app is up to date. Click the avatar in Teams app&gt; check for updates&gt; the latest version is 1.1.0015756.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as you have re-install Teams app, may I know have clean the cache in the following location:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft &nbsp; &gt; remove folder <strong>Teams</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft &nbsp; &gt; remove folder <strong>Teams</strong>,
<strong>TeamsMeetingAddin</strong></p>
<p>Reagrding the issue about Teams add-ins does not appear in Outlook, please close Outlook and Teams, then restart the Teams client first, then sign in to Teams, and then restart the Outlook client, in that specific order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, go to File &gt; Options&gt; Add-ins&gt; click "Go..." besides "COM Add-ins"&gt; check if there is an option for Microsoft Teams, and tick it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Hans</p>

<p>Hi Hans,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update, but it did not resolves my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>we did all like cleared AppDATA for Teams, Logged in with Teams then outlook as suggested by you but did not get back Teams Add in Outlook. and while checked in "&nbsp;<span>Meanwhile, go to File &gt; Options&gt; Add-ins&gt; click "Go..."
 besides "COM Add-ins"&gt; check if there is an option for Microsoft Teams, and tick it. "</span></p>
<p><span>there is a option to Enable Teams add-on but it does not even help.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Chandra,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Greetings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is Alan Wu from Office 365 forum support and I am here to follow up on this thread.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For your case here, I'd like to know whether you have done as Hans suggested that you can check if you are currently using the latest Teams version. If yes, for the "Teams video sharing" issue, I suggest
 you change another network environment where the network is good, ie, the coffe shop or store or you can even try with another client (your colleague's or friend's) if it is possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For the option of "New Teams Meeting" (called MS Teams extension in Outlook called by you), I suggest you try the followings to give it a shot:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Check if you are using the latest Outlook client. To do so, you can click "FILE"&gt; "Office Account"&gt; "Office Update"&gt; "Update now". After that, it is recommended that you upload a screenshot about
 your Outlook client version.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Create a new Outlook profile and configure your account under the new profile. If it doesn't work, please upload a screenshot like mine as the following one.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d161d43-2946-4395-adba-78c2dd9b0c7c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d161d43-2946-4395-adba-78c2dd9b0c7c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>3. As mentioned above, if it is possible to try on your colleague's or friend's client, you can also check it on his Outlook client (definitely the one should be workable for your colleague or friend)
 to see if there is any difference.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We are looking forward to hearing you soon.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Alan</span></p>

<p>Hi <span>Alan Wu,</span></p>
<p>Few of my <span>colleague's are not able to share their screen on Teams call and it freezes after 2 to 3 seconds.</span></p>
<p>below is the version we got in our laptops, when clicked on update it says teams is up to date&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(37, 36, 36, 1)">You have Microsoft Teams Version 1.1.00.14359 (64-bit). It was last updated on 6/19/18.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>and about your suggestion on changing network, we checked it by connecting to LAN&nbsp; but still issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>i can share the device details in which am getting these issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Dell Latitude E5440 and Lenova 20269&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>please let me know the solutions/ methods to overcome this.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;as i checked my outlook client is update attached screenshot and Teams addin is missing i did all re installation everything as Hans suggested</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>but no luck. Teams add in is missing&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Chandra,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your update.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you mentioned that the issue persists "w</span><span>e checked it by connecting to LAN", do you mean you previously connect to Teams via a public
 network? It would be better if you can test it under another network (ie, a coffe shop, store, etc).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For "Teams add-in" missing issue, I haven't received your screenshot as well as the screenshot of your current Outlook client version. So, would you please upload them again?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And, I think it might there be a little confusion between us. I'd like to clarify that I suggest you configure your account on any other workable colleague's Teams client to see if you can work well
 on his machine. This can help us identify if the issue is related to the setting on your own machine or client. Your effort is much appreciated here.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>It should be the root cause. You can refer to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/get-clients" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/get-clients</a>&nbsp;(Desktop

    <title>outlook 2016 imap set sent folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacobacci  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook 2016 imap set sent folder</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded from Office 2010 to 2016 and have run into the following issue with Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contrary to Outlook 2010 I have found no possibility in Outlook 2016 to select the folder sent messages get saved to on the IMAP server. My provider uses SentMail, Outlook 2016 insists on using Sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means I have to periodically manually move all messages from the Sent folder to SentMail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two questions:</p>
<p>- Is there a reason, Outlook 2016 does not pick up the correct folder?</p>
<p>- How do I manually select another folder than Sent?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks a lot for any help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Outlook 2010 when using an IMAP mail account also uses a *.pst data file for Contacts/Calander/Tasks, and this Personal Folders set would also contain the default folders (Sent/Inbox/Outbox)</p>
<p>Installing 2016 does not upgrade/overwrite 2010 you have to manually uninstall 2010, have you done this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the tree view pane of the main Outlook window, below Favorites section, you should have a Personal Folders set and an IMAP folder set, usually named as per the mail address, is this what you have?</p>

<p>thanks, Palcouk</p>
<p>Yes, I have uninstalled Office 2010 prior to installing Office 2016.</p>
<p>In Outlook 2016 I have first configured the Hosted Exchange Account and next the UPC IMAP account. In App Data / Local / Microsoft / Outlook, there is a *.ost file both for the Exchange and the UPC IMAP account.</p>
<p>I suspect that Outlook for some reason does not recognize the SentMail folder of the UPC IMAP account as the default account for Sent and then creates its own Sent folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I would like to define the SentMail folder as the folder for sent message. But I can't find a way to do this in Outlook 2016</p>

<p>In the tree view are the data sets shown as prviously mentioned? Allthough you would have an extra data set for the Ex account</p>
<p>
</p><p>What type of mail accounts were you useing previously under OL2010? As installing 2016 would have used the origional OL profile, its settings and data files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you simply added a new IMAP account there would have been nothing for you to define, it means therefore there is somthing going on with your set up that you have failed to mention</p>

<p>I was using the exact same accounts under Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>The Exchange account was the only one that asked for credentials, so I input them. Then I saw that for the Exchange account Outlook 2016 had created two *.ost files, so I deleted the Exchange account and the two *.ost files and re-set up the Exchange account.
 The UPC IMAP account was not touched.</p>

<p>If you are using the exact same mail accounts (other than the Ex one) all settings would have been as before and the IMAP mail account would have used its default folder set</p>
<p>If you added the Ex mail account the data files being used would have been shown within MS Outlook in account settings, the data files tab</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that by deleting the ost data files in the app data folder you have damaged the Outlook Profile, and as such, with OL closed,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel&gt;Mail Applet&gt;Profiles........ add a new Profile with prompt for profile selected, then in email accounts add the mail accounts using the auto setup process.</p>
<p>In the Email Accounts section you can set the required mail account as default - do NOT attempt to fiddle with data files settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once completed start OL under the new Profile - do not do anything untill it has fully synced</p>

<p>I have done exactly as you proposed</p>
<p>- create new profile</p>
<p>- add Exchange account using auto setup process</p>
<p>- add UPC IMAP account using auto setup process</p>
<p>- let everything synchronize</p>
<p>I am afraid the result is exactly the same as before. For the UPC IMAP account Outlook 2016 is creating a new "Sent" folder, instead of picking up the account's default "SentMail" folder to store sent emails.</p>

<p>Hi Damien,</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK. I should say that is the OneDrive set up issue. Did you sign in with your account? After signing in with your account, the OneDrive is trying to add the sync folder to your Mac. For my experience, this error message should occur in this step.</p>
<p>Sorry for my previous sentence that makes you confused. I don't mean it is a sync issue, I said “can not add sync folder”. When you first install the OneDrive, it will let you add your sync folder. However, the steps I have provided is exactly the possible
 cause of the issue. Thanks for trying to provide us the file length/size update. Please also check the following 3 steps. I can reproduce the same error message If I set those settings for my library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rena</p>
        </p>

            Yes, for some security reasons system info would show MSE as from 'unknown publisher'.
<br />
You're fine if you got it from MSE's original download source(s) &gt; <br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download</a>

<br />
You may also confirm from the installer you downloaded and saved from either these sites, that its publisher (and digital signature) is in fact 'Microsoft Corporation'.<br />

<h2>            PC Suite 7.1 causes whole computer to &#39;pause&#39; every 2mins</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHAT THE PROBLEM IS:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use my PC to watch Television, Play Games, listen to music, etc, and I can't do ANY of these things without the whole picture, sound, and system freezing up for a brief moment every 2 mins.</p>
<p>TO FIX THIS, I can uninstall the latest version of PC Suite but that then means I cannot connect to the internet using my mobile as my modem, or browse my mobile using PC Suite.</p>
<p>Using the OLD PC Suite for my Nokia 6300 does not work on my new 6700, and does not casue this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENED:</strong></p>
<p>I recently recieved my new Nokia 6700 Classic.</p>
<p>I uninstalled my old version of Nokia PC Suite and used "Nokia_PC_Suite_Cleaner_7_1_1" to fully uninstall that old version, and I rebooted.</p>
<p>I installed the latest PC Suite "Nokia_PC_Suite_7_1_30_9_eng_web" as per the instructions.</p>
<p>Everything works fine.. I knew it would... except... every single two minutes my system pauses for a brief moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OBSERVATIONS:</strong></p>
<p>I have studied my Task Manager and I have observed the following...</p>
<p>- The problem will always occur whether the phone is connected or not.</p>
<p>- The problem will always occur whether PC Suite is running or not.</p>
<p>- The problem does NOT occur when PC Suite is NOT installed. - It happens EXACTLY every 2 mins after Windows login.</p>
<p>- It makes "services.exe" use 100% CPU every 2 mins - this is what's creating the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For the record...</strong></p>
<p>*Software*</p>
<p>Nokia_PC_Suite_7_1_30_9_eng_web</p>
<p>XP Professional SP2</p>
<p>McAfee Security Centre</p>

<p>2 GB RAM</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to someone’s response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faithfully,</p>

<p>I have discovered that by opening Settings -&gt; Manage Connections - then un-ticking the USB and DX-Cable connections (leaving Bluetooth ticked) will stop the system for searching for these connections every 2 mins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ridiculous that Nokia have made the software do this, as I have to keep changing those settings&nbsp;whenever I want to connect via USB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks anyway!</p>

            Hi GrannyG,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Nokia Support Discussions Forum!<br />
<br />
You can create groups of contacts by going to Menu &gt; Contacts &gt; More &gt; Groups &gt; Add. And regarding your other query, when adding other details in your contacts it will be saved only to your phone memory as this is a default function for every Nokia phone and
 took up more space than the normal file size for contacts . That is also the reason why they are deleted when you moved them to the SIM memory.

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you explain what exactly are you trying to achieve. The circular references are a warning that things may not calculate the way you want. It would more easy if you explain your exact problem that perhaps can be solved by using a non circular formula.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the looks of the formula it looks like your result is evaluating to 0 which in Date format is&nbsp;1/0/00 12:00am</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you. And yes, I did discover yesterday actually that it had to do with interations. Mine WAS on but set at 100. I read somewhere to set it to 1(on pc) and it worked and I was able to use it on my phone correctly too. So I guess beyond one iteration
 it was turning a2's "" value to zero, making it return a2 (at end of formula) which would be zero, in time format:1/0/1900 12:00 am. Thanks for checking for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And interestingly however the iterations are set on the file (on pc/mac), the file keeps the setting. Probably basic info for some experienced users but I didn't know this stuff. Glad i know now as I have uses for timestamps.</p>

<p>Hi Anand,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modern authentication in Office 365 enables authentication features like multi-factor authentication (MFA) using smart cards, certificate-based authentication (CBA), and third-party SAML identity providers. Modern authentication is based on the Active Directory
 Authentication Library (ADAL) and OAuth 2.0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default, modern authentication isn't enabled in Exchange Online and Skype for Business Online. SharePoint Online is already enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enable Exchange Online for modern authentication, please refer to this article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enable-Exchange-Online-for-modern-authentication-58018196-f918-49cd-8238-56f57f38d662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enable-Exchange-Online-for-modern-authentication-58018196-f918-49cd-8238-56f57f38d662</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gary</p>

</p><p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. The query is not about enabling&nbsp;modern Authentication for EXO. Here's my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have modern authentication enabled for EXO. I would like to know</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The authentication flow for OWA.</p>
<p>2. Does OWA, SPO browser access use access token-refresh token pair for authorization ?</p>
<p>3. <span>
As per this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Session-timeouts-for-Office-365-37a5c116-5b07-4f70-8333-5b86fd2c3c40?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 the browser or tab, or when your <strong>authentication token</strong> expires for other reasons such as when your password has been reset”.</span></p>
<p>Which is this Token ? Is this SAML token or Access-Refresh token ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. While the token is still active, if the user closes the session/closes the browser and reopens; does he have to reauthenticate with his credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>

<p>Hi Anand,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. Here are the answers:</p>
<p><strong>Question 2</strong>: If you enable modern authentication for Exchange Online (SPO is enabled by default) by setting “<strong>OAuth2ClientProfileEnabled</strong>” as “<strong>true</strong>”, the authentication mode will be same as the Office 2016
 client. It means that OWA will also use a valid refresh token.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3</strong>: from my experience, it should be Access-Refresh token.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4</strong>: no. He doesn’t have to re-authenticate with his credential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gary&nbsp;</p>
