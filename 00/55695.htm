    <title>Using XBox One with Sandstrom Freesat&#43; HD - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using XBox One with Sandstrom Freesat&#43; HD</h2>
                    
<p>I have successfully set up my XBox One + Kinect to work with my Sandstrom SHDFSAT12 Freeview+ box, but when I request a channel change the IR code is sent too quickly for the receiver to respond so if I say XBOX WATCH BBC2 it sends the correct code for channel
 102 but the receiver only shows 12-</p>

<p>When using the remote for the receiver, there is a slight lag between pressing a button on the remote and the number showing up on the screen. Is there any way of slowing down the codes sent by the XBox so that the receiver can have time to respond?</p>

<p>I have encountered this and had to change mine from the recommended speed to fast due to my Tivo box being to slow at entering the numbers. What you will need to do is go to Settings&gt; TV &amp; OneGuide&gt; Device control&gt; Cable or satellite box. On the right side
 of the screen under Advanced you should see 'IR delay', change that to the setting that suits you and see how it goes.</p>

    <title>From login screen to Spotlight keybaord shortcut - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            From login screen to Spotlight keybaord shortcut</h2>
                    When I lock my computer in Windows 10, I see the Spotlight screen. Then I press a key and the Spotlight picture slides up and brings up the login screen. Is there a way I can bring the Spotlight picture back instead of logging in? It does time out eventually
 but it would be nice to quickly force it back. Thanks.

</p><p><span>Please be inform that the Windows spotlight features like, the Windows spotlight displays a new image on the lock screen each day. The initial background image is included during installation. Additional images are downloaded on ongoing basis. The

            <p>Where is the "unhelpful" button? I obviously knew what Spotlight was before posting the question so I didn't need an explanation. I simply wanted to know if there was a way to get back to the picture after clicking a button for the login prompt. I think
 when you said "Please be inform [sic] that this feature is not available in windows [sic] 10..." that you meant it's not possible--although that was a lot to read to find that short answer. Are you also saying that changing the screen saver timeout will affect
 the Spotlight image? If that is what you're saying, it's not clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me give a little advice: Using lots of words to cover up the fact that something is not possible does not soften the blow that it is in fact not possible.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform manual restart and check if it reverts back to Windows 7. Once it is reverted back to Windows 7, run all the Windows Updates again and check if you are able to upgrade successfully or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also make sure that you haven't connected any external devices other than mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also download with the ISO. Here is the link:&nbsp; <br />

            <p>I have the <strong>same problem with my ASUS U43F</strong>. Everytime I try to update I get 0xC1900101 - 0x20017 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really frustrating. I was looking forward for update to Windows 10 but no matter what I did I got error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried:</p>
<p>- installing reserved update</p>
<p>- installing ISO update from MS site</p>
<p>- <strong>I even did Windows 7 reset to factory settings</strong> and still nothing! After about 3 hours of constant windows 7 updates I finally had all updates available for me. Then I installed latest drivers. And after all that I finally tried to update
 to windows 10. And I got the very same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was talking about new Windows 10 like 3 months before release and still I got zero, nada, none...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like this issue has been previosly mentioned in other threads (update from win 8 to 8.1) and wasnt solved to this date:</p>

            <p>I have the same error and also I tried all available methods of upgrading from Windows 7 Professional to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried about 5 times and every time with same error of&nbsp;</p>
<p>0xc1900101 - 0x20017<br />
</p>
<p>Also, gives me this message and recommend to look for, just after the first boot and appearance of Windows 10 logo :</p>
<p>SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the last try, after completion of downloading and installation by using the Windows Update, I postponed the restart from the recommended "Restart" button of the upgrading and Windows Update. I restarted manually from the Start menu. Then, I pressed F8
 to enter the Safe mode option. I boot by Safe mode to disable the the driver of graphics card ( I have ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3400 Series). Then, I restarted by Normal mode and then now I restarted from the Restart button of Windows Update to complete the
 installation process of Windows 10. Unfortunately, this disabling to graphics card driver was not enough for successful upgrading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

I have same error and I'm now frustrated from 3 days of failed tries! I think that as a compensation Microsoft should send me a product key for Windows 10 so I can make clean install.

 for Windows 7, and for Windows Server 2008 R2</span></a></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Method 2</span></b></p>
<p><span>You may also run system file checker [SFC] scan on the computer which will replace the missing or corrupt files &amp; check if the
 issue persists:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Type ‘cmd’ in the
<b>Start Search</b> box. Right click on ‘cmd.exe’ in the <b>Program list</b> and then select the option
<b>Run as Administrator</b>. </span></p>
<p><b><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Note:</span></b><span> If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></p>

            Thought problem was with Windows Update on my P.C.. However after using System Files Checker received the message : Windows Resource Protection found no integrity violations. Also used Windows Update Fix-it. After these two methods to correct what was
 thought to be a software problem, my P.C. Windows Update when instructed to Update still gives the message
<b>&nbsp;; Windows Update cannot currently check for updates because service is not running.</b>
<div><b><br />
</b>
<div>Still cannot install Zune. P.C. Operating System Windows 7</div>
<div>When installing Zune package 4.8 get the message : ' Windows 7 Portable Device Update' didn't install. Therefore I thought it a Windows Update problem , but i cannot update.Also get the error code : 0xc8000222 when trying to install Zune.</div>

    <title>How to get free app store credit with your Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to get free app store credit with your Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Everybody says that Windows 10 is great. It's the cat's meow. Well, they're wrong. Windows 10 is not better. It is designed to squeeze the lifeblood out of its users. That is its only reason for existing. Microsoft gives it away for free because they will,
 like google, make money some other way, namely by stripping you of your privacy and any rights they can infringe upon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They do this with your unintended permission so you then agree and that's great because now there's no way back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there's never a way back. It's a one way trip. Once your explicit tape is on the web, how will you get it back? This is just the same. Microsoft will track you like the NSA and with the NSA. And the NSA will track you with the help of Microsoft. Microsoft
 will monetize your information because whatever they do is technically not selling it. But they tell all your friends you just played a song and then say that you recommended it when you didn't and tell them to buy it when in fact you never wanted anyone to
 know you like that kind of music. But MS don't care they consider it all harmless. If you have a gripe there's no recourse. There's not even anyone listening. You are a sheep and you are led to the slaughter. Soylent is people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft doesn't give a hoot about you in case you didn't know. They don't know who you are and don't care to ever hear from you. What they do want is your money and your information which they can turn into money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who can blame them? It's the way of the world. Everyone wants to cash in. But make no mistake: They are NOT here to be nice to you and they will NOT be nice to you because being nice to a person is very expensive. It requires people and those things cost
 money. You are NOT worth that kind of cash especially since you didn't pay a damn thing for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft will have you thinking you need Windows 10, but the truth is that there is completely nothing new in Windows 10. Except Cortana. But that's actually not new. Also there's no reason it should be part of the OS. It should be a separate app you can
 install... um... Anywhere. Also Cortana is designed to listen to you and store EVERYTHING YOU SAY. And this info is then used to squeeze money out of you, out of your likes, your friends, your opinion, your web habits, and anything else they can squeeze money
 from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you have no opt out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Correct me if I'm wrong. Fanboys and fangirls. I will not upgrade without at least gutting the entire OS of the spy behavior. The only reason to upgrade is because the latest apps may say "Hey, you need WIndows 10 because..." followed by a reason that doesn't
 hold water. You don't need Windows 10, and all apps can run great on windows 7. Nothing new in Windows 8 or 10 is useful. Not anything. I think it would be best if someone would fork Windows 7 on Github.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short: You give up WHO you are instead of money. And you can never go back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The real price of Windows 10 is your privacy.</p>

            i agree with your recent statement and Microsoft like many other companies, are bent on earning money, and many people are conned into it, without even realising. Ive been told, there is no such thing as a free lunch, and win 10 is a classic example justifying
 that quote. however you can reduce the damage done by windows by NOT USING EXPRESS SETTINGS, because this lets apps: use your camera, access your info, access your contacts and microphone for thing like games that dont need your camera, so i believe there
 may be a background story to this, and maybe even a way to prevent this but for the meantime DO NOT UPGRADE TO WIN10

            <p>This is <strong>absolutely true</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the contrast, <em>Windows 10 is a great operating system</em> - Microsoft's being a big jerk by using it for&nbsp;stripping people of their&nbsp;privacy.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>There is a way to disable this spying, which is what I did, and use Windows 10 without all of the privacy issues.</strong></p>

            <p>Hi<b> Toli,</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>1. Did you try formatting the iPod on a different computer?</p>
<p>2. Are you the administator to the computer?</p>
<p>3. Is it Apple iPod shuffle, nano, classic or touch?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try
<span>formating on a different computer and check the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To format iPod you will have to start it in Disk Mode. Follow the instructions from the below lin:</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Putting iPod into Disk Mode:</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1363" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1363</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The first thing you will need is to plug the USB cable that connects your iPod to a computer and a
 program like iTunes. Once you have that, plug it in and see if the computer recognizes it and if you can sync with iTunes.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to refer the Apple iPod manual for reference.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            I got past all that, I tried plugging it in and it would freeze itunes on another computer so im positive its the ipod.&nbsp; It is a classic 160gb. yes i am the admin.&nbsp; I just tried disk mode format and also scanned to fix file system errors.&nbsp; added a few
 songs unplugged and the songs were there.&nbsp; normally they wouldnt.&nbsp; It also asks me to specify language twice.&nbsp; Anyways I plugged it back in to manually add more songs and unplugged and it was empty.<br />
You guys obviously don't know past that but thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem occurs when some files in the Windows Update are missing, even though the update is downloaded and extracted successfully. If the Windows update troubleshooter didn't resolve the issue, then I would suggest you to manually tries this steps and
 check:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: Stop the Windows Update service </p>
<div>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.
<ol>
<li>Open Administrative Tools from Control Panel. Open <strong>Control Panel</strong>, type
<span>administrative tools</span> in the search box, and then click <strong>Administrative Tools</strong>.</li><li>Double-click <strong>Services</strong>. <br />
<span>Note</span> If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</li><li>Click the <strong>Name</strong> column heading to sort the names in reverse order.</li><li>Find the <strong>Windows Update</strong> service, right-click it, and then click
<strong>Stop</strong>. If you are running Windows XP, find the <strong>Automatic Updates</strong> service, right-click it, and then click
<strong>Stop</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2: Delete temporary update files in the SoftwareDistribution folder </p>
<ol>
<li>Open File Explorer (in Windows 8.1 and Windows 8) or Windows Explorer (in Windows 7, Windows Vista and Windows XP).</li><li>Double-click the local hard disk where Windows is installed, typically drive C.</li><li>Double-click the <strong>Windows</strong> folder, and then double-click the <strong>
SoftwareDistribution</strong> folder.</li><li>Double-click the <strong>DataStore</strong> folder to open it, and then delete all files and folders in the folder.
<br />
<span>Note</span> If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</li><li>Click the <strong>Back</strong> button. In the <strong>SoftwareDistribution</strong> folder, double-click the
<strong>Download</strong> folder to open it, and then delete all files in the folder.
<br />
<span>Note</span> If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Step 3: Restart the Windows Update service </p>
<div>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.
<ol>
<li>Open Administrative Tools from Control Panel. Open <strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>, type
<span>administrative tools</span> in the search box, and then click <strong><span>Administrative Tools</span></strong>.</li><li>Double-click <strong><span>Services</span></strong>. <br />
<span>Note</span> If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</li><li>Click the <strong><span>Name</span></strong> column heading to sort the names in reverse order.</li><li>Find the <strong>Windows Update</strong> service, right-click it, and then click
<strong>Start</strong>. If you are running Windows XP, find the <strong>Automatic Updates</strong> service, right-click it, and then click
<strong>Start</strong>. </li><li>Close the <strong>Services</strong> window and the <strong>Administrative Tools</strong> window.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to perform an upgrade installation with the ISO using the media creation tool. Download the ISO file using the media creation tool from the following link:</p>

</p>

    <title>Internet connectivity after curing Conficker virus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr_ohio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet connectivity after curing Conficker virus</h2>
                    
<p>My Dell laptop was infected by the Conficker virus.&nbsp; I thought I had gotten rid of it by using several well-known fixes (I think it was either the Malwarebytes product, or the Sophos product).&nbsp; After getting rid of the virus, I could not connect to the internet
 via my home wireless network.&nbsp; Two days ago, if I open Internet Explorer, it says that it cannot connect.&nbsp; However, if I look at the wireless status bar in the tray, it says the computer is connected to the wireless network.&nbsp; I was also able to ping yahoo.com,
 and my Symantec antivirus software was able to use its update process to get updated virus definitions.&nbsp; I went into Internet Explorer, and reset all the settings to original.&nbsp; Once I did this, I was able to connect to google.com, and I was also able to get
 to Microsoft.com.&nbsp; However, when I tried to get the latest Windows updates, the screen went back to "Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage".&nbsp; Today, when I try to use the laptop, I cannot connect to the wireless network at all, it sits and says "acquiring
 network address" and will never connect.&nbsp; I have other laptops in the house that still connect fine to the wireless network.&nbsp; Additionally, I did try to plug the laptop into the broadband router (modem?) with the network cable, but I still had the "acquiring
 network address" issue.&nbsp; Thinking that something was corrupt with Internet Explorer, I tried FireFox, and got the message "the proxy server is refusing connections".</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions as to what to try?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>You are correct in atleast one thing in your post. That being your advice is your opinion. Apparently you did not read the OP's post very well. He/she stated that Malwarebytes has already been used. Additionally, while Malwarebytes is a good malware
 scanner, it is not conclusive. When dealing with infections containing the magnitude of changes made by conflicker virus, it is imparative that certain log files be reviewed by a trained tech. Since, as I clearly stated in my post, MS Answers does not permit
 the posting of log files, the OP has no choice but to either deal with the infections him/herself, which will more than likely result in continued problems,&nbsp; or post the issue where a real analysis can be performed. It is likely the LAN settings has been changed
 as you suggested. That appears to be the only solid advice given. Finally, unless you are personally aware of a users ability to edit a computer's registry it is never a good idea to recommend Hijack This or and other registry editor. Deleting the wrong key
 by an untrained person can cause complete computer failure. No trained tech would recommend a user edit the registry without trained supervision. Not sure where you came from or what it is with you contradicting behind me on many of my post but I am not pleased
 with it. You are obviously free to post anything anywhere but, there are unwritten rules of courtesy on forums such as this. Apparently you have never heard of them.</strong></p>

<p>The OP said:</p>
<p>I think it was either the Malwarebytes product, or the Sophos product</p>
<p>That implies to me that the OP is not sure which if either found anything.</p>
<p>I missed the part where the OP said Malwarebytes had already been used.</p>
<p>Did I say MBAM was conclusive?</p>
<p>It is not "conflicker virus" it is "conficker virus".</p>
<p>I did not ask the OP to post a log file and where are the rules that say you can't post a log file? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not contradicting behind you - people come here for advice to fix problems - and often get ideas that begin with words like "try", "maybe" "might be" and "could be". &nbsp;</p>
<p>Your advice on this topic (and others) is sometimes to have the OP take his discussion to your WWW page, join your club and try to get it solved there. &nbsp;Maybe we would like to see the issue be resolved here and learn something. &nbsp;What is your membership drive
 motivation?</p>
<p>Describe the analysis you have done on this issue or evidence do you have that the system is "obviously still infected".&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can't solve the problem here, just say "I don't have any good ideas right now - maybe somebody else can help you".</p>
<p>I did not say your advice was wrong, but it is useless in that it does not further the resolution of the problem. &nbsp; I just suggested keeping the&nbsp;discussion&nbsp;here instead of on some other planet. &nbsp;Isn't that what a community forum is supposed to be? &nbsp;If you
 can solve the problem, solve it here.</p>
<p>You have suggested in some other post to run MBAM in Safe Mode. &nbsp;That is against their recommendation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MBAM loses some effectiveness for detection &amp; removal when used in&nbsp;safe mode because the program includes a special driver which does not&nbsp;work in safe mode. Further, scanning in safe mode prevents some types&nbsp;of malware from running so it may be missed during
 the detection&nbsp;process. Additionally, there are various types of malware infections&nbsp;which target the safeboot keyset so booting into safe mode is not&nbsp;always possible. For optimal removal, normal mode is recommended so it&nbsp;does not limit the abilities of MBAM.</p>
<p>Marcin Kleczynski&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malwarebytes President and CEO</p>
<p>That might qualify for some wrong advice.</p>
<p>You also suggested when that person got error 50003 trying to run MBAM, that they then go to your WWW site and join your club to get it fixed. &nbsp;That is not required for this problem at all. &nbsp;Why don't you just fix it right here so we can all see what the
 solution is? &nbsp;I decided just to stay out of that one. &nbsp;Why does your advice always seem to contain words like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I recommend you post this issue on my free computer support forum and deal with this the proper way.</strong></p>
<p>Is this forum the unproper way and why can't we get a "<strong>real</strong>" analysis here? &nbsp;Can we only get unreal analysis here and be required to come to your place to get some real analysis? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you having a membership drive at your place or something?</p>
<p>I would like to know these solutions too, but do not want to go sign up at some other XP forum, repost the topic I already posted someplace else and be waiting for and tracking replies from different areas of the world to find a solution to a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if the Internet settings are the problem or not here, but at least I did not tell the OP to come to my join my club at my WWW site to get it fixed!</p>

<p><strong>First of all my advice does not always contain the reference to join my site. Only when the need to post log files is involved. . And, I do not need lessons on how to use MBAM. I am fully aware the recommendation to run in normal mode. I am also
 aware that most often malware processes block executable files from running in normal mode thereby preventing MBAM from scanning. The purpose of running MBAM in safe mode is that 90% of malware process are not loaded in safe mode. I only make this recommendation
 when it is apparent to me there is a malware process issue involved. This method usually corrects the issue allowing the OP to reboot in normal mode then running Hijack This for an accurate analysis. No reputable virus/malware forum which I have ever seen
 in 15 years of computer experience instructs the OP to run a malware scanner as an only resolution. Nor do they suggest using Hijack This or any other registry editor without properly trained supervision. Software programs which create log files are created
 for a reason; to properly analyze the computer.</strong> <strong>It serves no useful purpose to give the OP a half fix solution. Malware, if not properly removed will ALWAYS leave remnants leading to future problems. Malware scanners are only the beginning
 of the removal. They only touch the surface.&nbsp;<br />
</strong></p>
<strong>If you are seriously interested in learning the process of malware removal then you are in the wrong forum. This is not the place for it. This forum is primarily for what it's name says it's for; System recovery and Repair...ie,, Hardware and OS related
 issues.</strong>
<p><strong>As for the prohibition of posting log files you will have to contact Microsoft about the issue as did I since it is their forum and their rules which we are bound by.</strong><strong>The link below clearly states no log files.</strong> &nbsp;<strong>
 You can argue that issue with Microsoft and not me. But, unless, and until, log files are permitted here, I will continue to refer the OP to my site when I feel the need for log files is necessary to properly fix the issue.

<p><strong>"</strong> Hi, policechuck.</p>
<p>Logs are not analyzed at Microsoft Answers forums.&nbsp; Please see "How to get rid of Malware " for general instructions.&nbsp; The thread includes a list of security sites that provide

<p>Corrine, Microsoft MVP (Consumer Security). This posting is provided "AS IS" without warranty, and confers no rights.<strong>"</strong></p>

<p>What planet are you on where:</p>
<p>Logs are not analyzed = posting logs is prohibited.</p>
<p>I agree, this may not be the best place for interpreting a HijackThis log, I never suggested anyone do any such thing and never mentioned the registry in any post, but I can give instructions to a 12 year old girl how to do it safely and&nbsp;efficiently&nbsp;if needed.
 &nbsp;You are the one that keeps bringing up "posting log files is prohibited", but I have never asked for a log file of anything. &nbsp;Where do you get this stuff? &nbsp;I have analyzed thousands of HijackThis logs. &nbsp;If I need one to fix a problem, I will ask for one.</p>
<p>What I think you mean is: &nbsp;I don't know what is going on and maybe if I get some log files I can try to figure it out, so please come over to my site, sign up and I will see if I can spot some more things for you to try.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I never said a malware scan is the first resolution for anything. &nbsp;It is "Perform the scans and resolve any remaining issues". &nbsp; I get my system infected on purpose almost daily and every chance I get when I am trying to understand how some other system
 got infected. &nbsp;This way I can learn how to remove malware with no trial and error, no maybe, no might be, no usually and I can assure you there is nothing left over in the registry when I get done.</p>
<p>I will be happy to get my&nbsp;system&nbsp;infected, remove the malware and challenge you to search for a trace of it using whatever methods you specify when I'm done. &nbsp;Just because you ALWAY have remnants doesn't mean everybody else does. &nbsp;It just means you don't
 quite know how to remove the stuff properly, but you can learn how to do it with some practice.</p>
<p>I know what the registry looks like before I start and when I am finished with things - there are no surprises for me. &nbsp;How did the registry come into this anyway - oh, you brought it up out of some thin air somewhere.</p>
<p>If MBAM will not run, you figure out why it won't run and you make it run. &nbsp;You don't just start trying things that might work maybe or usually. &nbsp;You don't "try it in Safe Mode". &nbsp;Your MBAM recommendations contain flawed thought processes and procedures
 as a result of short sighted thinking,&nbsp;inexperience, lack of training and knowledge&nbsp;- unless you know more about it that the folks that write and maintain it. &nbsp;Do you ever visit their forums for solutions to why MBAM won't run and what to do about it when
 it won't - and why running in Safe Mode is not a good idea if you want it to be effective? &nbsp;Why give advice that you know is faulty - unless you really just don't know. &nbsp;That's okay though.</p>
<p>I did not say I was seriously interested in learning the process of malware removal - you said that. &nbsp;Malware is merely a ticklish annoyance to me - it is never a serious problem to work on. &nbsp;I just like to try to stop people with problems before they get
 off on the wrong track by following ill conceived advice - "try it in Safe Mode"? &nbsp;If you are smarter than a fifth grader, malware presents very few perplexing challenges. &nbsp;Any advice that begins with the word "try" reflects insecurity and lack of confidence
 in the advice. &nbsp;The Conficker virus is so old and boring it makes me yawn. &nbsp; I am&nbsp;surprised&nbsp;it is still around at all.</p>
<p>Why do you insist on conjuring up words, sentences and situations from your imagination. &nbsp;What comes into your eyeballs from your monitor and what ends up in your noggin seem to have a vast disparity sometimes. &nbsp;I will not contact Microsoft as you did about
 posting logs. &nbsp;I never asked for a log or posted a log, so your logic is once again flawed and does not apply to me.</p>
<p>Please just tell me what they said to save me the trouble or emailing them instead of just making stuff up or interpreting a sentence you read somewhere in some convoluted fashion. &nbsp;I really hate boring and&nbsp;inefficient&nbsp;tasks. &nbsp;Can you copy and paste a sentence
 or are you compelled to convert it into some other words that makes sense to you?</p>
<p>If you have better solutions, post them or just try to remain silent in areas where you are not sure what you are doing and just read the information. &nbsp;There are plenty of topics in many forums that I just choose to stay out of instead of offering potentially
 useless advice. &nbsp;If you have something useful to contribute that furthers the solution, then contribute. &nbsp;There is no malware removal forum here, but there is a System Repair forum so if my system is broken, I might try to find help here since that is the
 name of the forum.</p>
<p>Is English your first language? &nbsp;Maybe there is just a comprehension issue here.</p>
<p>Now why don't we just fix this silly Internet problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides&nbsp;referring&nbsp;the OP to your site, do you have any contribution to make on the subject to further the resolution?</p>

<br />
<br />1. Check the processor seating, heat sink, and the compound between the processor and the heat sink which are common causes.
<br />
<br />2. There have been a few instances where Norton/Symantec and other antivirus/security programs have caused this error.
<br />
<br />Avast could be involved in the issue directly as the cause or indirectly by masking the cause. So I would fully uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool to prevent leaving trouble causing remnants. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1 is a full antivirus.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Avast - then use the Avast Uninstall Utility - follow the instructions here

<br />
<br />3. Check with the System/Motherboard Maker's support, their online docs and drivers, diagnostics, and ask in their forums about any known issues. 
<br />
<br />4. Use all the other methods in my previous post.

                    Please can anybody tell me why i have lost all of my "logos" in favorites?&nbsp;I used to have a rather nice collection but now all i have is&nbsp;lots of&nbsp;IE logos (and a bunch of folders).&nbsp;All i can think that has changed is that i downloaded a toolbar from my
 broadband provider. I'm sure that prior to that even when Norton scanned my computer and deleted any temporary files they remained unchanged. I miss them, please help!

<span>Hi Tracy E,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Vista forum.</span></p>
<p>
<span>I think that if you do not visit the site for a prolonged period the icon gets cleared out of the internet temporary cache files. Also, if you clean out your IE temp files they can
 be removed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>To the best of my knowledge the only way to keep these permanently is to get a 3 party app that will let you keep your “Favicons”.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Try searching for one of those and see if it will work for you.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 update broke Uplay and Razer Synapse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dannguyen4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update broke Uplay and Razer Synapse</h2>
                    I recently had a Windows 10 Automatic Update on my computer, I went to open Uplay and it gave me the "Uplay has encountered an error where it cannot recover from and must shut down". I've tried everything from fresh install to re-install and updating and
 it still gives me the error. Razer Synapse just won't even open at all. This came right after the update and these two apps just won't comply. I had to restart and reset my PC where it wiped my restore points and backups. I lost all of my work and at this
 point I'm fuming with frustration. What the hell is going on and why can't I turn off automatic updates??? Everything was working fine up until the updates force themselves on my PC and suddenly something errors right after.&nbsp;

            Hi Dan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />In cases like this your first line of defense should be System Restore, so as soon as you did the Reset you should have checked that it is enabled for C with at least 5-15% disk space apportioned. <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>  When did you do the Reset?  
<br />
<br />Next I would always have  System Image backup on an external drive along with your file backup.  This way if something like this happens and System Restore cannot get you back then you can apply the image in 20 minutes and be back up and running.  For this I'd use free Macrium which works best:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br />So after Updates mess things up, you'd Restore or Reimage and then run the Hide Updates tool to check for hide the problem Updates:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off WIndows Update by setting a Metered Connection:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />There are even good reports from users now who've had them shut off for awhile and only install the Version Upgrades twice a year from the Media Creation Tool which is the most stable method anyway, and includes all previous Updates rolled in. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Blue &#34;Please Wait&#34; on Startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mandervian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue &#34;Please Wait&#34; on Startup</h2>
                    When my computer is booted up, immediately (no exaggeration) the first thing I see, is a white circle of spinning dots, and the words "Please Wait". I have looked everywhere but the solution for other people is usually to go into safe mode. I can't do
 the process in my case because I have no interaction with the screen. All I can do is manually Shut Down, and move the mouse. No icons to click, no restart icon, nothing. I've seen other cases similar to this, but either on an older version of Windows, or
 they can actually go through the normal boot up process. I would really appreciate if someone could walk me through on what I could do as I'm not very tech savvy.

            <p>Hi Mandervian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of the Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and we are happy to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Start the computer in Safe mode through Windows Recovery Environment.</p>
<p>I suggest you to refer to the section: <strong>From installation media</strong> from the following Microsoft article on
<strong>Start your PC in safe mode in Windows 10</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are in the Safe Mode with Networking then follow the below method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to manually update the
</span>Display Adapter <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">driver from the <strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following Wiki article created by Andre Da Costa on <strong>How to: Install and Update drivers in Windows 10</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists then, I would recommend you to download and install the latest display driver in compatibility mode from the manufacturer’s website.
</p>

<h2>            Impossibile modificare la privacy per i bambini</h2>
                    
<p>I miei figli sui loro tablet non possono accettare o aggiungere amici su XBOX live, ne nei giochi, poiché un messaggio dice che dovrebbero essere cambiate le loro impostazione della privacy. Recandomi nelle impostazioni&gt;Privacy mi viene spiegato che i bambini
 ovvero chi ha un account con data di nascita da minorenne deve avere il consenso di un account di un adulto. Così creo la famiglia con me adulto e i miei 2 bambini, ma non c'è verso di modificare la loro privacy. Quando vado nella pagina per la modifica
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=389397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Impostazioni della privacy per Xbox</a> vedo solo il mio gamertag, ma non quello dei miei figli quindi non posso modificare la loro privacy. Cosa sbaglio? Come devo operare?</p>

Gold sharing </a>is a feature exclusive to the Xbox one. On a 360, each individual profile would have to have its own Gold Subscription.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 IE 11 will not connect&#47;display web pages but other browsers work fine</h2>
                    <p>So I know we have the new Edge browser, but after upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10, IE 11 is still installed but does not connect to anything.&nbsp; I get a blank white screen when trying to go to any web page in IE11.</p>
<p>Edge, Chrome and Safari all work.&nbsp; IE11 now matter what web URL I try to go to does not display anything but a white page.</p>
<p>I have removed IE11 through Programs and Features, rebooted.&nbsp; Then added IE11 through Programs and Features and rebooted.&nbsp; IE11 still does not work in Windows 10.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

            It does appear that if the web page url, for example google.com, is in the compatibility view list, then I can get to that web page. &nbsp;But when I click on links to web pages not in the compatibility list they do not appear. &nbsp;I get a blank page/ white screen.

<h2>            Unable to boot into Windows - Disk Corrupted</h2>
                    <p>I have a DELL Inspiron 17R SE 7720.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was running Windows 10. A couple of weeks ago or so, I installed some Windows updates. Immediately after the update and subsequent restart, I noticed that my Disk usage started to fluctuate wildly, spiking with considerable frequency to 100% and then coming
 back down, before spiking again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to reboot my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I tried to reboot, my laptop wouldn't boot into WIndows, after a long time trying to boot up, it gave me a message saying a device is not found and I should use a recovery or repair disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Microsoft Media creation tool, I created a recovery disk on my USB and made it bootable using Rufus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my laptop, using my BIOS, I changed my boot to Legacy from UEFI, to enable a boot from USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After plugging in the USB disk, I tried booting up from there, which happened successfully, I then tried one of the repair options, i.e., trying to reset my laptop keeping the files. Unfortunately, it said that my Disk was locked and hence &nbsp;a reset could
 not be performed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the reset option again after a reboot, but I got the same error message. I then tried to bring up the command prompt with "Shift + F10" on the repair screen, and tried the following :&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>CHKDSK /R</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This reported that the Master File table is corrupt and that it was unreadable, and it would try to get it from the file system. Unfortunately, after waiting a really long time, it failed to get the Master File table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Subsequently, from the Command Prompt, I tried the following :&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>BootRec /FixMbr</strong></p>
<p><strong>BootRec /FoxBoot</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>These operations completed successfully, but as I was to find out, did not help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried the following BootRec command..</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>BootRec / ScanOs -This told me that there were 0 OS installations</strong></p>
<p><strong>BootRec / RebuildBsd - This also told me that there were 0 OS installations, and would not proceed.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought to navigate to the boot folder and rename or remove the existing boot record, in case it was locked or hidden...</p>
<p>So I tried to navigate to&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>C:\Boot </strong>- from the command prompt, but it said the file structure was corrupt and unreadable.. I got the same response if I tried to navigate to any folder on the C Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My disk was functioning normally till the time I installed those updates. I don't think it is a hardware issue, even though my laptop is 3 years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what can be done now. Apparently, there is no restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not wish to re-install Windows, I had a lot of data on the disk, which I do not wish to lose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly advise.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We&nbsp;realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with not able to boot to your system.&nbsp;We will certainly help you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As the error
</span></span>Master File table is corrupt and that it was unreadable itself states that the system files are corrupted and so you are not able to boot to the desktop. We see that you have tried all the options to recover but still the issue is not fixed and
 also there is no restore point create, so in this scenario you will need to reinstall Windows 10 again so that you can boot to the desktop again.</p>

<p>Excellent detailed post - sorry about the disk problem though.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would take the hard disk out of the laptop and connect to a working desktop computer (SATA cable) or USB3 caddy (cheap as chips).&nbsp; The former is better as there's no USB interface to complicate
 matters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then see if you can access data before rebuilding. Preferably use a (host) Windows10 computer as this has a much improved "chkdsk" for fixing disks.&nbsp; There are various utlilites you can try if you go this route.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hard disk recovery "experts" will say that the more you use the disk the worse it will get. This may be true (if its on its way out) but you have to balance that with how valuable the data is/how much you are prepared to pay to retrieve your data.</p>
