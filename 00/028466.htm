    <title>Linking a Video in PPT 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cao42812  say:</h3>
<h2>            Linking a Video in PPT 2010</h2>
                    <p>Our CEO is traveling to Europe and we are sending the PPT presentation along with 4 videos (MP4s) and will have a laptop ready to have these files (all together in a folder) to be downloaded to the laptop he will be using. The 4 videos are quite large (800MB)
 and so we thought it best to link, rather than imbed, for quality as well as stability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way we linked them was to click on an object in the slide go to "insert&gt;run program&gt;browse&gt;" and find the video file in the folder with the PPT presentation and click on it. We have tested it and this works, and launches the video. Then when the video
 is finished we hit keys "ALT/TAB" to go back to the next slide in presentation mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our questions are:</p>
<p>1) is this the best (secure) way to link the video(s)? It seems to work fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp; I tried the other way (found online) by going to insert&gt;video&gt;insert video&gt;link video"and got an error message saying
</p>
<p>"PT cannot link selected file, verify the path and file are correct, install Apple Quicktime player and restart PPT and try again"</p>
<p>Is this a better (more secure way)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I believe once they are moved the links will break and they will have to be re-linked, correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Is there a way to launch the video automatically right after slide transition?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

            <p>I suspect you meant to say you used Insert &gt; ACTION SETTING &gt; Run Program ... etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't do it that way, unless you'll be running the presentation on the same PC you created it on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, use Insert &gt; Video &gt; From File</p>
<p>Choose the video, then click the downward pointing arrowhead on the Insert button and click LINK from the popup menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you're inserting Quicktime videos, you'll need Quicktime installed on the computer in order for it to work in PPT 2010 (it's free).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So long as you put the videos in the same folder as the PPTX before linking, the links should be OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After inserting the video, and with it selected, go to the animation pane and click the PLAY animation, then in Timing, choose Start: With Previous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It'll automatically play when the slide appears.</p>

            As Steve is suggesting you need to install Quicktime to play mp4 in PowerPoint 2010 on Windows 7. If you are unfortunate enough to have 64 bit Office (not Windows) then you have a problem because 64 bit Office cannot talk to 32 bit apps (like QT). This
 is only one of the many reasons 64 bit Office is usually not a great idea!<br />

            <p>Thank you very much Steve and John,<br />
<br />
Steve -&nbsp;we followed these steps and the video starts fine, and we get audio, but no image on the screen...(is black), until we click the start button again. We don't want our CEO to have to do this...would you know why this is happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also once we get it working, and it is transferred onto a drive and then onto another PC (with windows 7) and graphics card, media players what are the chances it will or will not run? Are we playing too much of a gamble here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>John, we are not running it through Quicktime, but through another reliable player called VLC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again to both of you!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Which steps? &nbsp;Mine or your original ones? &nbsp;;-) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt; Also once we get it working, and it is transferred onto a drive and then onto another PC (with windows 7) and graphics card, media players what are the chances it will or will not run? Are we playing too much of a gamble here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, video in PPT (and in general) is something of a game of chance when you have to move it from one PC to another. &nbsp;If at all possible, TEST on the actual hardware that'll be used. &nbsp;Ideally, give the CEO a lightweight laptop to use,
 one you can test everything on first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt; John, we are not running it through Quicktime, but through another reliable player called VLC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've linked according to my suggestion, you're going through QuickTime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that might help is to convert the video to WMV, which is more universally playable under Windows (though not on Mac).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also convert the entire presentation to a movie and let the boss just play that. &nbsp;How well it works depends somewhat on what's in the presentation, but it's worth considering. &nbsp;I resorted to this when I had to send a presentation to a friend
 in Japan, where it was going to be played on a Windows PC by someone of unknown skill levels. &nbsp;That's all I knew, so a movie seemed to be the least demanding approach. &nbsp; Worked like a charm.</p>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We followed <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">your</span> instructions to link the video</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Instead, use Insert &gt; Video &gt; From File</p>
<p>Choose the video, then click the downward pointing arrowhead on the Insert button and click LINK from the popup menu."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I said we aren't using quicktime I meant we are running the video with VLC...although is QuickTime running in the background?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes as I said it starts but we only hear audio, and the screen is black. We then have to click the run button to get it to show the visual screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is wrong with doing it the original way I explained through ACTION and RUN PROGRAM? Is is because the links break when moved to a new laptop where they don't via the method you described?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the issue with converting the entire thing to a movie is that one has to present the timings and we wouldn't know how much time he needs on each slide...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will mention the WMV to the videographer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            How to start Voice Command in HTC HD2</h2>
                    Windows mobile 6.5 in the HD2 seems not to have the button allocation program which would allow a button, say "phone", to be used to fire up the speech.
<div>So how do I do this please?</div>

<p><em>Yes mate - this works with most shortcuts too!<br />
<br />
With file explorer, go to \Windows\Start Menu\Programs and copy the voice dialer shortcut. Go back a couple of levels to the \Windows folder and paste it there. Locate the shortcut (should be at the very bottom of the file list) and rename it to long_send<br />
<br />
That shortcut gets executed when you hold the call send button, and like I said, you can do it with most shortcuts.<br />
<br />
Works for me</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>unfortunate with the abysmal rating of the new app (&lt;1.5 star) on apple store, Skype is not going to gain any meaningful new users no matter what minor cosmetic change you are trying to sell here.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
I don't know whether the team behind this NEW SKYPE has realized, that users who indulge themselves on SNAP, IG and KIK will not invest time on the NEW SKYPE just because it now has "me-too" features. To convince them to use NEW SKYPE, you have to convince
 all their friends, family, their followers and the followings to ditch IG SNAP etc and move to SKYPE, that is IMPOSSIBLE, I repeat IMPOSSIBLE. I know it's harsh but sometimes you just have to accept where you are now. So please stop dreaming about the NEW
 SKYPE will become the next "social" thing, it's not go going to happen. I'd suggest you guys to focus on how to retain the old user base which is in serious jeopardy now. This NEW SKYPE experiment is a disaster and doomed to fail, you guys need to act fast
 before it's too late.&nbsp;

<p>Dear KatL. and anyone from Skype who might be interested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Skype since it's inception. I use it as my preferred tool to communicate with primarily, business colleagues, new businesses and close friends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have sung old Skypes praises to the skies to whomsoever would listen as the only genuine alternative to normal telephonic communications. My children, their friends and associates similarly use Skype as the preferred "serious" means of communicating with
 each other and us, despite also being subscribed to snap chat, facebook, etc. etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>This new update destroys all that Skype stood for such that practically everyone i have subsequently spoken to on this subject is dismayed and disgusted at this most recent development to the point where there is now an active exploration of any sort of
 comparable programme that can be used to replace the now horrible Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft want to try to jazz Skype up, fine. But keep the older version of Skype operable as an alternative&nbsp; programme and see how they compare. By ramming this abortion of Skype down everybody's throats, they will have lost and will continue to lose
 a large number of loyal customers and it's doubtful that they will attract many fans from the other existing and well established and better products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft and Skype, if you have any sense you will take note. These are the vastly majority views that are being expressed in just about every forum discussing this topic.

                    When attempting to create a new document in Publisher I am having trouble inserting a Text Box. When I click on "Draw Text Box" I get the cross-hair and when I attempt to Draw the text box, the BOX travels to the extreme left of my screen far from the
 document I am trying to create. I have used Publisher for years and I have never seen this issue. I have run the online repair, uninstalled/reinstalled, checked all the Options &amp; settings. No matter what I do I cannot fix this issue. Please help. Thanks

<h2>            How to simplify the inbox </h2>
                    
<p>Hello. I have recently upgraded from Windows Mail (Vista) to Outlook 2010 (Vista). (I have Office Home &amp; Student 2007).&nbsp; I would like to simplify my inbox so that it does NOT show the day of the week received and does NOT give the two or three first lines
 of the email.&nbsp; I.e., I would like my inbox simply to show each email in one line only, just like my simple Windows Mail inbox did.&nbsp; Is there any way to do this?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Iggy&nbsp; :)</p>

<p>Thank you, Guruprasad. I was able to remove the day-of-the-week view with your suggestion;&nbsp; however, I am still receiving my emails with a preview of the first two or three lines of the contents of the email. My inbox looks cleaner now; but, is there any
 way to set the inbox to only show sender/subject/date like the old style?</p>

            I have different problem and don't want to create a new topic. When I receive mails, I read them and delete and the last deleted email stays on the preview, so the inbox is empty but still I have a preview, so I have to close and open a program again,
 any suggestions? New install and my old mails imported form .pst file if it helps...

<h2>            Executable file found in programData file.</h2>
                    <p>OK, I am currently in a bit of trouble with a small virus on my system: I'm not entirely sure what it's trying to do, but I know that cmd flashes open every now and then, which coincides with about four different runtimes of "Microsoft Register Server" opening,
 aswell as an attempted scam site opening if I'm using the internet. (Such as "placetree", "clickintoday", "adexchangeprediction" -Currently reading these from my history tab-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'm in the process of removing it, and I was wondering if it is usual for any program to leave an executable inside the "programData" folder.
<br />
Location is C:\ProgramData\{D47F187E-63D4-AFD5-47A0-4CDFD1DC78FA}</p>
<p>File is called 4EE46C43-F94F-DBE8-A20F-D72CB41D0AC7.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got any ideas?</p>

<h2>            How do I stretch the type to fit the insert Word Art box as I could with my previous Office product&#63;</h2>
                    I make a lot of signs and really liked the feature that let you stretch your typeface wider or taller. I can't do that with Office 10 -- at least I haven't found a way. Can I? I hate having to guess what size would look best to fill the space. Also, I
 would like to shrink the space between lines of type or reduce the space between words. I used to be able to do that with previous Word programs. Is there a way to do that with Office 10?

            <p>Much of the functionality you're asking for is on the Character Spacing tab of the Font dialog or in the Line Spacing area of the Paragraph dialog, but in the case of WordArt, if you use Text Effects | Transform and
 apply the Square transform, you may find you have more flexibility in shaping the text.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 AND Windows Phone 8.0 issue after HERE Maps offline maps update</h2>
                    <p>Earlier today a message prompted on my Windows Phone 8.0 screen (a Lumia 625 handset) asking if I would like to update my offline maps. After the update was done, I requested my Windows 8.1 HERE Maps app to do the same, but something happened and the app
 crashed alongside with the Store app. I managed to repair my Windows 8.1 Store app by creating a new Cache folder, as detailed elsewhere (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/wshostexe-store-broker-is-taking-up-75-of-my-cpu/aa135e7c-f5f0-4016-b88a-ea250bdd54e3">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/wshostexe-store-broker-is-taking-up-75-of-my-cpu/aa135e7c-f5f0-4016-b88a-ea250bdd54e3</a>),
 and to reinstall my Windows 8.1 HERE Maps app.</p>

</p><p>But something also happened to my Windows Phone 8.0 and&nbsp;its&nbsp;HERE Maps app no longer runs, neither let me change my maps settings under the Settings app, always rebooting my phone when I try to open HERE Maps or the maps settings. What can I do about it?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Renata,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not a HERE Maps apps issue, I think it was caused by it, but it's actually a Windows 8.1 and a Windows Phone 8.0 issue. After the offline maps update, both HERE Maps apps crashed, but ALSO the Windows 8.1 Store and Windows Phone 8.0 Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to solve the Windows 8.1 Store issue because I have access to the file folders, a solution outlined in the forum thread I've cited above, and then I managed to reinstall the HERE Maps app and the Windows 8.1 issue seems to be solved. But the Windows
 Phone 8.0 issue isn't solved yet, and I have no idea how to solve it. For example, I uninstalled the HERE Maps app from my Windows Phone 8.0 and tried to access (Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Maps), but the phone keeps rebooting whenever I try to access those
 settings or, when installed, when I try to access&nbsp;the HERE Maps app. It's a Windows Phone 8.0 issue, related to the offline maps I've downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It makes no sense for me to contact HERE Europe B.V. about this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gabriel</p>

            <p>[Update]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some reviews of HERE Maps app on Windows Phone Store, at least the Brazil's version of the Store, also complain about HERE Maps app and Windows Phone crashing and rebooting after the&nbsp;last offline maps update. The same issue as mine&nbsp;is happening: when trying
 to open HERE Maps app or the maps settings (Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Maps) the phone freezes and reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've already&nbsp;stated,&nbsp;the issue&nbsp;was caused BY the last offline maps update, but it's not an issue restricted to the HERE Maps app.</p>

            <p>[Update 2]</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Foursquare app received&nbsp;an update today and while trying to run the app my phone crashed and rebooted. I can't confirm it's a Foursquare app issue, because I haven't used it since the offline maps update, but I remember the&nbsp;Foursquare app used to use
 the phone's offline maps at the top of the app to show my current location. Anyway, I think it's an OS issue related to the offline maps installed (and which I can't uninstall).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is another unanswered question regarding this entire issue: how can an app have access to system files in a way it can lead the system to crash and reboot? As far as I knew, apps weren't allowed to access system files, at least not in this way.</p>

            <p>the nokia class of apps are slightly different than say, a regular developer apps. For instance, they are the only ones (other than microsoft) who have a full featured music player on the phone. It is quite possible that they have additional access, which
 is not all that surprising considering the close developer relationship between MS and Nokia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Returning to the issue, at this point, it looks like you are heading towards a phone reset to get the phone working normally.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the app is indeed causing issues across the board, then the app developer (Here Maps) will investigate and push a fix soon enough.

            <p>Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue was caused by the offline maps. There is no way for me to try to update or delete them, because they crashed not only the HERE Maps app, the Foursquare app and, just now, the Facebook Messenger app, but they also crashed the maps settings, under
 Windows Phone's settings (Settings &gt; Applications &gt; maps). Furthermore, as far as I know, I'm not the only one having trouble with it, but it seems I'm the only having this issue who knows about this forum. So, if resetting my phone is the only alternative,
 it's a terrible one, not just because I'll spend some time on it when I wasn't planning to do so, but also because most people having this issue won't know about this one and only solution to their issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a customer, I think Microsoft should have&nbsp;a better way to solve this kind of issue if the goal is to&nbsp;secure a third or a second place in phone's market share.</p>

    <title>Cannot resize browsing window when inserting pictures in Word 2016... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandra buskey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot resize browsing window when inserting pictures in Word 2016...</h2>
                    <p>When I insert a picture into a <strong>Word 2016</strong> document and click on
<strong>Pictures</strong>, the resulting browsing window nearly fills the screen when it opens and I cannot make it smaller. &nbsp;The little sizing double-arrows (<strong>&lt;--&gt;</strong>) appear at both sides and the bottom (<em>but not the top</em>) of the window,
 but are ineffective. &nbsp;Also, I can't move the window by dragging the top of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no <strong>Minimize</strong> or <strong>Restore</strong> <strong>Down</strong> option at the top of the window, only the
<strong>Close</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>X</strong>) option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens whether the document is <strong>Maximized</strong> or <strong>Restored Down</strong>, which in the second case means it covers other work I have open at the time. &nbsp;I don't necessarily want the window to fill
<em>ALL</em> of the screen, as sometimes I want to see what's "behind" it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't have this problem with Word 2013 - is this something new? &nbsp;Is it a Windows 10 (which I use) vs. Windows 8.1 issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do so I can resize the window?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time...</p>

<p><span>I would like to suggest you ensure you are

</span><span>you can control which Office software your users can download and install from Office 365.</span><span> You can click Software download settings under Office software or search settings directly in the search bar.</span></p>

    <title>Spam in Outlook email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cbyfan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spam in Outlook email</h2>
                    Ok so what did Microsoft change recently with this?? All of a sudden a bunch of spam is going to my Inbox instead of my junk folder that never used to. What is the point of having a junk folder if your system can't tell the difference. They are the same
 type of spam that I get occasionally but now your junk filters are broke. So you changed something. Stop fixing things that aren't broke just for the sake of changing things :|

            While I appreciate any help and suggestions that have been given, I also have to point out that everything has been pointed back to myself and other users and the original question (What did Microsoft/Outlook change to cause all this?) has not been addressed.
 I personally have not had to access those settings and filters in years, so I changed nothing but all of a sudden this starts happening. So I'll look at my settings but the bigger issue lies with Microsoft, not its users.

<h2>            Get my data since 2011</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Skype since 2011 and I would like to download all the conversations that I've ever had. I used Skype with different computer over the time and I can't figure out how to get all my conversations. I suppose that Microsoft is somehow saving that in
 databases.</p>
<p>I can't see old messages when using my own Skype client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi ErwanM1
<br />
<br />Skype only stores data from the last 2 years, any data prior to that will not be recoverable . .. 
<br />
<br />To get all data stored by Skype, including chats, history . . . etc. click the link below and follow the provided steps:

<h2>            Bing Ads</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>At the managment dashboard of Bing Webmaster we have a big orange link on top saying that we can use 100 Credits for ads in Microsoft Advertising. We would like to test that, something different (beyond Google PPC) but once clicked the page keeps loading
 forever.<br />
</p>
<p>Any suggestions ?<br />
</p>
<p>Ps:1 The advertising will focus on the account of the website : https:// www dot heckbuy.com</p>
<p>Ps2: We are reffering to the orange spinner that loads forever.</p>
<p>Ps3: Does Microsoft has something similar to Shopping Ads of Google ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
HeckBuy Team</p>

<p>Hi Heckbuy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response! The promotional offer will not automatically show within your Microsoft Advertising account. The link you are seeing within Webmaster Tools will either give you the code to input into your account or it will send the code via
 email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check your email to see if the promotional code was sent there inadvertently without notification from Webmaster Tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did not receive an email and you are still having trouble redeeming the promotional code from Webmaster Tools, please check your private messages on how to move forward with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>

<h2>            Lifeblog now showing all copied items after sync with N95 8gb.</h2>
                    N95 8gb. Lifeblog 2.5.224. Win Vista Ultimate 64bit.<br />
<br />
I have lifeblog installed on my PC, and when I sync my phone, the phone shows the pc is downloading my messages and images, but when I start lifeblog on the PC they are not there. There are some older items from a previous sync, but none of the new ones. When
 I manually copy new items from the phone, the program advises there are no new items.<br />
<br />
Lifeblog on the phone shows all my items without any problems.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.

<h2>            Problem connecting to a 169.254.1.1 network</h2>
                    Using both my older HP rw6815 and my newer HTC Touch Cruise, they failed to connect to my WLAN at home (which works fine with any other device). It seems that the cuplrit was my LAN Ip setting - I had 169.254.1.1 for the router and DHCP above 169.254.1.100.
 With this, the PDAs (Win Mobile 5.0 and 6.1, respectively) did not connect with any security setting (Unencrypted, WEP 64- and 128-bit, WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK) for 2 different routers (Linksys WRT54G and NETGEAR WNR834b v2). Once I changed to 192.168.1.1, it
 worked fined for all the mentioned configs. This is just a heads-up in case somebody else encountered this problem and did not know how to solve it.

            192.168.1.1 is IP address used by several router manufactureres as default address for the router itself.
<br />
<br />
This address is mostly used by Linksys routers as well open-source linux-based firmwares that are compatible with Linlsys routers. As a consequence 192.168.1.1 is likely to be set as default gateway on computers connected to the router.
<br />
<br />
http://192.168.1.1 also usually contains web-interface that controls router's configuration. If you are unable to access this address it's likely that you have some kind of network configuration problem.

            Ehm, I don't mean to be nasty or anything, but you are clearly talking about something completely different. I know how to configure my router AND the attached devices alike (in fact, I have DD-WRT running on a Linksys WRT54G), this is not the problem.
 Again, you set your network up with a subnet of 169.254.1. EVERYTHING WORKS fine (desktop PC with fix IP on the subnet, several laptops and an iPhone on DHCP, VPN, SSH, port forwards, you name it).&nbsp; Then you try with a windows mobile device (see above for
 exact models), and it DOES NOT CONNECT. It refuses to do it, no matter what encryption your network uses (no encryption, WEP, WPA, whatever). Then you say "ah". You change the whole network over to the 192.168.1.x subnet (but for that matter, it could probably
 be anything, I think it was only with the 169.254.x.x subnet that it was having problems), and everything works - including the windows mobile devices. The only reason I posted this was that I did not find any sign of this on the web

<h2>            Calendar Control in Excel 2010</h2>
                    I have several spreadsheet applications that use the Calendar control in a UserForm. Once I transitioned to version 2010, they caused an error: Microsoft Forms -- "Could not load an object because it is not available on this machine". I tried locating
 it in Addional controls but it is not in the list. I am also running Access 2010 (if that makes a difference). When I look at my UserForm, the Calendar control has been removed. Is there a way to use the Calendar control in version 2010 or must I resort to
 the DTPicker? I am not the end user of these apps.

<br />Chats in Skype are instant text messages you can send to single contacts or groups of contacts.
<br />
<br />When you call a contact from skype to skype you are connected through voice chat until one of you ends the call.
<br />Calls can also be between skype and cellular phones or mobile phones which can cost a fee depending on the location and the Skype version.
<br />
<br />I hope this is answering your question.
<br />
<br />Greetings,
<br />Manuel

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Sorry I missed that:
<br />The chat also works as some kind of "action log".
<br />The chat displays when someone goes into away/dnd, when you miss a call or the call duration with the specific contact.
<br />
<br />Greetings,
<br />Manuel
