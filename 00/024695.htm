<h2>            Problems syncing SBCGlobal.net Calendar&#47;Contacts with desktop Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have a client that insists on using her SBCGlobal.net account to manage both her Calendar (meaning "Meetings") and Contacts. &nbsp;She needs to "connect" the Calendar and Contacts with her desktop Outlook 2016. &nbsp;In other words, they need to sync together -
 if she makes a change in one, it needs to be reflected in the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the ICS route (importing a file), but it didn't catch everything that was on SBCGlobal.net. &nbsp;I know there's also the concept of "Subscribing" to that calendar (the SBCGlobal.net one), but I can't find a good explanation, step-by-step on how to
 do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wayne</p>

            <p>Visit https://calendar.yahoo.com/. At the left, under "My Calendars", click your name. Choose Share. Select "Generate links". Copy the link in the "To import into a Calendar app".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook 2016, click File&gt;Account Settings&gt;Account Settings. Select the Internet Calendars" tab and click New. Paste the link into the text box. Remove anything at the end after the ".ics" string. Change the "https" at the front to "webcal". Click Add.
 That should add the Yahoo calendar to Outlook 2016.<br />

            <p>Well, I am definitely running into problems with your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I think you're partly right about "how" to get that ICS link, but when I click on the link in "To import into a Calendar app", it explicitly says that this is really just a one-way link. &nbsp;I need a link where I can both view and add and possibly edit calendar
 entries - regardless of whether I'm on the web our Outlook - and have those changes show up in both places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I did try your way, but it made a separate calendar from what Outlook had. It would be good if Outlook would "absorb" the SBC Global Calendar and incorporate its contents and any changes made to it. &nbsp;So what I wound up with was a blue calendar on the
 left and a green calendar on the right (which I assumed was the SBC Global calendar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>See why I'm trying to "merge" these calendars - so that my client sees only one calendar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) What about bringing Contacts into Outlook? &nbsp;Is it done in a similar fashion?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your help, but I just need a little tweeking to get this right.</p>

            The best you can do with contacts is to export them on one service and import them to the other. This, too, is static. Yahoo simply does not support calendar and contact synching with another service.

            <p>OK, I'll accept that 'Contacts' can only be exported - not dynamically kept in sync - but what about my first problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I follow your advice for the SBC Global Calendar and try to put in that ICS address, I now get an error message that says: "Task 'Internet Calendar Subscriptions' reported error (0x80004005): 'The operation failed.'" &nbsp;That comes up in a little box and
 no calendar is created.</p>

            I had no trouble following the steps I outlined and my Yahoo calendar shows up just fine in Outlook 2016 and it's updated every send/receive interval. Apparently it's not a one-time import. However, that it's not a two-way sync. You can't add anything
 to the calendar from Outlook 2016.

    <title>VBA can&#39;t close form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertbonds  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA can&#39;t close form</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to use VBA to close a form and then delete it...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.Close acForm, "frmHome", acSaveNo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DoCmd.DeleteObject acForm, "frmHome"<br />
</p>
<p>...but the 2nd line above triggers an error message that "frmHome" can't be deleted while it's open.&nbsp;If I add a&nbsp;test to be sure that ALL forms in the database are closed before the deletion,&nbsp;e.g. ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.Close acForm, "frmHome", acSaveNo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Application.Forms.Count = 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.DeleteObject acForm, "frmHome"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
</p>
<p>...the delete line does execute (which proves no forms are open), but I get the same error message -- that "frmHome" can't be deleted while it's open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The form is in a single-user database file, so it's not shared. It is a front end that links to&nbsp;tables in a&nbsp;back-end file... which I mention just in case it's relevant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I cancel my delete request&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, several days ago I requested my account to be deleted. Skype told me that it will take 30 days for my account to be deleted. But I decided it's best if I keep it, because I realized I need it for more than a month. So I don't want to delete it anymore.
 When I click "Cancel the request", it wants me to go to my google account and fill the blank with a code I received on my google account. It's impossible to do because I've closed that Google account months ago. What do I do? Will my Skype account be deleted
 in 30 days? &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c40df78-0d36-4992-b3a3-238a2f7653af?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c40df78-0d36-4992-b3a3-238a2f7653af?upload=true" /></a>

    <title>Create a login authentication in MS Access 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> akr_89  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create a login authentication in MS Access 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am new to Access and I have a couple of questions. I have the following Users and Tables.
</p>
<p>Tables - ItemList, Prices</p>
<p>UserA [Admin - All tables] </p>
<p>User_Manager [User - Access to Prices table]</p>
<p>User_Assistant [User - Access to ItemList]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to be able to do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Create a login when opening Access and give rights to specific users for the tables specified above]. The user authentication should display as soon as Access is opened.</p>
<p>b) I am connecting SQL server to Access. When connecting a table, all the columns are visible and the data is modifiable. Is there a way to display only a few columns to the user and also make sure the data cannot be modified through the table in Access.
 I am creating a form to give rights to modify table data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help as soon as possible would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

</p><p>Side note, Users should not have access to the tables.&nbsp; You can control what they see based on the above link with the use of Forms.&nbsp; Using Forms you will be able to accomplish what you want though you may have to make some changes should the User be above
 average.&nbsp; In that event they will find their way to the tables... however, the average User will be much happier with the Forms as they present the data in a more User friendly environment.</p>

            <p>Too big of a topic to cover in one post, but a few keywords to help you focus your learning curve:</p>
<p>* SQL Server can (and should, in most cases) run with Windows Authentication where access is granted based on membership in certain Active Directory groups that you have given certain access to the server, the database, and the database objects.</p>
<p>* One advantage is that there is no username/password dialog: users are authenticated by logging into their Windows workstation and that authentication carries through to the&nbsp;SQL Server.</p>
<p>* To allow access to only certain columns (or certain rows, for that matter), you can link to a View rather than a Table, and this view only has the desired columns.</p>
<p>* Unless you are a very experienced&nbsp;programmer you don't want a form to give rights; rather you put people in certain Active Directory groups (e.g. Administrators, Assistants) and they get the rights given to those groups.</p>

            <p>Please see my blog article on Login Security. it illustrates techniques for creating a login and using it to apply different access levels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for SQL Server, As Tom noted, the better option is to create Views and link your forms to those Views. Also applying your security on the &nbsp;SQL Server side is more secure than using Access. But your DBA should be doing that.</p>

<h2>            SiriuCE on New AT&#38;T Tilt</h2>
                    
<p>Has anyone been able to get the SiriuCE software to work on the new AT&amp;T Tilt?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm new to Windows Mobile. But when I tried to install SiriuCE 2.0, it gave me an error. So, I tried installing SiriuCE 1.6.&nbsp;The login interface seems to function, as it pulls up the validation block from the Sirius authenticator/login. WMP
 opens...but it doesn't start playing the music.</p>

<p>ok I have the tcpmp media player....I still can't get SiriuCE to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will the other geekstoolbox sirius wm5 work on a WM6 device?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's interesting that the device actually came preloaded with software/player for XM satelite radio, and I'm having such a time getting Sirius to be able to play. With the merger going through I wounder if that will have an effect.</p>

            This doesn't quite answer my question.
<div><br />
<div>When I login to Exchange Online, I have a plan which costs 6 USD a month which is called "Microsoft Office 365 (Plan P1). This plan is not shown in the compare section you sent me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>On the link we have:</div>
<div>1. Hosted Email (Exchange Online): 4 USD</div>
<div>2. Office 365 Small Business: 6 USD</div>

<div><br />
<div>Additionally, there is the afore mentioned:</div>
<div>4. Microsoft Office 365 (Plan P1)</div>

<div>As you see in the linked image below, I currently have one subscription plan for the "4. Microsoft Office 365 (Plan P1): 6 USD/user/month" and I have ZERO for the "2. Office 365 Small Business".</div>

<p>Yes, exactly the question I have. I have 2 $6/month subscriptions to (Plan 1) and it looks like I should cancel them and get 2 $60/year subscriptions to Office 365 Small Business if the latter is&nbsp;essentially the same service but under a different name.&nbsp;
 So, what exactly is the difference, or are the two plans offering exactly the same service but under a new pricing structure?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The original poster's question was very simple and I don't know why it is so hard for&nbsp;MS to answer it.<br />

<h2>            Outlook not pulling new emails</h2>
                    <p>I have Outlook 2013 and have not had an issue until 2 days ago.&nbsp; My emails are not being pulled into the inbox on my PC.&nbsp; I get the emails on my Galaxy S5, but not on the PC or surface pro 3.&nbsp; Here is where it gets funny... If I send an email from the PC,
 Surface or phone, the email shows up in the sent folder on all devices, but still won't pull new emails.&nbsp; I have checked port settings, set up new accounts and still nothing.&nbsp; If anyone has any info for me, I would appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Michael!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the steps you tried, It looks like you've tried almost everything.&nbsp; But you can also try this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Try to access control panel and look for Mail(Outlook 2013)</p>
<p>* Choose to view profiles and create a new profile.&nbsp; Doing this step will appear that it is the first time you'll setup your email to outlook. (you may want to take note the server information including the port numbers and if with or without SSL/TLS) and
 authentication for outgoing server</p>
<p>* As soon as you're done creating a new profile, set it as a default and relaunch outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If these steps work, It could be a corrupted profile and to finish the steps, you may want to export any local folders, contacts and calendars from the older profile and import it to the new profile (could be done under file menu of your outlook)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that these steps work! Cheers!!</p>

            <p>Easiest way to do this is to open the Character Map from the Start Menu. Then either browse in the font "Arial" or "Arial Unicode MS" to copy your characters from and paste them in your subject.</p>
<p>Not all mail clients my properly interpret these characters though so test before sending. In general, you should be ok for email between Outlook clients.</p>
<p>Also note that by using too many of these characters, you might generate the reverse effect. When people are annoyed by it, they might directly press the delete button.</p>

            Dear Dorothy ,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />This is a scam. Please report this email. 
<br />
<br />I understand that this is frustrating to receive lots of spam and unwanted emails. It is even more frustrating to receive scams, spoofing and phishing emails. Scammers nowadays are using multiple methods to intimidate users.
<br />
<br />There are couple of ways to deal with scammers and unwanted emails (I am sure that you are aware of some and you are using them, but maybe additional information in support articles will help you):
<br />
<br />1. First of all check your spam filters and see suggestions on how to keep spam out of your inbox <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-keep-spam-and-junk-email-out-of-your-inbox-in-outlook-com-a3ece97b-82f8-4a5e-9ac3-e92fa6427ae4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-k...</a>
<br />2. Report the phishing, spam and unwanted emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />3. Add emails or domains to block sender (those that were actually used to send emails - see #5) list <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-senders-or-unblock-senders-in-outlook-com-afba1c94-77bb-4f50-8b85-057cf52f4d5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-...</a>
<br />4. Create specific rules for subjects or common phrases that are present in those emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-in...</a> and add conditions, that are common for those emails, for example additional keywords, recipient address includes etc.
<br />5. Nowadays some scammers have learned how to mask their emails addresses that you can see in the emails. However, in the message source you will find the real one (and the real domain) In order to view message source please check this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiving-email-from-blocked-senders-in-outlook-com-265923a0-b52c-4157-92c8-370385215da1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiv...</a>
<br />
<br />Also read this information about fighting junk emails from Postmaster for Outlook <a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/junkemail.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.co...</a>

<br />
<br />Hope this will help your email free from Junk!

<p>Thanks so much for your thorough reply. You were absolutely right. Just now I got through to a Microsoft operative and gave him the same information and he said it was bonified and from Microsoft, he gave me a route to check out my outlook log ins. When
 I got to my account again I thought since its bonified I'll press the button to check out what the message says. And there was a block on it from Virgin who had identified it as containing matter that could adversely affect my computer. So you were right and
 the operative on this occasion wasn't, though the connection he gave me to check out my signing in history was fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again many thank for your helpful information.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t get into Bios to change boot sequence - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> singy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t get into Bios to change boot sequence</h2>
                    <p>I know that pressing F12 on my Dell Inspiron 530 is supposed to get me into the bios--I've done it hundreds of times prior to now, but it does not work for me now. Isn't there any other way I can get into the Bios so I can change boot sequence to the cd
 drive? I've had suggestions to hold the shift key down when restarting, to shut down and wait ten seconds and then press F10, but it does not work. Short of reinstalling the system--and I'm not sure it wasn't the July build update of Win 10 that started this--I
 don't want to reinstall and find the same problem. Again, isn't there any other way to get into the bios on this machine when F12 does not work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all the suggestions made to this point--none of them work. It's hard to believe there is no way to bypass F12 to get into the bios, but apparently that is the case.</p>
<p>Thanks to those of you who offered suggestions.</p>

            <p>I assume you mean that you have turned off Fast start.&nbsp; There isn't really anything else that can interfere with these special keys as Windows has not even started to load at the time that they are valid [which is only whilst the Dell logo is on screen at
 startup].</p>
<p>
</p><p>F12 should take you to the boot options menu on a Dell.</p>
<p>F2 should take you to the&nbsp;BIOS on a Dell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are neither of these keys working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the Dell logo screen on starting the computer display the normal message in the bottom / top right-hand corner telling you what F2 and F12 do?&nbsp; Or is it just the Dell logo without any message being displayed, without anything else at all?</p>

<h2>            nokia 3110 classic micro sd problem</h2>
                    hi to all 3110c users! i have a question. i've been using my nokia 3110c for 2 months. I have a Kingston 2gb micro sd . At first week of using, it works fine but nowadays, I have a restarting problem with it. When my phone is low in battery, i starting
 to have restarting problems and when i update my music player, my phone also restarts and starts for 5 times. Today, i almost consumed my 2gb microsd card and I used 1.5 gig of it. Can you help me to solve this restarting problem? I've been reading the discussions
 there but im not sure what will i do first. Will i update my firmware version to 5.50 because i only have ver. 5.01 or I will exchange my memory card? Pls, experts, help me for this problem. Thanks.

            Try deleting as much as possible that you don't use from the memory of the phone itself (junk graphics/tones/clip-art/themes etc). Either back it up somewhere and get rid, or shift it onto the SD card itself if you really need it.<br />
<br />
I had the same problem with the 3109c, and doing that made it a lot more stable. I guess the phone reads stuff from the SD card into its local memory to access it, and if your phone memory is stuffed full then it has a wobble...

            Hey All,<br />
I too had this issue with Nokia 3110. One resolution for that issue I found is like,<br />
1. PLEASE KEEP ALL UR SONGS UNDER "Music" folder in the SD Card.<br />
2. DELETE ALL SUBFOLDERS OF "Music" Folder.<br />
<br />
The device wont get that much task for updating the Music Library next time.

            yes, there are lots of such problems with 3110 classic on forums i visited and i also got it<br />
<br />
problem is simple:<br />
low batery, actualization of music library on microsd card, running on it applications, etc.<br />
and nokia restarts, flashes and turns off - no mater what firmware, so updating to 5.50 wont solve it<br />
<br />
people are sayin its faulty nokia series, i'm sure nokia knows about it, i heard ppl sending e-mails to them and still no solution<br />
i also heard visiting "Nokia Care" services may solve problem, and it might be free with warranty<br />
<br />
and of course there is simple solution ;-) - dont use microsd, what is hilarious with 9mb memory inside :-/

            Hi,<br />
I bought 3110c few months ago. With first music compilation everything was allright. After I deleted first music compilation from MicroSD (1GB) and loaded a new one, I found all the problems mentioned here - don't recognize mp3 files, hangs up while updating
 library, after pressing "start play" should wait for 2-3 minutes, during that phone freezes totally.<br />
Guys in the Mobile shop warned me that 3110c don't even recognize SD cards above 1GB, and the phone could hang up. But analyzing your and other posts it sounds like 3110c can't even handle 1GB. May be it could help to try 512MB card ?<br />
From other side it should be buggy Nokia software problem, bcs my 3110c can't update media library even without SD card - it shows 200-300 files w/o card !!!<br />
After 2 library updates I couldn't more power off the phone (only by taking off the batt.)

            dear all....<br />
<br />
even you changed ur sd to a lower 512mb,the problem still exist coz i have 512mb sd memory and had the same problem.<br />
the solution is as following :-<br />
<br />
1- rename the files that has numbers or sympols (1..@...ect.)to names do not have num. or symbols.<br />
<br />
2-put the activating mp3 (ring tones-alarm-sms),the running theme,running wallpapers,screen saver,profiles in the main memory notin the sd memory.<br />
<br />
that is the answer which i found it by myself and it works well with me.<br />
<br />
the reason :<br />
<br />
when the phone starts up,the software conects the related data on the sd to it,and if it has numbers or sympols in its names it makes the phone corrupts then restarts coz the software starting debends on the main memory (c).<br />
<br />
i wish if this presents you a final answer for such a problem.<br />

<h2>            Need Help&#33;  Trying to recover contact list.</h2>
                    The screen fried on my HTC Dash a while back. I have a new phone now, and I need to get the contact information off of the Dash. Since I have a new laptop, the contact info was never synced with it. I know the contact information is still in the phone,
 because when I went to sync it with my old desktop, it showed 0/72 when it started. Unfortunately, even though it thinks the sync has been completed, the contacts are not showing up in Outlook, and are thus not syncing with the new phone.&nbsp; I've tried on both
 XP with my desktop and Vista with my new laptop.&nbsp; Neither are updating the contact information in Outlook.&nbsp; I can access the files on the new phone directly, but I'm not sure what file I'm looking for or what program I can use to open it.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

            Fwiw, I finally got this solved.&nbsp; In order to get the old backup copy of the pim.vol file onto my phone, I had to rename the existing one on my phone.&nbsp; It wouldn't let me delete it because it was in use.&nbsp; After renaming the existing one and copying the
 backup to the phone, I had to restart it.&nbsp; After that I could delete the renamed file, and my contact list was back.&nbsp; Then I sync'd the contacts with Outlook, and then sync'd Outlook with the new phone.

            Is your new phone the same kind?&nbsp; If it is, then you could copy the old PIM.VOL to the new device and it will bring up the contacts.&nbsp; If it is not the same, it will not work.<br />

<li>I have recently upgraded my pc to Windows 7 from Vista. &nbsp; </li><li>I have produced a mail merge document for labels using data base in excel and Avery L7161 label sheets. When I do a print of the addresses they are not in the correct position and move up slightly for each line of labels until they are overlapping the previous
 row of labels. &nbsp;I have checked and re-checked my label size and page size which all seem OK, &nbsp;but the problem still occurs. &nbsp;The printer is not slipping as I do a check on plain paper and then compare to a blank &nbsp;labels sheet. Frustration is really setting
 in now!!!! Can anybody help me please. Pretty please!grams you are having problems with</li><li>&nbsp; </li><li>I have re done the mail merge document 3 times with the same result </li></ul>

<br />Do you receive any error messages? If you restart eM does it work?

<p>Restarting doesn’t work. A box stated that microsoft has a problem. Retry later. I recall authentication failed as another message. &nbsp;Needs my password (which it has). I updated and password was ok. Signed out and in to check. Hotmail on other apps work ok.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As noted, no issues with fresh install on win 10 laptop. But uninstalling on older computer is not what I want as I’ve &nbsp;configured local folders. That takes ages to redo.&nbsp;</p>
