<h2>            Emails are sending by just hitting the S key.</h2>
                    <p>I've got a problem in Outlook when sending an email with an attachment.</p>
<p>When you type in the "To" box and select a name which is over the top of the attachment it selects the name then selects the attachment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you then just press the S key it sends automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to disable this feature/shortcut?</p>
<p>

            i cant repro... do you have sticky keys enabled? How are you using the mouse or keyboard to select the name? 
<br />
<br />Alt+S is the Send shortcut, and you can enable Ctrl+Enter in File, Options, Mail.

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done this on 3 different machines.</p>
<p>Sticky keys aren't enabled. It's a user who uses the mouse to select the name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you select the name away from the attachment it is fine because the cursor doesn't go onto the attachment.</p>
<p>It is only when you select a name over an attachment that it seems to highlight it even though you dont click the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is when S is sending.</p>

            Those are the steps I used to test - when i do it, my cursor is still in the to field and S types S. 
<br />
<br />Some more testing... If i tab until i hit the attachment (its highlighted) then it wants to send.... and if I double click when selecting the name, it will select the attachment, then S sends. I can't repro it with just one click on the address, or using the keyboard to select. 
<br />
<br />I will let support know.  Tell the user to use the arrow keys and tab (or Enter)  to select an address or click once if using the mouse...  
<br />
<br />Thanks.

            Unfortunately, until the problem is fixed by Microsoft, that is the only solution.  There are two tricks that would let you cancel the send - leaving the subject field blank or entering random characters in the To field that don't resolve to an address. Not double clicking on the address in the autocomplete list is less effort.

<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Also if you click the address and it doesn't hover over the attachment you can still type in the address bar.</p>

    <title>How can I get an uncommon fractions to be automatically formatted as - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meyoung  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I get an uncommon fractions to be automatically formatted as fraction characters&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am working in Word 2010.&nbsp; I have the "Replace Fractions with Fraction Character" option enabled in AutoCorrect; however, that only works for very common fractions, such as 1/4 and 1/2.&nbsp; If I want to do other fractions, such as 1/3 or 5/8 or anything else,
 it is not automatically formatted as a fraction character.&nbsp; After doing some research on this today, I realized that *some* - not all - other fractions can be inserted as symbols.&nbsp; I have created keyboard shortcuts for those fractions as well.&nbsp; However, even
 the symbols list only has a handful of fractions and doesn't cover every eventuality (such as 3/20 or 7/16).&nbsp; I tried typing in those fractions and then manually changing the numerator to superscript and the denominator to subscript.&nbsp; Not only does that not
 look exactly the same as the other fraction characters, but that is a pain to have to do that every time I need to use a less common fraction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas?&nbsp; Is there a way to provde feedback to the programmers at Microsoft and suggest that perhaps enabling the "Replace Fractions with Fraction Character" option would cause ALL fractions to be replaced wtih fraction characters, not
 just the few that they think people will be using?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help you are able to provide.</p>

            Most fonts contain made-up fractions for 1/3, 2/3, 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, and 7/8, and&nbsp; you can define AutoCorrect entries for those if desired. For other fractions that do not exist in a font, you must create the fonts yourself. See
<span><a href="http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Formatting/CreateFraction.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Formatting/CreateFraction.htm</a>&nbsp;for several methods. If you want all the fractions to match, then you need to eschew
 the made-up fractions from the font and create all the fractions the same way.</span>

            Most of these types or errors are caused by faulty third-party add ons. Lets check if thats the case for you by opening Internet Explorer in a special "no add on" mode.<br />
<br />
Please click Start --&gt; All programs --&gt; accessories --&gt; system tools --&gt; Internet Explorer (no add ons) and see if you still get the error when closing Internet Explorer.

<h2>            Cannot Add Buttons to Run Macro for Workbook on Network Drive or enable Developer tab - Server Drafts Location For Offline Editing Is Not Valid</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use Excel 2013 at work and I have added code to a workbook we all access on the network drive. I am able to add and run code from my Personal workbook or from the workbook we all access from the network, let's call it 'Project Workbook'. I can do anything
 I want in the workbook, including add or remove the Developer tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong><br />
*I can open the workbook from the network drive from my boss' computer, but I am unable add buttons to his QAT or ribbon that will run these 2 macros.<br />
*I am also able to even enable the Developer tab, but I am not able to do either of these things for my boss when opening the same workbook.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">For both problems, I get: 'The server drafts location you entered for offline editing is not valid or you do not have permission to access this location. Specify a location on your local computer.'&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I've tried:</strong><br />
* I went to File/Options/Save on his computer and found that his 'Offline editing options for document management server files' is already set to The Office Document Cache, like people recommend online.</p>
<p>* When I open&nbsp;File/Options/Save on his computer, his Offline editing options are already set to The Office Document Cache, as I mentioned, but he does has nothing in the Server Drafts Location: and I do. I have&nbsp;C:\Users\(my work username)\Documents\SharePoint
 Drafts\ and he has nothing. I've tried browsing to that path but cannot find SharePoint Drafts (see comment 1 under FYI).</p>
<p>* I've tried changing his setting under File/Options/Save to 'The server drafts location on this computer' vs. 'The Office Document Cache'.</p>
<p>* As far as the code is concern, I've tried adding the code to his Personal workbook and I've tried adding the code to the 'Project Workbook'.<br />
* I've tried adding the macro buttons and enabling the Developer tab while the workbook is on the network and I've tried saving a copy on his desktop, and I still get that error msg.<br />
* we do not have permission (b/c this is at work) to fix this via going to the registry and changing values, so I can't try that.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>FYI:</strong></p>
<p>* this is not a Shared workbook (under Review/ShareWorkbook). I oversee this workbook, and at one time I made it a Shared workbook, but we took it off Share many months ago.<br />
* this is not a protected workbook, and it has no password protected cells in it.</p>
<p>* (1) online says there is no SharePoint Drafts physical folder&nbsp;<a href="https://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/120568/unable-to-find-sharepoint-drafts-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/120568/unable-to-find-sharepoint-drafts-folder</a></p>
<p>* I don't think he needs to repair his Excel file and we probably will not be able to download any program to help with this anyway b/c it is a work computer. (Online, someone mentioned to uninstall and use the following to get leftover files from uninstall:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">cleanc2r.zip
 and/or ripoutoffice2007.zip and/or msicuu2.exe.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said there is not protected workbook or password of any protected cells, so I don't know if there is some kind of administrator permission he needs to have for me to do all this in his Excel workbook or what. If so, I would appreciate stepping me
 through that b/c I'm not aware of that with Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any help. Thank you!</p>

<p>I just wanted to post a work-around for anyone else with this issue. I know it doesn't solve this particular issue, but you can add a command button (or a toggle button but it will be different code) on the spreadsheet itself, and when pressed it will do
 what is needed to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done that with other command buttons, and it will appear on everyone's spreadsheet when they open the spreadsheet from the network drive (even if you hide the button on your spreadsheet). They can then run the code by pressing the command button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. As I mentioned, please note that if you hide the button or control by going to to Developer/Design/Properties and changing the Visible property to False, the button might not appear on your spreadsheet, but it will appear on others on the network who
 open that spreadsheet. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just letting you know in case you want to hide the button for some reason so others don't see it. I'm not sure what happens if you hide the command button or whatever control via code, though.</p>

<h2>            Excel Not Opening Full Screen</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone tell me why after I save and close my excel workbook, then close Excel program it doesn't open full screen next time?&nbsp; I have to click the little square in the top right of the program to return it to full screen after opening.&nbsp; (I close while
 it is at full screen by clicking the X in the top right of the program)... No huge problem, just annoying ... WORD doesn't have this problem ...Thanks in advance!</p>

            Hi Fred,
<br />
<br />Open an Excel file. Maximize the window. Holding down the Ctrl key, close the window. See if that solve the issue.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />

<p>I tried using your instructions, and Excel opened full screen immediately after closing ... However, I closed Excel and after running other programs for a while reopened the Excel program and it opened half screen ...&nbsp; Have know idea why, but I tried it
 daily since Friday ... Any chance this is due to my using pinned icon on toolbar to open program?&nbsp; I unpinned the icon and re-pinned from Start ... Opened full screen I'll test it again tomorrow and see how it opens after a day's use.</p>

<div><br />
<div>While I'm not sure about the issues each app is facing, in general, the answer lies not with the operating system but the individual developers of each app/game listed. You'll find your answers by contacting them directly. There is usually developer contact

To how many developers should i contact?<br />
<br />
There are not only 1 or 2. Many apps were not getting installed through SD card and the same apps got installed when i tried them through directly phone. Then what is the use of SD card??<br />

    <title>Auto forward sent messages in Outlook 2016 Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark donohue  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto forward sent messages in Outlook 2016 Mac</h2>
                    <p>It seems like this out to be simple, but I'm having no success.&nbsp; I want to set up a rule in Outlook 2016 for Mac so that every email I send will automatically be forwarded to another email account.&nbsp; I went to Rules, Edit Rules, Outgoing, to set up a new
 rule, but no matter what combination of choices I try the rule doesn't work.&nbsp; The instruction on the subject I've found online (including on the MS website) all reference some version of Outlook that doesn't have the same options (or lack of options) I'm finding
 in 2016 for Mac (other versions seem to have some "Manage Rules" wizard that's lacking in 2016 for Mac).&nbsp; How do I do this?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was, by the way, easily able to set up a rule to forward all incoming mail to another email address--it just seems like setting up a rule for sent mail, if it can be done at all, is way harder than it needs to be.</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to set a rule to forward emails sent by yourself, I recommend that you use the
<strong>Client Rules</strong>, such as Exchange, IMAP or POP. Please set your rule like below to forward emails sent by yourself:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6bfb8a41-31ed-495e-9018-0fbea0d50fc5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6bfb8a41-31ed-495e-9018-0fbea0d50fc5" /></a><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Remember to add a filter like Date Sent. If not, all the emails in your mailbox will automatically forward to the target mailbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still can’t forward emails to the target mailbox, please provide the following information for us:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-version-of-Outlook-do-I-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What version of Outlook for Mac client are you using?</a> It looks like 15.31 170216.</p>
<p>2. What type of email account do you use, an Office 365 account, a Gmail account, a Hotmail.com account or any other account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Barry</p>

    <title>Moving from Lotus Notes on premise to Outlook on Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> al thornquist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving from Lotus Notes on premise to Outlook on Office 365</h2>
                    <p>We have recently migrated from Lotus Notes on premises to Outlook in Office 365.</p>
<p>I have been the Lotus Notes admin since we started using it in 1998, and I am now the Office 365 admin.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things to learn, but one thing that I am trying to figure out is how I can access mailboxes in a similar fashion to how I would as a Lotus Notes admin. Over the years, employees have come to understand that I had full access to all mailboxes
 and therefore if someone was out of the office, they could come to me and I could open the absent person's email and find and/or forward the required information.</p>
<p>If you know Lotus Notes, it was very easy for me to create a "shortcut" to any database on the server and open it at will.</p>
<p>I am trying to determine how I can perform a similar function now.</p>
<p>I don't necessarily want to open the mailbox within my desktop Outlook client, so I am fine with opening it via the web interface, but my understanding (limited as it may be) is that if I have permissions to a mailbox it will automatically open in my desktop
 client? I don't want 20+ extra mailboxes in my Outlook desktop client - I find the Outlook 2016 folder pane hard enough to navigate as it is.</p>
<p>Is there a way that I can simply have permissions for all the mailboxes so that I can open via the web interface without affecting my OUtlook 2016 desktop client?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a related note - is there ANY way to make the Outlook 2016 folder pane look more like the 2010 version? My migrated Lotus Notes mailbox has over 500 folders and trying to navigate those in Outlook 2016 is ridiculous. At least in 2010 I can see them more
 clearly and more folders fit vertically in the pane.</p>

<p>Hi AL Thhornquist,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few points need to clarify.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>In the first method I provided, you need to create a new Outlook profile and re-add your account after change the automapping to false in PowerShell. If you have already done this and the shared mailboxes still shows in your new
 profile, please wait some time before add your account. The change to full access permission may have a little down time as a couple of minutes. You can test this by trying to access the shared mailbox in OWA, after removing the full access permission. If
 you can still access it during the test, the configuration is not validated at that time. Wait a couple of minutes until you cannot access it, then move on to the next step.
</span></li><li><span>If you have successfully removed them by MFCMAPI, you could still use the method above to test the validation information before re-assigning a full access permission
 without automapping disabled. (click your profile photo on upper right corner of the window&gt;open another mailbox).</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

    <title>How can I REPLACE the Normal.dotm template for Word 2010 with an - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cixelfire  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I REPLACE the Normal.dotm template for Word 2010 with an alternate template, without modifying on an individual basis&#63;</h2>
                    I would like to replace the normal.dotm template with a template that I have created in our company's style set.&nbsp;
<div><br />
According to this article:&nbsp;<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/change-the-normal-template-normal-dotm-HA010030756.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/change-the-normal-template-normal-dotm-HA010030756.aspx</a>
</div>
<div><br />
<b><span>&nbsp;NOTE&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;If Normal.dotm is renamed, damaged, or moved, Word automatically creates a new version (which uses the original default settings) the next time that you start Word. The new version will not include any of the customizations that
 you made to the version that you renamed or moved.</span></b></div>
<div><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>I witnessed this occur when I deleted the previous "Normal.dotm" template and renamed my other template "Normal.dotm". When I reopened Word - all changes had been reverted.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span><span>I would like my own template to be the default for all employees, so I need a quick and easy solution to make this happen. The template is comprised of the following that needs to be available for everyone:&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>1. Specific fonts, colours</span></div>
<div><span>2. Highly specific style set, tailored for line spacing, numbering structure, indents, and other paragraph features</span></div>
<div><span>3. Building blocks (header, page number)</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span><span>Because of all these items that need to be adapted in the normal template, I can't ask each employee to modify their Normal.dotm template on a case-by-case basis. The other alternative is simply making my template available within that folder,
 but I fear that some people will forget it is there, and it will go unused - so I would like it to be the default.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span>Thanks in advance!</div>
                </div>

            You can modify the Normal template but not replace it. I recommend that you create a custom document template and copy it to each user's User Templates folder, for example by using a login script. (The exact location for the user templates folder is listed
 in the File tab | Options | Advanced | File Locations.)

There must be some setting, somewhere, that allows you to remove Word's ability to recreate the Normal template when it is deleted or moved? It would have to get that information from somewhere?&nbsp;
<div>
<div><br />
<div>Are you able to expand on what you mean by a "login script"? The templates folder is easy enough to find. This would be a change needed on multiple computers though (not just multiple users) so I'm not sure this applies.</div>

            No, Word can't operate without the Normal file. It will always be recreated if it isn't present when Word starts. You should think of it as a user file, not something that should be managed centrally.<br />
<br />
Login scripts would be something you create for the Windows network. A simple example of a batch file can be found in the article at
<a href="http://word.mvps.org/faqs/macrosvba/DistributeMacros.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://word.mvps.org/faqs/macrosvba/DistributeMacros.htm</a>. For more, ask in a Windows forum.

                    <p>I've imported a piece of clip art to use as a bullet, but it's so small. How can I increase the size of the bullet without increasing the font size? I'd like a bigger bullet with a 12 pt. font.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have exacty the same problem with Word (only), after having updated yesterday:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mac: Mac mini (late 2014)</p>
<p>OS X: Mojave (v 10.14)</p>
<p>Word: v 15.33, according to finder (Word automatically updated yesterday, 1 November 2018, here in France).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try opening Word from scratch, it gives me the new document menu with all the templates (which I've never used and never had selected as default before this update), and THEN crashes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try opening from a Word document in finder, it just crashes straight away,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Thankfully, Excel and PowerPoint still work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem that I've had since being obligated use your online subscription model (Office 365), is that everytime MS Office updates itself, it erases the "recent files" list in the Word, Excel and PowerPoint menus. Really annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't MS and Apple just work together to make things run smoothly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your time and effort,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jheryus</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your OS and Office installs are both in dire need of updating. I am nearly certain that once you have installed updates this problem will go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">INSTALL UPDATES</span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Ensure your Mac and Office have the latest updates</span></strong><span>. Here’s how to install updates:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection, then:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><strong><span>Update Mac OS X</span></strong><span>. Open the App store and click on the Updates button. Install
 the updates.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><span>After, in any Office application go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates to launch the AutoUpdate app.
<strong>Let AutoUpdate install updates and then restart your Mac.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use Antidote, Webex, Silverlight, EndNote, Zotero, Suitcase, 3<sup>rd</sup> party font management tools or other add-ins there is a potential for crashes unless you also update your add-ins to the latest update. Install updates
 for these programs if you have them. </p>

<p><strong>I am trying to setup the journal functionallity in Outlook 2010, but i'm running into the issue that it only automaticly records email etc. from enabled contacts. Since i have about 500 contacts and I also get a lot of customer/supplier emails that

<p><strong>Another thing i noticed is that meetings in the calender aren't automaticly added in the Journal as such. Is there a way to automate this?</strong></p>

<p>You are asking about CRM functions. Outlook is not CRM software. It is a Personal Information Manager. Accordingly, it will track&nbsp;activities&nbsp;on your personal Contacts, but not every action for every sender you've ever had. It has robust features for finding
 and filtering&nbsp;all senders from among your message store so you can find all relevant messages to and from</p>
<p>I also suspect you are confusing "Journal" with "Activities." The latter is the function that tracks the Outlook items associated with a given Contact that reside within your message store.</p>

            <p>I know this is quite an old thread, but that is a poor answer really. The OP was asking about a useful function which should really be pretty easy to include in the journal. I would definitely use it, but seeing that it isn't possible means I wont' use the
 journal at all as it doesn't track most of what I do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A journal that records all my activity isn't a CRM tool, it is just a journal which actually works. This is a journal which only tracks some of my activities and is therefore not of much use to me (I appreciate it may be great for many others).</p>

<p>SharePoint 2013 / Office 365.</p>
<p>My company has a SharePoint site with three separate Document Libraries.</p>
<p>I want one of the libraries to allow all users to upload or create documents, but only to be able to see documents that they have been shared on (or they created them selves)</p>
<p>What permissions should I assign to the group for all employees?</p>

<p>Please advise. I have to have this done asap. (Before tomorrow morning)</p>

<p>hi allison,</p>
<p>about your requirements, i would suggest you create a customized view for the library and grant a customized permission level to the group. however, after doing the above, the users will not able to manage "<strong>shared with</strong>" list including stop
 sharing since we need <strong>full control</strong> permission level to do that.</p>
<p>here're the steps:<br />
<strong>1</strong>. go to this library, if this is a newly created document library, we need to upload a file and share it with others so that the
<strong>shared with</strong> column can be visiable when editing a view.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>. click <strong>library</strong> &gt; <strong>create view</strong> &gt;
<strong>standard view</strong> &gt; type in a view name, for example <strong>only see mine</strong>, tick the check box before
<strong>make this the default view</strong> &gt; choose <strong>create a public view</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong>. in the <strong>columns</strong> section, tick the boxes before
<strong>created by</strong> and <strong>shared with</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong>. scroll down to the <strong>filter</strong> section, choose
<strong>show items only when the following is true:</strong> and configure it as the following shows:<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=13f7ea0e-3ce7-4af0-951c-3b9548bb6cd2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d13f7ea0e-3ce7-4af0-951c-3b9548bb6cd2" /></a></p>
<p><strong>5</strong>. till now, shared users will still able to switch to the default
<strong>all&nbsp;documents </strong>view to see all the files, so we need to create another personal view named
<strong>all</strong>: click <strong>library</strong> &gt; <strong>create view</strong> &gt;
<strong>standard view</strong> &gt; type in a view name <strong>all</strong> &gt; choose
<strong>create a personal view</strong> &gt; <strong>ok</strong>.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d9341c9a-aab7-4718-9a3e-cb42dd13f253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd9341c9a-aab7-4718-9a3e-cb42dd13f253" /></a></p>
<p>back to the library, select the default <strong>all documents</strong> view &gt; <strong>
library</strong> &gt; <strong>modify view</strong> &gt; <strong>delete</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>6</strong>. click <strong>library</strong> &gt;<strong> library settings</strong> &gt; shared with button &gt;
<strong>advanced</strong> &gt; <strong>stop inheriting permissions</strong> &gt; <strong>
ok</strong>.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ce1865ce-9ee1-43ce-8bda-2289df534159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dce1865ce-9ee1-43ce-8bda-2289df534159" /></a></p>
<p><strong>7</strong>. back to the shared with button and share this library with the specific group.</p>
<p><strong>8</strong>. go to <strong>site settings</strong> &gt; <strong>site permissions</strong> &gt;
<strong>permission levels</strong> &gt; select the default <strong>contribute</strong> permission level &gt; scroll down to the bottom and click
<strong>copy permission level</strong> &gt; give it a name, for example <strong>my permission</strong> &gt;
<br />
<br />
for<strong> list permissions</strong> tick the following 3 permission levels:<br />
<strong>add items ,view items, &nbsp;view application pages</strong>.<br />
<br />
for <strong>site permissions</strong>, don't change.<br />
<br />
for <strong>personal permissions</strong>, untick all.</p>
<p><strong>9</strong>. go to <strong>library</strong> &gt; <strong>library settings</strong> &gt; shared with button &gt;
<strong>advanced</strong> &gt; select the group &gt; <strong>edit user permissions</strong> &gt; select the permission
<strong>my permission</strong>.</p>
<p>meanwhile, it's appreciated if our community members will share ideas about how to achieve these requirements.</p>
<p>regards,<br />

<p>I tried creating a custom view that would allow them to only see documents shared with them, but allowing them to "add" documents also allows them to "view", so since everyone was "shared" on that library, they could still see items that weren't specifically
 shared with them. </p>

<p>Hi Allison,</p>
<p>After doing the steps I listed, the default view is the <strong>Only See Mine</strong> no matter who access the library, and he won't see the files which is not
<strong>created by</strong> himself or <strong>shared with</strong> him even though the library is shared with all the users.</p>
<p>Only the admin who did the settings can access the<strong> All</strong> view and can see all the files in this library since this is a personal view to him.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
James</p>

<h2>            Mac Remote Desktop Connection To Windows Server - Redirected Printer Showing Wrong Driver</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I got directed here with my issue so hopefully its the right place.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Macbook Air running Lion 10.7 and using the Remote Desktop Connection app thats built in to connect to a Windows 2008 R2 Server. I redirect my local printer which is a CM6040 and prints perfectly from the Mac.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to print an A3 page and discovered it wouldn't work, after a little digging i found the driver it picks up in Widows is for a different HP model, a Laserjet 2800.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The option to change the driver is greyed out, so my question is how do i change the driver it uses to the correct one? or failing that where do i find a list of Printers that are compatible with this kind of situation?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance</div>
<div>Vince</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Daily forecast high and low temperatures do not correspond to hourly forecast temps for the day</h2>
                    It's a no brainer that the highest hourly high temp for a day should be the forecast high for that day.&nbsp; Likewise, the lowest hourly forecast temp for a day should be the forecast low temp for the day.&nbsp; Why are those two forecasts sometimes out of whack?&nbsp;
 Should I not rely on forecast hourly temps, and if so, why do you bother to put them out?&nbsp; Or should I rely on the National Weather Service instead?&nbsp; I like the format of the hourly forecasts by day because they seem to allow me to make better plans, but if
 they're not in accord with the daily forecast, what's a mother to do?

</p><p>Region and time zone are set correctly. &nbsp;Low for today is right, but forecast hourly high is two degrees higher than forecast daily high. &nbsp;That is typical. &nbsp;Both lows and highs can be out of whack.</p>
