    <title>Keep source formatting doesn&#39;t keep bullets or indents when - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Keep source formatting doesn&#39;t keep bullets or indents when pasting FROM Word 07 TO Outlook 07</h2>
                    
<p>I have defined "styles" in Word 07 that more or less match the way that Outlook 07 auto-formats a series of bullet points (including the way it formats "sub-bullets").&nbsp; Although I like the auto-formatting of bulleted lists in Outlook, I prefer to do my work
 in Word 07 and then cut and paste into an Outlook 07 message for further distribution.</p>
<p>However, when I try to copy from Word 07 into an Outlook 07 document, the "keep source formatting" option in Outlook does NOT keep the bullets at all, and it does not get the indents on my paragraphs completely correct.</p>
<p>The styles that I have set up in Word are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Note0 has a round solid bullet with no indent, hanging indent by 0.5cm, and a left-tab at 0.5cm</li><li>Note1 has a round open bullet with a 1cm indent, hanging indent by a further 0.5cm, and a left-tab at 1.5cm</li><li>Note2 has a square solid bullet with a 2cm indent, hanging indent by a further 0.5cm, and a left-tab at 2.5cm</li><li>Note3 has a round solid bullet with a 3cm indent, hanging indent by a further 0.5cm, and a left-tab at 3.5cm</li><li>Note4 has a round open bullet with a 4cm indent, hanging indent by a further 0.5cm, and a left-tab at 4.5cm</li></ul>
<p>Just to be absolutely clear, when I copy from Word 07 to Outlook 07, I lose ALL of the bullets.&nbsp; THis means that I go from a Word document with bulleted, indented paragraphs to an e-mail message with indented but not bulleted paragraphs.</p>
<p>Moreover, the indent for Note1 gets shifted further to the right by 0.25cm.&nbsp; All other indents are consistent with how they have been formatted in the Word 07 styles.</p>
<p>I do not have styles set up in Outlook 07.&nbsp; I have tried to set them up, but I have found that they do not work reliably for me.</p>
<p>My "Mail Format" settings in Outlook 07 are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Compose in this message format</span>: HTML&nbsp; (I've tried RTF; it doesn't work any differently)</li><li>Under "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Editor Options (Advanced)</span>", I use "Keep Source Formatting" when pasting from other programs.</li></ul>
<p>I would be very grateful for anyone's help.&nbsp; I cannot change these formats as they are the ones in use by my colleagues.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to carry on developing documents in Word 07 given the flexibility/ease of applying styles in that app.&nbsp; (It seems like
 Outlook 07 has some kinks in its use of styles.)</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Adam of London,</p>
<p>I did not notice anywhere if you are using Word as the email editor in Outlook. If you are not then I would suggest that you try that.
</p>
<p>I have provided a link about how to set Word as the editor in Outlook.</p>
<p>Using Outlook 2007 with or without Word 2007 installed<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/using-outlook-2007-with-or-without-word-2007-installed-HA010220991.aspx?CTT=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/using-outlook-2007-with-or-without-word-2007-installed-HA010220991.aspx?CTT=1</a></p>
<p>If you are not using Word then you will get different results based on your editor setting in Outlook. The option to use Word as the email editor is designed specifically for what you are trying to achieve which is to have the ability to use features in
 Word for emails</p>
<p>I have also included a link to advanced editing options. </p>
<p>Editor Options (Advanced)<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/editor-options-advanced-HA010208748.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/editor-options-advanced-HA010208748.aspx</a></p>
<p>Hopefully this will help.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 &#47; Onedrive sync permissions problem</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
Hi,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
I have an Office 365 home subscription and am trying to backup my files to Onedrive.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
I have shared my subscription with my mum and she has backed up a folder of some office files on her computer that we're both working on.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
When I go to her place and copy a folder of documents that I worked on that are on my computer and my Onedrive, office 365 upload center and therefore her Onedrive says they can't upload the files to her onedrive. It says she doesn't have permission.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
Why does Office not think she has permission to upload the file? If I have the file on my computer then Office 365/Onedrive should just allow the file to be uploaded, it should be treated as any other file right?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks actually I've fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I went to all office apps and made sure that the sign-in of the app matched the sign in on the onedrive.</li><li>In the Office upload center I went to the resolve dropdown and selected Sign-in and upload.</li></ol>
<p>This fixed it but was laborious. There were 50 or so documents and I thought that once I had signed-in on the office apps to the correct logon it would just reconfirm all the documents and upload them correctly. This was not the case. I had to use the drop
 down on all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to make this less painful? why are there permission between one drive and office anyway? if i have the file why can't i just upload it to any onedrive account without office? does office just get in the way?</p>
<p>

    <title>DCount &#61; Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kate_madden1  say:</h3>
<h2>            DCount &#61; Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to count the number of billers per team on a report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I run the following query:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT Jobs.Date, Jobs.Team, Jobs.[Consultant First Name], Jobs.[Consultant Surname], Jobs.[Fee Value] AS Fee, Jobs.[Drop out?] AS DropOut, Jobs.[Placed?], Jobs.[Invoice Sent?] AS InvSent, [Month_Target] AS [Month Target], [Week_target] AS [Week Target]<br />
FROM Jobs<br />
WHERE (((Jobs.[Placed?])=Yes));<br />
</p>
<p>Which I have based my report off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to count the consultant name, but only distinct values. So, I used the DCount expression in a control source of a field on my report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I've entered:&nbsp;=DCount("[Consultant First Name]",[Board Query])</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried without the "[ ]", I've tried moving the "'s too, but every time I just get an #Error output.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p />

<p>You could try:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>=DCount("[Consultant First Name]","[Board Query]")</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This won't get you a unique count. It will count all records.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>You could create a query that returns all unique first names with a query like:</p>
<p><span>SELECT&nbsp; DISTINCT [Consultant First Name]&nbsp;</span><span>FROM Jobs&nbsp;</span><span>WHERE [Placed?]=Yes;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Another issue would be two or more consultants with the same first name.&nbsp; I would expect that you need to create a query of distinct first and last names.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reports allow you to create a distinct count if you group by the consultant and use a running sum text box.</span></p>

<p>I don't follow. You had wanted to count the unique consultants but just stated "<span>I've decided to remove the count product". Does this mean you don't need an answer to this question or is there still a need for an answer?</span></p>

<h2>            Graphic Performance in these last Builds</h2>
                    <p>I noticed that Directx and Vulkan Games got improvement with these last Builds. I don't know if this issue is related at MS libraries like&nbsp;<strong>directx</strong>&nbsp;and open&nbsp;<strong>vulkan</strong>&nbsp;or if the gain is related with the new video drivers via
 WU (AMD&nbsp;<strong>gpu</strong>&nbsp;with wrong "driver version number" but Great performance).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else noticed this gain in graphics performance?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Far Cry 5 (DirectX) got improvement (smoother and better FPS)</p>
<p>Rage 2 (Vulkan) got improvement</p>

            On the Mailings tab, in the Start Mail Merge group, click Start Mail Merge and select Step by Step Mail Merge Wizard. Note, however, that you will have to have saved your Works files in another format and converted them to Excel sheets as Graham describes.
 When you get to the "Select recipients" step in the wizard, you will choose "Use an existing list" and browse for the Excel file you saved. If you prefer to do this manually rather than use the wizard,&nbsp;the procedure is detailed with step-by-step screen shots
 in Graham's article.

<p>Don't you think you should clearly define how to switch from a competitor to Microsoft?</p>
<p>Don't you think you should update your site (layout, etc) to reflect the changes of the live.com domain. domains.live.com is horrible.</p>

    <title>Hotmail suddenly not connecting whilst on Wifi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steffangait  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail suddenly not connecting whilst on Wifi</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I recently have started having issues with my hotmail accounts when connected to the wifi at my house, I am not able to refresh my emails, send/receive etc on any of my hotmail accounts whilst connected to the wifi, when I use mobile data I don't
 have a problem. this is. both on safari and also in the mail app. I have spoken with my internet provider and they have done various checks and have advised it is nothing on their side and is something to do with the hotmail server? It is not just me having
 this problem it is my housemates too. My Mac will not let me add a hotmail account (as I deleted it to try and re-add) my iCloud email works perfectly fine, and my hotmail accounts constantly say that they're offline and normally after a while they go back
 online but this time it hasn't happened and its been a few days now without service. I've tried chatting to an agent for Microsoft and tried the call option when in the support page but on both it says to try again later. Does anyone have any ideas what I
 can do? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Steffan,<br />
<br />
There are few reasons why you are not able to connect to your Hotmail account. To provide you with the correct resolution, kindly answer the following questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are you able to access your Hotmail account using the same device, but connected to a different network?</li><li>Have you recently made any changes to your home network?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are able to access your Hotmail using your mobile data, this means that the servers are working fine. If the internet provider verified that the connection does not have a problem, the next thing to check is the configuration of your home network.<br />
<br />
We look forward to your response.</p>

            Since we already figured out that it is not the servers or the internet connection that has the problem, the next thing we have to check is your home network or router. You need to contact the manufacturer of your router to reconfigure the settings that
 are blocking the website to load.

            Whether I use the mail application on my Mac/iphone or open safari and use hotmail.com. when using the mail app it says cannot connect to server and won't refresh, when I go onto safari it says the web page cannot be displayed.&nbsp;

            Sounds like a DNS issue, perhaps. What happens if you use nslookup at a command line to look up the domain name you're trying to reach?

    <title>Purchasing store apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lrg15  say:</h3>
<h2>            Purchasing store apps</h2>
                    <p>I have tried buying games through the Windows 10 store. I am properly signed in with my MS account, but it keeps asking me to add a payment method, this is on both my laptop and Surface Pro 2, so to check if it was my account, I used my Lumia 950 running
 the latest Win Insider build 10.0.14342.1003, signed in with the same MS account as my laptop and surface,&nbsp;and I am able to purchase apps that way, so I thought that maybe since I had bought it from the store on a different device, that the purchased app would
 show up and let me download it, no such luck, I have attached a screen shot with the error message. I have tried numerous uninstalls of the app and reinstalling as per the error message, the one I used in the picture is for Microsoft Solitaire Collection.
 I do own the game, If I go to "My Account" online it shows the app as purchased, but does not show up on any device other than my phone. I was hoping there would be some kind of fix in the latest&nbsp;build release&nbsp;14352.rs1_release.160522-1930, but no such luck.
 I have tried buying other apps and games, but laptop and surface do not seem to recognize my MS account with my credit card. I tried to add it as a payment option and am told that the payment method already exists and does not add it to my account, which honestly
 it shouldn't because it is already&nbsp;set up. It would be nice to be able to purchase some apps for my computers some time soon.&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
<li>Date &amp; time zone available by cities.</li><li>When browsing (with network set to 3G only), the device connects via 3.5G. But if I pause to read a page, the icon changes from H (connected to 3.5G) to G ( connected via 2G). Is it to conserve power in idle screen because as soon as i click on a link it
 switches back to 3.5G connection?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Changes mentioned in Nokia Suite</u> </strong>-</p>
<ol>
<li>Performance &amp; usability improvements.</li><li>Better Applications. (?) (Found no new application)</li></ol>

<p><strong><u>Not Fixed</u> -</strong></p>

            I know what those symbols mean. But on 3G mode the network cannot switch to 2G. So my guess is that when the network activity is idle, it just conserves power.

<p>
</p><p>I posted this same question last week and did not get an answer. For reference, I am a Mac user and the change happened when Office365 updated on my computer on April 17th.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This change drastically reduces the functionality of Outlook Calendars, but is not mentioned anywhere in the April 2019 release notes for Office for Mac (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/release-notes-office-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/release-notes-office-for-mac</a>).</p>

 clarify items in my boss's calendar and format them according to his preference. It is crippling not to be able to do this anymore.

    <title>Word 2016 Automatically Reopen Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr. buckler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 Automatically Reopen Windows</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Office 2016 and cannot figure out a way to get Word to automatically reopen documents that were open when I closed the program or shut down the computer. When I close the program or restart my computer, Word does not open any of
 the previously open documents and instead brings me to start screen. It's very important to my workflow that I restore this functionality. Please advise.&nbsp;

            <p>This is an operating system feature in MacOS. Word has never been able to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To enable the MacOS version, go to System Preferences&gt;General and DISABLE "Close windows when quitting apps".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think for this to work, MacOS needs to be the one to quit the app (i.e. use the Apple&gt;Shutdown command while Word is still running) but I am not entirely sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume you have investigated Word's File&gt;Open Recent&gt;More... function? &nbsp;That's what I usually use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also record a macro while you open each document. &nbsp;When you get it perfect, re-name it "AutoExec()" and it will run every time Word starts up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or: &nbsp;You can include aliases to each of the documents in the following folder, to have Word open them automatically at startup:&nbsp;/Users/&lt;your login&gt;/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content.localized/Startup.localized/Word</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

    <title>Canceled Installation Deletion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> consensusofdisagreement  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canceled Installation Deletion</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently enrolled in a Computer Science course. Because of the course, I was given access to Dreamspark in order to download Visual Studio. I downloaded the Visual Studio 2015 Communiy edition, which was an iso file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having no program that could read this type of file, (mount the file, I believe is the correct term after doing some research), I set out to find one that was free. I downloaded a program called Free ISO Mount from CNET Download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started the Setup for the Free ISO Mount installation. During the setup I accepted what I thought was the Terms and Conditions, but what was actually the Setup asking if I wanted to download and install two out of three bundle programs included with Free
 ISO Mount. When the prompt asked if I wanted whatever the third program was I realised what had occured. Seeing no way to back track on the setup I declined the third and continued the setup. My plan was to simply uninstall the other two programs after the
 setup was complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The setup installed the two programs which turned out to be PC Cleaner Pro and Weatherbug. I immediately had a bad feeling as my computer started running very slow and they appeared very suspicious. At this point the setup said that it had downloaded the
 Free ISO Mount program that I had originally wanted and that it was ready to install. Because of my negative gut feeling I simply X'd out of the setup as I didnt want any more suspicious software installed. This leads to my first question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I canceled the setup after the download of the Free ISO Mount software but before the installation of said software, does some version of this software still exist on my computer? If so, how do I find it and remove it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did the setup simply word the prompt wrong? It made it sound like the Free ISO Mount was a seperate download than the setup file I had downloaded titled "isomount_setup.msi". If I delete this setup file should all traces of this software be gone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's my primary question, but I will give further context in the event that any of you think further action is required on my behalf.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled PC Cleaner Pro. After the installation I got a prompt from Kaspersky Antivirus stating that malware like activity was detected and that I should close all programs and run an Advanced Disinfection scan. I accepted and the Advanced Disinfection
 scan began. After the scan was finished, I could do basically nothing on my computer. I couldnt log out, I couldnt start Task Manager (it said the file could not be found, or something to that effect), I couldnt start Control Panel ( it said that file could
 not be found). I kept getting prompts saying that things couldnt be located, ranging anywhere from what appeared to be screensavers to System 32 (I believe it was called; something important if I recall correctly). Eventually, the only thing I had on my screen
 was the background image. At this point, I assumed the best course of action was a hard shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read about the Advanced Disinfection scan on my phone, and I believe that it was the reason for the strange behavior (files couldnt be accessed) as opposed to malware. Kaspersky website said that the scan makes registries unable to be accessed (or something
 like that) in order to help it root out any malware on the computer. Apparently, it was supposed to reboot the computer after the scan was finished but that didnt happen, which is why i think i was forced to hard shutdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After restarting my computer everything appears to be working fine. I uninstalled Weatherbug without incident. Kaspersky had me run some kind of debugger that was supposed to fix any issues that may have been caused by malware. I am now running a Full Scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My primary question is above, regarding wether or not Free ISO Mount may still be on my computer. But does anyone think my computer is fine at this point? Or should i be worried?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for anyones help regarding this issue and I apologize for the Mt. Everest of text.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Christopher,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues with Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try the following methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try to boot the computer in safe mode and check, Please refer to the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or
 an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may
 temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the
 computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a
<strong>SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The <strong>
SFC /scan</strong> now command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Hover the mouse to the right hand corner of the screen to get the charms bar.<br />
b. Type command prompt. Right click on Command Prompt and select Run as Administrator.<br />
c. Type the following command in the command prompt and press enter.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>SFC /scan now
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>d. Wait till the process completes, restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

<h2>            Mail Merge&#58;  Modifying and saving a data source created in Word 2003 into Word 2007</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Word 2007.&nbsp; In Word 2007, I was able to merge documents with a data source that was created in Word 2003.&nbsp; However, when I tried to add new records to the data source and save them, it said the data source was a "Read-only" file
 and could not be modified.&nbsp; One solution it gave was to rename and save as a new file, which I did, but again when I&nbsp;wanted to add&nbsp;another new record and tried to save, I got the same "Read-only" message.&nbsp; Do I have to&nbsp;save it as&nbsp;a new file everytime I want
 to edit the data source??&nbsp; In Word 2003, a dialog box would pop up and ask if I wanted to save changes made to the data source and I would just click 'Yes.'&nbsp; (I also tried going to 'Properties' of the data source and unmarking "Read-only" but the check box
 was already unmarked!)

<p>What format is the file in, and how are you trying to edit it?</p>
<p>If you have already associated it with a merge, then you need to use the Edit Recipient List tool in the Mailings ribbon tab.</p>
<p>It's "acting" as if the file is already open... which is what would happen if you try to edit a data source already associated with an open merge operation. This presumes that you're trying to open/edit the file using something other than the Edit Recipient
 List.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that you do not have write access to the folder where the data file is stored. Unfortunately, I've seen this happen fairly often. If this is the issue, then navigate to the folder using Windows Explorer, and give yourself full access
 to the folder.</p>
If one of these isn't the problem, then additional description of what you're doing might help get to the problem more directly.<br />

<div>As a work around, use the data source for a Directory type mail merge in the main document of which you insert the mergefields into the cells of a one row table and have nothing else in the document.&nbsp; When you execute that merge to a new
 document, that document will contain a table with a row of data for each record in the data source.&nbsp; Insert a new row into the top of that table into the cells of which you insert the field names (not the mergefields themselves, but their names) and then add
 new rows with the new records to that table.&nbsp; Then save that table and use it as your data source.</div>

<h2>            Import HERE map &#40;Nokia&#41; favorites into Microsoft maps</h2>
                    <p>I've been using a Windows Phone since the Lumia 920 and I'm frustrated with the lack of support for problems. HERE Maps disappeared from the Windows Store and I haven't heard any updates about when the "technical issue" will be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, my new Lumia 950 can't access/import/export my favorites from HERE Maps. I noticed a post about it in April of 2015, but the issue hasn't been resolved yet. I want to try the new Microsoft Maps app for Windows 10 Phone Mobile, but I have
 a lot of favorites that I need to be able to transfer first and I don't know how. There's already limited apps in the Windows store and the ones that exist are rarely updated/lower quality than the counterparts on Android/iOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise. This is my last attempt in getting help before I jump over to Android and give up on Windows 10 Mobile system. Apparently, HERE Maps is working and all my Microsoft Apps are there. I don't see any reason to stick with W10 if I can't even get
 some support on problems.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>finally it's here. :) HERE favorites migration will be possible after June 30 directly from Windows Maps.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Here is what transitioning your phone favorites from HERE to the Windows 10 Maps app means for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you currently use HERE apps on Windows 10:</strong> When the HERE apps stop working on June 30, today’s Windows Maps app update will take care of migrating your phone HERE favorites upon your first visit to the Favorites pane or the Maps Settings
 page. Also, upon upgrading to the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, we will remove any existing non-working HERE apps from your device.</li><li><strong><strong>If you&nbsp;</strong></strong><strong>currently use HERE apps on Windows Phone 8 or Windows Phone 8.1:</strong>&nbsp; Your HERE apps will not automatically be removed; however, the apps will not be updated going forward.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the latest on maps and
 navigation scenarios, we recommend upgrading to Windows 10 wherein the Windows Maps app will be your default mapping experience and will prompt you to migrate your phone HERE favorites upon your first visit to the favorites menu.</li></ul>

            <p>So how does this exactly work for me? &nbsp;It says "if you are currently using HERE apps on Windows 10..." &nbsp;But I am not any more using HERE apps, they are no longer available for Windows 10. &nbsp;How can I migrate my HERE favorites to Windows Maps? &nbsp;Any why the
 limit of only 300 favorites? &nbsp;I have over 1,000. &nbsp;So while certainly some progress, this is still half-**** not working.</p>

            Yes, you'll probably need to install some printing software to your device.&nbsp; PrintCE is not compatible with WM5 or WM6 devices, but you could try one of these:<br />

<h2>            OneDrive not Syncing with OneDrive Phone App &#40;Folders&#41;</h2>
                    <p>The OneDrive on my computer has files stored in different folders, but when I open my OneDrive phone app it doesn't sync. Is there a reason for this? Does it usually take a while for it to sync up with the phone app?
</p>
<p><br />
Thank you! </p>

            Thanks Vijay for your help. I actually deleted the app and the reinstalled&nbsp; it on my iphone. It now reflects the current folders. I am just concerned that I will have to delete my app each time unless perhaps there is a lag time.

            <p>You cannot do this with the Safety Scanner without the use of the task scheduler or some external automation program and then it will still fail as it needs to be freshly downloaded when the definitions expire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should be using your installed antivirus software to perform a scheduled scan.</p>
