<h2>            HUP</h2>
                    <p>Morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I joined a new company in December which will also incorporate working from home. I have purchased a new laptop and am looking to install Microsoft office professional plus 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received an email from my company stating that they have a HUP deal to get this for £9.95. I used the link provided on the email I received to register my email address. I received a reply from microsoft saying unfortunately this email address isn't recognised?
 I also have a code that was provided but I haven't found anywhere to enter this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The company I work for has 9000 employees globally that received this email. I am unsure of why this isn't working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently trying to speak with an advisor on the microsoft chat but this has been trying to connect for about 2 hours?</p>
<p>
</p><p>can someone help please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kieran</p>

<p>I have checked the affected user, the email address with the custom domain hasn’t been assigned to the affected user.</p>
<p>Please try using PowerShell cmdlets to check if it works.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>There are two things to check first:The computers recieving the files have SP2 for Office 2007 installed - choose Office Button, Excel Options, Resources, and check the bottom line for a reference to SP2. 2. Make sure they are running the most current printer
 drivers - go to the manufacturer's website and download and install the latest drivers.</p>
<p>Regarding trucated pictures - are you copying a range contain pictures or the pictures themselves?&nbsp; If you are copying a range it sounds as though that it is being copied as a picture?</p>
<p>Regarding the clipboard:</p>
<p>That usually can be fixed by deleting the Data key in the registry. This article provides a "Fix it for me" button that can fix automatically, and it shows you how to fix it yourself:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940791</a></p>

<p>Regarding using multiple versions, you can but its advisable to install the earlier one first and be careful not to remove the earlier version when installing the later version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope some of the above helps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Shane,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the help.</p>
<p>I checked and the excel system and it has SP2 &nbsp;so I have to see if the printer drivers are updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the&nbsp;trucated&nbsp;pictures I'm actually copying data and not pictures when I'm getting the errors. The errors are&nbsp;appearing&nbsp;when I'm copying&nbsp;several&nbsp;line at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The refresh screen is my main problem because you can't do any operation with the excel screen will refresh thats why I'm thinking about doing the downgrade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>
<p>Aya.</p>

<p>Part of the problem with refresh may be solved with the printer drivers.&nbsp; In addition 2007 is more graphically intense so it may require a more powerful graphics card.&nbsp; I'm not suggesting you get one, only that that may be an issue.</p>
<p>If you are not copying pictures I don't know why you would get that error message.&nbsp; Are you using Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V, not the copy picture command?</p>
<p>You also should look at the two links I gave you.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks again for all the help.</p>
<p>I did upgraded my printer driver and I still have this problem of screen refresh if you have any other suggestions I'll be greatful. my screen graphics is relatively new like the computer 6 mo. and is integrated graphic Rhaden 3400 series</p>
<p>The truncated picture problem occurs when i copying many columns or copy more than one time, some time it appears with another error:</p>
<p>"excel cannot complete this task with available resources choose less data or close other application" if I press Ok and continue its continue working.</p>
<p>It seems too me all his memory is full but I'm not sure why.</p>
<p>I did follow part of the recommendation of the files you send it seems so far that clipboard problem is over.</p>
<p>the refresh problem is my main pain since it happens all the time no matter what I do and how big is the Excel sheet.</p>
<p>The excel 2007 has also tendency to crush if I working on it with more than one file opens. It could happen 2-3 time per day depend how much i use it. most of the time he recover the the files but for time to time i loose my job and had to start over.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why I have all this problems especially since the same office was install on my old computer with XP and worked perfectly</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>One user had this problem and they did:</p>
<p>1. SOLUTION: Finally was able to get rid of the problem ... I removed my clipboard enhancement application along with my memory optimizer application, rebooted and the problem was solved. Between the 2 of them one was definitely the culprit though I haven't
 had the time to pinpoint which one exactly as I wasted so much time troubleshooting.Hope this helps all others looking for a solution to this kind of issue.</p>
<p>Of course you may not have anything like that installed.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;You also could&nbsp;boot Excel in Safe mode&nbsp;and see if the problem diappears:</p>
<p>Try opening Excel in application safe mode and check if the same issue persists. To open Excel in application safe, click on Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Microsoft Office &gt; Press and hold the ‘Ctrl’ key and click ‘Microsoft Office Excel 2007’. If it works fine
 in Excel safe mode then disable the add-in(s) for it using the steps given here:<br />

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>Thanks for all the suggestions.</p>
<p>I tried all your solutions but nothing worked:</p>
<p>I deleted files from Temp folder but I stilled got the same error message "The picture is too big and will be truncated"</p>
<p>so then I checked but I did not find similar software installed on my computer (memory optimizer application, etc.).</p>
<p>I started the excel with safe mode and when I copied data lines ,I got the same error even if I copied few lines.</p>
<p>I noticed that if the clipboard is open and I constantly press on clear all I get less error message.</p>
<p>Usually after The first error I get second error saying "Excel complete this task with available resources. choose less data or close other application".</p>
<p>This error can appear even you copy few line and Excel is the only thing working.</p>
<p>Its really annoying and I appreciate any help since nothing so far worked.</p>
<p>Is there option to remove the clipboard completely?</p>
<p>Thank you again,</p>
<p>A.</p>

<h2>            Groove Music opens music file but doesn&#39;t play it.</h2>
                    <p>Working from within File Explorer, Groove Music will open but will not play music (wav or mp3) except on perceptively rare instances (I believe this is when I first start my computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attempted to restore default libraries and cleaned out the Temp folder. I've also run an SFC check..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, Groove Music does play music that has been imported into it's own library, but again an outside file will not execute when prompted in File Explorer, only Groove Music will open and sit atop other windows idle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some help understanding this issue and instructions to change configurations either via Control Panel, Registry or Command Prompt would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Cannot &#34;move&#34; email between forlders within PST file</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I am experiencing strange behaviour with my new installation of Office 2010.&nbsp; I cannot freely drag messages from one folder to another (within my personal PST file).<br />
<br />
At the same time I cannot undo file movement.&nbsp; Say I delete an email (not permanently) I used to be able to choose undo and back it came. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
So this has a double effect.&nbsp; If say I dragged an email to the wrong folder I cannot undo it and then I cannot manually move it back to the ordinal folder or any other.<br />
<br />
I have discovered that if I choose Junk Email / never block sender... I can then move the email....but only once.&nbsp; It does not remember this I have to choose "never block sender again" and then can move "once" again to any folder.&nbsp; It seems that it is some
 kind of a security setting!<br />
<br />
Strange.....any help appreciated.<br />
<br />

            <p>I have several POP accounts and one IMAP account.&nbsp; For one account I have both IMAP and POP3 options loaded.&nbsp; I use the POP3 for general inbox download and then use the IMAP to see other folders on the server like SPAM where i can delete
 in Outlook and not have to go and log in to a web site.&nbsp; I have had this setup in Outlook 2007 and 2003 before without issue.<br />
<br />
With regards to moving an email..... i should be more specific.&nbsp; I CAN move an email from my inbox to another folder ONCE.&nbsp; Eg. I can move from inbox to a folder called received, or deleted or any other.&nbsp;&nbsp; But only ONCE.&nbsp; If I move the file by mistake and then
 go into the folder to try and move the email back&nbsp; to the original or to another folder I cannot.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to be able to move emails freely and expect this is the correct function.<br />
<br />
With regards to what happens.&nbsp; If I try and drag an email to another folder...nothing.&nbsp; No error message nothing.&nbsp; Same if I choose to "move to" another folder.&nbsp; Nothing.<br />
<br />
WIth regards to UNDO.&nbsp; I can choose to delete a message and it goes into the deleted folder.&nbsp; In past i could click UNDO and it would come back to the original folder.&nbsp; No more!&nbsp; Same basic problem.&nbsp; The message can be moved only once and when it has been moved
 cannot be manually moved back or to another folder or by way of the UNDO button.<br />
<br />
It seems that when the message has been moved once it is somehow tagged not to be able to move again.....<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

However I have further discovered that it seems to be<span style="font-weight: bold">

Also note that I have completely removed my IMAP account from Outlook and now only use POP with the same problem.<br />

You don't need to create a new account, however can configure the same email account in new Outlook profile.

            Hi magnumjoe<br />
<br />
If you are trying to do a hard reset on a Nokia N78, then you need to use a different key selection.<br />
<br />
The keys you need to be pressing together are 3 * and Multimedia key.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<h2>            Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007 Download &#40;good copy&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    I had to upgrade my father's conputer from Windows XP to Windows 7 and now I find myself still having a really hard time trying to locate a download for Office Enterprise 2007. He never got a disk when he bought the computer but he had the product ID and
 the CD Key so I thought that it should not be a problem to find a download and then I would have him up and running. However, I am not able to locate a leget download most of the so called downloads on the net are just junk, they claim one thing and you get
 nothing but a bunch of junk that you don't even want. So if anyone knows where I can find a place where I can download a good copy of this version I would really appreciate it. Thanks so much in advance. Liane Bamburg

 and drop) it in your C:\Windows\Fonts folder. &nbsp;Also, if you don't like the download idea, you may be able to find it on the install CD buried in one of the CAB files. &nbsp;Hope this helps.

            <p>Okay, so I found the real fix. I faced this problem too after I installed build 10074 on my PC, and I want to share with you a fix and a possible cause of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, how to fix it. The problem is that the Settings app has not been&nbsp;properly&nbsp;registered in the system, that's why you get all those "ms-settings://... is not registered with any application" errors.</p>
<p>To re-register the Settings app, open <strong>Powershell</strong> prompt and execute the following command:</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>Now you'll have Settings app and "ms-settings" protocol work correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the cause. I believe the issue lays somewhere in one of the build 10074 updates, or the whole Windows Update system. I haven't faced this issue when I installed 10074 on Day 0, but when I reinstalled it several times recently I always got non-working
 Settings app. To check this theory, I reinstalled build 10074 once again, but this time I unplugged LAN cord that came to my PC from the router, so I haven't had Internet connection entirely. Everything went fine, and after the setup was complete, the Settings
 app was working!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you are making a clean install of build 10074, it's better to disconnect your PC from the Internet. Who knows which issues may come up.</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bing Rewards currently available in Australia, Canada, United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Germany.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why Firefox &amp; Chrome searches counted as desktop?</p>
<p>It is because of your tablet's user agent. Bing Rewards works on browser user agent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If apps doesn't adding point to your Microsoft Rewards, try searching with browser.</p>

            I have received this same error 3 times now...&nbsp; Twice before, I used the Office 2013 uninstall utility to remove Office, followed by a successful reinstall of the suite, only to receive the same error a few days to a week later.&nbsp; I just received the error
 again after having used the uninstall utility only two days ago.&nbsp; I've had Office Professional Plus 2013 on my system for probably a year without any problems&nbsp;before this issue arose&nbsp;around the beginning of March.&nbsp; What is causing this and how can it be avoided?&nbsp;
 Apparently, simply uninstalling the program and reinstalling it isn't fixing the issue.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note<span>: </span></span></strong><span><span>Ensure to read the disclaimer or take a backup of the registry before modifying it.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once removed restart the computer and try to reinstall the Office suite.</p>
<p>

Hello ,<br />
<br />
I have exactly the same problem with this Office 2013. Worked perfectly for almost 8 months, but by the end of March I have the same problems ...<br />
<br />
No one from Microsoft support couldn´t help me.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;They told me &nbsp;"just reinstall it " .. but it works for maybe 3 or 4 days. And then the same error occurs ..<br />
<br />
And the last one ...<br />
<br />
I bought a brand new notebook HP EliteBook G840 . I did just clear new installation , and I installed the new Office 2013 license there.<br />
<br />
After installation, everything looked good. I was able to set the applications Word , Excel , PowerPoint, Outlook ... There were no problems .. But when I have made ​​this clear Office installation and installed updates for Office, the same error code &nbsp;2-3
 appeared on the screen "Office couldn´t be streamed" .. "Cannot find the source of the installation file" , but which file ..? ! Update file .. ? ! or what ..? ! !<br />
<br />
I installed my office from the installation DVD that I made from my account on the website office.com ....<br />
<br />
Installation is brand new, with all drivers. Just "Windows 7x64 Pro" and Office 2013 nothing unusual (HW, SW)<br />
<br />
I'm really disappointed of the behavior of this product .. and I do not know what to do now .. I really need Office product for my work .. and I bought this product .. ! So, I want to make it work ..!<br />
<br />
I have experience with Office 97 to 2010 ... but none of them was not so bad ..! !<br />
<br />
If there is somebody who could help me , I´ll be happiest human in the World<br />
<br />
Thank you so much..!!<br />
<br />
Petr<br />

            <p>Hello Carolyn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow these steps and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Restart your phone and make sure that your phone is not in Flight (Airplane) mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. Check the signal strength on the phone screen, and move to an area with better reception. If you continuously experience low signal strength in a certain area, the mobile network coverage may be insufficient there. With Netradar you can check mobile operator
 coverage maps. The maps are available at <a href="http://www.netradar.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.netradar.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Change network selection mode to automatic. Select Settings &gt; Network &amp; wireless &gt; Mobile &amp; SIM &gt; Sim settings. Ensure that Network selection is set for automatic.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>d. Remove any accessory covers or shells from the phone temporarily to check if they affect the signal strength.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>e. Check that your SIM card is fully inserted. If possible, try your SIM card in another phone and/or try another SIM card with your phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Do not use SIM cards that have been modified to fit the SIM slot. If a regular SIM card has been cut to a smaller SIM format you will have to contact your operator to order a replacement SIM.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep us updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>The problem is that the toggle for airplane mode cannot be 'depressed', so these suggested steps are not going to work. A search for 'airplane mode stuck lumia' will bring up numerous threads on the same problem. My guess: there's a type of hardware problem
 that will cause the OS to report that airplane mode is on. Maybe some system level failure of the antenna assembly (?). The fact that the user sees this as 'airplane mode on' leads to a lot of confusion. It would be great if you can get hardware and software
 engineers together to find out how this could ever happen.</p>

<p>After several years of using Lumia devices the described error now also happened to me on a Lumia 950XL after an update was applied on Thursday night 14th April 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All described solutions to solve the issue did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Device Information:</strong></p>
<p>Operating system build: 10.0.14393.1066</p>
<p>Firmware revision number: 01078.00053.16236.35006</p>
<p>Hardware revision number: 4.0.1.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Error Descriptions:</strong></p>
<p>I.&nbsp;In the "Phone screen" when trying to make a call it reads "phone off". But the&nbsp;flight mode symbol is not showing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/583657bf-50d6-478c-aa45-5e582f6aa419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/583657bf-50d6-478c-aa45-5e582f6aa419" height="508" width="278" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>II. After dialing the numbers a message appears informing that the phone is in flight mode.</p>
<p>The user is asked to activate the mobile connection. Confirming to connect has no effect. After about 20 seconds of not performing any other action an error message appears informing that some error happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>III.&nbsp;In Settings &gt; Network &amp; wireless &gt; Mobile &amp; SIM you can observe that the airplane symbol is showing next to the SIM profile created by the Network provider. Nevertheless once again the flight mode symbol is not showing in the upper&nbsp;left corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/896de97e-daac-4c05-b5fa-78f4e983e97e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/896de97e-daac-4c05-b5fa-78f4e983e97e" height="509" width="277" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>IV. Changing the&nbsp;network selection mode is not possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;All options under Settings &gt; Network &amp; wireless &gt; Mobile &amp; SIM &gt; SIM settings are greyed out and cannot be altered.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a09cb2a-d30a-476e-8581-4b9882437f8f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a09cb2a-d30a-476e-8581-4b9882437f8f" height="512" width="284" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>V. - The flight mode button in the quick symbol&nbsp;can be toggled on and off. Nevertheless clicking the button on and off triggers for the airplane symbol on the flight mode quick button to blink between fully showing and being greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15d0214f-c43a-40c4-95b4-82d0de8f31d4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15d0214f-c43a-40c4-95b4-82d0de8f31d4" height="508" width="284" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>V. Switching flight mode on and off under Settings &gt; Flight Mode is possible. But the phone screen keeps being stuck in the described off state (I.)&nbsp;when turning it off and on again.</p>

<p>I upgraded my 950 on 17th April and met the identical problem. The IMEI and MEID of my 950 displays weird characters. I think rewriting the IMEI might solve the problem, but I have no idea how to do that. Does your phone display the IMEI and MEID properly?</p>
<p>Besides, today I went to an official repair shop. The repair fee is too high that I can buy a new 950.</p>

    <title>Rounding when exporting a query with a double to CSV - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> louis rossouw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rounding when exporting a query with a double to CSV</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I recently tried exporting a query to a CSV from Access.&nbsp; The query has a large number of records (+-230 000).&nbsp; Some of the results are doubles and when exported random values in the same column get rounded to two decimals (i.e. 0.00) and random values get
 exported to the csv as scientific with full precision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seems to be a bug.&nbsp; It either should export full precision or stick to the formatting of the field.&nbsp;It was so problematic that the total for the data was siginificantly different than it should be on the CSV compared to adding it in Access via a summation
 query.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was trying to get the data to Excel, so instead tried importing the data into Excel directly using the Access import feature.&nbsp; This did not result in the same problem.</p>
<p>However I'm quite concerned that I cannot effectively trust the CSV export functionality from Access.&nbsp; I have used it quite often in the past and I'm worried how much errors had been introduced in my work in this way. Is there something I'm doing wrong?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            What are you using to export?&nbsp; Are you using TransferText or TransferSpreadsheet?&nbsp; And are you using an Export Specification?

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently trying to configure my SPF records so I can verify my sending domains via Mandrillapp (mandrillapp.com).</p>

            <p>Hi Reginald Andre,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description, you are using the same domains for Office 365 and Mandrill app as the sending domains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the situation, you need to set one SPF record as below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Values: v=spf1 include:sharepointonline.com include:spf.mandrillapp.com -all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Office 365, "sharepointonline.com" in an SPF record includes email from both Exchange Online (Outlook) and SharePoint Online, you can refer to the following article to check the detailed information.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/External-Domain-Name-System-records-for-Office-365-c0531a6f-9e25-4f2d-ad0e-a70bfef09ac0#BKMK_SPFrecords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/External-Domain-Name-System-records-for-Office-365-c0531a6f-9e25-4f2d-ad0e-a70bfef09ac0#BKMK_SPFrecords</a></p>

            <p>Hi Franky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. My main issue is there are 3 SPF records which I believe were created automatically by Office 365 when I setup my Exchange email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can edit either one of them to include "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">include:spf.mandrillapp.com", but when I try to verify this setting on Mandrillapp dashboard, it detects multiple SPF records on my domain DNS (PII removed by
 moderator) and fails.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Do you have any guidelines on how to remove or consolidate the SPF records into one?</span></p>

            <p>Hi Reginald Andre,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office 365 won’t create multiple SPF records on your domain DNS provider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the situation, I suggest you remove the other two SPF records and leave one with following format:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>v=spf1 ip4:XX.XXX.XXX.XXX include:sharepointonline.com include:spf.mandrillapp.com include:mail.contoso.com -all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Franky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for being vague, my current DNS are managed via Office 365, and when looking at the DNS records, I saw the following SPF records under "Exchange Online":</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34d6e780-a420-4ca3-89bd-6c4ef43b51d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34d6e780-a420-4ca3-89bd-6c4ef43b51d5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no "Delete" options available, so I assume these records are tied to my Exchange Online account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a guideline on how to consolidate them into one single SPF record so I can pass the Mandrillapp verification check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Reginald Andre,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;It’s not feasible to delete the SPF record for a domain which is managed by Office 365.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the situation, I suggest you modify all the SPF records with the same value like v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com include:spf.mandrillapp.com -all to check how it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I suggest you submit feedback about the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">verification check of&nbsp;</span>multiple SPF records to Mandrill, or move to another DNS provider as a workaround.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Franky</p>

    <title>How do you rename an data file linked to an IMAP email account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajack01  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you rename an data file linked to an IMAP email account&#63;</h2>
                    When you add an IMAP email account to Outlook 2007 a data file is created for that email account.&nbsp; The file is assigned an automatically generated file name - there is no way to specify the name of the data file that I can see when you setup the email
 account.&nbsp; I've attempted to rename the file in windows explorer thinking that when I opened Outllook it would prompt me to locate the renamed data file.&nbsp; Unfortunately this doesn't happen and outlook just creates a new data file instead.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance to anyone who has a solution to this problem! &nbsp;
