    <title>Windows 10 File Explorer Query. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobbygunner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 File Explorer Query.</h2>
                    Using File Explorer View/Sort on a folder, my .JPG files are displayed in my desired filename sequence. When I use iTunes to copy them to my iPhone Photos App, the sequence is different. Is this because they are copied in the computer's physical sequence?
 How can I get the desired sequence on the iPhone? The symptoms are the same when I use FE to copy to a flash drive for viewing on a TV.

<p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>Many thanks for your reply and suggestions.</p>
<p>I have no problems with the YY-MM sort keys I use; FE displays the desired sequence. It seems my problem rests either with the iPhone software (and TV software) or with the true physical sequence of files and folders on my computer which the other devices
 read.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I conclude that I have no Windows 10 problem. I shall pursue the matter with Apple.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10. Pics from SD card arrive on computer but can&#39;t import - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nigelgmiller  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10. Pics from SD card arrive on computer but can&#39;t import</h2>
                    <p>Pictures from my SD card automatically transfer to computer and appear on my monitor in Photos Collection. Very nice. But, when I take the next step and select "Import" I am told to "Connect the Device you want to import from and make sure its turned on
 and unlocked " No, that is not what I want to do. (Tried yellow slide on card, not the problem).</p>
<p>All the pics are right there before me on the monitor. I want them In Pictures where I can access for upload to eBay. Right? The Import option at this stage should get the photos to Pictures, as was basically the way it worked before Windows 10 update. Please
 help someone,&nbsp;I would be grateful. Nigel. </p>

            <p>Thanks for your suggestions, but we are not making headway. Since the very first day of Windows 10 new picture imports don't go to Pictures. I insert my SD card, photo Collection screen appears and I can see the photos are loading. I then take the option
 to import and that is where the problem comes in. A message "Connect to the device you want to import from" pops up&nbsp;I mentioned that before. And that is it. I don't have a device to connect to, other than the camera itself, but I don't believe that is the
 way. The SD card is in the computer, the pictures have been loaded and are waiting for the command "Import", but that is being stonewalled.
</p>
<p>Now something mysterious has occurred. All the photos that I could not import yesterday, somehow over night, without a request or instruction, no clicking on Import, arrived in photo Collections ? &nbsp;Right away I took 2 new photos, inserted the memory card,
 but once again, I could not import the new ones. Back to square one. But it got worse. My first attempt I saw the 2 new photos loading, and then appear in Collections. I just tried again, and the card is not even registering in&nbsp;"This PC" Devices and Drives.
</p>
<p>When I go to File Explorer, it is just like clicking Pictures. I get the old photos that I had before Windows 10 was installed. The new photos that mysteriously have appeared are separate in Collections, not combined in Pictures. &nbsp;And now I can't get any
 more imported there anywhere.&nbsp;I am using&nbsp;the internal card reader. Ran method 1, and method 2 takes me all the way to selecting the drivers but there is no option to update, not that way anyway.
</p>
<p>In summary. After numerous attempts to import all the photos off the SD card yesterday, failure. All worked perfectly right up to the option to import. I could see the upload process underway, the photos appear in photo collections, but the moment I took
 the option to Import, up came the instruction "Connect to the device you want to import from" Road block effectively right there. But mysteriously, over night all those photos I noticed were in photo Collections. But when I tried to Import 2 brand new "test"
 photos, I am back to the original problem.&nbsp;"Connect to the device_ _"&nbsp;The problem has not seemed to be the internal reader for it would time and time again get the photos to photo Collections, no problem. Nigel.

            <p>Thanks for your suggestion. The SD card registered fine on another computer (which was&nbsp; long way away, so part of the delay for me). I have bought an external reader and that is also accepting the SD card. I can open the pictures on my computer from the
 card. But, the real problem still is here. I can't import. Are you familiar with the new Windows 10 photo set up. If you want to go to Pictures with Windows 10 all you have to do is click the Picture tile that has photos changing in it all the time, and you
 go to Photo. Collections. That is where you are given the option to Import. That is where the problem is. I click on that option but up pops the instruction "CONNECT TO THE DEVICE YOU WANT TO IMPORT FROM. AND MAKE SURE IT'S TURNED ON AND UNLOCKED" and then
 underneath the options "Try Again" and "Close" </p>
<p>Okay, as I say, that is exactly where the problem lies. The card&nbsp;reader is working. I can open the files on the computer and look at the photos, but I want them transferred to Pictures in Microsoft Windows, but that instruction is telling me to do something
 it shouldn't be. I should not have to connect any device, only the memory card, right? And the&nbsp;SD card is working&nbsp;fine.&nbsp;(There oddly was a problem with the internal reader, (only since Windows 10, not a single time before),it went away, and came back. The
 external reader &nbsp;has over come that problem). Thanks, I wait for your reply, Nigel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi, no reply yet, and all this is causing problems for me, particularly not being able to upload photos to the Internet, specifically eBay and KSL. I now have photos in 2 basic areas, Pictures in File Explorer and Photos in All App.&nbsp;<strong>I cannot upload
 photos, not that I can tell, from Photo&nbsp;App to eBay.</strong> I can in Pictures via File Explorer.&nbsp;A double click on the picture in Pictures and in seconds it is uploaded. That is not the case if you go to Photo.&nbsp;Collections.&nbsp;(Photo&nbsp;App) . Double clicking
 on a selected photo is not uploading it to eBay. So now what? </p>
<p>And then the other initial problem I have mentioned and not yet resolved. <strong>
Please describe to me how to Import pics when that instruction to Connect to a Device appears each time I click on Import while the SD Card is in the reader.</strong> I can access the photos via File Explorer, but I am not being allowed to Import. Can someone
 please answer as soon as possible. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other issues too, randomly some pics from the SD card appear in Pictures our of the blue&nbsp;without an Import procedure having been carried out, SD card&nbsp;long removed from Reader the day before when attempts were made, for example, and then they disappear.
 But for now don't worry about that. I am just mentioning it. I hope it doesn't keep happening though. (I would prefer if all my photos went to the old Pictures and stay there because I have no problem getting them to eBay from there)</p>

<p>Hello StefanoMalavasi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the issue, please follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a different Internet connection and try signing in to Skype.</li><li>Use a different Skype account and log in to you Windows XP device.</li><li>Log in to Skype for Web.</li></ul>
<p>Also, make sure you're using Skype version 7.36. This build gets downloaded when Skype is downloaded from Skype.com using an XP machine. Downloads using other operating systems or websites will tend to provide you with the wrong version. Higher than 7.36
 can no longer be installed, unless you are running a higher version of Windows OS such as 8, 8.1 and 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of these steps worked, please check the message I sent you for further discussion.</p>

            use Show Key Plus to find your product key - see instructions:
<br />
<br />How to Find Your Product Key After Upgrading to Windows 10
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/find-windows-product-key-after-upgrading-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/find-windows-pr...</a>
<br />
<br />After downloading it, extract the zip file then launch ShowKeyPlus.exe.
<br />
<br />
<br />ShowKeyPlus will reveal your product key and license information such as:
<br />
<br />Product Name
<br />Product ID
<br />The currently installed key, which is the generic product key used by Windows 10 depending on the edition installed.
<br />The Original product key. This can be your Windows 7 or Windows 8 retail or OEM product key before upgrading. This is the product key you want if you encounter product activation issues in Windows 10.
<br />OEM Key OR Retail: ShowKeyPlus will check for the presence of an OEM marker; that is how big name vendors activate multiple machines at the factory running Windows.

            In Windows 10 keys do not matter. As soon as you do a clean install Windows would automatically activate when it connects to the Internet, for the first time, provided you install the same version as was installed before.

<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps you need to update your keyboard device driver.
<span>
Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also
 conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you do for your keyboard), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should
 turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows: </span><span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span><span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:

                    <p>After several time I keep getting dumped by windows 8.1 which then crashes again before i can do anything! The problem, I think, is one of the drivers I have updated with "Your PC ran into a problem and must restart" WRITE TO READONLY MEMORY in module bSciSDa.sys.</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP! I have already sent it back to ACER after all helpdesk advised me it was the hard drive BUT it wasISn't so I need to first get out of this no boot booting loop I am NOW stuck in!

<p>If I can't resolve this Microsoft needs someone to Systemically analyze and repair, with their proprietary knowledge that only they allow themselves to know!</p>

Hi,<br />
<br />
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the zip containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply. Preferred sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers, download managers, etc.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel-Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel-Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel-Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel-Dump is the best
 choice. Do note that Kernel-Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong></em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload photos and files to Onedrive.</a><br />
<br />
After doing that, to learn how to share the link to the file if you are unaware, please visit the following link -
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Share files and folders and change permissions</a> and view <strong>'Get a link'</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUpUtilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete .DMP files upon use. With this said, if you've run such software, you will need to allow the system to crash once again to generate a crash dump.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

            Hi April.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try a new battery, another USB port, make sure the mouse is switched on underneath, push the Reset button.
<br />
<br />Next go into Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, find mouse device, right click to Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />Check for Updates in WIndows Update, expedite install of all until it possibly provides newer drivers or enabling software.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Spam and unwanted emails since October upgrade of Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Spam and unwanted emails since October upgrade of Windows 10.</h2>
                    Ever since I upgraded to the Windows 10 October 2019 upgrade, I have been receiving disgusting spam and unwanted emails.&nbsp; I do not use Outlook, so please do not give me instructions on how to get rid of them through Outlook.&nbsp; I use Thunderbird and did
 not have that problem until I upgraded.&nbsp; I don't think it matters which app is used for emails, because it has nothing to do with that app, but with the upgraded Windows 10.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

<p>I find it very unlikely that version 1809 would have affected your emails and more likely a coincidence. Do Bell offer any ways of marking spam on their website so you don't see it in Thunderbird, you would need to login to their site email page using your
 email and password.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bell.net/loginr/wmwrap.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bell.net/loginr/wmwrap.jsp</a></p>

            Hello <br />
<br />
I'm Independent Advisor, here to help you with your question. <br />
<br />
Please run Windows Update troubleshooter from Settings app &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot. See if it works.
<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try this: <br />
<br />
Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key.
<br />
<br />
net stop wuauserv <br />
net stop cryptSvc <br />
net stop bits <br />
net stop msiserver <br />
Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old <br />
Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old <br />
net start wuauserv <br />
net start cryptSvc <br />
net start bits <br />
net start msiserver <br />
<br />
Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then. <br />
<br />
To fix Windows Defender: <br />
<br />
Run services.msc to open Services Manager. Ensure that the Windows Defender service is started and set to Automatic.
<br />
<br />
You may need to re-register the following dll files and see if it helps you. Run each command in an elevated command prompt one after the other and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />
regsvr32 wuaueng.dll <br />
regsvr32 wucltui.dll <br />
regsvr32 softpub.dll <br />
regsvr32 wintrust.dll <br />
regsvr32 initpki.dll <br />
regsvr32 wups.dll <br />
regsvr32 wuweb.dll <br />
regsvr32 atl.dll <br />
regsvr32 mssip32.dll <br />
<br />
Also run regedit command and navigate to the following key: <br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender <br />
<br />
Here ensure that the value of these DWORDS is 0: DisableAntiSpyware and DisableAntiVirus.
<br />
<br />
Let us know if this helps!

            Hi Zandrux.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What I'd do at this point is do a Clean Install  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />It is also one of life's great learning experiences that will permanently make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to keep it that way.   Not one of the millions of consumers who have complete my Clean Install tutorials in the past ten years has ever come back to report such problems as you describe, so this is why I think it will benefit you a lot.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Done. Worked now, I do have a concern though. Before, I reset my windows because of this problem, and I got it to work, then few days later the same problem then I followed your fix. If this happens again, what would you think is wrong? Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello Lucky!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for posting on Xbox Forums! I understand that this situation can be frustrating but, I will be happy to assist you with it today! Just to clarify, are you trying to add billing info on your console while also adding a credit or debit card on
 your account? If so, I would suggest trying to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/payment-and-purchases/manage-payment-options-on-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
add or update your info</a> on the website first. If that doesn't work either I would then suggest troubleshooting your console. You can try to
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Power Cycle</a> the console to see if that resolves the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you have any further questions or concerns, do not hesitate to reply back letting us know. Again, thank you for posting on Xbox Forums!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Chrome not working</h2>
                    I'm on Win10 (not like I had much choice) and hate Edge, so I use Chrome. But now when it opens, it immediately closes. I disabled Edge a while back by changing the file name so I can't use that. Is this Microsoft being massive **** or something else?
 I have to use my phone.

I would appreciate if you answered the question instead of dodging it. Have you made it so Chrome does not work on windows 10 now? It's been working perfectly fine up till now.

<p>Chrome works well on my copy of Windows 10. And I didn't have to rename files to get it to work properly. Chrome has always been my default browser. I know ... you'd rather hear me say how terrible Microsoft is. But the fact is, Chrome works just fine on
 Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you can identify a specific or potentially specific reason why Chrome isn't working, you'll need to do the standard troubleshooting procedures, starting with disabling all extensions and the progressing from there, if needed, to reinstalling Chrome.</p>

            I can't get onto Chrome for any of that. It closes shortly after opening and I renamed the microsoft edge folder ages ago cuz it was annoying and i wanted to disable it.

<p>Likewise I have Chrome running fine, no bodging required to get it working.&nbsp; In fact I have Edge, Chrome and IE all co-existing quite happily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So at a high level yes Chrome works on Windows 10.&nbsp; If there is a problem with your install its most likely a local problem, not an overall "you can't use Chrome on W10" kind of thing.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you didn't receive your shipping label after arranging your service order online. There are several methods in shipping or returning back your device to Microsoft which depends on your region. Now, the best thing to do is to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact support</a>&nbsp;or
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers</a>&nbsp;about this, provide the service order number so that they can discuss the process and resend you the shipping label according to your order and choice of shipping method.</p>

<h2>            ScreenBeemMini2 Wireless Display Adapter firmware update problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello Insiders, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had some issues upgrading my ScreenBeemMini2 Wireless Display Adapter firmware using the ScreenBeam Configuration Utility app in the Windows Store. It may have just been my configuration but this is what I did to apply the update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the adapter on a Dell U2410 and the app fetched the update and try's to install it the and the screen go black like it says it was suppose to but nothing happens. The install says don't unplug power during the update. Looking at the adapter once the
 screen goes black after 5 min of waiting, the adapter light is off. So I unplugged it and tried it again from another PC, yet I get the same result.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to take the adapter and plug it into a TV monitor, following the same steps and the screen goes black for just a few seconds and it finished the update. Now I have the latest firmware 5.3.8.0.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this was helpful let me know. Todd</p>

            I had a similar experience with a different setup - I had the adapter powered by USB, but not plugged into an HDMI port.&nbsp; I used the ScreenBeam app on the phone to connect to it wirelessly, and perform the update.&nbsp; It went through the steps in a very normal-looking
 way, then just sort of ... finished.&nbsp; There was no sort of status update, but the instruction card was pretty specific that you shouldn't interrupt the process.&nbsp; I tried reconnecting to it from the phone a few times, nothing; I was pretty sure I had bricked
 it.&nbsp; I let it sit for about 20 minutes while I was doing something else; still nothing.&nbsp; At that point I unplugged it and went to dinner; when I came back, I plugged it in once more and it was working fine, with the new firmware.&nbsp; So definitely a horrifying
 upgrade process.

            If you download a font and want to install it you have to have it open with/be associated with Windows Font viewer. You want to be able to click on it and install it and you can't if the file is associated with another program and thus just opens as a
 picture in it.

            I already know this! &nbsp;It will NOT work if you do not have it associated with Windows Font Viewer. &nbsp;The install command will not appear unless it is associated with that. &nbsp;Thanks, but this was of no help.

<p>I have gone in and set the Windows Font Viewer numerous times as the default for .ttf files but it continuously goes back to my ACDSee program. &nbsp; I am SOOO tired of resetting this. &nbsp;What can I do to make it stay???</p>
