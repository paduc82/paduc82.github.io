                    Since Updating the phone an hour ago, the problem with the camera opening and closing still persists! to use the camera you will still need to download a third party application

            I think the fact that you have now gone through several different software versions and this is still not working is proof that it is not a software fault that can be easily fixed by just updating it to whatever version you fancy today.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, as you have changed codes and broken the warranty terms, Nokia are not really obliged to help you out.<br />
If it was still in warranty, the best option would be to get the NCP to send it to Nokia and get them to have a look at it, especially if you have taken it to a couple of Care Points and it still cant be fixed.

<h2>            software update interrupted on 6500s</h2>
                    
<p>I tried to update my 6500s software today via cable connection form the computer. It started and then I got a message saying the phone was no longer connected.&nbsp;I left it for about 5 mins but the computed said the program was not working. so I had to disconnect.
 Now the phone won't switch on at all. Does anyone know a way to&nbsp;get the phone on or reset it?</p>

<p>The 6500 is an S40 phone so your options are limited. You won't be able to reset an S40 phone yourself. The only thing you can try is to remove the battery and leave it out for over 5 minutes. If that does not work then I'm afraid it is a trip to the local
 Nokia Care Point.</p>

<h2>            Auto Decline Calendar Requests During Certain hours And Automated Reply</h2>
                    <p>HI there - I am often getting meeting requests from out of time-zone offices&nbsp;requesting meetings at impractical times e.g. middle of the night. I am looking for some help here to have an Auto-Decline for calendar requests during&nbsp;set hours (e.g. set&nbsp;to be
 active daily between 10pm and 6am)&nbsp;with an Automated Reply which I can set: e.g. "I cannot attend a meeting at this time, please&nbsp;suggest a different time".&nbsp; Does anyone know if you can do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your help,</p>

            You can try compacting it without opening it in Access. Open Access and click on Database Tools. Click on Compact. A dialog box will open. Select your file and the destination.
<div><br />
<div>You might have to do this locally. Copy the file to your hard drive and then compact it. Actually, that is always best practice anyway.Compacting a file that is on a network sometimes blows it up.</div>

            It sounds like the file is just plain corrupt.&nbsp;Are all users on the same version of Access?&nbsp;This could be due to someone opening it in Access 2010 and compacting. I've seen that blow up a number of Access files. And not splitting a multi-user database
 is asking for trouble. What was stable for years can suddenly turn into cottage cheese.

            <p>Is it slow deleting large files&nbsp;from your NAS ?<br />
</p>
<p>I have a buffalo link station. When the TrashBox is enabled on that I get a similar problem.&nbsp; When this is enabled, instead of deleting large files the NAS secretly moves them to a TrashBox folder,&nbsp; this is very slow and breaks&nbsp;the Compact/Repair process.&nbsp;
 If you have a similar re-cycle bin type feature&nbsp;on your NAS then you could try disabling it by logging into the NAS's web interface.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You mention a virus, could anti-virus software be affecting it? you could try disabling the AV software on your computer temporarily to see if that is the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does a&nbsp;Database.MDB file appear in the q:\links\ folder while it is doing a compact (when it fails).</p>
<p>When doing a compact/repair, access creates a copy of your database in the folder that the original resides called Database.mdb.&nbsp; This means there needs to&nbsp;be enough space for the extra database.mdb on your drive&nbsp;- so check if that is an issue!.&nbsp; If completed
 successfully then the original gets deleted and the new one gets renamed.&nbsp; In older versions of Access the %temp% folder was used instead, so perhaps you could check your Temp folder and permissions on that if your are using Acc2000.</p>
<p><br />
Check you NAS for disk errors using the NAS's web interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try repairing/re-installing Access -- this may fix any problems caused by </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, then a bit more info, like version of Access and OS, do all the computers have the problem or is it just selected computers,&nbsp;make/model&nbsp;of NAS,&nbsp; size of database file, any AV or Anti-spyware software you are running.</p>

            <p>Well, if you can't open the file anymore it might be corrupted.&nbsp; (Hope you have a backup).&nbsp; In the meantime you can make a copy of the file and try to import all the objects into a new clean database.&nbsp; Provided that works...&nbsp; Then you need to split the database,
 see links posted above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have to restore from backup you still need to split.&nbsp; Having multiple Users accessing the same file is corruption waiting to happen.&nbsp; Mind you, as you have experienced, it may not happen right away but it is going to happen.&nbsp; Once split, unless you
 are doing to some heavy processing the need to compact the back end should drop...&nbsp; I have database back ends that have never been compacted and running fine for years but they are split.&nbsp; If anything you can have you Users compact the front end though in
 a properly designed database even this should be neccessay that often.</p>

            <p>In addition to everything else, make sure nobody has the database open when you try to compact. Navigate to the folder containing the database using explorer, and look for a file with the same name as your database but with either a .ldb or .laccdb extention.
 This is a locking file Access creates when the database is opened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that file exists, somebody hads the db open, or Access thinks it is open.&nbsp;If the DB is not properly exited (ie it crashes), then sometimes the locking file is not deleted. If you know for a fact the db is closed, try deleteing the locking file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like everyone has said, you need to split your mutiuser DBs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps<br />

            <p>Thanks for all your input on our problem.&nbsp; I kind of just wanted to hear from other users if it was&nbsp;a well-known problem, or just some new convolution of factors.&nbsp; I've gotten a few more ideas here to check out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is't a multi-user database, and it's not corrupt.&nbsp; It's not even a particular database, it's&nbsp;a new problem with all databases.&nbsp; I'm the only one in it (or my buddies for theirs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe it's an .mdb file; I may check to see if the same thing happens to a .accdb file.&nbsp; We use Access 2007 here, and I've got the choice to use either file extension, but maybe switching to the other would be worth it for some files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Space shouldn't be the issue, but I will verify.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The server people know nothing of Access, and think the C/R funtionality is out of line.&nbsp; They're not application programmers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks anyway!</p>

<h2>            It would be nice if the OS quit trying so hard to get users to log in onto a online MS acccount</h2>
                    <p>On set up most users wouldn't even know they could just do it the old way with how the GUI states the choices are. Is this OS trying to forsake those living in areas with limited/no internet?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should&nbsp;state:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp;Log in to live account</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp;Don't have one, click here to make one</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Make standard User</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;Log in to live account</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp;Don't have one, click here to make one</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also don't like the idea of an OS as a whole being logged on to the internet all the time. Steam gives me grief as is and if windows pulled the same stunt I think that would do it in for me. Not all windows users live in LA or NYC with 1gbs internet that
 never dies with 100+ choices for a ISP. Also on laptops Wi-Fi in public places is risky and flaky so they likely wouldn't be happy about not being able to use the PC at all because they can't log in without good working&nbsp;internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on this? </p>
<p>

            I ran into this problem before with Windows 8/8.1.&nbsp; I for one would rather sign in as a local user during setup then possibly later on get a message about signing into an online account.&nbsp; I don't usually have to worry about it in an enterprise environment
 much as I will be pushing out the OS via an SCCM task sequence.&nbsp; <br />

            <p>I strongly agree with your concerns -- and share your solution. I, too, force a LOCAL logon when I install a new MS OS.&nbsp; Personally, with the nearly daily announcements of user accounts being compromised on one "cloud" after another, I really don't want
 my logon credentials sitting in a cloud somewhere, even if that is MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The simple way to "force" a local logon is to have the network cable disconnected (or, in the case of a laptop, have the Wifi disabled) during install.&nbsp; But, this is probably not obvious for many folks installing the Tech Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, given the obsession these days with the "cloud", I think we're basically beating our heads against the wall here and MS is not going to make local logons easy in the foreseeable future.</p>

            <p>I'd also like to see the "Standard User" account more prominently displayed. people are already wary of online security after the Snowden leaks and the fear-mongering adds up to a of people who, for whatever reason, don't trust Microsoft with their account
 security. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do see the logic behind pushing people to an account that authenticates online. Being able to remote-wipe a machine that's compromised or stolen&nbsp;is a boon to sales for enterprise and SME.

            <p>Another way around this is sign in with a bogus account like 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and after failure, it will then give you an option just to the right of the sign in box to create a local user. I found this out by accident once and was sure glad I messed up.</p>
<p>I would love for Microsoft to make it easier to bypass this, as the cloud is a scary place. I prefer the idea of making it harder to allow hackers to gather information than to place everything in one place, aka the cloud, which is a gold mine for hackers.
 Almost like an easy button. The rants I could go on about this...</p>
<p>I hope Microsoft reads this and recognizes the fact that users will want a local user, as it appears they do want to make one operating system for everything.</p>

            <p>Installation wise I must of missed it asking, that or far to used now to setting up a local account to notice it. As for it coming up and asking for the account, it would be nice if later on it gave a nice reason for it, something along the lines of a "All
 you to download app's, share files with OneDrive, direct access to Outlook.com" or some such to spell out what's being missed and gained by using/not using a MS Account.</p>

            <p>Whether we like it or not, the world is moving toward cloud-based credentials management. Android phones require Google account. iPhones require iCloud account. Blackberry doesn't work without their account. Even my old HP TouchPad required me to create
 their proprietary account for webOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good thing is that all of the login data is duplicated locally. So that when you're disconnected from the Internet, your device isn't bricked. The online account is used for the platform application store management and to synchronize your personalizations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I love how people think that the Internet in the USA is cheap &amp; abundant. The reality is that we have only 1 cable internet provider per location (it changes neighborhood to neighborhood), 2-3 DSL providers (with speeds no higher than 7Mbps), and 1
 fiber optics provider (if you're lucky to have it). Most people are connected at pipes narrower than 30Mbps because wider bandwidths are very expensive.</p>

            The option is there - but it is not prominent. When prompted to sign in with Microsoft account, I chose Create a new account - at the bottom of the sign up form that opened up&nbsp;there was an option to sign in without Microsoft account. I usually do that
 anyhow, since I like to set&nbsp;a shorter&nbsp;account name, than otherwise would be generated if signing in with Microsoft account anyway.

            <p>I completely agree. I went to "Windows Feedback" in order to report a problem with the taskbar. It asked me to log in with my MS Account, which is completely understandable, they want to know where the feedback is coming from. I start to log in and it informs
 me that it's going to convert my local account to my online MS one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to convert my local account, and I certainly shouldn't have to just to give feedback! I'm really hoping that part was just something overlooked during the build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But yes, I hope Microsoft stops pushing this so hard. It gets annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I do realize the world is moving in a cloud based direction, and if I want to use cloud based services (such as OneDrive), signing in is obviously necessary. However, I want to use this on a case by case basis. There's no reason my entire local account
 should be cloud based.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 5530 and 5800 XpressMusic bluetooth headset problem</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Nokia 5530 and one of my friends had a Nokia 5800. We both have the same problem with our headset we bought (the mrhandsfree Blue twin).</p>
<p>we can pair them and this is no problem, we authorise it and again, no problem. It connects with the headset. After a few seconds, the connection is lost without a reason. We can connect it again by pushing the button on the headset, but this starts the
 voice dial. I want to be able to use voice dial, but only when i want it (normally, it is when you push the heatsetbutton a few seconds).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way to remain connected with the headset is to play music, it plays through the headset and the connection stays on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the headset is off and i put it on, the phone can see the headset and connects. It disconnects again after a few seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we get called, we can't accept the phonecall. the phone just rings, if we push the button on the headset, it connects with the headset and the sound goes perfectly through the headset. If i push the button to pick up, it disconnects the call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why can't i stay connected with my phone and headset?</p>

<p>Hi,i work at Halfords on the audio desk. The amount of&nbsp; times i am trying to fix customers Nokia 5800's which are having problems connecting to the Parrot built in hands free car kits! i have one myself and i will freeze on connection and you then have to
 restart the phone to get it to connect. After connecting it will disconnect shortly after for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>I have had about 7-8 of this particular model doing the same thing, Nokia havent bothered to sort it out and blame it on the parrot kits but i know it happens with most bluetooth devices as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please Nokia fix this bug.</p>

<p>i also have a 5530 and i am using it with the Nokia BH 503 and it connects to my phone fine and i can listen to music with no problem. however when making or&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;phone calls after some time 25 minutes the headset disconnects and i must restart the

<p>i wonder if nokia will say that its the manufacture of the BH 503 that is causing this issue :)</p>

<p>come on nokia there is an issue with the bluetooth in the 5530 even nokia headsets have problems maintaining a connection during calls. please fix it in an update and send it out.</p>

<p>Hi, I have the same problem with a Nokia 5800 and a E63.&nbsp; Why Nokia doesnÂ´t say anything about this?&nbsp; Where can I find a way to fix this problem?&nbsp; I bought an Nokia BH-703, incredible, a Nokia headset and it doesnÂ´t work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please Nokia, say something or I will loose my faith in you totally.</p>

<p>So as for my Nokia 5530 i have upgraded my phones software to version 30.0.009 and the headset problem has not happened since.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i hope i am not speaking too soon but i have had the update about 2 weeks now and my headset has not cut off a single time during a call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 it suppose to work this way or there really is something wrong with my headset?if so, what should i do then?</p>

<p>I have the same problem with my 5530 and Jabra Stone BT headset. It pairs ok but the phone doesn't respond to buttons being pressed and after several seconds disconnects the headset. Doing a reset to factory settings and upgrading the firmware to 32.0.07
 didn't solve anything.</p>
<p>I've tested the headset on Samsung 5230 and it works perfectly.</p>
<p>The fact that no one from Nokia responded to this issue in almost a year says a lot about level of their support...</p>

<p>I can access it just fine, try&nbsp; unplugging your router/modem for 30 secs and power it back on and see if that works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also you could try flushing out your DNS cache</p>
<ol>
<li>Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Command Prompt</li><li>Make sure that you right click on the command prompt&nbsp; and&nbsp; "Run as Administrator"</li><li>Type in the command <strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong></li></ol>

            If all of that stuff above does not work is because the netspend server automatically tagged your IP address and will refuse to let you connect.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It did the same thing to me right after I told them my card was lost.&nbsp;&nbsp; But when I "spoof" my ip I can get on netspend.&nbsp; Or, if I go to another router I can get on netspend.&nbsp; Of course netsend told me it must be my ISP blocking them, nope nor some unseen setting
 in my modem.&nbsp; I use at&amp;t and I used a different at&amp;t location and it worked also at&amp;t changed my router and it does not work.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
There must be some super secret setting in the netspend server or routers that is blocking specific ip addresses.<br />

</p><p>What are the symptoms?&nbsp; Note that you can use the Developer Tools, Network Capture tool to get more details about what you are getting.&nbsp; Also, you can use the Developer Tools, Browser mode or Compatibility View to try changing the User-Agent string to something
 lower than IE9, since the HTML5 indicator (Mozilla/5.0) may be causing the login site confusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; FWIW I can get as far as the above page using IE10 and even use its Account Login button but can't really do any more testing for you without a valid account.&nbsp;
 An incorrect account evidently makes the site erroneously assume that I don't have Cookies enabled.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>

<h2>            VS 2005 application - web browser control crashes when opening a mht file in application folder after installing Patch KB3185330, October 2016 security monthly quality rollup for Windows 7 SP1</h2>
                    <p>Hi All, </p>
<p>I have a Click-Once application that was created in VS 2005. It uses web browser control to open a mht file stored in the application folder. After installing Patch KB3185330, October 2016 security monthly quality rollup for Windows 7 SP1, the 'navigate
 to' method is producing an error and the application crashes. Even if the mht file is opened in IE, the IE gets crashed.
</p>
<p>If the mht file is moved to a location other than the application folder, then I am able to open the mht file in IE.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great, any suggestions on opening the mht file in application folder itself in IE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error details: </p>

    <title>Lumia 800 M&#224;J &#43; synchronisation impossibles - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lumia 800 M&#224;J &#43; synchronisation impossibles</h2>
                    
<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ayant un Lumia 800 depuis 1 semaine, j'ai un petit soucis avec ce dernier:</p>
<p>Je suis affectÃ© par le bug firmware qui fait que ma batterie n'a que 900 mah dÃ©tectÃ©s, problÃ¨me qui est normalement rÃ©solu par la derniÃ¨re MÃ J du Lumia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hors, depuis une semaine, je n'ai jamais rÃ©ussi Ã  installer cette MÃ J ni a synchroniser le tÃ©lÃ©phone.</p>
<p>Lorsque j'allume Zune et que je branche le Lumia, la dÃ©tection se fait "alÃ©atoirement" (dans les 10 minutes on va dire), puis Zune cherche les MÃ J pour le tÃ©lÃ©phone (aprÃ¨s l'Ã©tape "nommez votre tÃ©lÃ©phone").</p>
<p>Malheureusement je tombe toujours sur le message d'erreur en piÃ¨ce jointe ("le logiciel Zune ne peut accÃ©der Ã  certaines donnÃ©es importantes sur l'appareil. Essayer de le dÃ©connecter et de le reconnecter. Si le problÃ¨me persiste, contactez le service clientÃ¨le")
 et, au choix, la recherche de MÃ J continue dans le vent (j'ai tenu 5 heures max comme Ã§a avant d'Ã©teindre l'ordi) ou s'arrÃªte tout simplement (et le tel n'est plus dÃ©tectÃ©).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Je n'ai pas pu non plus ajouter de la musique sur le tÃ©lÃ©phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Y a-t-il une option spÃ©ciale Ã  cocher / dÃ©cocher dans les divers menus du tÃ©lÃ©phone (genre, au hasard :"autoriser la synchronisation") ou alors suis-je contraint de faire appel au service aprÃ¨s-vente (lequel d'ailleurs ? Celui de mon vendeur ou celui de
 Nokia ?) ?</p>
<p>Je prÃ©cise aussi que du fait de la capacitÃ© de la batterie lÃ©gÃ¨rement tronquÃ©e, le tÃ©lÃ©phone n'a mÃªme pas une journÃ©e d'autonomie en le laissant en veille.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Merci</p>
<br />

<p>Oui : 2 ports USB frontaux + 2 ports arriÃ¨re (ceux de la carte mÃ¨re donc) et dans aucun cas la synchronisation n'est possible.</p>

<p>Bonsoir,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Je me permet de remonter ce sujet car j'ai reÃ§u hier, suite Ã  mon appel au SAV Nokia, un tÃ©lÃ©phone de remplacement.</p>
<p>Ce dernier n'est pas affectÃ© par le bug firmware, donc la batterie est totalement dÃ©tectÃ©e, trÃ¨s bien.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NÃ©anmoins, j'ai toujours le mÃªme problÃ¨me de synchronisation (voir premier post).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lors de mon appel au SAV, le tÃ©lÃ©conseiller m'avait conseillÃ© de me mettre en mode "hors connexion".</p>
<p>Je n'ai malheureusement rien trouvÃ© de plus approchant que le mode avion (qui est donc censÃ© coupÃ© les communication externes).</p>
<p>Aucune amÃ©lioration.</p>
<p>De mÃªme en enlevant la carte SIM, il m'est toujours impossible de synchroniser le tÃ©lÃ©phone, donc pas de MÃ J du tel ni de documents dessus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Est-ce qu'il y a un endroit cachÃ© ou activer ce fameux mode "hors connexion" ou alors ai-je encore droit Ã  un appareil dÃ©fectueux ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Par ailleurs, j'ai trouvÃ© comment configurer le tÃ©lÃ©phone pour envoyer / recevoir des MMS (<a href="http://mobile.free.fr/faq-config-apn-autres.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">voir iÃ§i</a>) et j'ai donc pu envoyer / recevoir des MMS hier soir.</p>
<p>Mais pas ce soir.</p>
<p>J'ai donc reconfigurÃ© le tÃ©lÃ©phone pour rÃ©enregistrer l'APN mais lÃ  non plus, rien de positif.</p>
<p>Est-ce qu'il y a une manip' particuliÃ¨re Ã  faire pour valider dÃ©finitivement un APN ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Merci</p>
        </p>

<p>Bonsoir et merci pour la rÃ©ponse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>J'ai regardÃ© attentivement le lien (puis celui donnÃ© par l'internaute expliquant comment il a rÃ©solu son problÃ¨me) et j'en suis toujours au mÃªme point.</p>
<p>Le tÃ©lÃ©phone est dÃ©tectÃ© comme fonctionnant normalement par Windows (dans le gestionnaire de pÃ©riphÃ©riques) avec un pilote Ã  jour.</p>
<p>Zune le dÃ©tecte sans soucis au bout de 10-15 minutes, pas de problÃ¨mes.</p>
<p>J'ai tentÃ© les 2 mÃ©thodes sur <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2468307/fr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
cette page</a> et rien n'y fait, il m'est strictement impossible d'aller jusqu'au bout du processus de mise Ã  jour du tÃ©lÃ©phone dans Zune.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Je ne peux donc pas Ã©crire de donnÃ©es sur mon tÃ©lÃ©phone avec Zune (et je ne connais pas de mÃ©thode pour outrepasser Zune et me servir du tÃ©lÃ©phone comme clÃ© USB).</p>

<h3> pwatters  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 duplicate junk folders</h2>
                    <p>There are two Junk email folders displayed in my Outlook 2016. Account type is Gmail using the new Google Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the folders is named '<strong>Junk</strong>' and is at the top of the tree with other system folders. The other is named '<strong>Junk Email</strong>' and is listed alphabetically with all of my other folders. See the screenshot below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1fd48f3-7db0-4793-8290-0eccc41a3440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1fd48f3-7db0-4793-8290-0eccc41a3440" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have logged into my Gmail account with Chrome and can confirm that the '<strong>Junk Email</strong>' folder (i.e. Gmail label) does not exist anywhere in Gmail. The default system junk folder is named '<strong>Spam</strong>' and I have confirmed that any
 emails in the Spam folder sync with the '<strong>Junk</strong>' folder in Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So where does the duplicate '<strong>Junk Email</strong>' folder come from and how can I remove it, given that it is not displayed anywhere in Gmail?</p>

Advanced SystemCare Free

<div>after I uninstalled that program that error message went away?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again for taking the time to help me out.</div>
<div>&nbsp;In the future if someone asks you that question see if they have that program installed?</div>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>By saying â€œI would like to get a second Outlook profile setup on all my desktops so I can leave my autodiscover as is.â€, do you mean to configure the Exchange Online account in Outlook via Exchange mode manually? If yes, please note that manual Outlook configuration
 in Office 365 is not officially supported. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>After all on-premises mailboxes are migrated to Office 365, you can configure an Autodiscover DNS record for your Office 365 organization to enable users to easily connect to their new Office 365 mailboxes with Outlook and mobile clients. For your reference:</p>

<h2>            Save an attachment in Outlook 2016 to a SharePoint library</h2>
                    <p>Using the older OneDrive sync client I used to be able to save attachments in Outlook 2016 to a SharePoint library. However since "upgrading" to the new generation sync client it doesn't seem to allow this, or it does allow you to navigate to the library
 but doesn't actually save the file?</p>

<p>Hi Darren,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I'd like to explain that the Next Generation sync client is not feasible to sync the attachments in Outlook 2016 to SharePoint library. Though we can navigate the attachments to SharePoint library or local sync folder, it will not be synced eventually. The
 Next Generation sync client now could only sync OneDrive library and could not sync the SharePoint/Group library. We are working to improve it and this feature will be released in the future. However, the accurate release timeline is not available. You could
 monitor our <a href="https://blogs.office.com/office365forbusiness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Blogs</a> and
<a href="http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Roadmap</a> to receive the latest updates on Office 365. Your understanding is highly appreciated.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As a workaround, you could first download the attachments to local place, then upload them to the SharePoint library; Or you could go to the SharePoint library and use
<strong>Open with Explorer</strong> feature to drag the attachments from local place to the library. Here is an article for your reference:
<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/2629108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to use the "Open with Explorer" command to troubleshoot issues in SharePoint Online</a><br />

Thanks for your time and patience.<br />

<h2>            &#34;ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO MOVE THE FOLDER.....&#34;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I am now having to click "Yes" over 100 times a month to confirm that i want to move a folder from one to another, which is a new thing (Outlook 2016) compared to previous versions. This means i'm having to reassure Outlook that i want to move folders over
 100 separate instances; over 100 pointless clicks of "Yes" because Microsoft is terrified i don't know what i'm doing with my mail folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've taken a look in the settings/options, in Outlook and i am unable to find anything that turns this ridiculous feature off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>can anyone suggest how to request the Microsoft developers to put in a simple option to disable such a nuisance task (e.g. Options&gt;Advanced&gt;Other)?</p>

            There is not a setting to disable it - it was added to a build months ago and is highly annoying. It makes deleting a lot of folders a PITA now too. Right-click &gt; Move folder doesn't have the confirmation.
<br />
<br />
A user reports that holding shift when dragging gets rid of the dialog - I still get the confirmation in current builds.
<br />
<br />
You can vote for the option to disable the confirmation here - <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows/suggestions/17825995-provide-an-option-to-switch-drag-and-drop-confirma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    <p>I have a font in my access font list call barcode.&nbsp; There is no further info as to which barcode font it is.&nbsp; I am not even sure how it got there, and if it is usable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event I am looking to add a barcode font to access, (numbers, letters - upper &amp; lower) I want my production reports to print out with a barcode that combines the customer name,&nbsp; sale order number and Purchase Order number) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick search shows many free barcode downloads.&nbsp; Does any one have direct experience and could guide me to a site they have used with Access and could recommend? &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 iCloud Contacts &#34;Display As&#34; are duplicated&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello from Australia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been battling Outlook 2016 for months now as it refuses to import any .pst or vCard files I have created; however..... I still have my iCloud CONTACTS showing in OUTLOOK but where the actual DISPLAY NAME is shown, it is duplicated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The contact itself is not duplicated only the DISPLAY NAME!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any attempt to edit any of the contacts and the whole program freezes the PC and I have to kill the process with task manager!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any ideas why this would occur and how to correct it/</p>
<p>
</p><p>many thanks</p>
<p>

<br />What happens when you try? 
<br />
<br />When you open the contact in outlook, the display name is duplicated? Is the display name duplicated at icloud.com? 
<br />
<br />Do new contacts you create in iCloud sync to outlook ok?

<p>Thanks for the reply, much appreciated..... Iâ€™ll try to clarify the issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Outlook 2016 I am using iCloud contacts only!</p>
<p>
</p><p>They look and work fine but, I cannot edit them! The instant I try, the application freezes the whole PC and I have to use Task Manager to end it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is in these same contacts that the DISPLAY (Not the actual contact) are duplicated e.g. SMITH - SMITH.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The â€œ-â€œ sometimes appears in FRONT of a name e.g - ADT and then it cannot be sorted in order, It/they appear at the very top of the Contact lost, really weird!</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, on icloud.com i can edit and save any of the CONTACTS and the double display name is not there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to Outlook 2016! If I go to my iCloud contacts again and try to EXPORT them to a Vcard, I go to the Settings Cog, choose SELECT ALL, click on EXPORT but the ONLY file extension available is Vcal!! Not Vcard , so obviously its not going to work I guess!
 There is not way i can change this weird extension.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i do accept this incorrect option, it only ecports the VERY FIRST CONTACT in spite of the SELECT ALL bit .....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last one ........ I have EXPORTED the same contacts from my Gmail account to Vcard, saved to my desktop, but OUTLOOK wonâ€™t even look at it if I try to IMPORT it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Iâ€™m thinking of uninstalling OUTLOOK and then reinstalling it as I feel there is something amiss therein!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this clarifies my problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>cheers</p>

            Have you tried signing out of iCloud, verifying the iCloud data file was removed from outlook then signing back in? It sounds like the database might be corrupt, since it tries to export as vcal. 
<br />
<br />Re: Gmail vcards - you need to export for outlook, which creates a csv, not vcard. Outlook can't import a multi-contact vcards, it will only import the first one.

<p>Again, thanks for the reply ............ I started thinking about your reply and did a couple of things that have worked!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To correct the weird "Double Display Name" e.g. SMITH - SMITH I simply went to Outlook 2016 and clicked on RESET VIEW, simple as that and everything back to normal!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your advice, I exported the Gmail contacts yet again in the Outlook .csv format, imported it from Outlook and voila, there they were all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting brain working again!</p>
<p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our boss like to use hotmail.com (personal email account) to receive all her emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started from probably a month ago, all the email which comes from our company domain will be filtered into junk mail.</p>
<p>We tried to whitelisting the domain from her personal account, it wont help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to send email from company email address to my own hotmail.com account, it has been put into junk as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks hotmail blacklisted our domain from server level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering how to request to whitelist our domain. I did search in outlook.com support page but couldn't find any place to lodge the request.</p>

            Hi VF,
<br />I would check the junk mail setting to make sure that somehow the domain or an address from the domain does not appear. In the blocked address or domains.
<br />Here is a document of things to check.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-or-allow-junk-email-settings-48c9f6f7-2309-4f95-9a4d-de987e880e46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-...</a>

<br />How to Whitelist an Email Address with Outlook
<br />Open the email
<br />Right-click on the senderâ€™s name, and click â€œAdd to Outlook Contactsâ€
<br />Click â€œSaveâ€
<br />On the Tools menu, click â€œOptionsâ€
<br />On the Preferences tab, under E-mail, click â€œJunk E-mailâ€
<br />Click the Safe Senders tab
<br />Select the â€œAlso trust e-mail from my Contactsâ€ check box
<br />See if this helps resolve the problem. 
<br />If not here is the information on where to request your domain be whitelisted.

<h2>            Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 cannot verify the license for this product</h2>
                    I bought office professional plus 2010 over a year ago and have been using all the products fine so far. Suddenly a message now pops up when I try to open any office programs saying "Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 cannot verify the license for
 this product. You should repair the Office program by using the Control Panel". I have tried this, re-entered the key I was given when I bought the product and rebooted my computer but it still isn't working and the same error message comes up?

            Hi,<br />
I have tried these steps, but still no luck. The only box that needed unchecking was word, none of the others had any boxes checked.<br />
I found the programs in the 64bit file, even though I'm sure when I downloaded office2010, I installed the 32bit version because I remember having trouble with the 64bit installation. Would the different folders make any difference?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I have also had this problem since early this morning. My computer shut down on its own and after I restarted it I was unable to use any Office 2010 software but I have not used it for about a week so don't know if these are connected. I also lost the use of
 my Avast Software, my wireless connection icon is gone, my power indicator now reads like wingdings font when I hover on it. Did all the things suggested and no improvement. Still need help and a solution. Thanks<br />

            <span>I got mine working again after a series of things. It was my wifeâ€™s computer that was running really slow so I made the mistake of updating a number of Drivers, downloading
 some new software tools, and running a couple of cleaners/speed-up tools all within the same week. Her computer was working fine and then it just suddenly shut down â€“ and not from a MS software update. After she restarted it she noticed a few things were messed
 up. As I began to try to repair it I found several things wrongâ€¦. Avast antivirus was off and could not be restarted, No Device Manager info, icons missing from the notification bar, the MS Office issue, etc. After about 10 hours of messing around and I do
 not recall the exact order but I did all thisâ€¦. Scanned with Malwarebytes which found 1 virus, then scanned with AVG (downloaded to replace Avast as even reinstalling Avast would not get it to work â€“ no virus), scanned with Panda â€“ no virus, did all the things
 in this post (the â€œFix It Toolâ€ still could not get Office to work), restored/undid the registry changes done by CCcleaner (have never had a problem with CCC before) and Toolwiz (I think Toolwiz was possible culprit with the registry cleaner), tried but could
 not complete a system restore for any date, disabled/uninstalled any recent stuff added to Firefox as an extension or plugin, uninstalled any new programs I installed in the past week, turned off some of the startup programs via Startup Optimizer. I found
 I had no info showing up in my Device Manager so I found this link http://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-xp-tips/device-manager-empty-or-blank/#!<span>&nbsp;
</span>and followed those instructions. I know I had done a few reboots during all this but I think I failed to do a reboot after running the â€œRepairâ€ tool for Office until I rebooted after fixing Device Manager. Now when I tried Office Word it requested me
 to re-enter my Product Key. Note, I never uninstalled office , I just ran the repair function under â€˜uninstall or changeâ€™ feature. After entering the Product Key it worked. Hope this helps anyone else as it seems it took the combination of things to get it
 back.</span>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Skype name of your account is the username that you created when you joined Skype. If you are using an email address or phone number to sign on Skype, then you have a Microsoft and not a Skype name. Also,
 the Skype name is created by default that has the word â€œlive:â€ when youâ€™re using email address or phone number.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To check what's your Skype name:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Sign in to Skype Application.</span></li><li><span>Click your Profile/name at the top left of Skype.</span></li><li><span>You will see your Skype name displayed in your profile under your display name.</span></li></ol>

<h2>            Pasting a bulk of endnotes to a separate document</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am assisting an author with formatting the endnotes of his book. I have a copy of the book that is about a week old, and I am formatting the endnotes on my end. The endnotes are properly cross-referenced in this document. However, he is continuously updating
 his version of the document, and so the text of my version, other than the endnotes, is out of date.</p>
<p>What I would like to do is find a way to paste in all the endnotes (nearly 600 of them) into his version of the document while maintaining the cross referencing. Is this possible? The only other alternative I can think of is to manually paste each note into
 the new document, which will be painstaking to say the least. Eventually, once the formatted endnotes and the updated text is synced up, we will section off the chapters with their respective endnotes, and save them in separate documents (which is easy).</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any help you can provide.</p>

<p><span>Do the compare the other way, open your document (the one with the 600 (!) endnotes), save as a&nbsp;new version or copy (just to be safe), then Compare and Merge (Review tab, Compare group, click Compare)
 and select his new version "into" this new version/copy&nbsp;document.</span></p>
<p><span>This way you will have all the endnotes references in the right place and you will see (using the usual Track Changes notation) the changes the author has done. You can now work your way through
 the document, accepting the changes, you can accept all in one go if you feel brave :-)</span></p>

<h2>            Save&#47;Print as PDF crashes Word</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I've had this issue for a while now and figured now is the time to try and fix it :)</p>
<p>Whenever I try to convert a Word document to PDF, whether it be thruogh the PDF toolbar, or the print dialog window, Word will crash. All other applications (e.g. Excel) can convert documents to PDF perfectly fine. I only have this issue with Word.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<div>I suggest cleaning out your PC as described in the following FAQ:<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/what_to_do_when_word_crashes.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/what_to_do_when_word_crashes.htm</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Then check with Adobe that you have the latest version/updates for Acrobat. I'm sure that Word 2003 needs Acrobat v8 with all the updates.</div>

<p>Hi Doug, thanks for the response. I'm using Word 2003. By 'PDF toolbar', I meant the toolbar add-in from Adobe Acrobat.</p>
<p>Would you suggest that I re-install Microsoft Word or re-install Adobe Acrobat? When un-installing either applicaiton, would a normal un-install (e.g. the Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel) suffice, or do I need to do it in a very meticulous manner?</p>
<p>I don't really want to switch to non-Adobe PDF products for personal preference :)</p>

    <title>moving father from incredimail to outlook , syncing with hotmail.. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            moving father from incredimail to outlook , syncing with hotmail.. issues&#33;</h2>
                    Hello all, my dad has been on incredimail for years, and subscribes to these investment newsletters. And he's is DEAD serious about not deleting a single one.<br />
I finally convinced him to delete everything that is over a yr old.. he had over 35,000 (yes, 35,000) emails that were UNREAD in his incredimail.<br />
<br />
So i finally got all of his incredimail emails converted so that outlook 2010 could recognize them, then i added his hotmail/live email account to outlook, and i slowly moved his incredimail emails over to his hotmail email address that i had setup via outlook
 connector.<br />
<br />
The issue. now that i have made all of his folders, and subfolders in outlook 2010, it has been sitting at send/receive for over 24 hours.<br />
I've went to his hotmail account and noticed that all the folders i had made are there, but none of the emails are in any of the folders on hotmail's site.<br />
<br />
Will outlook 2010 just sit at synchronizing folders, until it is complete?<br />
His incredimail file size for all of his emails UNCOMPRESSED was/is 4.2GB<br />
<br />
Could someone enlighten me.. if the think this process will go through? or will outlook just sit at synchronizing folder forever?<br />
As his computer sits now... I have outlook running(stuck on send /receive) and have his incredimail open, so that he can receive his new emails, until this sync process is finished.<br />
<br />
Any tips, recommendations, or clarity would be greatly appreciated!<br />
Chris

            <div>When you perform a reverse sync (Outlook to Hotmail) it does take a long time to sync the entire folder structure with emails to Windows Live WebSever.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You would have to wait till the synchronization is complete.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As a work around, you may try creating one folder at a time and try to sync and check the result. It is better though to leave the current synchronization uninterupted.</div>
