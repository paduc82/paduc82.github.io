    <title>802.1X authentication and network configuration failing on windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loemnk  say:</h3>
<h2>            802.1X authentication and network configuration failing on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I need to authenticate several clients versus a radius server via WLAN and LAN. since windows 10 this seems to be an impossible task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a pfsense with the plugin freeradius and self signed certificates up and running. every client except windows 10 does happily connect and asks if the provided certificates are trusted ‚Äì well except windows 7 where I opt out the certificate check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when observing the windows event los I can see that EapMethod-RasTls and EapMethod-RasChap are printing authentication successfull and at the server side (pfsense) I can see the "Login-OK" in the logs. but somehow the process breaks and windows 10 does not
 want to finish the connection protocol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any advice where I can obtain more information or is there someone with the same, but already solved, problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>certificate wise I have a CA which I use to sign my other certificates. the chain works fine for every other service and as mentioned before gets delivered correctly to the supplicants during the first connect. I added my certificates using the mmc but no
 luck so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>greetings</p>

            <p>Thank you very much, a somewhat usefull solution was pointed out in one of the first posts on the given site and after some digging I put the pieces together. kind of strange that it did not show up during my initial search... . the situation is that certain
 freeradius versions do not support TLS 1.2 or simply cannot calculate certain necessary values correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://community.jisc.ac.uk/groups/eduroam/article/tls-12-and-updated-radius-requirements</p>
<p>
</p><p>microsoft removed OOTB support for older TLS versions as they are in fact vulnerable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2977292</p>
<p>
</p><p>sadly pfsense's freeradius package is stuck at version 2.2.6 and I do not want to update manually. as the link to microsoft's support site points out (tutorial inside) one can force a supplicant to use an older TLS version or instruct the authentication
 server not to advertise TLS 1.2. the latter I have not tried. forcing the supplicant to only use TLS 1.0 seems to be working but enabling all TLS versions did not work. I assume windows 10 elects the highest common version and if that fails it will not try
 others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>conclusion: I will need to move my radius server to another host and use an up-to-date version of freeradius3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the hype around OPNsense inspires someone to write an up-to-date freeradius3 plugin as their plugin system gets released with version 16.1 end of January (https://opnsense.org/about/road-map/).</p>

<h2>            Sort files by name in Chinese</h2>
                    <p>English version: (It may be strange)<br />
I'm a Chinese but&nbsp;I set the system language into English(Canada) on purpose.</p>
<p>And then, I want to sort files by name.</p>
<p>When&nbsp;the name&nbsp;is English, it works (arrange in alphabetical order), but it works in Chinese strangely.</p>
<p>I want it to sort by the s<span>troke</span> <span>amount of the </span><span>whole</span><span>&nbsp;first word in Chinese&nbsp;(I used to do when the system language was Chinese), but it sorts by the
</span>s<span>troke</span> <span>amount of the&nbsp;" </span><span>radical" of the</span><span>&nbsp;first word (just like&nbsp;the&nbsp;Chinese Dictionary). That's not what I want it to do!<br />
Can I change the&nbsp;rules of the sorting?&nbsp; thx</span></p>

<p>When exactly do you have the problem? When system language is set to English?</p>
<p>What happens when you set the language to Chinese?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the system language is set to Chinese, System will not recognize Chinese language, it recognizes files as English.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No, he said his system language <em>was</em> Chinese but now he's changed it to English (Canada). While it was set to Chinese it sorted Chinese filenames properly but now that it's set to English it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt the sorting rules can be changed in any way, but if at all it's possible he's far more likely to get an answer at TechNet than here.</p>

    <title>Official Xbox Magazine Review - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bentleyma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Official Xbox Magazine Review</h2>
                    

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2foxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fu14%2fGRAW09.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It‚Äôs imminent now. That moment when you‚Äôre standing in a videogame store and some kid picks up the box for the latest Clancy gem, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, and starts talking about how ‚Äúsick‚Äù or ‚Äúill‚Äù the graphics are. And you, being an old-school
 Xbox gamer and Clancy-game veteran, will have that ‚Äúold guy‚Äù rebuttal: ‚ÄúI remember back when Ghost Recon was ugly, when we shot at blocky enemies and went prone amidst seven-polygon trees!‚Äù</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, there‚Äôs truth in advertising in the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù portion of GRAW‚Äôs name. The designers have painted one incredibly expressive digital canvas specifically for Xbox 360 ‚Äì as opposed to a mid-range 1997 PC ‚Äì and their subject is Mexico City. There is
 absolutely no mistaking GRAW for a current-gen game. The HDR* lighting, which runs the gamut from dawn to mid-afternoon to dusk, creates a remarkably believable urban landscape across its 12-mission single-player campaign. That campaign, which chronicles an
 attempt by Mexican insurgents to rise to power, as well as the capture and subsequent rescue of both the U.S. and Mexican presidents, inspires a good bit of eye-rolling by the final sequence (which is itself underwhelming), but as the saying goes ‚Äì it‚Äôs not
 about the destination but rather the journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2foxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fu14%2fGRAW02_0.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During that voyage, some GR veterans‚Äô feathers might ruffle at the direction Advanced Warfighter takes; like Ghost Recon 2, it strays a bit from the established sniping-terrorists-in-a-forest paradigm the series made its name with ‚Äì especially early on.
 You‚Äôll be blowing the snot out of enemy transport trucks with a mini-gun in a helicopter, nuking fuel tankers, and ordering tanks to fire on opposing armor a lot for the first few levels. It‚Äôs fist-pumping fun, but die-hard Recon fans will no doubt wonder
 if the series has devolved into just another action game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, later portions of the campaign do remind you that this is still Ghost Recon, offering numerous grin-inducing sniping binges that are enhanced by a couple of key additions to the series: Cross-Com and the UAV. The latter is a beacon that gives
 you a bird‚Äôs-eye view of the battlefield, identifying enemies on your HUD. The former complements it by giving you a picture-in-picture live feed of what your fellow Ghosts are up to, letting you see in two places at once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2foxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fu14%2fGRAW11.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, your supposedly elite-trained Ghost allies muddy up the fun. To put it bluntly, none of them seem competent. They‚Äôll stand out in the open during heated firefights, step out in front of you when you‚Äôre trying to fire from around corners, and
 won‚Äôt even mimic your stance (as they did in previous Recon games). They hinder more than they help, and the times you get to run solo are more of a relief than they should be for a game so steeped in squad dynamics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though campaign play is good but flawed, multiplayer is thankfully a home run (see below). When the original Ghost Recon launched for Xbox, it was a killer app for the fledgling Xbox Live service. Now here in the early days of Xbox 360, GRAW will continue
 to wear that badge of honor again for some time. So whether you‚Äôre easily dazzled by superb graphics or are itchin‚Äô for some multiplayer-lovin‚Äô, GRAW scores on both fronts as an impressive new chapter in the series.</p>

<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />

</strong>This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</p>
<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to see<br />
if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card or cable<br />
and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC<br />
and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power.<br />
Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Start - type in Search box - MSCONFIG&nbsp; find at top - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See&nbsp;troubleshooter link<br />
above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update your major drivers and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build, if it was an upgrade to 1809 - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build
<br />
<br />E. I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

            Hi TiNaMArIe49 
<br />
<br />When you say you have tried installing, are you using the Windows 10 installation media, or just trying a Windows Reset?
<br />
<br />If you are trying the Reset operation, and that is failing, a full clean install would be your best option, since your Recovery Image is probably corrupt . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you using any third party firewall software?</p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Which antivirus program are you using?</p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Were there any recent changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To verify that the Windows Firewall service is started, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, click <b>Run</b>, type services.msc, and then click
<b>OK</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the list of services, locate
<b>Windows Firewall/Internet Connection Sharing (ICS)</b>. Notice that the status of the service is
<b>Started</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If the service is not started, click on start and change the ‚ÄúStartup type‚Äù to automatic</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not able to start Windows Firewall Services feature refer this KB article:</p>
<p><b>You cannot start the Windows Firewall service in Windows XP SP2</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/920074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/920074</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: If you have installed any third party firewall or if you are using antivirus program that has an inbuilt firewall. Then the Windows Firewall will be
 automatically disabled.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>I would also suggest you to download and run the latest Microsoft Safety Scanner on your computer and check if it helps:

As OEM&nbsp;the Printer Maker is responsible for the proper operation of the printer <br />
and their&nbsp;supplied drivers. Check with&nbsp;the Printer Maker's&nbsp;Support, their on-line
<br />
documentation and&nbsp;drivers, and ask in their forums.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Lenovo Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues. You probably need to re-install the latest chipset drivers though some maker's also have separate USB platform drivers (ask Support and in Forums
 if you can't locate them).<br />

<h2>            No program is able to connect to the internet except Firefox 4 Beta 6. Please check out the full details below.</h2>
                    
<p>No other program is unable to connect to the internet except Firefox 4 Beta 6. The programs which are unable to connect are ....Internet explorer 8, Firefox 3.6, Chrome, Opera, Mcafee Anti virus, Microsoft security essentials, Windows update.&nbsp; Internet download
 manager and every thing............</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Troubleshooting steps I have done..</p>
<p>1) Disabled any firewall on the system (Mcafee, then Microsoft security essentials, Windows firewall).</p>
<p>2) Restarted all the services which belongs to network.</p>
<p>3) uninstalled the network drivers and reinstalled them.</p>
<p>4) Uninstalled the VMware software completely.</p>
<p>5) Disabled wireless and tried with wired and viceversa. By the way I have a home wireless router and my other laptop with XP and a desktop with 7 are working fine.</p>
<p>6) I had Microsoft security essentials, I uninstalled it completely and installed mcafee A/V. Then disabled the firewall.</p>
<p>Please help me in resolving this issue.</p>

<p><span>Hi mraviteja,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since Firefox 4 Beta 6 is able to connect to Internet, the connection seems fine. Looks like one of the installed components on the computer is preventing
 you from accessing internet. It could also be your proxy setting.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the methods below to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Check your proxy setting</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The steps below will determine if proxy server is enabled. If so, disable the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to Start and type Internet Options.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Internet Options.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Connections tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on LAN settings.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>See
 if proxy server is enabled. If so, uncheck the box against ‚ÄúUse a proxy server for your LAN‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 OK twice.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run the programs where you‚Äôre facing connection problem and see if they connect.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Perform Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Many third party software can interfere with internet connection. Check and see if there‚Äôs any software that‚Äôs preventing you from accessing internet.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do so, place the system in clean boot configuration. The suggestion to perform this method is to isolate the problem(s) between the baseline OS/Drivers
 installed and any third party applications.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer:</span></p>

 Vista or in Windows 7</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer once the system is in clean boot configuration. Follow the elimination methods provided in the article above to find out which
 application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Ensure that you put your computer
 back to normal startup mode after completing the troubleshooting steps. Steps are available in the article given above.</span></p>

    <title>mouse pointer and touchpad issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> butch214  say:</h3>
<h2>            mouse pointer and touchpad issue</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 14 Z laptop. I am pretty sure that since I've been using Windows 10 that at times my mouse pointer decides to have a mind of its own, constantly moving and not responding to the wireless mouse or the touchpad intermittently. The last
 couple weeks it is really been getting worse. I am disabled with limited use of one hand, but enough to work the wireless mouse. In thinking that maybe this Microsoft wireless mouse could be the problem I uninstalled it. Today have been trying to use the mouse
 pad thinking it would be better but it is not. I even went into the mouse pad options and set everything up for a light touch. It seemed to work pretty good for little while then it's back to its same old thing of not responding to the touchpad intermittently.
 Most of the time when I touch the mouse pad all of a sudden the pointer will jump to the left or the right, up or down, or it will go into the magnifying mode. I purposely would take my hand off the wireless mouse and could watch the pointer slowly work its
 way downward in a straight line. After I have uninstalled the Microsoft wireless mouse the pointer does not seem to do that anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My question is ‚Äì could Windows 10 be the cause of this issue or could it be something else?</p>
<p>Any help with this issue would be much appreciated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thank you</p>

            <p>To the Microsoft Engineer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thank you for your speedy reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You had two questions for me ‚Äì</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Have you installed all pending Windows updates?</span></span></li></ol>
<p>I have an Inspiron 14z N411z Quick Start laptop PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have this Windows 10 set up for automatic updates.&nbsp; Due to the complexity of this Windows 10 product this PC&nbsp; dummy&nbsp; is unable to navigate and find things that I could when I had Windows 7, 8 and 9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Yesterday morning I completed your instructions to fix my issue and after the restart it seemed to work&nbsp; well for about 10 to 15 min. and then proceeded to do its mouse dance. So, I repeated your instructions for the second time and after the restart it
 seemed to work pretty well, so I just turned it off for a couple hours and returned later in the day. It worked well for about 30 min. before the mouse started dancing around again. So I turned it off for the&nbsp; rest of the day. Since the start of this morning
 it has been working&nbsp;&nbsp; well While I was in Google Chrome checking e-mails and the news.&nbsp; Then I went to Microsoft edge to check e-mails and the news and after about 10 min. the mouse started acting up again, so I closed Microsoft edge and returned to Google
 Chrome and the mouse worked well for me for about&nbsp; an hour. Note: during this time I was on battery mode. After I plugged this PC back into the charger the mouse has been working very well the last couple of hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Note: before I sent my questions to the Microsoft community the other day I had already turned off my&nbsp; Microsoft wireless mouse and unplugged the USB&nbsp; for it.&nbsp; I then went into "programs and features "and uninstalled "Microsoft Mouse And Touchpad"&nbsp; I believe
 it said. After plugging in the USB for the Microsoft wireless mouse&nbsp; and turned the mouse&nbsp; switch on, I went to&nbsp;"programs and features ",&nbsp; and saw&nbsp;the Microsoft Mouse And Touchpad did not return. So, I am not sure just what I uninstalled but the PCs touchpad
 is working fine and so is the wireless mouse that I have.</p>
<p>Do you have any thoughts or words of wisdom to share regarding the above&nbsp; Mentioned&nbsp;note?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Also, if the mouse pointer continues to work well over the next few days I&nbsp; will hope&nbsp;the issue&nbsp; is&nbsp;fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<div>DRIVER_OVERRAN_STACK_BUFFER (f7)<br />
A driver has overrun a stack-based buffer.&nbsp; This overrun could potentially<br />
allow a malicious user to gain control of this machine.<br />
DESCRIPTION<br />
A driver overran a stack-based buffer (or local variable) in a way that would<br />
have overwritten the function's return address and jumped back to an arbitrary<br />
address when the function returned.&nbsp; This is the classic "buffer overrun"<br />
hacking attack and the system has been brought down to prevent a malicious user<br />
from gaining complete control of it.<br />
Do a kb to get a stack backtrace -- the last routine on the stack before the<br />
buffer overrun handlers and bugcheck call is the one that overran its local<br />
variable(s).<br />
Arguments:<br />
Arg1: 00007b8d8d419b81, Actual security check cookie from the stack<br />
Arg2: 00006b8d8d419b81, Expected security check cookie<br />
Arg3: ffff947272be647e, Complement of the expected security check cookie<br />
Arg4: 0000000000000000, zero</div>

            I analyzed your dump. No driver is getting named.
<br />
<br />Enable Driver Verifier and generate dump files and upload to Onedrive and share the link here (Don't forget to turn off Driver Verifier after the job is done). Do read the instructions carefully particularly how to get back into Windows when you get the crash.

<h2>            New Arc Touch Mouse - Turns Off While In Use</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got &nbsp;anew Arc mouse. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an issue where it will randomly turn off every few minutes. &nbsp;I then have to make the mouse flat, and then open it again for ti to power back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried new batteries, and toggling anything I thought would help with the device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>quick launch is gone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boogerboy1  say:</h3>
<h2>            quick launch is gone</h2>
                    I don't know what happened.&nbsp; But my quick launch is gone.&nbsp; I don't keep anything on my desktop.&nbsp; I just pin everything to my quick launch.&nbsp; The frustrating thing is that&nbsp;I know how to put it back it just wont go.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is what I did - put cursor in empty
 spot on the task bar -&nbsp; right clicked to bring up the menu - went to the top to the toolbars - &nbsp;moved over and down to quick launch to "check the box" - however the box won't "check" and the quick launch won't appear even though I can "check" and "uncheck"
 all of the other options&nbsp;such as "desktop" or "windows media player.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also tried to fix it another way - &nbsp;I moved the cursor to an empty spot on the task bar - right clicked - then I went to properties - I put a check in the quick launch box - then I clicked
 "apply" and then "OK" - it sill doesn't come up - when I go back to "properties" the quick launch is UNFREAKING CHECKED.&nbsp; Also, I thought maybe one of my kids "slid" it over.&nbsp; So I moved the cursor over just next to the start button so that the arrows appeared
 and I tried to drag the arrows over but nothing happened.&nbsp; I tried dragging in every spot on the taskbar and still nothing.&nbsp; On other profiles on my computer there is no problem with their quick launch.&nbsp; Does anybody have any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks boogerboy1

            Hello BoogerBoy1,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets give this a try:<br />
<br />
To help resolve this issue, use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click<strong> Start</strong>, click
<strong>All Programs</strong>, click <strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>
Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>. </li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<div><span>sfc /scannow</span></div>
The <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.
</li></ol>
<p><br />
Be advised this scan may take awhile. Let us know if this helps you either way. Make it a great day!</p>

<h2>            Wrong version of vista installed, any way to change it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Howdy,</p>
<p>My sister was having trouble with her HP laptop (running Vista Basic), so my dad tried to fix it by using his own copy from his HP, not realizing he was installing Vista Home Premium. He used his cd key, so it can't validate.</p>
<p>She no longer has the CD that came with her laptop, so is there any way to downgrade Vista Premium to Home basic so her serial will work?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>The correct version with the correct Disk will have to be reinstalled.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista Recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer to
 put it back to Factory Settings</span></span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Also ask them if it is possible to make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Drive failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their own way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Have you installed the latest printer drivers from the printer manufacturer‚Äôs website?</span></p>
<p><span>Was the printer working fine before?</span></p>
<p><span>Did you make any software or hardware changes to the computer before this issue started?</span></p>
<p><span>This behavior occurs if existed printer drivers are corrupt.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest that you remove all the installed printers and reinstall the Windows 7 printer drivers if available.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Remove a printer</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>1. Click the "<strong>Start</strong>" button, type
<strong>PRINTER</strong> in the search box and press <strong>Enter</strong>. </span>
</p>
<p><span>2. Find the icons of installed printers, and delete them.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Right-click on the blank part of the window, and choose "<strong>Run</strong>
<strong>as</strong> <strong>administrator</strong>"-&gt;"<strong>Server</strong> <strong>
Properties</strong>". </span></p>
<p><span>4. On the
<strong>Drivers</strong> tab, select the listed printers and click the <strong>Remove</strong> button. Please then select Remove driver and driver package.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Open Start menu, input
<strong>APPWIZ</strong>.<strong>CPL</strong> in the Search box and press ENTER to launch "<strong>Programs</strong>
<strong>and</strong> <strong>Features</strong>".</span></p>
<p><span>6. Try to remove all related printer software.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue is not resolved, I suggest that you clear the printing sub system.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>======</span></p>
<p><span>Start Windows Explorer, and then rename all files and folders in the following two folders:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>c:\windows\system32\spool\drivers\w32x86
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To rename a file, we can right click the file and select Rename.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>======</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Important</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify
 the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore
 the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span><span>Drivers
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Print</strong>
<strong>Processors</strong> </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. On the File menu, click Export.
</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the File Name box, type a descriptive name for this key -- for example, type WindowsNTx86regkey -- and then click Save to save it to your local Desktop.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>c. Delete all keys other than Drivers and Print Processors.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>======</span></p>
<p><span>Navigate to and click the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors registry key. View the list of subkeys. There should be only the following subkeys:

<p><strong><span><span>USB Monitor</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>WSD Port</span></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If there are any keys other than those listed in above, follow these steps to delete them:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. On the File menu, click Export.
</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the File Name box, type a descriptive name for this key -- for example, type Monitorsregkey -- and then click Save to save it to your local Desktop.

<p><span>We can use this backup of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors registry key to restore the key if you experience any problems after you complete
 this procedure. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>c. Delete all keys other than the 5 listed above.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 4
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Disconnect the printer cable from the computer, and then restart the computer.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 5</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Reconnect the printer cable to the computer, install the printer according to the manufacturer's installation instructions, and then check if the issue
 persists.</span></span></p>

</p><p>1-Navigate to the key in regedit&gt;go to file&gt;export&gt;save it where ever you like</p>
<p>2-There is an infinitesimally small possibility of a problem hence my suggestion to back it up</p>

<p>
</p><p>You are getting different errors like ‚ÄúCircular Kernel Context Logger‚Äù and ‚Äúfailed to start with the following error: 0xC0000011‚Äù</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any changes prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to software issue or damaged files on the system.</p>
<p>You can try the below methods and check.<br />
Method 1.<br />
Try to put the system in clean boot. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1. It starts Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.<br />
How to perform a clean boot in Windows: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2.</p>
<p>Windows Kernel event ID 41 error "The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first" in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2008 R2:</p>
