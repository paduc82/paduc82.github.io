<h2>            MicroSD&#47;SDHC 4 or 8 Gb cards on N80, N73, and other S60 v3.0 devices</h2>
                    I'd like to get a MicroSD card and use a micro-to-mini SD adapter to get it to work with my N80.<br />
<br />
I've been searching around this forum but haven't been able to find a definitive answer. Found some that said that micro non-SDHC cards can work, if the firmware's up to date. I found other threads that said there's a hardware limitation. I couldn't find a
 definitive answer. Micro has more memory, but I thought memory addressing was done by the OS, not some hardware chip. The converter adapter makes the micro card effectively a mini card with alot of space, no other hardware required. Up-to-date software/drivers
 perhaps provided in newer firmware, could make it work.<br />
<br />
I'd like to get input from someone who's tried this, I'd like to know if Micro Sd cards work on devices that support mini Sd, using an adapter.<br />
<br />
Thanks

            As far as I know a standard micro-SD card in a mini-SD adaptor will work with phones like the N80 / N73 but SDHC cards will not work.<br />
<br />
The most I ever used in my N80 was a 2GB card. I was interested in using more but all the posts I read on the subject said it couldn't be done. Phones like the N73 or N80 can only address a max of 2GB, a limitation of FAT / FAT16 file structure.<br />
<br />
I'd love to hear from someone who has managed to jump the barrier. In the end I upgraded to a N82 and packed it with an 8GB micro-SDHC card.<br />

            The 2gb limit is a limitation of SD cards. <i>That</i> is why these phones can't use something bigger.<br />
<br />
There's nothing to stop you setting up a FAT32 filesystem on a 2gb card, for example.

            Yeah, I'd like to find out if someone's actually tried this on a miniSD device, whether this worked, what happened, etc.<br />
<br />
I read around that micro cards can be used on N73(a mini sd device), but can't be accessed from desktops/laptops while the device's in the pc suite mode.

            I have N80 since 2 years 6 days(bought 29th of May 06). First 6 months I used 2GB minisd. After that I started to use 2GB microsd with an minisd adapter. Both mini &amp; micro I formated in fat 32. They worked fine in mobile as well as PC also in Pc suite
 &amp; Mass storage mode. But when i put that in my other mobile devices was motorola E680i, then moto did not recognize the card for fat32 format. After that I again re formated that card in fat16, then it can start to work in both mobile. So mini &amp; micro or fat
 &amp; fat32 is not any big problem. But i can not use 4gb micro sdhc in N80 &amp; N73. So I think sdhc is not competible with n80 &amp; n73. Maybe it's hardware &amp; also firmware limitation. Another thing is I bought one card reader when sdhc is not came in the market (2006).
 But it still can read my 4gb sandisk micro sdhc card. So some time i think it can be done by firmware.

            Wow Reaz33, impeccable memory. I got my N80 in December '06, can't remember the date. I've had mine for about a year and a half. I'd been thinking about upgrading, but newer Nseries didn't seem drastically different, same connectivity stuff(wifi, 3g, etc,
 stuff that this device also has), moderately bigger screens(this has 2.2 in, newer devices have .4, .6, or at max, 2.8), processors about 80 MHz faster(this has a 220 MHz arm9, N95 has a 300 MHz I believe?). I don't know, maybe I'm missing something. This
 memory thing might be a sign it's about time I<br />
upgrade, I was planning on waiting for the multitouch S60v5 coming out this year.<br />
<br />
Anyways, what happened when you put the micro card in the device, I'd appreciate details.. Did it say the card was corrupt, did you format, which brand was the card, etc. Has/could someone with say a formatable 4 Gb a micro SDHC and some other mini SD devices
 like the N73 give this a try. It'd give us all a definitive answer once and for all. This seems to be a recurring topic, there's tons of similar posts on this forum, just no definitive answers. If someone with a card and an older device could give this a try,
 maybe format the card using the phone, it'd be great!

            when i put memory card it says "no memory card inserted" very few times it says corrupted. That card was sandisk 4gb micro sdhc.

            I guess that's it then. My theory in life on most things is that with a little bit of thought and effort, you can find better, cheaper, faster ways of getting what you want.<br />
<br />
For example, UPnp is probably the most under-utilized feature in Nseries devices. When setup properly, you can access content on your computer over wifi. That's akin to having access to and using content that weighs tens or even hundreds of Gb, all from your
 device.

<div>Hi. I just got the Note II, &amp; it's running android. I had the htc trophy, and wp7.5.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, I have a lot of pdf files (acrobat reader for wp7.5), old epub files (freda ereader for wp7.5) and other important items on the old trophy I'd like to move over to my Note.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I've found the Outlook.com, and skydrive apps for my new phone, and have installed them.
<br />
My only problem at this point is that I cannot readily identify how to move those files, stored within the programs, up to my skydrive acct.
<br />
I've found that as long as I can get those files to the skydrive, I can access them on my Note 2.
<br />
<br />
How can I do this? <br />

            <p>Hello Tyia:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the additional feedback.&nbsp; I understand this is currently not set up to let you access the files you need to transfer to your new device.&nbsp; There does not seem to be anyway to access the files stored within your phones file system or within apps
 that have been added to the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point the only other suggestion I have is to contact the app developers to see if there is any work around or update that can be performed to allow the access of files being stored within these apps.&nbsp; Besides this the only other thing I can suggest
 is to try and located these files on the net via your PC so they could then be uploaded to SkyDrive or emailed to yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

<p>The phone number for Nigeria is not reachable. I've chatted with a Microsoft support staff who said my product key is MSDN key that it's only MSDN team can help me to check and generate Confirmation ID. The support staff gave me two phone numbers to call
 in Nigeria however, both lines are not reachable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The painful thing is there is no way I can enter a new Product Key (If I decide to buy a new key) because the recommended option (Activation over internet) is showing "This product cannot be activated because the product key is not valid"</p>

            I believe what you are calling " Re-installation Confirmation ID " is generally known as the "Product ID".   When asking for help from MS they will often ask for your Product ID.
<br />
<br />Go to File menu &gt; Account command &gt; About button.  Near the top right of the dialog you will see the Word version, followed by "Product ID" on the next row.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contact Microsoft support directly from&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;to get the confirmation id. Contact support on call instead of chat.</p>

                    I have an Acer Aspire&nbsp;Windows Vista laptop that's been upgraded to Windows 7.&nbsp; Upgrade went fine.&nbsp; I run Office 2003 on the laptop but with Outlook 2007.&nbsp; I've previously noted that after a Windows Update I've had problems, with Outlook 2007 saying I don't
 have an email client installed.&nbsp; I've reinstalled Outlook 2007 each time and fixed it.&nbsp; This week's updates broke it again and in order to try and solve it I used the Office 2003 CD to remove Outlook 2003 before trying to reinstall Outlook 2007.&nbsp; I now get
 the following error during installation: <strong>"Error 1310. Error writing to file: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\Addins\MSVCR71.DLL. Verify that you have access to that directory."</strong>&nbsp; I tried uninstalling Office 2003 to start again from
 scratch, but now get a very similar error message when trying to reinstall Office 2003.&nbsp; If I choose to ignore the message I get another immediately refering to file MSOSEC.XML and no option to ignore.&nbsp; I've tried searching for the file and pasting it into
 the&nbsp;ADDIN directory, but it won't copy and paste.&nbsp; I've tried msiexec /unreg and msiexec /regserver commands, but no success.&nbsp;Stuck now.&nbsp; I can't install Office or Outlook and don't know what to try and not sure where the problem lies.&nbsp; I've also tried changing
 access rights and using compatibility mode to install as Windows XP SP2.&nbsp; Nothing doing.&nbsp; Any ideas gratefully received.

<p><span>Looks like you have Outlook 2007 standalone version, and also Office 2003 which includes outlook 2003 as well. To let you know,
 to get your outlook program run smoothly, you cannot have both versions of Outlook (2003 and 2007) installed on your computer simultaneously. Thus you will have to remove outlook 2003 and just use outlook 2007.</span></p>
<p><span>Try uninstalling Office 2003 with the help of Windows installer cleanup utility.
<br />
Download it from here: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301</span></a>&nbsp; and install. After the installation is complete,&nbsp;you can find it listed in your All
 Programs list, Open it and select Office 2003 and click on remove. {This will uninstall Office 2003}<br />
Now try installing Office 2003 by customizing it and unchecking outlook while installing Office 2003.
<br />
For help with customizing your installation check this link: <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/HP052741691033.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/HP052741691033.aspx</span></a>
<br />
Restart your computer and install Outlook 2007.<br />
Hopefully this will fix your issue.</span></p>

<h2>            One of my OneNote notebooks won&#39;t open in the online version of onenote &#40;via browser&#41; for editing</h2>
                    <p>The notebook in question opens easily and syncs easily in my Android version of OneNote. Why this isn't happening in the online version of OneNote is the mystery.</p>

<p>It happens only to a specific notebook; all other notebooks open normally. Deleting browser history on all my browsers (I use PC and Android versions of Edge, Opera, Firefox, Chrome and Samsung Internet) and this has not resolved the problem. All my other
 notebooks open normally via these browsers and the OneNote apps from WinStore, Playstore and within MS-Office. Its just that one notebook that won't open in the online version of OneNote.</p>

<p>The notebook isn't a shared one. Resetting all my browsers (Android &amp; PC versions of Edge, Opera, Firefox, Chrome and Samsung Internet) has not helped. This means the problem is at the OneNote level; either online or within the PC/Android app version level.</p>
<p>What I will try next is:</p>
<p>1. Close the notebook from within the Android and PC app level while online.</p>
<p>2. Go to my OneDrive via browser (Edge this time) and open the affected notebook from inside OneDrive using OneNote app in a PC (either from WinStore of within MS-Office suite).</p>
<p>3. Examine all sections of the opened notebook for irregular text characters and inserted media. I will deliberately make some small subtractive/additive edits here or there and save/allow to sync with the online server.</p>
<p>4. Close the notebook from the app and try to open it via Edge browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that there might be a small content-related anomaly that the OneNote Online server is having trouble dealing with that the PC/Android apps aren't having difficulty with. What is your opinion?</p>

<p>Hello again, at the moment I've inspected all the pages within the affected notebook and even made some edits here and there to make a sync with. I'm using the OneNote app from WinStore. What I have noticed is that compared to all my other notebooks, the
 affected notebook is taking way too long to sync (even though that seems to be going normally...no sync failure/errors to report so far). One thing to bear in mind is that internet bandwidth at my location -office LAN/WLAN- in Abuja, Nigeria is far less than
 optimal but going anyway. If the syncing takes too long, I will stop it by closing the notebook normally and signing out. Next I'll try to open it using OneNote Online (via Edge browser) to see if it will open.</p>

<h2>            Web pages keep rolling even when i&#39;m not scrolling</h2>
                    I'm using Internet Explorer 8.&nbsp; When i use the scroll wheel to go up and down pages, the pages keeps moving long after i've stopped scrolling.&nbsp; I've tried different mouses (wired, it's not a low battery issue), tried different ports, no difference.&nbsp; It
 only happens in IE, not other programs.<br />
The problem started a long time ago when i upgraded to IE 7.&nbsp; I thought upgrading to IE 8 would help, but the problem still exists.<br />
Any ideas?&nbsp; Thank you for your help.

<p><span>Hi domondrums,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the methods listed below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>You may open Internet Explorer with no add-ons mode and check if the computer/Internet Explorer continues to freeze or not. To start Internet
 Explorer without add-ons, </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• Click the Start button, click All Programs, click Accessories, click System Tools, and then click Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If disabling all add-ons solves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as
 you need them. This will allow you to figure out which add-on is causing the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more details, refer the below link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Tips for solving problems with Internet Explorer</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Tips-for-solving-problems-with-Internet-Explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Tips-for-solving-problems-with-Internet-Explorer</strong></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Use the Manage Add-ons tool to determine which add-on is causing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Use the Manage Add-ons tool in Internet Explorer to individually disable each add-on to determine which add-on is causing errors. To do this,
 follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Open Internet Explorer 8 (IE8).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click Tools, and then click Manage Add-ons.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. On the Show drop-down menu, select All add-ons to display all add-ons that are installed on the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. For each item in this list, select the add-on, and then click Disable in the Information window.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. When you have disabled all the items in this list, click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. Exit and then restart Internet Explorer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. If issues do not reoccur, repeat steps 1 through 3.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8. Click Enable for a single add-on.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>9. Repeat steps 6 through 8 until you determine which add-on causes errors to occur.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you have used this process to determine which add-on is causing errors, you can disable that add-on. Or, you can uninstall the software
 that installs the add-on. We also recommend that you contact the software vendor that provided the add-on for additional troubleshooting and support.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If Method 1 does not help in fixing the issue, you may uninstall and re-install IE8.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Refer the following Microsoft KB article and follow the steps mentioned (as applicable to your operating system):</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span>How do I uninstall or remove Internet Explorer 8?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After uninstalling IE8, you may access the link below and follow the steps mentioned to solve any IE8 installation problems, if any:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Please read: "HOW TO solve IE8 installation problems"</strong></span></p>

    <title>Insider Preview as VM on Hyper-V Cannot Connect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billcosner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insider Preview as VM on Hyper-V Cannot Connect</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 Insider Preview as a Hyper-V virtual machine. The Host is also Windows 10 Pro. For the last few builds I have been unable to connect to the VM through the Hyper-V Machine Manager. The machine starts and runs and shows in the preview
 window, but falls to (0) under Processor and 418 under Memory. Remote Desktop Connection cannot connect either. The only fix so far is to reset the VM, or use the square "Turn off" button on HMM instead of shutting the VM down normally. I have looked all over
 online, Feedback Hub, TechNet, Google and now here. If there is an answer somewhere someone please point it out to me.</p>
<p>Update 05/05/17 - I still haven't solved this</p>

<p>I can't offer you any solution Bill, but offer the encouragement that there are many of us here (myself included) who have had no problems running Insider builds inside a Hyper-V VM with a host machine running Win10 Pro, in my case all the way from the beginning
 of Insiders to the current RS3 16179.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I presume you are using a production Win10 build on the host.&nbsp; If so, which one?&nbsp; What resources does the VM have?&nbsp; In the early days of Win10 Insiders there were problems with VMs with only one virtual processor - some kind of spin lock issue if I recall.&nbsp;
 Don't know if that still applies.&nbsp; My VM has had 2 virtual processors since that issue arose.</p>

<p>No new changes other than regular preview updates. The host is Windows 10 Pro Version 1703 build 15063.138. The VM is Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview Version 1703 build 16179.1000 with 4 Processors @ 3.96 Gb installed Ram. I have run an IP build on Hyper-V
 for a couple years with no problems. On the same host, I have 2 other VMs, a Windows 8.1 Pro and a Windows 7 Pro. Both the 8.1 Pro and the 7 Pro start and connect normally every time.
</p>
<p>Troubleshooting steps so far, I've stopped the service to this VM, I've deleted and reinstalled this VM via ISO and a "clean" install, I've uninstalled and re-installed the Hyper-V Manager through "Turn Windows Features On or Off", I've dropped from 4 Virtual
 processors down to 2 then down to 1, then back up to 4, I've "uninstalled" Ram from 3.96Gb to 2.0Gb and "reinstalled" the Ram back up to 3.96Gb. I've tried restarting the VM in "Safe" mode (It couldn't re-connect). I have renamed the VM so all letters are
 capitalized, then all lower case. I am open to any other tips or tricks if you have any. Thank you both for responding.</p>
<p>Sorry it took so long to reply. My normal hours are screwy. </p>

            Far more resources in the VM than anything I have :)&nbsp; It seems to me that your issue is in the VM hosting rather than the Insider build inside the VM.&nbsp; I can usually connect to a VM even if what's running in it is practically knackered.&nbsp; Kind of looks
 like the VM isn't being given any resources.&nbsp; But I'm no expert on Hyper-V.

    <title>Nokia 5800 touch screen problem. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia 5800 touch screen problem.</h2>
                    I've only had this phone since Saturday but have noticed that it doesn't like being turned on for a long time. After a few hours, when you try to unlock it, the touch screen stay locked and you can't press anything but the call, menu and end buttons still
 do. I've found that turning the phone off then back on again solves it, but it's VERY annoying having to do that every single day. Any way to fix it, or is it just a case of waiting for Nokia to fix it in a firmware update?

            That could be the problem. Operators have a habit of messing phones' firmware up when they do their branding.<br />
<br />
One thing you can try is to reset the phone to see if that helps.<br />
<br />
Use PC Suite or OVI Suite to back up any content of yours on the phone (but NOT the settings, they can be the problem).<br />
<br />
Dial the number *#7370# and supply the security code when prompted (it'll be the default 12345 unless you've changed it).<br />
<br />
The phone will restart having been wiped clean.<br />
<br />
If you had more than 20 messages in your sent items then go into the messaging application, then Options &gt; Settings &gt; Other, and set "Number of saved msgs." to something bigger than the number of messages you had in there. If you don't then the phone will discard
 all but the last 20 messages.<br />
<br />
Use PC Suite or OVI suite to restore your data.<br />
<br />
If that still doesn't solve the problem then you might want to take the phone back to the place you got it.<br />

Try these steps:<br />
a. Open Internet Explorer.<br />
b. Go to Tools &gt; Internet Options&gt; Advanced Tab.<br />
c. Scroll down to the Security section and ensure that the Use TLS 1.0 option is checked, then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
If the issue persists, then get in touch with the site administrators for further assistance.</span></span></p>

            I believe from the statement "I can't get to the AKO/DKO homepage to log on," means that you are going to AKO/DKO or https://www.us.army.mil and are receiving a certificate error and clicking continue anyway to access the page then after you click the
 continue anyway option you are most likely getting a message that says "cannot display page". If you are getting the error that says "cannot display page" you need to install the DOD certificates to gain access to the page. I direct everybody I talk to to
 go to www.miitarycac.com for the installation of those DOD certificates. More specifically you can click this direct download link to obtain the certificates needed for installation.
<br />
http://www.militarycac.com/CACDrivers/InstallRoot_v3.13A.exe<br />
If you receive an error that states that the file does not have valid digital certificates and does not give you an option to continue the installation you will need to save the file to your computer then right click the file and then select the option to run
 as administrator. When the certificates install you will see a command prompt box pop up and disappear then you will most likely recieve a message saying that the program appears to not have installed correctly. The program did install correctly and you will
 select the option that says "This program installed correctly." After doing so you should then be able to access the AKO/DKO website.<br />
<br />
If you install the DOD certificates and you still cannot access the AKO/DKO page you will need to review your security settings for Internet Explorer. You will select Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Advanced Tab&gt;Security Subheading then you will scroll down to the SSL
 and TLS options and the only two options should be the SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0.<br />
<br />
Hope this clears all of your confusion up.<br />

    <title>ASP ReportViewer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aditoma  say:</h3>
<h2>            ASP ReportViewer</h2>
                    <p>In IE 10 we have a bug for it when we render reports. The report width is not made 100% how it is done in IE9 and IE11.</p>
<p>The problem from what I have seen is because the div with id ‘ReportViewer_ctl09’ contained into the ReportViewer body and used to render the report has defined inline styling. This inline styling looks like this:
</p>
<p><code>&lt;div id="ReportViewer_ctl09" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; overflow: auto; position: relative;"&gt;</code></p>
<p>If I remove ‘auto’ value for overflow then it look ok in IE 10 also. This I’ve done it into the browser, here actually it takes the setting and uses it for the control. From code I was not able to set it.</p>
<p>The ReportViewer is defined like below and also has an event for onLoad.</p>
<p>` position: relative;"&gt; @Html.MvcReportViewer(path, null, null, null, null, new ControlSettings() { //KeepSessionAlive = true, BackColor = ColorTranslator.FromHtml("#fffffe"), SplitterBackColor = ColorTranslator.FromHtml("#fffffe"), InternalBorderColor =
 ColorTranslator.FromHtml("#dedede"), ToolBarItemBorderColor = ColorTranslator.FromHtml("#dedede"), LinkActiveHoverColor = ColorTranslator.FromHtml("#83AFDF"), ToolBarItemHoverBackColor = ColorTranslator.FromHtml("#83AFDF") }, new { style = "width: 100%; height:
 900px; border: none", frameborder = "0", id="MvcReportViewer", name="MvcReportViewer", onload = "onLoadIframe(this); " } )</p>
<p>
</p><pre><p><code><span>function</span><span> onLoadIframe</span><span>(</span><span>obj</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

        </span><span>// it's body</span><span>

     </span><span>}</span><span>
   </span><span>}</span></code></p><p /><p>When the view is loaded first time it executes the onLoadIframe method but the overflow setting is not changed.</p>

<p>When the ViewReport submit button is pressed then the report is rendered but still the overflow value is set on ‘auto’.</p>

<p>I’ve looked for a specific event like OnRenderComplete for ReportViewer but this does not have a such event defined.</p>

<p>In case you had similar issues or maybe you have any idea how to solve this bug please let me know.
Thank you.</p><p /><p /></pre>

            Hi, I hope you're having a wonderful day.
<br />
<br />For that you will need to do it via PowerShell.
<br />
<br />Try this script and see if it works for you.

<h2>            Hide and Unhide and array of worksheets&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I want to hide and unhide groups of worksheets in a workbook.&nbsp; I&nbsp;recorded a macro to hide several.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This works<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheets(Array("Cost Summary", "Actual Material", "Actual Labor", "Actual Equip", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actual Sub")).Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheets("Cost Summary").Activate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveWindow.SelectedSheets.Visible = False</p>
<p>Tried this to unhide</p>
<p>&nbsp; Sheets(Array("Cost Summary", "Actual Material", "Actual Labor", "Actual Equip", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actual Sub")).Visible = True</p>
<p>it does not work.&nbsp; I had to reference each sheet in a seperate statement</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheets("Cost Summary").Visible = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheets("Actual Material").Visible = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheets("Actual Labor").Visible = True</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>How come the array statement won't work if the sheets are hidden?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Problem with captions in Word 2010 Pro on Windows 7 Pro</h2>
                    Just today, during final editing of a large document with many cross references of headings and captions (tables, figures) I realised that as I inserted a new caption (table or figure, it does not matter) all the previous captions were modified according
 to the latest one. If it was "figure" everything prior to that became a "figure" as well. If later I added a "table" all previous captions (which were turned into "figure") turned into "table" as well, and so on.<br />
<br />
I reopened the document, tried to see if there was any update to apply (unfortunately none, as I regularly apply updates), tried to open and repair the document (again no success). Apart from the table of contents, I also have a list of figures and a list of
 tables, one of which is empty while the other one contains all of them (figures and tables, depending on the latest caption with common numbering).<br />
<br />
The document is large with enough (not a lot) of pictures and a size of approx. 20MB. Until a total number of 20 captions (again approx.) everything seemed to be in order and figures were separated from tables with different numbering. Any ideas?<br />

            Make sure that the field codes are correct by pressing Alt+F9 to toggle all field codes.&nbsp; { SEQ Figure \* ARABIC } for figure captions and {&nbsp; SEQ Table \* ARABIC } for table captions.&nbsp; They are different numbering schemes*.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you suspect that the document
 may be damaged, use open and repair on the document.&nbsp; If Word does not fix the problem and you find that all your field are correct,&nbsp; you may have to avoid adding new caption to you document via the caption dialog.&nbsp; Instead, copy a table label + field code&nbsp;
 (or a figure label + field code, as appropriate), paste it where wanted, and update the field.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
*Are you, perhaps, trying to do something else—same number scheme, different label?&nbsp; The "way forward" (if I can use a little awful business jargon) is just a bit different:&nbsp; type the label then copy and paste the field code and update it.<br />

<h2>            band 2 quided workouts do not integrate with other apps to map a run</h2>
                    <p>I am using a band 2 on a windows phone and windows PC.&nbsp; I really like the run app as it can use the GPS to map my run and it then this app integrates very well with mapmyrun / mapmyfitness.&nbsp; I decided to try the guided work out option to provide me a guided
 plan for preparing to run a 1/2 marathon.&nbsp; The app on the band 2 works well to guide me thru a workout however it does not leverage the GPS to map the run and where is my issue - it does not integrate with the run application so even though I did a run it
 does not appear as run on the health application nor does it appear as a run on mapmyrun.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I am doing a guided workout - it is a run and should be tracked by the native run application and this should in turn also appear as a run in mapmyrun including leveraging the GPS to map the run.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to make this work that way I want it to work?</p>
