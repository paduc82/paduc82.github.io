            <p>Hi Diane,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the information. It's most likely that the issue is account related because your other account works fine. Can you please post your account (where you cannot change the Profile picture) in the private message area? This is for us to ensure that
 it's private and secure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's most likely that you are signed in to this site&nbsp;because you've been able to reply in the private message area. You should still be able to access or view the responses here by just signing in or going directly to this address.</p>

            <p>Michelle, I have no idea why my account profile has to be blocked, nor why I should not be able to access my account.&nbsp; My query, if you look through the post and replies, is simply about a failure by Microsoft to allow me to change my profile picture.&nbsp; I
 have no idea of what you are talking about regarding a "violation of the Code of Conduct" whatever!&nbsp; There is no reason, nor do I want, my account to be blocked AT ALL!&nbsp; I just want to be able to change my profile picture, and I am concerned by your comment
 that somehow you have found some "Code of Conduct" violation, whatever that means!&nbsp; I can assure you nothing on my account nor in my picture, contains anything I can even vaguely see as being in any way in violation of that Code!&nbsp; Can you please explain, and
 urgently ensure that my account is accessible, before proceeding to free up my picture so that it can be changed?&nbsp; That is ALL&nbsp;I asked for!</p>

<h3> steven&#38;&#38;&#38;&#38;&#38;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Home Use program office 2016 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Ive downloaded and activated my copy of office 2016pro on my windows 10 machine, the problem I have is that through the same HUP program I ordered the version for mac in error. I never actually downloaded the software to my machine as it came up with an
 error (at this point I realised my mistake). Anyway all is well all my programs run fine except that when I go into My office it only shows the version of office that I bought in error and never successfully downloaded.</p>
<p>I have tried multiple times to remove office and link the office 2016 which works fine until I open word ect to activate the program through my Microsoft account at which point I get an error saying this Microsoft account cant activate this version of office.
 Is there anyway of rectifying this. As stated ive already tried inputting my Microsoft account details and linking the product key and downloading office that way but still when it all finishes and it tries to utilise my Microsoft account to activate the software
 its like it cant find it, at which point I manually enter the key again and it unlocks the software but im still left with the my office issue, any pointers, im feeling its this mac version sitting there un installed that is the problem but I cant get rid
 of it from my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope ive explained my issue properly.</p>

            Office 2016 pro plus can only be activated using product key and HUP Office 2016 MAC using email id, so just open Word or any Office app. Click on File Tab &gt; Account and then sign out of Office app.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an old Access database that I wish to use. The problem is that I have Office 365 installed using Access 2016. Some functions of the old database are not compatible with Office 2016, How can I run the old database. Can I delete just Access 2016 without
 deleting the other prorams?&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be honest this is a pain. Newer versions should be able to operate the older ones!!!!</p>

            Depending on when your Access file was created, it could be supported under 2016. MDB files were replaced with Access 2007. So we are talking at least 10 years old. No software vendor maintains backward file compatibility indefinitely. 
<br />
<br />No, you can't uninstall Access separately. What might work for you is to download and install an older version of the Access runtime (I would suggest 2003 or 2007). And then try running your MDB through that. 
<br />
<br />I would then consider updating the MDB to current format.

<h2>            How Can I Delete Pages from my Newsletter created in Word 2008 New Blank Publishing Layout Document which have become &#39;un-deletable&#39;&#63;</h2>
                    I have created a newsletter from a Word 2008 New Blank Publishing Layout Document. &nbsp;I copied some images from Google images into a few blank pages to use at a later stage and now I cannot delete those pages which are now linked together, 2 at beginning
 and 4 at the end of the newsletter. Nor can I choose any of the images separately to move to other pages. &nbsp;I guess the pages are somehow 'corrupted'. &nbsp; The option to delete them is not available to me either under Edit or on the toolbar. &nbsp;How do I get rid
 of them? &nbsp;I don't mind if I lose the images.

<h2>            Calls breaking up when made from outside of Skype.</h2>
                    <p>Dear Skype Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am writing to you looking to solve an issue that's been bugging me over the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever a call is made to our company switchboard, which is connected with Skype Call Forwarding, the calls break up as soon as they reach the cell phone number that the calls are forwarded to.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87ce35a7-3bc1-4b1a-ae0e-30c1f3e8bc8e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87ce35a7-3bc1-4b1a-ae0e-30c1f3e8bc8e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I have tried toying around with the amount of seconds until a call is forwarded, which really is the only option I have in the settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d069b857-0af7-4989-afe3-2bc2d207285a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d069b857-0af7-4989-afe3-2bc2d207285a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>We have a Skype Number set up with Call forwarding.</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />To better understand the issue and help resolve, could you please let me know
<br />- has the setting you described ever work?
<br />- do you have a Skype subscription or credit?
<br />- what do you use the skype number for? is it the number you provide your customer to use to call the company?
<br />
<br />Looking forward to hearing back from you. 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week! 
<br />Margarida

<p>Hello Margarida,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it worked up until about a month ago. It still works when I call it from a Skype number. To answer your questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last instance of it working I have on register is the 15th of March.</li><li>We use Skype credits, which we have on the account.</li><li>We use the Skype number as our contact number, forwarding calls to two people at the company.</li></ul>
<p>

Alex</p>

<h2>            Office 2010 default even when Office 2013 installed</h2>
                    <p>I bought Office 2010 Home and student last year just before Office 2013 was released and took advantage of the 2013 uppgrade.
<br />
<br />
This left Office 2010 still installed - and I want to continue with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the default programme is still Office 2010. I have tried all the normal things in Control Panel / Program/ default programs - but I cant make it use Office 2013 when I click a office file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I change this so that it uses Office 2013 by default</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>Mal</p>

            You'll need to reregister Word using the specific version path. See <span>
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/Document_Not_Found.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/Document_Not_Found.htm</a>. I have four versions of Word installed, and I have to use this trick to reregister Word 2003 (my default version) after most updates of
 later versions. It could be that just repairing Office 2013 would do the trick, but reregistering Word 2013 is simpler. Of course, if you have to reregister every component of Office 2013 separately, then repair would be more efficient.</span>

            <p>Thank you for the quick reply Suzanne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I had a problem with not getting Office 2013 updates - I have already tried using the repair facility by going to the control panl program and right clicking office 2013 and selecting repair. Despite having a back up dvd it it seemed to completely download
 office including the very latest service pack which was good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the 'repair' clicking the program icons didnt load the problem, so I used the total remove tool and started again and all seemed to be well except for the association problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the /r method suggested - but that still hasnt made any difference. </p>
<p>The article you refer to seems to use a later version of Windows - so it doenst look too easy.<br />
<br />
Do you have any other ideas please.</p>

            <p>There is no "later version of Windows" than 8.1. The screen shots were probably taken in Windows XP or Windows 7. But that article only briefly touches on reregistering Word. What you want to do is find the complete path for the executable for Word 2013.
 On my Windows 7 system, it is</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15\WINWORD.EXE</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what you have to do is press <strong>Windows Key + R</strong> to open the Run box. In it paste the copied path and add the quotes and /r switch to get this:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15\WINWORD.EXE" /r</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>and press <strong>Enter</strong>. Note that there is a space before the /r switch, which is outside the quoted portion. This will "reregister" Word 2013, that is, reestablish it file associations (its "ownership" of the .docx, .dotx, etc. file types) in
 the Windows Registry. Word will not open, but you will get a message box similar to this one (but referencing Office 2013).</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>You can do the same for Excel 2013, but the switch is /regserver. The same may be true for other Office applications.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Before you start messing around with the registry, try taking the Winword.exe file in the Office 15 file and copying it. Paste a
<strong><em>shortcut </em></strong>on your desktop and rename it Word 2013 reregister. Then right click on it and get the properties. Add the [space]/r to the end of the target. Here's mine for Word 2010:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Once you have that changed click on OK and then double-click on it. If this works ,you might want to save it somewhere else. (I wouldn't want it on my desktop!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have one of these, it is very easy to add the /a and /safe switches to copies. Like Suzanne, I have multiple versions of Word on my computer and have noticed that updates tend to mess with registration. Here is my Safe Mode shortcut folder:</p>

            Current recommendations for minimizing junk mail<span>&nbsp;</span><b>in Outlook.com.</b>
<div>
<div>1. Sign in to&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://mail.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072C6">Outlook.com</font></a></strong>.<br />
<div>2. In the upper-right corner of the page, click the&nbsp;<strong>Cog</strong>&nbsp;icon, and then click on<strong><br />
More mail settings</strong>.<br />
3. Under&nbsp;<strong>Preventing junk mail</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>Safe and blocked senders</strong>.<br />
4. Under the&nbsp;<strong>Safe and blocked senders</strong>, click on&nbsp;<strong>Blocked senders</strong>.<br />
5. In the Blocked senders list, add the name or domain (the part of an e-mail address that follows the @ sign, such as outlook.com) that you don't want to receive mail from, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Add to list &gt;&gt;</strong>.<br />
<b><br />
You can create rules to delete incoming junk mails.</b><br />
1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click the&nbsp;<strong>Cog</strong>&nbsp;icon, and then click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>More mail settings</strong>.<br />
2. Under&nbsp;<strong>Customizing Outlook</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>Rules for sorting new messages</strong>.<br />
3. Click&nbsp;<strong>New</strong>&nbsp;and then under&nbsp;<strong>Step 1</strong>, click the drop down arrow on the first box and choose<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Sender's address</strong>.<br />
4. Under&nbsp;<strong>Step 1</strong>, type in on the third box the email address.<br />
5. Under&nbsp;<strong>Step 2</strong>, choose&nbsp;<strong>Delete these messages—don't even put them in my Deleted folder</strong>.<br />
6. Click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>&nbsp;at the bottom of the page.<br />
<b><br />
</b><font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><b><font color="#000000">You may also</font>&nbsp;set your Junk email filter to</b>&nbsp;<b>Exclusive</b>.<br />
If the Exclusive level was set, messages from senders not on your Contacts or Safe senders lists will be sent to the Junk folder.<br />
By default, the Junk folder will automatically delete messages after 10 days.<br />
This is more convenient as we don't have any control if senders are randomly changing their address.</span></font></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click the&nbsp;<strong>Cog</strong>&nbsp;icon, and then click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>More mail settings</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Under&nbsp;<b>Preventing junk email</b>, click&nbsp;<b>Filters and reporting</b>.</p>
<div>3. Under&nbsp;<strong>Choose a junk email filter</strong>, select Exclusive</div>

Might be a good idea to use the<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Sweep</b><span>&nbsp;</span>function too.
<ol>
<li><font>Sign in to your Microsoft account.</font></li><li><font>Go to your Inbox folder, locate the email then click the check box beside it.</font></li><li><font>Right above your Inbox, please click on<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Sweep</b><span>&nbsp;</span>dropdown arrow.</font></li><li><font>Please choose,<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Delete all of them?</b><br />
</font></li><li><font>Before clicking<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Delete all,</b><span>&nbsp;</span>you can tick the box for<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Also block future messages</b>.</font></li></ol>

<h2>            Sender images in gmail and windows live mail</h2>
                    <p>When I send an email from my windows live email to my gmail inbox, there is a sender image associated with my windows live address. I know how to turn off the sender image in Gmail, however i would like to permanently remove the association of this image
 with any account. &nbsp;Is there anywhere within windows where this would be stored? I have searched contacts and files but can't find anything.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry, i should have been more specific. This is occurring when i send an email from outlook (@live.com) to my gmail inbox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the email arrives, the gmail inbox shows a sender image (which i would like to remove). However from the sent items in outlook, my sender image is just my initials (my preffered sender image).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question, i see the same text/layout at the top of the window in both inboxes. Title, then sender image and sender address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the issue is in gmail, but i'm unsure if its picking up a photo somewhere in my microsft account.</p>

<p>This suggests you're viewing both of them in the (same) browser. I think I'd be right in saying that nowhere does
<strong>Windows Live </strong>or <strong>Windows Live Mail </strong>figure in your setup, then. I wonder why you chose the title you did ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see in Gmail whether you have connected the two profiles: hover over the sender name to see the contact card, then click
<em>Contact info</em>. What do you see under <em>Connected profiles</em>?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            VLookup, Guest &#35;&#39;s&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am sort of new to Excel functions. My fiance and I are looking to get a guest list spreadsheet going for our wedding. What I want is to have a guest number associated with everyone. It would be great if I could make different excel worksheets and if I
 wanted to add somebody to a section I could type in the guest number and their first and last name would automatically appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess I will have a "data" sheet with the left-most column as the guest # and all the basic info (name, address, email) shown. I want to be able to make other worksheets and be able to enter the guest # and have the guest's name appear in a column of my
 choice on the separate worksheet. I don't really know the best way to approach this and would appreciate some expertise. The main thing we are trying to accomplish is easier sorting on the guest list. I want to be able to move guests around the guest list
 by simply typing in the guest number, thus eliminating cut/paste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can offer!!</p>

<p>Hi, you can create your list in sheet1 column A ID#, column B name</p>
<p>then in order to get the name based on the ID# use the formula as follow</p>
<p>=index(sheet1!$B$1:$B$1000,match(A2,sheet1!$A$1$A$1000,0))</p>
<p>you don't need to sort your list in alphabetic order the above formula will get the information needed</p>
<p>change sheet1 for the name of your sheet</p>

<p>I have not looked at the templates personally, but this guy does good work. There are two versions available... free and paid... perhaps the free version will do all you need. Scroll to the bottom of this webpage to get the template (but you should read
 the rest of the page to see what the paid version offers)...</p>

<h2>            HTML email sent by Bcc is converted to plain text</h2>
                    Any email sent via Bcc is converted to plain text.&nbsp; Using Windows 7, McAfee Ver 10 and Outlook 2003.&nbsp; Searched the web and found similar problems on hundreds of forums, but no solutions.&nbsp; McAfee was re-installed and then troubleshot by McAfee technician
 and it's not the McAfee settings.&nbsp; Happens with numerous ISPs so that's not the problem.&nbsp; Definitely a Windows 7 setting somewhere...

<p>Well, I found the solution.&nbsp; It was a stupid mistake on my part.&nbsp; During an online troubleshooting chat with tech support at Frontier.com (James), James asked if my Outlook software updates were current.&nbsp; That was the problem.&nbsp; I was operating from a fresh
 install of Outlook 2003 on a new computer and I had not installed all the updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had to admit something as silly as this, but hopefully it will save someone else the trouble.&nbsp; Rest assured I will never make this mistake again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Case closed.</p>

<p>Since you want a TOC based on these numbered paragraphs, it will be easiest to use the built-in heading styles for the paragraphs. The article at
<a href="https://shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html</span></span></span></span></a> tells
 you how to do that. If you select the multilevel list that shows 1 Heading 1, 1.1 Heading 2, 1.1.1 Heading 3, your numbering levels will already be linked to the heading styles. You'll need to modify the number formatting (via
<strong>Define New Multilevel List</strong>) to have a period following the number, and, if you want the paragraphs to have the plain appearance you show above, you'll need to modify the heading styles themselves to have different font and possibly paragraph
 formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could use the built-in List Number series of styles, which are already quite plain, but (<em>a</em>) they're not already automatically linked to a list template, so you would have to do that manually, and (<em>b</em>) they would not automatically appear
 in a TOC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you plan to base a TOC on these styles, then by default the TOC would include the entire paragraph of each heading, which you say would be several sentences. To avoid that, you can use the style separator. Apply the heading style to only the part you
 want in the TOC, apply a non-heading style (a style with an outline level of Body Text) to the rest, and insert a style separator to make the two paragraphs join (see

<h2>            Auto complete doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hello there, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I'm having an issue with my auto-complete in outlook.com not working. And it is specific to only one computer, so I have no idea what setting or add on maybe affecting this.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for example, when you go to create a new email, and you click on the "To" field, normally it will populate with recent contacts. Or, once you start typing, it will begin to fill with the name of whomever you're typing. On this particular computer, that
 doesn't happen. I simply get no auto-complete results. This works on every other computer in this house, as well as every other location I've logged into my outlook.com account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a small list of specs that I am using on this computer. This is happening in Internet Explorer 9 only, FireFox and Chrome both work. I am using Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit. I have reset IE back to default many times with no avail, I have tried
 lowering all security settings to see if that would change anything, but nothing. Java and Flash are up to date. I've also tried disabling my anti-virus to see if that was affecting it, but this problem has pursued through 3 different antivirus software now,
 so I don't believe that to be the issue. (This isn't a problem on a laptop that is using the same antivirus currently, which is Eset Nod32.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks so much in advance, it's been a issue for several months and I finally got fed up with not being able to find any answers on the internet.&nbsp;

<h2>            Watch Option in actions in windows live mail, is it avail in outlook 2016</h2>
                    I have switched from windows live mail 2012 to outlook 2016 and I have used the flag and the watch actions. &nbsp;I do not see the Watch Action on my tool bar. &nbsp;I liked the way it made the email conversation red. to find it easily. &nbsp;Also i see with IMAP mail
 you cannot use categorize tags? &nbsp;What are my options with the new Outlook?

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently purchased a new Acer Aspire S 13 and at the time I also purchased a Office 365 subscription. I have downloaded and activated it but Word, Excel ect. all have (demo) written on them. Why is this like this? I'm not overly computer savvy so
 any help is much appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Donovan,</p>
<p>I personally have never heard of that one! Maybe it was a demo machine you bought!? I am not even sure if we have such things as Demo version for retailors but I think I know whom to ask so I&nbsp;will find a way to figure this out&nbsp;for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you provide a screenshot of where Demo is written?</p>
<p>Also can you find out&nbsp;the build number? Best way to find that out is&nbsp;open Word go to File/Account and you should see a version number there something like Version 1612 (build 1111.1111) OR 16.0.1111.1111.</p>
<p>A screenshot of the build number could also work. </p>

<p>You may want to check in your settings for activation. As far as preview evaluation copy in your bottom right hand corner is perfectly normal. The only time this is removed is when it becomes a RTM version. Nothing to worry about, it is the way it is suppose
 to be.</p>

 for the whole show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see it flash up in the top left corner where I see it in PPT 2013, but it doesn't stay on the screen and I can't seem to move my cursor in a way that gets it to come back.</p>

            <p>I just updated my Office 365 with the 2016 editions this week, including Powerpoint. I was recording slide narrations right before the update, and when I started to use it with the new yesterday noticed the same issue with the Recording Toolbar missing.
 I could see it flash before disappearing, so knew it was there, but not accessible. If you shift/tab to switch while in that mode, you can see it appear again, and you can catch it with the mouse (though it only pauses the session, and no other functions work).
 I also noticed some odd behavior with selecting the recording option for the current slide, and the menu suddenly disappearing (making me select it again). That lead me to believe either a program glitch, update necessary or possibly driver issue (video or
 mouse). I performed all Windows updates (v8.1; haven't updated to Windows 10 yet) with no change to the issue. I then updated my video driver (Nvidia) with no change either. There were no updates to my touchpad driver, but I also use a Logitech gaming mouse
 as my primary device (using the programmed buttons for everydays functions). I removed the old software and updated to the new (prefer rather than upgrading directly). That fixed the issue, and the Recording Toolbar menu is working properly for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps, but likely a glitch between Powerpoint and some other installed applications or software drivers, so try updating and/or removing specific things that run in the background. Good luck; back to narrating slides for me.</p>

            <p>RexAl - thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say you removed old software and updated to new, were you referring to uninstalling an earlier version of Office? &nbsp;Or was that a reference to something related to your Logitech gaming mouse?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're referencing Office, I don't think that will help me... I loaded all new version of Office 2016 on a brand spanking new computer. &nbsp; &nbsp;:0/</p>

            <p>The old software I removed was for my Logitech mouse. I still see an occasional glitch in PowerPoint with the mouse, but the original problem is still OK. PP definitely needs an update, but mine was tied to a software conflict. Experienced this type of thing
 before with one software not playing nice with another (not Microsoft) so have dealt with similar problems. If you have software installed you can remove to test things (accessories, background running programs, etc) you might try removing those to start,
 and reinstalling them if it doesn't resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck, and hope you can get the button bar back.</p>

    <title>Hyperlinks to bookmarks created in Outlook opening in browser - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hyperlinks to bookmarks created in Outlook opening in browser</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created an oft in outlook using an html template I created. I used the "Send page by email" feature in Internet Explorer to bring it into outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once bringing in email and creating the oft file, I've created bookmarks within the email that I am hyperlinking to from the intro of the email, like a Table of Contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is when sending these emails out, the hyperlinks I've created open the email into a browser window, instead of scrolling to the bookmark lower in the email, within outlook. So I need the links to just go to the bookmarks NOT open a browser window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>You may want to shorten that process by choosing; Insert As Text.</p>
<p>See:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msoutlook.info/question/26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Permanent Link to Insert HTML into mail"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Insert HTML into mail</span></a></p>
<p>You should be able to add bookmarks directly within the HTML as well by using;</p>
<p>&lt;a href="#intro"&gt;Link to intro&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&lt;a name="intro"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your intro header&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;Your intro text...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Yeah, I know, it is old style HTML4 by using the name attribute for the a tag instead of an id attribute on the h2 tag.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do this afterwards in Outlook as well. Is this the process that you use?<br />

<h2>            Office&#58; You&#39;ll need internet for this. 0xCAA30190</h2>
                    <p>I am using up-to-date Microsoft Office 2016 and Windows 10 and am having trouble signing in to my work onedrive account within the office products i.e Powerpoint, Word, etc. I open all of my documents from my onedrive directory which has worked until recently
 I have been prompted "Sign-In-Required. We can't save, or check for, changes because your cached credentials have expired". When I enter my valid username, I get the error "You'll need internet for this. 0xCAA30190". Does anyone know how to solve this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried deleting my office credentials in the credential manager, using the quick and online fix for office products, and have re-installed office, all without any success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Roberta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not find the solution in your link, however after trying many different things I have fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix the issue, within windows click Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Access Work or School</p>
<p>Then disconnect from your work or school account, and finally connect to your school or work account again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this helps other people with the same problem as it was very difficult to troubleshoot!</p>
<p>
