<h2>            Icons changed appearance on pinned bar</h2>
                    For some bizarre reason my icons have changed on their own accord.&nbsp; They no longer are the icons for the various Microsoft Office programs and are instead a generic looking "page".&nbsp; I can still access Excel, Word etc. but their icons are indistiguishable
 from each other where they are pinned to my desktop.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me how to change them back to individual program icons?

            <p>Hello DKlaar,<br />
<br />
It happens&nbsp;sometimes, but I don't know the reason.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Most of the times the problem may be resolved just by refreshing your desktop or after you restart your system.<br />
<br />
If this doesn't&nbsp;help, you may change them back manually.<br />
If the shortcuts are automatically created when you've install the office packed the "Change icon" button in "Properties" should be inactive, but if it's active you may just click on it and automatically will be opened the directory of last used icons. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Otherwise, you should go to the installation directory (should be&nbsp;<em>"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\"</em> by default) and create a new shortcut to desktop. When the shortcut is created, must be with the default icon. If the icon is still with the "<em>Unknown
 file</em>" icon, <strong>right click on the shortcut --&gt; "Properties"</strong>, in the tab
<strong>"</strong><strong>Shortcut"</strong> you should&nbsp;see the button <strong>"Change icon..."</strong>. Click it and select the icon you need.<br />
<br />
All the icons from the office packed are located in the installation directory.</p>
<p>If you use Microsoft Word 2013 you will locate all installed packages in the folder
<strong>OFFICE15 </strong><strong>("C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\OFFICE15")<br />
<br />
</strong>I hope this may be helpful&nbsp;for you. If isn't, just wait for the administrators answer.<br />
Have a nice day. :)</p>

    <title>Xbox One Day One Edition Controller Rumbler Grinding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gimli1357  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Day One Edition Controller Rumbler Grinding</h2>
                    
<p>I got my Xbox One on Day One and it has been working great since I got it. The only problem I'm having is that the controller's right trigger rumbler is making a loud grinding noise when it's activated. The controller was working fine and has not been dropped
 or hit at all, it has rested safely on a desk when not in use. I played through all of Dead Rising 3 two times and it worked fine, but now sounds like it's loose inside. All of the other rumblers in the controller are fine, but it's specifically the one in
 the right trigger that sounds like it's grinding. The controller works fine otherwise,&nbsp;nothing else is wrong with it. But when playing something like Halo: Spartan ****, the noise is really loud when a turret over heats or in Dead Rising 3 when a weapon
 breaks. The noise it makes&nbsp;sounds as if it were sitting on a solid wooden desk while rumbling at max. I'm afraid that every time it rumbles that it's causing more damage inside.</p>
<p>I want to get it repaired, but will I be able to get a Day One edition? I'm also not sure how to get a controller repaired as I don't see an option for that in the warranty and repair section but I know it has a 90 warranty on it. Any advice or help is appreciated.
 :)</p>

<h2>            Laptop makes loud buzzing noise upon windows 10 start up sound and then freezes</h2>
                    <p>I have a 6 yr old Dell Inspiron 17. &nbsp;This problem started when an update from Windows 10 (I think the anniversary update) was downloaded. I did the system restore point once and this helped but I have been receiving a lot of Windows 10 updates. &nbsp;Probably
 because of all of the issues I have read about with this update. &nbsp; Every time Windows 10 updates I have had the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

            <p>This sounds like an audio&nbsp;driver related problem... When you first upgraded to W10 did you check with Dell that their components were upgrade ready? Unfortunately MS failed to advise users to do this first and I suspect it has caused more than a few problems!
 Contact Dell online help and also check their user-forums because you may be more likely to find a solution there. - Cheers, Ric.

<br />If the restart and update option has come up and wont go away, it may be that Windows has figured out it needs an update and is eventually going to force one when you restart the PC and you will not have a chance to stop it. This usually takes a few days.

            Hi Paula.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'd schedule some time to Update to the latest version Update 1809 using the most stable method which is NEVER Windows update but instead install the Media Creation Tool from this link choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   This will save your files and apps while bringing you up to the latest version by the most stable method.  It will also bring all of your Updates current and solve most problems since it reinstalls Windows.  
<br />
<br />To prepare you can save a System Image backup externally so that if it fails you can restore Windows in 20 minutes using Rescue media and the stored image.  You'll then have two backups since there is also a Go Back from the Version Update that lasts ten days.  Your files should also always be backed up if you value them at all.
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Well, you can't really go back to before that button started, I think. You may try a restore if you have a restore point made. But really its just a wait and see what happens and make sure its still blocked from updating

<p>I understand it has ended but I have not had any problems. Since I last posted I see that some of the security updates successfully installed. The creator and fall feature updates failed 50 times so they are not going to install ever. I can manage as is.
 Everything works fine on my laptop. some need a restart to finish installing and that is what I think the update and restart refers to, don't you. Thank you</p>

<p>Are you implying that you, as a rule, never restart (or shutdown and start, (these are essentially 2 different procedures respectively)) your device? If so, this is bad practice, as a rule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the message to restart to finish installing means exactly just that as some integral system files cannot be changed (or otherwise manipulated to complete the updating process) while the OS is up and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say that some, apparently stand alone, security updates have installed successfully (implying that some others have failed?). Have any cumulative updates failed to install? Do be aware that the majority of security updates are incorporated into the monthly
 cumulative updates. Also, being that Win10 version 1703 is no longer supported, any device running it will become more vulnerable to infection as time goes on (unless, of course, it is not connected to and or not used at all to interact with the internet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How has the determination been made that newer version updates "<span>are not going to install ever"? Have the update issues been diagnosed?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What is the exact make and model number of the device in question (the complete model number designation if/as possible)?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What exact build number of Windows10 version 1703 is the device running at this time?</span></p>
<p>

            Hi SaleableChart70 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Try following one by one. Skip a step which you have already tried.
<br />
<br />A. Run Internet Connections / Network Troubleshooters
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt;
<br />1. Click Internet Connections &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />2. Click Network Adapter &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />B. Head to following Microsoft Help Link and execute the steps there
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br />C. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Guided Walk though - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />D.  As a last resort if nothing works - I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi,
<br />I suggest you to go through the below steps and check if it helps. 
<br />
<br />Type CMD in search box&gt; Right click the icons choose Run as Administrator&gt;
<br />Type &lt;netsh interface tcp show global&gt; Then  press enter
<br />See the line that shows "Receive Window Auto-Tuning level
<br />If it shows normal status,then you have to disable it
<br />If there is already disabled ok
<br />To disabled it type:-   netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled
<br />Then Press Enter
<br />
<br />Hope it works
<br />Thank you

<p>Hi Vijay and Vanishtavanshita, thank you for your help, but unfortunately this didn't help! I think the problem is related to one of these two things:</p>
<p>1. Some windows security setting: I was facing this problem till last week, and one day, I got a notification saying that some windows security setting has been changed. And after this incidence, internet speed came back to normal until today when it got
 down after windows update.</p>
<p>2. My network adapter is downgrading itself to 10 Mbps instead of 1 Gbps or similar speed, but I don't to know how to diagnose and correct this.</p>

<p>Back in the days of DOS, the PrtScn key used to print the screen. But<br />
in all versions of Windows, this works differently, and the name of<br />
the key is now an anachronism. The key does <strong>not</strong> print the screen.<br />
PrtScrn captures the whole screen, and Alt-PrtScrn captures the active<br />
window.</p>
<p>Either one captures the image to the Windows clipboard. Once it's in<br />
the clipboard you can paste (Ctrl-V) it into any application that<br />
supports graphics (Windows Paint, other graphics programs, even your<br />
favorite word processor). You can edit or add to the image as you<br />
wish, then print it.</p>
<p>This ability to manipulate the image in a program before printing it<br />
is an improvement over the original DOS method of just printing it.<br />
But if you'd like that old facility back, there are several<br />
third-party freeware/shareware programs that can do this, such as<br />

Yes, that is true. It would be freaking hard to downgrade all the hardware. But if you have upgraded to Windows 8, then you should have a factory settings cd which resets the hard disk and installs all the new drivers and Operating System.

    <title>Problem Activating Windows 7 OEM On Repaired Computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john king 93  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem Activating Windows 7 OEM On Repaired Computer</h2>
                    
<p>I bought a OEM copy of Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit for my custom built computer a month or two ago. Recently the motherboard failed and the product was discontinued so I had to purchase a new motherboard and processor. Since the old Windows copy was not
 compatible with the new hardware, I had to install a new copy of Windows7, and it will not activate. I realize that a OEM key can only be used on one computer, and one compute only, but I am using the same computer with hardware repairs. Does this mean I have
 to purchase a new key, or is the something Microsoft can do for me?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:<br />
<br />
- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel<br />
<br />
- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on<br />
<br />
<strong>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</strong><br />
<br />
- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>You could try using phone activation and explain your case and see if they might be able to help you:</p>
<p>Activate Windows 7 manually:<br />
1. Click Start, and in the Search box type :&nbsp; slui.exe 4<br />
<br />
2. Press ENTER on your Keyboard<br />
<br />
3. Select your Country.<br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, and hold on for a real person.</p>

<p>If the motherboard that has failed and has been discontinued then if you purchased the new motherboard from the same manufacture and it is considered the replacement by the manufacture for the discontinued model then you&nbsp;may be (at Microsoft discression)&nbsp;allowed
 to use the same OEM product key. But it must be a replacement and not an upgrade.</p>
<p>How to activate Windows 7 manually<br />
1) Click Start, and in the Search box type:&nbsp;&nbsp; slui.exe&nbsp; 4<br />
2) Next press the 'ENTER' key<br />
3) Select your 'Country' from the list.<br />
4) Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.<br />

<h2>            Windows Media Player &#34;Server Execution Failed.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using an HP laptop, and this issue has recently reoccured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to play any media file with Windows Media Player, I get the "Server execution failed" error. When I try to launch WMP from any location, nothing happens. I can open wm_setup from the WMP program folder, but that's about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happened to me once before. I never figured out what was causing it, but it was fixed with&nbsp;a system restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, it's back. I'm still not sure what is causing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am able to temporarily fix the issue by opening an elevated command prompt and running "regsvr32 jscript.dll." After I run this, WMP works fine until I restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1) </strong>Does anybody know how to <em>really </em>fix this issue? I would rather not uninstall and re-install WMP. I have seen all of the posts that say to do things to the Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service; I have followed the advice.
 It has not worked for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2) </strong>What is it about jscript.dll that is influencing and disabling WMP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Can&nbsp;anybody shed some light on why this happens to WMP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said this has happened once before. I am not sure what set it off this time. However, I have two suspicions. It seems like there might be a correlation between times that I have downloaded music from Google Play and times when this has happened. Also,
 It seems like it stopped working&nbsp;after I had installed and uninstalled Microsoft WebMatrix and All of its components and extra software, including multiple SQL programs and IIS Express.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I have already tried to do a system restore. I didn't work this time around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice is appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

Hello Anil, thank you for your response.</p>

<p>I have seen this piece of advice before.</p>

<p>What does it actually do?</p>

            <p>Hello Anil, I tried your steps. I am still having the same problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The troubleshooter failed to actually correct anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The command didn't change anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The procedure for using services.msc failed to change anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had already tried a clean boot...still, no change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said in my initial post, I can successfully start WMP if I run<strong> regsvr32 jscript.dll
</strong>from an elevated command prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is this dll file inhibiting WMP or WMPNetworkSvc from working correctly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there another option that I can try before uninstalling and reinstalling WMP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any specific information that I need to provide to make troubleshooting easier?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using an HP laptop, and this issue has recently reoccured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to play any media file with Windows Media Player, I get the "Server execution failed" error. When I try to launch WMP from any location, nothing happens. I can open wm_setup from the WMP program folder, but that's about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happened to me once before. I never figured out what was causing it, but it was fixed with&nbsp;a system restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, it's back. I'm still not sure what is causing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am able to temporarily fix the issue by opening an elevated command prompt and running "regsvr32 jscript.dll." After I run this, WMP works fine until I restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1) </strong>Does anybody know how to <em>really </em>fix this issue? I would rather not uninstall and re-install WMP. I have seen all of the posts that say to do things to the Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service; I have followed the advice.
 It has not worked for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2) </strong>What is it about jscript.dll that is influencing and disabling WMP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Can&nbsp;anybody shed some light on why this happens to WMP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said this has happened once before. I am not sure what set it off this time. However, I have two suspicions. It seems like there might be a correlation between times that I have downloaded music from Google Play and times when this has happened. Also,
 It seems like it stopped working&nbsp;after I had installed and uninstalled Microsoft WebMatrix and All of its components and extra software, including multiple SQL programs and IIS Express.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I have already tried to do a system restore. I didn't work this time around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice is appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>But you have will to install the program into your WOW64 if you are running Windows 7 64 bit...system folder and run an elevated cmd prompt, then execute the cmd file they show you how to create...

That's because they don't get paid enough to think about the problem... being a level 1 and 2 IT specialist... I noticed a lot of buggy things happening with my user permissions... as well as wmplayer, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a permissions issue....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this but you'll have to use your wow64 system directory, to install and execute the cmd file&nbsp;if you have Windows 7 64 bit...&nbsp;

<p><font>Once you connect the LITEON external disk drive, you need to install the application that would have been provided along with the product. After that open File Explorer and click

<p><br />
You can restore them by right clicking somewhere on your desktop, not taskbar... on your wallpaper ... then go to personalize then on the left hand bar click on "Change Desktop Icons" then check the box for the&nbsp;icons that you want to appear on your desktop
 then click apply and then ok ...</p>
<p>Then they should appear ... if they did not then right click on your desktop again then go to view then make sure "show desktop icons" is ticked.</p>
<p>For other&nbsp;missing shortcuts you have to create them manually...&nbsp;if you require help then let me know..&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to fix Dxgkrnl.sys in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My computer was fine, and then I walked away from it without shutting it down.&nbsp; After 30 minutes, it was not in the sleep mode but froze up, with a black screen.&nbsp; The mouse or keypad wouldn't make it work again.&nbsp; I shut it down forcefully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I turned it on again, the blue screen&nbsp;said "system_thread_exception_not_handled (dxgkrnl.sys)."&nbsp; Thus, I am trying to see what I can do to fix the problem, so it does not come back again later.&nbsp; Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Cheryl and Denise,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for&nbsp;your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can remove the account&nbsp;you use to login to the system by first changing the Microsoft account you use to login to the local and then changing it back to the Microsoft Account using your new email address.
</p>
<p>Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Login&nbsp;to Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>2. Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt;<strong> Your account</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Select <strong>Sign-in with a local account instead.</strong></p>
<p>4. Provide your current Microsoft Account Password.</p>
<p>5. Follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>6. Once you have successfully changed&nbsp;to Local account, follow the below steps to&nbsp;change it back to new Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>7. Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt;<strong> Your account</strong>.</p>
<p>8. Select <strong>Sign-in with a&nbsp;Microsoft account instead.</strong></p>
<p>9. Provide your current&nbsp;Local Account Password.</p>
<p>10. Follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Also <strong>note</strong> that if your Microsoft Account you use to login to the system&nbsp;has been added to the Mail App, then you will not be able to remove&nbsp;this&nbsp;account&nbsp;from the Mail App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please respond if you have further related queries.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

                    I've been trying to create a partition on my Vista machine so I can run Windows 8 in a dual boot setup. However no matter what I do, it just won't work. I've used the windows disk management utility and got nothing but error messages including "incorrect
 parameters" and "catastrophic failure".... I went on to use several different downloaded programs but the story is much the same.&nbsp;
<div><br />

<div>No matter what programs or methods I use I can't create a partition. Any idea on what's happening?&nbsp;</div>

<p>Using your smartphone or Iphone as a hotspot to connect your console to the Internet just creates a lot of headaches. Xbox LIVE is quite demanding, therefore, it is recommended that you have a stable connection and a decent bandwidth/Internet speed for the
 best experience to Xbox LIVE.</p>

<p>I was having the same problem… It appears on my list of available networks but won't allow me to connect.</p>
<p>But my 360 will connect to it just fine.. Also, it won't charge or even recognize my iPhone when I plug it into the Xbox One USB drives, but will recognize/charge and use the Personal Hotspot's connection off of my friend's phones.. Not sure what the deal
 is, but It's really been a let down considering I don't have internet at my house which makes the XB1 practically useless. Would really like a solution to this as well.</p>
<p>COUNTRY: USA</p>
<p>Modem Brand: iPhone 5 Personal Hotspot</p>
<p>Wired or Wireless: Wireless</p>
<p>Things I've Tried: Turning Xbox On/Off, Turning HotSpot On/Off, Etc..</p>
<p>UPnP? Not sure, I don't think the iPhone has UPnP, but regardless, my 360 can connect just fine.</p>
<p>No NAT Errors.</p>
<p>No Error Codes, Just Typical Xbox Diagnostic Tests/Suggestions That Fail.</p>

<p>I have the same problem. I bought a new One on a Thanksgiving trip and do not have broadband where I am. I was hoping I could it set up using my iPhone hotspot but, despite being able to see my SSID, the XBone won't &nbsp;connect. Really disappointed about this.
 I guess I'm out of luck until I get back home. </p>

<p>Hey Jacko,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that Start here article have you tried the other troubleshooting steps that were provided?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey SnizzyGetsMoney,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was your friend able to connect successfully with their phones hotspot? The Console doesn't support third party accessories at this point so attaching an Iphone to charge will not work at this time. Was the conection from the hotspot holding through out
 the time you spent playing online or was its laggy? Connecting to a hotspot is one thing having reliable Download speed is another. Have you done a speed check with a different device to see how well your hotspot performs? The Xbox One is a demanding system
 so reach back and let us know what you find.</p>

<p>Same problem for me guys, however I have a work around if you have a jailbroken iphone.</p>
<p>Download My Wii in cydia, use this app to change your hotspot name and change the encryption type.</p>
<p>Once done you xboxone will connect normally.</p>
<p>For support records.</p>
<p>What Country/State/Province do you live in? &nbsp;UK</p>
<p>Modem brand &amp; model number: IPHONE 5</p>
<p>Router brand &amp; model number: IOS 6.1, also tried iphone 4GS IOS 7.0.1</p>
<p>Wired or wireless: wireless</p>
<p>Things you have tried: tried turning both xbox and phone on and off, manually setting SSID, trying different encryption types when doing manual setting</p>
<p>Is UPnP Enabled? N/A , this is a wireless connection issue not a port issue.</p>
<p>Do you have a NAT error? Again, the devices will not establish a link</p>
<p>Any Error Codes you encounter: "CANNOT CONNECT TO INTERNET"</p>

<p>Ok, so I had the exact same problem as all of you and when racin snake said that he had to change his hotspot name it made me wonder if some characters in the iPhone name might confuse the network, so I went in my iPhone to general &gt; about &gt; and changed
 the phone name to something simple (Verizon1) for me. &nbsp;And boom it worked (I have an iPhone 5). &nbsp;I'm not good at remembering to come back to these things but I'll try to come back if someone needs help, it's INCREDIBLY irritating to buy one of these and not
 be able to use it so I understand your guys frustration. :)</p>

<p>Crimsonhealer2's fix works. Make sure you don't have any commas, apostrophes, etc in your phones name and it will connect!

            Hi Sulaiman
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Its possible there might be an issue with your adapter or cable connection. You could try nudging the cable to see if it works or change out the cable. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Monitors
<br />
<br />Right click the monitor that is not working.
<br />Click uninstall
<br />
<br />Restart your computer then check if its working again properly.
        </p>

            Hi Sul3y.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See possible fixed for HDMI failure here:
<br /><a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/hdmi-port-not-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/hdmi-port-not-wo...</a>
<br /><a href="https://troubleshooter.xyz/wiki/fix-hdmi-port-not-working/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://troubleshooter.xyz/wiki/fix-hdmi-port-n...</a>
<br />
<br />Since one common fix is updating or reinstalling the display driver, I would follow these extra steps to Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks, Andre &amp; Greg for replying.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I have already done everything that has been mention above. <br />
<br />
Still, no luck and I checked the HDMI cable to another laptop and my ps3, it works fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do notice something in the device manager, which one particular device is detected as unknown.
<br />
Which I think that is for HDMI port or I might be wrong.<br />

            They way this is handled for the Unknown Device is to trace it's Hardware ID as shown in this illustrated tutorial:
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />It will show you how to trace the Hardware, search for drivers and install them.  
<br />
<br />Ask back if you have any questions.
