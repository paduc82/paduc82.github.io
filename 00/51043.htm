    <title>Usermode font driver host infected - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Usermode font driver host infected</h2>
                    <p>I have compared my fontdrvhost to a known file size (~540 kb) and my file is size is about 200 kb larger (~733 KB). My computer has been acting strange and I am pretty sure I have malware, I am also pretty sure this file is the problem. What should I do?
 I have files I don't want to lose on this computer (obviously...)! I have ran Malewarebytes pro, as well as windows offline scan... thing... and nothing has popped up (except for a few PUPs that I have since removed). I most likely have other important OS
 infections too (just knowing how malware works).</p>

            <p>Jodi - Hi </p>
<p>There are quite a few possibilities for what could be going on here... the sfc result is good, so we need to eliminate a few things... first of all can you just check what image you see when you use the keyboard shortcut (Windows Key - hold that and press
 L) - is it still the rocks, or your chosen picture? Make sure you have selected a different picture in 'settings' first. - Thanks, Ric.</p>

            <p>yes, the chosen picture comes up the the keyboard shortcut.&nbsp; So then I did a restart to see if it was still the cairn (rocks) and it still was.&nbsp; Additionally the setting about the weather that I added is there, and not on the lock screen with the cairns.</p>

            <p>Thanks Jodi - technically that is the start screen although it should still be possible for your chosen image to appear there instead of the dreaded rocks!</p>
<p>Have you got the switch set to&nbsp;ON in settings for 'Show Lock Screen background picture on sign in screen?' If not try it...&nbsp; If it is on turn it off - turn off your weather app and any others that may be on,,, and then in Lock Screen settings choose
 when tested with the keyboard shortcut and update me.</p>
<p>Thanks - Ric.</p>

            <p>The same thing happened to me with the recent update (my husband too).</p>
<p>Why do updates change settings?</p>
<p>Not only did it change the lock screen picture, but when I go to the windows icon on the lower left corner, now things look different.</p>
<p>With a previous update, my restore settings were changed, with the allowed restore space slider moved down to practically nothing. I lost several restore points, and searching around, lots of other people had the same problem. I also had a newly installed
 program uninstalled (other people too)</p>
<p>Windows - leave my computer alone!! An update shouldn't change settings.</p>

<h2>            Internet Connection Takes Far Too Long</h2>
                    I realize this question has been raised and answered on more than one occasion over the years, but I have reviewed many of those solutions and nothing seems to work for me. &nbsp;I'm now on the verge of re-installing my OS.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running Windows 7 on a Dell Studio XPS 1645. &nbsp;I am also using a LinkSys N Ultra wireless N broadband router. &nbsp;I have a 100 GB SSD that is 85% full...much of my saved data is on external drives. &nbsp; I also have McAfee Security Centre installed with both
 virus, spyware plus web and email protection running, but this has been running on this computer since 2010 and it has never caused a problem before. &nbsp;However, lately my computer has been taking a very long time to connect to the Internet.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After I boot up my computer connects to my WiFi within a few seconds. &nbsp;It states that I have connectivity to the wireless router as well as the Internet. &nbsp;However, as soon as I try to open my web browser/search engine it will take between 20-40 minutes
 to physically give me access to the web.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is something that began to happen 2-3 weeks ago. &nbsp;I'm pretty sure it's not my wireless router because my smartphone and my net book both connect to the Internet within seconds using that same WiFi connection. &nbsp;So I'm confident it has something to
 do with my computer, but how do I go about troubleshooting this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I found limited advice on-line and flushed out the DNS cache, deleted cookies and accumulated Internet files, did a complete disk check, and of course tried rebooting both the cable modem and wireless router...none of this worked. &nbsp;While my computer was
 waiting for access to the Internet I was reviewing processes through Task Manager and the processor was never being utilized by more than 2%, so there are no obvious processes running during that phase of my troubleshooting. &nbsp;I also tried a system restore
 to when I believe the trouble started...that did not work either.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Suggestions?</div>
                </div>

            SOLVED:
<div><br />
<div>I found on-line an obscure reference to McAfee being a problem in some cases, specifically with my computer (Dell Studio XPS 1645). &nbsp;So I reviewed the programs installed on my computer and noticed that one McAfee program (I have two installed) was installed
 on October 15th, which is around the time I started experiencing my Internet access issue. &nbsp;I initially thought it was my wireless router because I had also just managed to get it working properly again around the same time; hence, the reason for any confusion
 on my part.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In any case I experimented by uninstalling that one McAfee program and saw right away that this was the problem...I was able to access the Internet within 1-2 seconds again as soon as it was no longer on my computer. &nbsp;That particular McAfee program was
 then re-installed properly and it is all running the way it should now.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm guessing that this particular McAfee program was auto-installed on October 15th...it was not something I did manually, or even wittingly. &nbsp;It must have been one of those automated reminders on which I "clicked" to install the new update or version,
 and something probably did not quite install correctly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Lesson learned...when you have issues always check your software installation dates to see if any of those correlate to the time you began experiencing your problem :-).</div>

<h2>            L&#246;schen all meiner Spielst&#228;nde in der Cloud</h2>
                    <p>Hey ich hoffe ich kann hier Hilfe bekommen. Ich würde gerne alle meine Spielstände aus der Xbox One Cloud löschen. Ja ich weiß es geht über das Spiel und dann Spielstand von Cloud und Konsole löschen. Aber ich suche nach einer schnelleren Variante denn ich habe ungefähr 50 Spiele und nur 500 GB Speicherplatz auf der Konsole und ich würde mir gerne das lästige deinstallieren und installieren ersparen. Ich hoffe ihr versteht was ich meine. Danke schon mal im Vorraus.</p>

<p>To install Windows 10 on your PC, the processor (CPU) must support the following features: Physical Address Extension (PAE), NX, and SSE2. Most CPUs have support for these features, so if you receive this error, it is likely because the NX feature is not
 enabled on your system.</p>

</p><p>If your computer does support these extensions, you could still try using ISO media. In some instances, you might have to switch from your current architecture,&nbsp; 64 to 32 bit since these requirements mostly affect installation of 64 bit Windows 10:</p>

<p>
</p><p>You may need to use any third party software or program so that the information about the icon appears on the right of the icon. You may use your favorite search engine to find such program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, using third party software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of third party software can be solved. Using
 third party software is at your own risk.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Acer Support. If you need an Windows 7 Disk (the OEM installation media) they will sell it<br />
cheap since you already own Windows. Acer Support can also tell you about any recovery option they<br />
have set in place.<br />

<p>You can try some of these in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />

<h2>            Video call to known party</h2>
                    <p>Skype 12.10.572.0</p>
<p>I have tried to make a video call to a contact which is currently active.</p>
<p>This is a contact that I have previously reached via video call many times before.</p>
<p>Skype appears to perform the call. The sound is heard, the photo of the contact is flashing, "Connecting" is displayed.</p>
<p>The call terminates after the maximum number of rings.</p>
<p>The call was never received by the intended recipient. </p>
<p>However a message is soon displayed at the destination: "MISSED CALL" "CALL BACK"; included are the name of the caller and the time of the call.</p>
<p>On the caller's side the message displays <span>"MISSED CALL" "CALL BACK"&nbsp;</span><span>and the time of the call.</span></p>
<p><span>In both cases "contact name &amp; you" are included. The call time is 0 seconds.</span></p>
<p>Any explanation for this problem? Any solution?<span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade stuck on &#34;Downloading&#34; and &#34;Preparing for the upgrade&#34;</h2>
                    Once again, Windows OS is a failure.&nbsp; I set the upgrade to running before Ieft for work (after having to jump through a bunch of hoops just to get it to start to download).&nbsp; 10+ hours later, one window still says "Downloading Windows 10" the other window
 says "Preparing for the upgrade"&nbsp; both have scroll bar thins that are moving, but nothing to really indicate progress (i.e. % complete)&gt;&nbsp; What do I have to do to get this upgrade to work.&nbsp; And why doesn't Microsoft just make a product that works the first
 time?

            <p>There are too many different types of hardware it must adjust to. Upgrade is also dependent upon the condition of the old OS which in many cases we're seeing are virtual junkyards.&nbsp; Plus no tech enthusiast would run an in-place Upgrade or Factory Install
 in the first place, and many are both.</p>

                    I just bought a laptop PC (from Microsoft Store) with Windows 10 Home preinstalled.&nbsp; The system comes with a SSD system drive and a large HDD for storage, but the preinstall is set up with the user profiles folder also on the system drive.&nbsp; I need to do
 a fresh install of Windows 10 to move the users folder to the storage drive.&nbsp; Is there a way to do this?

 in in safe mode but that doesn't work, shutting the pc down, logging off the standard user......various other things but still can't log in to administrator. However if I change any settings in standard user account that requires administrator the password
 is ok. Very frustrating, please help.

            Hi.
<br />
<br />If your computer begins to feel buggy and you notice problems during boot, you can use the System File Checker (SFC) command-line utility to check the integrity and replace any corrupted or missing protected system files with a known good version.
<br />
<br />When SFC is unable to fix the problem, chances are the utility was unable to get the necessary files from the Windows image, which might have become broken. In this situation, you can use DISM to repair the Windows image (.wim), which then it will allow you to use the System File Checker to fix any issue with your Windows 10 installation.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />

            I'm going to guess you must have a new Dell. &nbsp;This is an application written by Dell specifically for their PCs. &nbsp;They are who you should be asking at this point, that's what warranties are for. &nbsp;The issue really has nothing to do with Vista, other than
 that's the operating system your friends' Dells have. &nbsp;Looks like you can download it here:

<p><span>Hi Jazzy477,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You cannot connect plasma TV to a computer wirelessly as there is no such option available in Windows 7 yet and nor does plasma
 TV support that feature.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the below link which might help you in connecting the plasma TV to the computer using wired connections.</span></p>

                    Since installing Windows 7, I get a warning box on the front page every time I start the computer.&nbsp; The message is "Microsoft .NET Framework Version 2.0 is required to continue"&nbsp; I have a 64 bit system and I have tried to load the .Net 2.0 but each time,
 the computer comes back with "this is already loaded as a part of the operating system.&nbsp; If I click OK, the box goes away and everything appears to work fine.&nbsp; How do I get rid of the box and message?&nbsp; BTW, I even tried the .Net 86 and it did not want it either
 - said it was incompatible.
