<h2>            Cl&#59;ean install windows 10 on old computer from DVD</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an old computer that a new intern needs to use until i upgrade the machine to a new one. I have to install windows 10 on this machine as it had windows XP. I have paid for Win 10 single language (32 bit), followed the instructions on the Microsoft
 Win 10 site for download, burned the ISO to DVD using CyberLink DVD Suite (This should not pose an issue) and now I cannot get the computer to use the DVD as the boot device. I chose it as the first boot device in the BIOS, and that did not work. I then went
 and pressed F12 and chose DVD as boot device and it just carried on through to XP.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone assist me with this as I need this computer on Monday! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike</p>

            <p>I can't be sure, but it sounds like you didn't create the DVD properly and it's not bootable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And by the way, there's a possibility that your old computer is not compatible with Windows 10, or that you will need Windows 10 drivers for some of it s components and they are not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And best case, if you do get it to run Windows 10, it is unlikely that it will run it with acceptable performance.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant make the F1-12 keys default on a Microsoft Nano Transceiver v2.0</p>
<p>The default is the previous (F1), play/pause (F2),next (F3), sleep (F4) and so forth.</p>
<p>Why would someone make it so is beyond my reason.</p>
<p>Although I found the same topic...:<br />

<p>
</p><p>... the solution (Fn+CapsLock) doesn't seem to work (nothing happens).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? I would really like to have bought a usable keyboard.</p>

<p>Hi Teodor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>Multimedia Keys</strong> and <strong>Function Keys</strong> can be interchanged. However, methods for interchanging them depends on your device OEM and keyboard.&nbsp;The most common method is using the
<strong>Fn Lock</strong> key. Toggle the <strong>Fn Lock</strong> on and the&nbsp;keys will function as if you’re holding down the Fn key all the time, just as the Caps Lock key makes your letter keys function as if you’re holding down the Shift&nbsp;key all the time.
 Devices use a dedicated <strong>Fn Lock</strong> key, and if you don't find one, you may have to press and hold the
<strong>Fn</strong> key and then press <strong>Fn Lock</strong> (secondary to another key,
<strong>Esc</strong> for example) to activate it. Some keyboards may use other combinations to toggle
<strong>Fn Lock</strong>. For example, Surface devices use <strong>Fn</strong>+<strong>Caps Lock</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Reference:</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>Another method is to change it via BIOS or UEFI configuration screen and once again, it varies from device to device.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - slow Wi-Fi connection, results in being disconnected most of the times</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you may have noticed in the title, I am posting this thread to report that I am occurring problems with my internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed Windows 10 more than a month ago, and since then I am struggling with terrible connection. My Wi-Fi used to be fine whole the time until I installed Windows 10. Then it started to act weird. Most of the times it would instantly change from
 fast to slow, and 80% is the chance that I will get disconnected. It's extremely annoying to keep up with this, I am losing my nerves. First I was using your new browser, Microsoft Edge. I thought that is the problem so I stopped using it. Besides, it was
 extremely laggy, had issues while trying to write something. But nevermind about that, the thing is that I am using Google Chrome now. I thought that would fix the problem, but nope.. it didn't. My computer with net source is in my next room. On my phone I
 can run Wi-Fi with a lighting speed, whilst on laptop connection is terrible. This all started to happen since I installed Windows 10, before that it was fine. Not to mention that internet disconnects most of the time when I am not even using the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am seriously thinking to get back to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No offense, but I have a feeling that Microsoft Windows 10 is intended to screw up with the internet connection.. etc. there was some option which was automatically enabled to share my bandwith with other Windows 10 users to help them download updates faster.
 Do I actually wanted to help them? This way Windows 10 was practically stealing my bandwith by automatically having it enabled. Then we have automatic updates which screw up with the net even more. I used to run on Windows 8/8.1, didn't installed any update.
 My antivirus didn't detected any virus, neither was anything wrong with the system. So, all this about system being unprotected sounds like some sort of manipulation attempt. No offense once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I don't get a solution for this, I am afraid that I'll have to get back to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are going to suggest me to upgrade devices, I want to inform you that I already tried that. I've gone to 'Device Management' and I've tried to upgrade each component under "Network adapters" category. Each of them claims to be up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, your help is needed. Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Thank you for answering me, please read the following.<br />
<br />
After I have ran Network Adapter Troubleshooter, there's one problem which occurred.. it says "The problem with a wireless adapter or access point". When I click on the "Details" it says "Explore the problems with the router or access point" and on the right
 said it claims that it's "Not fixed".<br />
<br />
Additional problem, not related to this one I am unable to operate from Desktop. When I pressed Windows key+X it opened that window on the left side below. When I've tried to click on the "Control Panel" nothing happens, happens with all other options too.
 Also, if I try to right click on "My Computer" and click on "Manage" same thing, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried Method 2 and Method 3. None of it seems to work. Looking forward for other solutions, thank you.</p>

            <p>I'll like to add that there is nothing wrong with my router. Every other kind of wireless connection works. I've tried to connect with my phone, works perfectly with fast speed. Only laptop behaves this way since I installed Windows 10.</p>

            <p>I've had this problem since win 8.</p>
<p>then last November a patch fixed it.</p>
<p>when I upgraded to win 10 it was broke again (wifi dropping)</p>
<p>I think Microsoft put the bad code into win 10 and forgot to fix it</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created this batch file/shortcut that I keep on the desktop. </p>
<p>it's all the thing I did for win 8.</p>
<p>its not a fix but it gets the wifi back quickly most of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>netsh interface set interface name="Wi-Fi" admin=disabled<br />
netsh interface set interface name="Wi-Fi" admin=enabled<br />
ipconfig /release<br />
ipconfig /renew<br />
arp -d *<br />
nbtstat -R<br />
nbtstat -RR<br />
ipconfig /flushdns<br />
ipconfig /registerdns</p>
<p>
</p><p>open notepad copy the code and save as wifiReset.bat</p>
<p>when wifi drops just right click and run as administrator</p>
<p>or create a shortcut and change it to run as administrator </p>
<p>right click on desktop new-shortcut&nbsp;browse to batch file and the give it a name</p>
<p>right click, click advanced select administrator</p>
<p>
</p><p>each command resets different things</p>
<p>don't worry about errors depending on the wifi status some commands will give you errors</p>
<p>hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Rob,&nbsp; Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I fixed my problem another way but honestly still don't know what the fix was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received a list of potential problems (one being low signal strength).&nbsp; So I bought a $44 wifi signal booster/extender.&nbsp; Once I hooked it up and (even though its further away from my router than the computer) I have great connection.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I downloaded a third party driver for my wifi adaptor.&nbsp; I did all of this simultaneously and...all of a sudden POOF my wifi doesn't drop every 30 seconds.&nbsp; Blazing speed as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said not sure what actually fixed my problem, but I'm up and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Brian</p>

When you enter your password almst anywhere, not just when logging in,&nbsp;the characters you type are replaced with dots on the screen. That's so someone looking over your shoulder can't see what you've entered.</p>

<h2>            Start menu closes prematurely</h2>
                    
Hi there.

I have got a problem driving me mad: as soon as I open my Start menu or any 
other application's context menu it automatically closes within just a few 
seconds without notification or error.&nbsp; The crazy thing about this is the 
fact that it only happens when I log in using my usual user account.&nbsp; As soon 
as I create a new one on the same system, with the same set of installed 
applications and services, or simply log in as another user everything starts 
working just fine.&nbsp; I have already tried disabling every single application 
and service one by one when logged in as the problematic user but so far all 
in vain.

Any ideas?

Many thanks in advance for good advices.

<p><span><span>Hello again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I am coming back to report that I have finally found a suitable solution for this particular problem and here it is:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since Microsoft was unable to help me I had no other option but to re-create the affected account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, there are a few steps that you might consider taking prior to disposing of the old account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The following steps ensure that in the end you retain as many software settings as possible within your new account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Back up your old account by simply copying all files within the respective c:\Users subfolder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Take heed of all special files such as NTUSER.DAT to be found at the root of your user's subfolder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Do not forget to adjust your explorer's settings to be able to see hidden and system files.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Log in using the broken account and run regedit or even better a more sophisticated tool such as TuneUp Registry Editor. Go to HKCU and export the entire
 Software key to a REG file.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Delete your old account via System Properties &gt; Advanced &gt; User Profiles.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Be sure to log in as local Administrator before you do so, otherwise you will not be able to remove an active profile.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Create a new user account giving it the name of the old one.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Log in as local Administrator and go into c:\Users\&lt;your_new_user&gt;.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Copy all files you can see such as NTUSER.DAT to a temporary destination.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. Copy your back-up data from step 1 into the new user subfolder overwriting all new files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I recommend using additional software such as Acronis True Image for example because Windows might not allow copying or overwriting certain files at this point.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. Take all files from step 5 and copy them back to your user’s folder overwriting the old ones whenever prompted.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8. Log in as the new user and run TuneUp Registry Editor.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Use the REG file from step 2 to import it into your new clean HKCU branch.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Note: Windows regedit will most likely refuse merging your back-up REG file with the registry for some reason.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That is why I strongly recommend using different software for this particular purpose (I have successfully tested TuneUp Registry Editor as mentioned above).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>9. Once the merging is done log off and back in again to make sure your old software settings are applied properly.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Verify that everything (or at least the most part of it) works as expected.</span></span></p>

<br />
<br />You can print by simply pressing "Ctrl+P" while inside paint3d.

            I am using a Canon PIXMA MX340, and I want to be able to print specific pages of a fax, rather than the whole fax.&nbsp; How do I do this?&nbsp; The "selection" and "pages: " options in the "Page Range" area are greyed out, and the "current page" option is available,
 but prints the entire fax regardless.&nbsp; How do I fix this?&nbsp; I have the most recent driver installed already.

Let's say you have selected a five-page fax you have received in Windows Fax &amp; Scan.&nbsp; You want to ONLY save or print page three.&nbsp; How does one do this?

Finding the fax files in order to use IrfanView to open them is a little tricky.&nbsp; You can either use "Save as" to save a copy of the fax in an easily-accessible folder or go to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows NT\MSFax\Inbox&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Note that C:\ProgramData is a hidden folder.&nbsp; Also note that there is no space when you type ProgramData.&nbsp; If you type (or copy/paste) that entire path into the Search box and press Enter, the fax Inbox should open.&nbsp; The folders in the MSFax folder are:<br />

To be a little clearer about what IrfanView can do:&nbsp; it can easily print a selected page from a multi-page tif (which is the format that faxes are saved in); if you select "File &gt; Save as" then you can save the page being viewed as, for example, a jpg image
 file.&nbsp; I don't think you can "save as" more than one but fewer than all of the pages -- but I haven't experimented with that.<br />
<br />
If I wanted to save say 5 pages out of a 50-page fax, I would use IrfanView to "print" the selected pages to

<p>The answer to your question should be in the documentation for your laptop. If you've lost it, go to the support site for your laptop and ask there.</p>
<p>As a generic fix, try this. Click the Start button, then right-click on Computer. Select Properties. Click on Device Manager (upper left) to open the Device Manager dialog. In device Manager, open Imaging Devices. You should see the built-in webcam listed
 there. Right-click on the camera, and select Disable.</p>

<h2>            Cortana white search box</h2>
                    Hello everyone.<br />
I know there have been a lot of questions and topics about it, but my problem is slightly different. So, my Cortana sear box turned white and I followed this tutorial to turn it back to its original dark 'color': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gksPY3zbehU&amp;t=1s<br />
The problem is that now the bar turned 'dark' but there is a 1 pixel line on the top that is still white, what do I do?<br />
Here is a pic of how the box looks right now: https://gyazo.com/a959b905ecf5c47b72caeac5fdf9cbf6<br />
<br />
Thank you and have a great day.

            1. To return Cortana to her natural darker colour, enable the setting "Dark Mode". To enable this, go to Settings, -&gt; Personalisation -&gt; Colours -&gt; (Scroll Down) -&gt; Dark Mode.

<br />2. There is a work-around which you can try - Navigate to Settings&gt;Region and change your region to any country where Cortana isn't supported like North Korea. After closing all the Windows, change it again to where you are.

    <title>Trying to play wmv files in Windows Media Player 12 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fotofundi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to play wmv files in Windows Media Player 12</h2>
                    I have 2 computers - a desktop and a laptop. Both are running Windows 7 Home Premium with service pack 1, and both have Windows Media Player v 12.0.7601.17514 installed. The original version of WMP on the laptop was installed in 2009 and the version installed
 on the desktop was installed in 2012. Both show as being up-to-date via the Microsoft update website.<br />
<br />
Any .wmv files I have will play perfectly in WMP on the laptop, but refuse to play in WMP on the desktop.<br />
If I try to play any .wmv file on the desktop - even if it was originally recorded on this machine, I get an error message.<br />
The message reads "Windows Media Player encountered a problem when trying to play this file" - it then gives me the option to go for help on the web. Selecting this button takes me to a Microsoft page relating to Error Code C00D11B1 which relates to the sound
 device and ID3 headers.<br />
Just in case this was causing a problem I changed my sound output from the external HiFi system to the internal speaker and then to the attached HD TV speaker system - which uses HDMI, but I still get the same message whenever I try to play a .wmv file.<br />
<br />
I have un-installed and re-installed WMP, have updated the codex using the codex update from Microsoft, I have disabled the enhancements on the sound properties, I have created a new User account - both suggestions which have appeared before as possible fixes
 for this problem, I have removed anything other than Windows programmes and drivers that might have any effect on the sound, but to no avail.<br />
I have no problems with playing music through WMP and have recorded programmes from the BBC using their iPlayer format, and can play these and any DVD on the desktop without any trouble - only .wmv format is giving me problems and only on this machine. I do
 need to find an answer to this.<br />
Any help will be appreciated<br />

            <p>1. I do not feel my question about having Katakana/hiragana characters using Win 10 has been answered.&nbsp; I had this feature with Win 7 but, according to Jhessica Sur, it has been removed on Win 10.&nbsp; I do not understand or appreciate the purpose for this removal.&nbsp;
 Will this particular feature be added to the "improved Windows" 10 features in the future, and most important, when?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is there a separate app I can install now so that I have the use of katakana characters using Win 10?</p>
<p>

<h2>            win 10 not accepting license key</h2>
                    Windows 10 oem license key is NOT being accepted by the installation! I am running a perfectly legitimate Win 7 pro, and I've tried install 3 times! What gives? Is MS not smart enough to have the installer read the existing on board key?

            <p>I HAVE been doing EXACTLY that! Oddly, it also reinstalled the update- which I ALREADY had of the "update" that creates the MS "flag" in my toolbar! If this wasn't a legit key, why would it do that? MS has actually given me more reasons to NOT want Win 10!&nbsp;I
 repair PC's for a living, and my advice to customers at this point is to wait, just as my advice to Win 8 users who had numerous issues with it was to allow re-installation of Win 7, or, if "upgrading" from Xp to use 7 and avoid 8,<br />
