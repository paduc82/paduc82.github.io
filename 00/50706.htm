<h2>            Set up OneDrive for File History</h2>
                    <p>Using <em>OneDrive</em> for <em>File History</em> should <strong>NOT</strong> be this difficult!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting up <em>File History</em>, <em>OneDrive</em> appears NOWHERE in backup Drive options!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All <em>File History</em>&nbsp;tutorials imply "<em><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">it's simple ... just select the virtual drive you'd like to use</span></em>" ... Where?&nbsp; How??</p>
<p>
</p><p>And hoop-jumping to set appropriate Sync behaviors?&nbsp; ...&nbsp; God only knows!</p>
<p>
</p><p>About to jump M$ ship and use <strong><em>Google Drive</em></strong> (BTW - offers 3X more free storage!)</p>

<p>Might try opening your c:\users\<strong><em>username</em></strong>\onedrive&nbsp; and making a folder named FileHistory.&nbsp; Right click and select properties &amp; Advanced Sharing and share it to your
<strong><em>username</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Consider right clicking the folder a second time and selecting 'Free up space'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can add the network path to&nbsp; \\computername\filehistory &nbsp; for the save to.</p>

<p>Using OneDrive for File History - or for any other regular backup - is not a good idea, which is probably why you're not finding much help on the subject.&nbsp;File History was designed to work with a local or networked storage destination, i.e., not on the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many PC users' upload speed to the internet is only a small fraction of their download speed. (Verizon FIOS is an exception.) Depending on how you use it, File History can easily suck up most of your upload bandwidth, which would make File History really
 slow and interfere with any other uploading you are trying to perform from your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another disadvantage to using File History with OneDrive: If you lose your internet connection, you've lost your backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But even at its best, File History is no match for a full-out backup program. It wasn't intended to be a full-out backup program. If you want 'the good stuff' in backup software, you want a third-party program.<br />

<p>Thank you for the clear response. It has been frustrating to see so much conflicting information online about both File History and OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I responded to this post mainly out of frustration with the lack of clear information about OneDrive. In another post, I was recently told that OneDrive keeps previous versions of files, like File History is supposed to do.&nbsp; Yet, I could find no useful information
 about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an external backup drive and have been using File History, but File History does not work properly. I was recently told that Microsoft may stop supporting it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive isn't working properly either. The logo in the taskbar that we are supposed to use for settings is sometimes there and sometimes it is not. I have yet to find clear, thorough documentation of how it is supposed to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the rant. I just don't understand why such a huge company consistently fails to make products that work properly and that also fails to document them appropriately for end users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for answering so clearly. I appreciate people like you who are generous with your time and expertise.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>&#34;Could not find this item&#34; Error When Renaming Folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gavin courtney  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Could not find this item&#34; Error When Renaming Folders</h2>
                    I have two Windows 7 x64 machines which were running normally prior to Tuesday's Windows Update patches.<br />
<br />
After the patches I began experiencing problems with both computers, and now when I try to rename or move a folder I get the error:<br />
<br />
<b>Could not find this item<br />
This is no longer located in [Director Path].&nbsp; Verify the item's location and try again.</b><br />
<br />
One PC has six drives in and the other has two drives and I get this error when renaming/moving folders on any of the eight drives.&nbsp; I tried connecting a few different external drives and renaming/moving folders on them, but I get the same error.&nbsp; It therefore
 seems to be a system wide problem rather than corruption of the drives.<br />
<br />
It seems this bug has been around for many years, and the patches on Tuesday appear to have triggered it in both my PCs.&nbsp; I've seen a lot of solutions suggested online but nothing that has worked for me.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know how to solve this problem?

<h2>            MSVCP140D.dll is missing from your computer.</h2>
                    <p>Hey, I have been searching the internet for this file and when i google search it there come websites and titles saying virus malware blabla.<br />
<br />
The Story behind this missing .dll file:<br />
I Was away from my pc for a while and when i got back my SSD Drive(My main drive) failed and i got a new one(Different type) and the guys at the company that sold me it and repaired my pc put windows 8.1 back on it (64Bit). And i Downloaded all the programs
 i needed and this one program said "The program can't start because MSVCP140D.dll is missing from your computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering is that dll file a virus or is it safe and can you guys provide me a download link if it isn't. I really would like to get it working like it did before my main SSD drive failed.</p>

<p>1)PC &nbsp;reset. I don't want to lose progress on games I have if the problem can be resolved by other means. I also a 400GB of games on Steam I don't want to have to re-download. I see it as a last resort. Not to mention re-installing all my programs</p>
<p>2)Command prompt. I don't know what to do with it.</p>
<p>3)Using recovery disk. I don't have one and don't know where to get one from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried system restore but it came up with a "Windows was unable to restore"</p>
<p>I tried start-up repair, that failed as well.</p>

<p>If you're still encountering the issue even if you're booting your computer to safe mode, we suggest you reset your Windows 10 to resolve the issue. When you reset Windows 10, you will have the option to keep your files. Just a reminder, this will delete
 the programs you have on your computer. For more information about the reset function of Windows 10, refer to this

            Hi <strong>Derek</strong>,<br />
<br />
Based on the information that you've provided, you were able to perform a full clean install but the issue still persists. There's a higher chance that this issue is related to a hardware failure. We recommend that you get in touch with your device' manufacturer
 for further assistance.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have any other queries that we can assist you with.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>When you performed your 'clean install' did you <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">format</span></strong> the HDD and
<p>
</p><p>Did you <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">boot from</span></strong> the Windows 10 installation media made from the Media Creation Tool Download page&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; You must boot from the installation media, or this is not a clean installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean installation wipes and formats the HDD to a brand new state. Windows 10 then installs a fresh copy on to your clean HDD.&nbsp; This must be done correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mention all of this to determine if you performed this feat&nbsp; according to the instructions found in the links above...if not you would still retain the same problems as before.</p>
<p>

<p>Wayne</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, when i did the install i used the media creation tool to create a bootable usb drive, and i formatted the partitian of the drive that i did the install on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>unfortunately I figured out that this is a hardware problem (memory on the graphics card failed). I was able to disable the drivers on the graphics card and run off of integrated graphics for now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is there a solution for this problem?</p>
<p>Maybe I can create a bat file that keeps relaunching it every 30 minutes or so?</p>

    <title>Ad Blocker for Edge&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tincanguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ad Blocker for Edge&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When will Microsoft provide an effective Ad Blocker for Edge?&nbsp; I have been using Windows 10 (v.10532) and have found it to&nbsp;be acceptable, but not&nbsp;yet equivalent to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I expect it will eventually be better than 8.1 but until an Ad Blocker is provided,
 I can't use Edge and will continue to use IE11.&nbsp; Not only do the excessive ads irritate me, they really slow down the operation of Edge, so much so&nbsp;that at times it is almost unusable.&nbsp; Fortunately, I have retained a copy&nbsp;Windows 8.1/IE11 on a separate HD
 and can invoke it quickly.&nbsp; I use it as my primary system and will continue to do so until Windows 10/Edge&nbsp;performance is&nbsp;at least equal to Windows 8.1/IE11.&nbsp; Please make that happen ASAP!</p>

    <title>Ram or Power Supply or Software &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deniz yildirim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ram or Power Supply or Software &#63;</h2>
                    I have a ASUS G30AB computer, with an added GTX780 TI and a Cooler Master g750m. The rams are 2x8 Adata. I haven't had a problem with this build since last month. PC started resetting itself randomly while playing games. It doesn't matter if I'm into the
 game for 5 minutes or 2 hours (I didn't usually last longer than 2 hours though). The computer shuts down without any warning or notice just like when power goes down, and then it turns on automatically. I checked the heat, it's not a heating problem. The
 event log says its kernel power 41 task category 63. But this only happens while playing games, not while I'm on the internet or watching a film.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What is this problem about ? Power supply or ram ? or maybe gpu ? I tried resetting the pc to its factory settings and reinstalled all drivers but the problem persisted so I reckon it's not a software problem.<br />
<br />
Any help is must appreciated.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An Event 41 gets logged if the machine doesn't shutdown properly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it overclocked? If so, try reverting to the default setup to see if it helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed from the specs that the graphic cards are all 680 types so installing a 780 may exceed the motherboard's support capabilities:

<p>
</p><p>Do you have the latest BIOS version which is 0602: <a href="https://www.asus.com/ROG-Republic-Of-Gamers/ROG_TYTAN_G30AB/HelpDesk_Download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>No it is not overclocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first bought the PC it had a GTX760 installed in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes the BIOS is fully updated as are chipset drivers. As I said, I recently started having this problem.<br />
</p>
<p>Edit: It seems my BIOS isn't updated, but I don't see why that would be a problem. I also am not sure on how to update it.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I have managed to update my BIOS, but I don't know if it worked.</p>

<p>Best thing to do will be to do whatever you usually do which causes the shutdown and reboot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you reinstall all the Rollups after you reset the system the last time? There's a list of them here:
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/23823.list-of-rollup-updates-for-windows-8-1-and-windows-server-2012-r2.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/23823.list-of-rollup-updates-for-windows-8-1-and-windows-server-2012-r2.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>December 2014 was the last one. Microsoft declared that no more will be released for 8.1 although another one might be released for Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you open each Rollup link, you'll see a list of issues which the respective Rollup fixes.

I appreciate your interest in windows 10. I understand the inconvenience you faced. I will&nbsp;help you with this.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also I would suggest you to check the specification of windows 10 from the below following link:</p>

            <p>Hi, the problem is still to be solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The manufacturer, Dell, as it is an old model did not officially checked the compatibiliy, nevertheless checking item by item with Windows 10 specifications this model is able to accept Windows 10 and if you do a quick research in the Net you will see several
 examples of people that upgraded to Windows 10 in a Dell Latitude D630.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping you could help concerning the error message as it seems it is not really related to the support to NX but perhaps to another issue that I still have to check in my BIOS. Just another clue, since I sent you my first message on my laptop finally
 appear the windows logo related to windows 10 migration, but when I double click on it it doesn't do anything at all. My previous attempts to upgrade were made directly through your site.</p>

<h2>            Printer icons in print dialog boxes</h2>
                    <p>After I upgraded my HP LaserJet printer two icons for the printer now appear in the print dialog boxes-a new one and an old one. Of course, you can‚Äôt print to the old one, but some of my programs default to the old one HP informs me this is a Windows 10
 issue since the printer performs well.</p>
<p>When I check Printing Preferences for the printer, two printers appear in the drop down menu: the old one and the new one. Print Server Property lists only one driver.</p>
<p>How can I remove all instances of the old printer from print dialog boxes?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a pc running windows 10 ver 1709 OS build 17604-1000. I have skype desktop which works fabulously but when i click on skype which is installed from the store, it says the following error :</p>
<p>
</p><p>OOPS, Skype currently unavailable, please try again later</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get no error code, all i see is an exit option. However, i can use the desktop version 7.40 very well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps i have tried so far :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Signed out of desktop version but it doesn't help</p>
<p>2. Tried disabling my Eset Smart Security but no luck either</p>
<p>3. Uninstalled and Re-installed skype from store, no good either.</p>

</p><p>If you still have the 7.40 installed, and it is working for you, I would suggest you to use it instead of the Windows 10 version.

<h2>            Windows 10 excessive CPU usage</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm experiencing excessive CPU usage for the last few weeks. The culprits are svchost.exe and explorer.exe which together chew up generally at least 50%, and as high as 80-90%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed the instructions on&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/windows-performance-recorder/a1648e8c-50c7-4243-9f1d-4216385c7ff3 and run a trace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the right place to post a link to my ETL file for someone to look at?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

Yes, you can post here any information you have to help us figure out the issue. By the way, have you tried performing a

I'm having the same issue.&nbsp; Some DVD's will play and some will not.&nbsp; The interesting thing is that even though the error message says it's a "Region 2" DVD, the label marks it as "Region 4."&nbsp; Has anyone found a solution to this issue?&nbsp; All the forum comments

<p>Hey Brandon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out! The incorrect region error message could be an issue with the app itself. For that, I'd recommend
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/free-up-hard-drive-space" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reinstalling it</a>. As far as the region restrictions as a whole, it is by design and only region-free DVDs and Blu-rays will work on all console. For more information on our region system, head on over to our
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/apps/watch-bluray-dvd-movies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>How to store all my data on D drive partition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> number19  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to store all my data on D drive partition</h2>
                    
<p>I just installed Win 7 Home on a 3 year old laptop with an 80 gig HD.&nbsp; I did a custom install and reformatted the drive.&nbsp; I set up 2 fairly equal sized partitions.&nbsp; Windows installed the OS on the C drive.&nbsp; Since I am starting fresh now with this machine
 I would like to be able to easily back up&nbsp;all my data.&nbsp; Is it possible to point the Libraries file and its folders (which I assume is where windows will store all my data) to the D drive?&nbsp; My intent was to be able to just back up the D drive&nbsp;and not have to
 wonder if I missed anything.</p>
<p>If having the data on a separate partition is not necessary please advise.&nbsp; As I add&nbsp;programs back onto this machine do&nbsp;will I need to&nbsp;point the data to the D drive location or is there a way to make that drive the default for data storage?</p>
<p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>You don't move the Libraries. The libraries do not contain any files, they only show a mirror view of the files that are contained&nbsp;in the folder that you add to a library.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of your personal data folders can be easily moved to the D: drive. See the following tutorial.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Redirect-a-folder-to-a-new-location" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Redirect a<span>folder</span>
 to a new location</span></span></a> </span></p>
<p>Simply create a new folder where you want the data to be moved on the D: drive and then follow the instructions for moving the personal data folder to that location.</p>
<p>After you move the folder to the new location, any programs that store files in that folder will be automatically redirected to the new location.</p>
<p>You can use this procedure to move most of the default folders under your username folder, such as My Documents, My Pictures, My Music, My Videos, and any other folder that displays a Location Tab in the Properties.</p>
<p>Let us know if you have more questions.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update 1511 Wont install. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr. fedora  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update 1511 Wont install.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently noticed that I am not running the correct version of windows so I decided to check for updates. It detected the update 1511 and gave me the option to "Install Now". I clicked this, and it said: "There were problems installing some updates, but
 we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for information, this may help:". I have attempted several fixes, but none have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried: Resetting the Windows Update Components, Using the troubleshooter built into windows, Using the troubleshooter that is downloadable off of the windows website, Using the media creation tool, Going to aka.ms/winup and using the .exe that
 it downloads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using aka.ms/winup or the Media Creation Tool I get the message: "Set-up couldn't start properly. Please reboot your PC and run set-up again", every time even if I restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. Thank You!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Philips GoGear Muse 8GB mp3 player not recognized by Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to a laptop with Windows 8.1 on it. &nbsp;I own a Philips GoGear Muse 8GB mp3 player, which worked fine on Windows 7, but now is not recognized by Win 8. &nbsp;I contacted Philips, and a customer service associate told me (very vaguely) that
 they don't have drivers for their own products, and to contact MicroSoft. &nbsp;What company doesn't provide drivers for their own products?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyhow, I found a community thread where one person was referred to the Microsoft Fix It applet, but lo and behold... it doesn't work with 8.1 either. &nbsp;Hmmmm... &nbsp;Any thoughts on this quandry would be extremely welcome. &nbsp;I am puzzled.</div>
                </div>

            <p><span>Hi Steve,<br />
<br />
What is the exact and complete model number of Philips GoGear Muse?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1: </b>I would suggest you to run hardware and device troubleshooter and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
a) Press ‚ÄúWindows Key + R‚Äù, type Control Panel.<br />
b) Then type ‚ÄúTroubleshooting‚Äù in the Search box and hit enter.<br />
c) Select ‚ÄúHardware and Sound‚Äù from the Troubleshooter Window.<br />
d) Select ‚ÄúHardware‚Äù.<br />
e) Follow the On Screen instructions.</span></p>
<b><span><br />
Method 2: </span></b><span>Microsoft compatibility center does not have any information about the compatibility of Philips GoGear Muse 8GB. I would suggest you to download the drivers for Philips GoGear Muse 8GB from the following link only if you are using<span>&nbsp;
</span>Model number SA2MUS08S/17.<br />
<a href="http://www.usa.philips.com/c-p/SA2MUS08S_17/gogear-muse-8gb/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.usa.philips.com/c-p/SA2MUS08S_17/gogear-muse-8gb/support</a><br />
<br />
If you are still facing any issues in using Philips GoGear Muse 8GB, then you can also try installing the drivers in compatibility mode.<br />
<br />
</span></span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</span></a></span><span><span><br />
<br />
</span></span><span>Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

            <p>Besides Microsoft Engineer's recommendation the add on message is to ask you to download the driver, go to device manager and go to the device that show question mark. open the device to search for driver and use this mehod to search your harddisk for this
 driver files from your harddisk directory. Point the folder to this driver folder and click on it to install. This is another method to try out with regard to other devices installed on Windows 8.1.</p>

            <p>The exact model number is SA3MUS08S/37. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A curious thing, when I plug it into a USB port, Windows pops up a dialog box near the bottom right corner that says "The last USB device you connected to this computer has malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it.".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it doesn't show up as a question mark flagged item in device manager. Is there a way to force Windows to accept drivers made for an earlier version?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>oh, and I used the mp3 player a total of 3 times before switching to Win8, so I am pretty certain the hardware itself isn't malfunctioning.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you guys for your responses. I appreciate the effort!</p>

<p>&nbsp;I checked on my desktop computer for the path and it gives me the target as %windir%\system32\wuapp.exe startmenu</p>
<p>&nbsp;I looked in<span>&nbsp;

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware device compatibility is the responsibility of the hardware manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If HP does not provide drivers for that monitor you can try installing drivers for a previous version of Windows (Windows 7) using the
<strong>Compatibility Mode</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the following website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP 2159m 21.5 inch Diagonal Full HD LCD Monitor Drivers:</p>
<p><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=3884707" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=3884707</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Operating System drop down menu select the <strong>Windows 7 64bit </strong>
or <strong>Windows 7 32bit</strong> and click the <strong>Next</strong> button. This will display the Driver download page.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Download the driver for&nbsp;<strong>Windows 7</strong>&nbsp;and place it on your
<strong>Desktop</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>2.</strong> <strong>Right click</strong> the driver <strong>installation file</strong> and select
<strong>Properties</strong> / <strong>Compatibility</strong> Tab.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Place a <strong>check mark</strong> in the <strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for:</strong> option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>4. </strong>In the <strong>drop down menu</strong>, select <strong>Windows 7</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Click <strong>Apply</strong> / <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>6. </strong><strong>Right click</strong> the <strong>installation file</strong> and select the
<strong>Run As Administrator</strong> option to install the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Regards</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run as suggested, but still cannot get the HP driver to show up in the options for monitor drivers, nor can I get the recommended resolution for the HP2159m monitor of 1920x1080.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only monitor that shows up after installing driver is Geneic Non-PnP Monitor</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running 1600x900 resolution and that seems to be the best resolution I can get. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>All monitors even ancient vga monitors are Plug n Play and do not require drivers. They all will show a picture but not all will have the software and drivers to run the utilities--resolution, hot keys, etc. Since your model is from around 2009, a new monitor
 would be a good investment. You should be able to use the old one as a second screen if your video card supports it. Or just put up with the lower resolution until you can replace the monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that is something else to consider--what model computer and what model video card do you have? That could be the problem if you have an older computer with unsupported video card. Try updating the drivers for the video card.</p>

            <p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am reaching the conclusion that the only solution is a new monitor if I want the absolute best picture/resolution I can get. &nbsp;That is regrettable because the HP2059 monitor is perfectly adequate with excellent resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is a new out of the box HP Pavilion, so I don't think it is a computer problem.</p>

<p>Did you read and understand what you were just told?&nbsp; Or is your conclusion no longer just about compatibility?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way that I could reach the "conclusion" that you just took would be if you are trying to view HD videos that need the HDCP feature that
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01679486&amp;tmp_track_link=ot_faqs/top_issues/en_us/c01679486/loc:2&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=3884707" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
these specifications</a> refer to.&nbsp; Otherwise I can't imagine how you would not be able to make optimum use of this monitor

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"I am running 1600x900 resolution and that seems to be the best resolution I can get. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless&nbsp;that is because of this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>A monitor without HDCP support, or connected by analog VGA, causes the displayed video to be downgraded in quality to a DVD-like resolution that is less than HDTV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;/quote&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with Mary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your observation&nbsp;sounds like a video card or driver issue, not a problem with the monitor.&nbsp; Related questions would be what machine are you attaching this monitor to?&nbsp; Using what connector?&nbsp; E.g. I could also imagine getting reduced
 resolution if you were trying to attach it as a projector to a laptop without also disabling the laptop's monitor.&nbsp; Etc.</p>
