<h2>            Nokia C2-01 Texts</h2>
                    My mobile tells me that I have too many messages and must delete some. &nbsp;How do I delete batches, rather than one at a time?

            Hi, no this looks like you have a single message open. Before you open any one message, rather when you still have the list of messages in the Inbox, choose Options, and you should see 'Mark' at the end of the list! Do you?

            Again, thanks for replying. &nbsp;I wish you were right, but sadly not. &nbsp;I select Menu, Messaging, Inbox, Options, and there is no Mark at the end of the list (which I sent you yesterday). &nbsp;Could I perhaps update the software?

            Hi, if that's the case, I give up. And anyway, like you said, it wouldn't have let you delete batches of texts anyway. But what I would do in this instance is use the computer through Nokia PC Suite where you can select whatever you like and move/delete
 them etc.

    <title>Outlook.com not working with Google Chrome - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jcadig1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com not working with Google Chrome</h2>
                    <p>This problem just started yesterday.&nbsp; I have an older laptop running Windows 7 and a newer Desktop running Windows 8.1 and I have the same issue on both computers., doing the exact same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The problem only occurs when using Chrome to&nbsp;access Outlook.com, Live.com, Hotmail.com regardless of whether from a link or from typing the address in manually.&nbsp; I can access OneDrive/Skydrive but then if I try to&nbsp; access the Outlook.com&nbsp; mail from there,
 it does the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There is no problem on Internet explorer, and there is no problem with anything else on Chrome,&nbsp;I have the latest version of chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It appears that Outlook is trying to open.&nbsp; When I first click on the outlook link, the full e mail page flashes open for a fraction of a second and then the whole page goes white except for the top half of the Outlook title bar.&nbsp; The outlook icon on the
 page tab and the refresh symbol in the address bar flash about half a dozen times indicating it is making a number of attempts to open the page.&nbsp; If I check the running processes in the task manager, it shows multiple processes running for Chrome.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I end task on each of the excess Chrome processes, I can then go back to the browser, click on the link and the full e mail page opens and II can access my e mail with no problem, until I try to open it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like there is some kind of conflicting configuration settings between Outlook and Chrome, but I can't figure out what it would be.</p>

            I had the same problem. I even tried to use IE11 and it did exactly the same thing on Chrome. however IE11 said there was something to do with certificate issues and after I accepted and allowed it, then it worked. But IE11 is SO..... SLOW and I am trying
 to load all my pictures in Onedrive and its like raking... forever! Please fix this issue, Microsoft!

            <p>I am happy to announce that I have resolved this problem on both of my computers. &nbsp;Open the Chrome browser, click on the Options menu (Upper Right Hand corner hat looks like 3 horizontal lines) - then click on "Settings" in the drop down menu. &nbsp;On the "Settings"
 page, scroll all the way to the bottom and click on "Advanced Settings", then scroll all the way to the bottom of that page and click on "Reset Browser settings". &nbsp;You may need to go back to your settings to enable some of your plug ins or browser extensions,
 but I would suggest you only do one at a time and wait to see how it affects your system,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure, but I think my problem may have been caused by some conflict between a browser extension "Norton Safe Search toolbar" and Chrome. &nbsp;I have enabled the extension again and I am waiting to see what happens,&nbsp;</p>

 is a problem that started about 2 weeks ago.</p>

            This is correct. And to be more specific, make sure the Location tab in the Region settings shows United States. I can confirm that date-time formats and input methods (keyboard) are irrelevant. These can be set to anything you like.

<p>It's almost certainly something to do with the display driver on your system that is causing the normal shadow to appears as a distinct band of color. &nbsp; Below, you will see the shadow that surrounds the page on my system.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I also suspect the graphics card may be the culprit. I checked for updates on it and there
<em>was</em> an update available, but installing it did not resolve the issue. Any ideas of troubleshooting steps to try to fix that?</p>

<h2>            ONENOTE in Mac &#34;Please wait&#34; pop up</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There&nbsp;is "please wait" window popping up, I think every time when I edit a note with drawings or shapes. It flashed really quickly and I couldn't catch it up for a screenshot, and it kept popping up, the screen was frozen and I couldn't do any work but had
 to wait for quite a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I normally make notes in OneNote on my iPad, with both of handwriting and texts input. Then I will also check out my notes and edit them on Mac too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, only noticed it happened in Mac. How to solve this problem??? Because of this reason, I have to start looking for another note apps/ software in Mac. It literally stops me using OneNote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, looking forward to hearing from you soon.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I have a Nokia Lumia 920 handset with me. Below are its details.</p>
<p>Software Release - Lumia Denim<br />
OS version - 8.10.14234.375</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was informed by Microsoft that "Phones running on Lumia Denim (OS version 8.10.14219.341, or higher) can upgrade to Windows 10."</p>
<p>It was also informed that to have the update we need to install "Upgrade Advisor" app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed the "Upgrade Advisor"app and found the message "Your phone is not supported for the upgrade to Windows 10" when tried to install windows 10 on my mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please tell me why I am unable to install the update even though my mobile has satisfied all the required conditions(Lumia Denim, OS version greater than 8.10.14219.341) mentioned by Microsoft.</p>
<p>And when windows 10 would be available officially(not through Windows Insider app) for Lumia 920 mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not interested to update my mobile with a preview version through Windows Insider app.</p>

            I doubt that it is from Microsoft if it is an email delete it if it is a pop up reset your phone first try a soft reset by turning your phone on then press and hold the volume down and the power buttons until it vibrates then release them if it is still
 there go to the about setting and tap reset backup your phone first let us know how you get on

    <title>Excel is saving blank rows, causing extremely large files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rita.b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel is saving blank rows, causing extremely large files</h2>
                    My coworker's Excel spreadsheets in one workbook have anywhere from 200 to 1000 rows on each spreadsheet.&nbsp; However, the blank rows for the entire length of the available rows (65500, using 2010 but saving for other versions) are being saved as if they
 have data (maybe a space?) entered in them.&nbsp; The saved file size was 69MB. &nbsp; I went in and deleted the contents of the empty cells (ikr) and resaved, managing to a file size of 8MB.&nbsp; What on earth caused Excel to think there is data in the cells?&nbsp; Why didn't
 it automatically compact the empty cells?<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated!!<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the name box (to the left of the formula bar formula text box) put in something like</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1000:65536&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>hit delete</p>
<p>where 1000 marks the first row you believe is empty.</p>
<p>make 65536 to be the last row you want deleted</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can get this number by do F5 then special and choosing last cell and noting the row.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>reference entering the row range in the namebox</p>
<p>this will select all the designated rows and then you delete them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now save the file.&nbsp; this should cause Excel to revise what it considers to be the last used row.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do this on every sheet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>or you could write a macro to do this - fortunately Debra Dalgleish has already done this:</p>

<br />
I don't know if there are operation limits (i.e. a limit on the number of cells that Find All will show), but the following procedure worked with a small range of cells.<br />
<br />
1. Find all "empty" cells, to wit:&nbsp; press ctrl+F, do not enter anything in the Find What field, then click on Find All.&nbsp; Note that that finds cells with constant null strings as well as truly empty cells (no constant and no formula).&nbsp; It does not find cells
 with formulas that return the null string, as we intend.<br />
<br />
2. Select everything in the Find All results, to wit:&nbsp; press ctrl+A.<br />
<br />
3. Clear Contents, to wit:&nbsp; click on Clear on Home ribbon, then click on Clear Contents.<br />
<br />
Note:&nbsp; At that point, ctrl+End will still go to the end of the "empty" rows.&nbsp; Excel does not adjust that location until we save the file or access ActiveSheet.UsedRange in VBA.<br />

            <p>Hi &amp; welcome too,</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>My understanding is that once the account is closed the email address is placed in a security hold for at least 30 days. &nbsp;<br />
At the end of that time anyone may be able to create a new account or an alias using the same email address.<br />

            No. &nbsp;You misunderstood. &nbsp;I did not close my account with MSN. &nbsp;I removed the account from me apple mail on my iPad because it was not updating. &nbsp;I still have the account can can access it on other devices. &nbsp;I cannot re-set/re-install it back on my apple
 mail on my iPad. &nbsp;I have been in contact with apple and we tried several things and they have determined that it is NOT an apple issue. &nbsp;It is a Microsoft issue. &nbsp;I believe it has something to do with the incoming/outgoing server address and the stupid verification
 process with outlook because one of the many error messages as to to with not being able to verify the account. &nbsp;Please advise. &nbsp;I called Microsoft but the wait time for the phone support was ridiculous...

            <p>I have the same problem. &nbsp;My hotmail account worked perfectly on my ipad and iPhone until last week then it suddenly said my password was wrong or the account couldn't be verified. &nbsp;Like emwsison I deleted it and tried to add again. &nbsp;I also tried on 2 other
 family iPhones and Messages on the Mac - same error messages. Hotmail account works perfectly through Chrome on the Computer. &nbsp;Rest of the family's hotmail accounts are fine on their iPhones so it must be an Outlook problem</p>

            It took some time but the folks at Apple helped me resolve the problem. &nbsp;Not Microsoft. If you are using the 2 step verification to get into your email you need to turn that off. &nbsp;Then you should be able to get your mail on any Apple device. &nbsp;I also am
 more successful using Outlook on my PC using Giogle Chrome. Internet Explorer won't allow me acces to the sign in screen for Outlook. &nbsp;Strange. &nbsp;

<h2>            Excel won&#39;t open spreadsheet from file in Windows Explorer &#40;Office 365&#41; - ALL SOLUTIONS TRIED</h2>
                    <p>Hi - so yes, I click on an excel file and excel opens but the file does not. This is only a problem for excel - word etc work fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the solutions offered to no avail:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- repairing doesn't work - it simply seems to unlicense my software meaning I have to reinstall it all</p>
<p>- uninstalling and reinstalling does not work</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything and am at whitts end. Any new solutions would be appreciated. Please don't tell me to repair or uninstall - these options have been tried numerous times and do not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Matt</p>

    <title>How can I delete a contact&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dialm4speed  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I delete a contact&#63;</h2>
                    Over the years I've somehow added info for the same contact numerous times. I bought an Invoke speaker and now every time I try to call her Cortana asks for Skype or Skype 2. I've linked the accounts and tried both options,&nbsp;but both don't work. I've decided
 to delete all of her contact info and re-enter it but I don't see anyway of doing it.

            They are probably linked. go to https://people.live.com and sign in. This is your Windows Address book. I think this is the best place to find someone and deal with linked information. MS lets you link Skype Contacts and Windows Contacts so they're not
 duplicate. However, you can't delete a linked contact from SKype because Skype can't delete Windows Contacts and Windows Address book can't delete SKype contacts. You unlink them first and then each program can deal with them in house.&nbsp;

<p>Kindly try to check your contact settings. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click your profile.</li><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Scroll down and look for <strong>Contacts settings</strong>.</li><li>Choose the option <strong>Don't use my address book.</strong></li></ol>

<p>I figured out that you can delete skype contacts by using internet explorer. Open outlook and turn on skype and *ding* delete away. As for people.live.com, nope you can't delete anyone. Julie I cannot figure out what contact settings you are talking about.
 I've checked several places but I don't see what your referring to. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;used people.live.com and then opened skype. As you can see under people&gt;Skype contacts&nbsp;(left side)&nbsp;both Sanae and Sunny (same person) are there but on the skype side (right)&nbsp;both are not because I was able to delete them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            You don't need to change the RecordSource property each time.&nbsp; If you change it in the form's properties sheet to fqPurchaseOrdersAll&nbsp; and save the amended design it will return all rows by default.&nbsp; You can then either open the form with an expression
 which filters it to the current orders as the WhereCondition argument when you want it filtered, as Jack suggests, or you can use your fqPurchaseOrdersCurrent query as the FilterName argument:<br />
<br />
DoCmd.OpenForm "frmOrders", FilterName:="fqPurchaseOrdersCurrent "<br />
<br />
when you want to filter it to the current orders.<br />

    <title>intra-company scan-to-email is delayed while outside addresses receive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            intra-company scan-to-email is delayed while outside addresses receive them immediately</h2>
                    <p>From at least two of our multi-function machines, the scan-to-email option has stopped working correctly. We usually scan, then send (from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***') to various addresses, both internal and external. Recently these emails are delayed, typically
 for about an hour, if they are going to internal addresses (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***). The same scan sent to a Gmail account (and once to a Hotmail account) arrives immediately though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Googling has uncovered many examples where the opposite is true, being able to email internally but not outside. I couldn't find another case like this one though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At various times today, the emails have arrived anywhere from instantly to 2 hours delayed to our own email addresses. We have not documented any delays to outside addresses so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also confusing to me are the trace results. Two recent scans, done about 5 minutes apart from the two scanners arrived to Gmail immediately, as I was still collecting the scanned document. In the trace, one shows a delay of 66 minutes, the other no delay.</p>
<p>The same scans, sent to my own company email addresses arrived 45 minutes later (at almost the exact same time), one showing a 115 minute delay and the other showing no delay at all. The pattern through the day has been for bunches of these emails to arrive
 together to the internal addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of this moment, it appears that the trace function is useless, as it provides mostly fictional information. While I'm curious about why this is happening, and knowing might help foster a solution, my primary goal is to get these emails delivered consistently
 in a more timely manner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other possibly relevant facts:</p>
<p>We're running Office 365 online.</p>
<p>We recently changed the SMTP server handling these emails, though it worked fine at first and still does occasionally.</p>
<p>It does not seem to matter which internal address we try to send to or which external address. Generally, the internal emails are delayed and the external emails are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

            <p>I apologize for the delay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything seems to be working correctly now. It seems that our SMTP server, for some reason, was only working intermittently. We have created a new one, on a new VM, which seems to be staying up consistently. If I learn anything else, I'll follow up with
 an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>
