            You probably need the ADMIN logon and password to make changes.&nbsp; Chances are the database was set up so that only the ADMIN can make changes.&nbsp; Hopefully, someone there can provide you with that.

            <p>Access workgroup security is pretty elaborate: for one thing, it can be set up so that different users have different privileges. You may need to log in as one user name in order to view data, a different ID and password to update data, and yet another to
 make design changes. It would seem that you have the right userID for what you're trying to do!</p>
<p>See the Access Security FAQ at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/207793/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/207793/en-us</a>&nbsp;for a (perhaps far too) detailed description; but it might point you to a solution. My guess is that you'll need to contact the original documentation, or developer.</p>

    <title>Update or remove legacy apps. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> _sam_m  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update or remove legacy apps.</h2>
                    I posted this to windows feedback but I thought I would post it here as well. &nbsp;Please combine Wordpad and Notepad into a modern text editor.&nbsp; Or just remove them completely.&nbsp; They don't seem to have changed since windows xp or 98.&nbsp; They don't have a lot
 of functionality compared to something like notepad++.&nbsp; Also they are not visually coherent with the new metro style.&nbsp; If you are going to all the trouble of building a new ui, why do you still have legacy apps?&nbsp; Shouldn't they all be on one design platform
 ideally?&nbsp; This isn't just Wordpad and Notepad some apps are new (i.e. finance, sports, reader, etc.)&nbsp;while some haven't been updated since the stone age.&nbsp; Seems like you guys need to blow the dust off some of them or get rid of them.&nbsp;

            <p>Not including a modern text / code editor with the OS only helps technical people despise it even more. &nbsp;Shipping any modern OS without modern tools is just plain lazy. &nbsp;Every box that I sit at should have a minimum set of tools - why settle for a hand saw
 when power saws are easily available (and if the answer is "install it" start listing the steps involved to load X program when the system is not internet accessible).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Modern Text Editor - Something like Notepad++ or TextMate (OSX)</p>
<p>2. Remote Desktop Manager (M$ even owns this tool: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21101)</p>
<p>3. SSH client in CMD or Powershell - is having to install Putty and click around that fun for everyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>--- These are just dreaming at this point</p>
<p>4. VIM in CMD and Powershell</p>
<p>5. SSH server ships in OS, user can enable if necessary</p>
<p>6. Some other widely adopted scripting language (Python, Perl, Ruby). I'd take just about anything at this point. I think it is easier to write a C# program and compile it in VS than it is to try to write a simple script in Powershell.</p>
<p>7. Command line package / update manager (that is easily accessed, via point #5. Ever try setting up powershell for remote usage?)</p>
<p>8. A linux shell might be nice, maybe ship cgywin? :)</p>
<p>9. Better debugging tools -&nbsp;sysinternals features should be included - and accessible from both GUI and command line!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. tcpdump</p>
<p>11. curl and wget</p>
<p>12. Something similar to Postman (plugin for Chrome), to test out web calls.</p>
<p>11. Fiddler! :) :)</p>
<p>(some of these items wouldn't need to be default, you could make it similar to what was done with telnet - "add windows features")</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really would love to use Windows again, I feel more organized and focused when using it. &nbsp;There are plenty of apps that I would love to run without having to use RDC or Parallels. If you would just include an updated feature set that was usable - "power
 users" wouldn't have to put up with OSX.</p>

            <p>I support the idea to remove legacy apps. But it is not enough.</p>
<p>There is now a chance to make a more principal choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All 32 bit stuff can be removed in a new Windows 10 <strong>x64.</strong></p>
<p>So no folders like Program Files (x86).</p>
<p>Such a principle choice is good for security and performance of a new system.</p>

            <p>You probably need to change the shortcut that you are using to launch Excel.&nbsp; Try this:</p>
<p>Right-click on the Excel shortcut that you normally use to start Excel (could be on the desktop or in the start menu).&nbsp; Click Properties, then in the Shortcut tab, set Run: to Maximized.</p>
<p>I am not aware of any settings within Excel itself that would control whether it starts&nbsp;in a&nbsp;"Normal" or "Maximized" window.</p>
<p>Hope that helps,</p>

            <p>OK, so you're opening files by double clicking in windows explorer (you said "when I open Excel", hence my misinterpretation).&nbsp; I have a feeling this is an office 2010 bug, but just to check, try opening a file.&nbsp; Now close the file so you have an "empty"
 Excel.&nbsp; Maximize Excel.&nbsp; Close Excel.</p>
<p>Any joy?&nbsp; If not, I'm out of ideas.&nbsp; Maybe there's a registry key you can tweak.&nbsp; A quick google threw up this (on this site!)...</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-customize/excel-wont-open-maximized/10193c40-f106-4e0d-a304-cd1caf740baa?page=1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-customize/excel-wont-open-maximized/10193c40-f106-4e0d-a304-cd1caf740baa?page=1</a></p>
<p>Read through it all.&nbsp; There is something you can try with the registry, and&nbsp;some other work arounds, but it does appear to be a bug.&nbsp; Frustrating... I know.</p>

<p>Hi Ma Lau,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response, but it appears to be working now. &nbsp;The dialog to select the OneNote page location came up twice, then the next couple of links defaulted to the old location without the dialog, but has been working as it should since then. &nbsp;I
 will let you know if it happens again</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to successfully download the Nokia Map Uploader (for PC) from the Nokia website but when I execute the program, it does not load. &nbsp;It always says "<strong>Maploader20 has encountered a problem and needs to close. &nbsp;We are sorry for the inconvenience."
<span>&nbsp;I have downloaded and reinstalled the software several times already but this always shows up</span>. &nbsp;<i>😠</i></strong></p>

            You did not state the operating system you are running on your pc. If it is Windows 7, I don't think Nokia Map Loader V2 is compatible with it. You may have to wait for the next version.

<p>I am also having problems loading maps.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I start the Map Loader, it says</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You have connected at least one phone without a valid maps drive.&nbsp; Either you are using an old Maps version or you have never started your Maps application"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Nokia 2700 Classic with Maps 3 installed. I have started Maps several times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can then download a map, which it "saves to storage medium".&nbsp; However when I start Maps on the phone all I can see is a blank pale green screen. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this problem might be if You have not downloaded a licence or not activated it. Nokia tries to protect their maps that there would be no unauthorised downloads. If You bought your phone from the shop, everything should be alright and You should just activate
 your "Drive" licence which helps You to navigate and calculates the routes from your place to destination point. To check if Your licence is updated, open Maps Ovi and go "Options -&gt; Shop and liences -&gt; My licences". If you can see just "Update" option, then
 Your licence is not activated and you have to press "Updated" to let your phone to connect to Nokia Server using GPRS ow WAP conection depending on what your mobile network company offers. After doing this in the screen mentioned above there should appear
 something like "Drive Europe. Valid until 2010.03.18". Sure, the continent and the date will differ :) If You succeed in doing this succesfuly, please try to relauch your Maps Loader once again and see what message it brings. I guess, You should be alright.
 By the way, what is operation system You use on your PC?</p>

<p>Hey, Buddy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it looks like that here you get operation system conflict with Maps Loader software. It might be that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Your operational system is not suitable for Maps Loader v. 2.0 (e.g. Windows 95, Linux or others. I can verify that it works fine with Windows XP Home Edition&nbsp;Service pack 2)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Your operational system is used too long and is full of **bleep** and needs to reinstalled or updated with proper Windows&nbsp;updates, which could possibile fix Your problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is more, call to one of your friends and try to install Maps Loader on his/her computer. I guess You should be alright ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tell us, if You succeed in doing something of here advised.</p>

            <p>Hi Charles,</p>
<p>Nokia 225 is a Series 30+ phone with limited Bluetooth capabilities:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en/mobile/phone/225/specifications/#head_connectivity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en/mobile/phone/225/specifications/#head_connectivity</a>
</p>
<p>The phone is missing several Bluetooth protocols required for car infotainment systems and other Bluetooth devices.<br />
It cannot even work with a Bluetooth headset, sadly.</p>

<h2>            Access to SharePoint Site - External Users</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently responsible for a SharePoint site and am constantly in need to share the site/separate folders with external users (outside of my organisation and my office 365). Once I've pointed to them that they need to create a Microsoft account (which
 they do), once they try to access the SharePoint site/folders, they receive a message that they newly created account is not recognised. Hence they cannot login and cannot view the site/folders I' ve shared with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is an adequate solution/workaround/explanation for this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been a recurring problem and I'm very keen to get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            <p>Hi Zhana,<br />
<br />
In this situation, you can consider removing the external user first, then re-share to check the outcome.<br />
1. Navigate to <strong>Office 365 admin center &gt; Active Users</strong>, find the problematic account and remove it.<br />
2. Delete the external users from all site collections:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a. As a global administrator, go to the site collections in which the external user is invited.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Open a new tab in the browser, and enter <strong>&lt;site collection URL&gt;/_layouts/15/people.aspx?MembershipGroupId=0.</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; c. In the "People and Groups : All People" page, delete the target external user from these site collections.<br />
<br />
3. Use SharePoint PowerShell to check whether you can get that external user. If so, delete that user. Here are the steps to use SharePoint PowerShell:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Download the PowerShell and connect it according to this article: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161372(v=office.15).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161372(v=office.15).aspx </a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Get all external users by running <strong>Get-SPOExternalUser -Pagesize 20</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Delete that unique external user by running <strong>Remove-SPOExternalUser -UniqueIDs &lt;UniqueIds&gt;</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Wait for a while, and then run <strong>Get-SPOExternalUser -Pagesize 20 </strong>
to see if the external user has been removed completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Open your browser and go to<strong> SharePoint admin center &gt; user profiles &gt; Mange User Profiles</strong>. If you can find their accounts, please remove them.<br />
<br />
If this issue persists, please help us clarify the following information:<br />
1. Capture a screenshot of the error message for our investigation.<br />
2. Go to the site or folder, then check the permission of this external user and let us know the results. To check permission, you can go to
<strong>site settings-&gt;under Users and Permissions-&gt;Site permissions-&gt;Check Permissions.</strong><br />
3. Does this issue occur to all the external users?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Kerwin<br />

 columns between remain unsorted.&nbsp; I have copied the data into a new file and tried to sort without success, and tried importing the data from a .csv file without success.&nbsp; I have also copied the data into an Excel 2010 file that previously sorted the columns
 but the sort no longer functions as soon as I input new data.&nbsp; As I mentioned in my post above, the fixes others have used successfully do not work.</p>

    <title>laser printer template for business check in ms excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bfreeze  say:</h3>
<h2>            laser printer template for business check in ms excel</h2>
                    Hi, Does anyone know where I can find or how to design a MS Excel template to use in printing my business checks through a laser printer, similar to printing a business size envelope through the manual feed slot of a laser printer? My business checks are
 sized 3" high x 8.25" wide and have the date, payee, written dollar amount, numerical dollar amount, and memo fields to fill in. Also, does anyone know how to convert a numerical dollar amount in an Excel field to a written amount as one would normally see
 written out on a check? I searched the internet and surprisingly have not found this. With all of the small business people in this country and the world, I can't believe this hasn't been asked for before. Thanks! Bfreeze

            I don't know what you tried or how you searched. I googled "Excel amount in words" and got 22 million hits. the first one seems to be exactly what you want.<br />
<br />
Next, making a template is not that hard at all, no matter what Phil says. It is just a bit tedious. Start by putting some data in cells that will look like a check. print it. Then adjust row heights, column widths and try printing again. Repeat until you get
 it right.<br />

            The currency symbol textbox in regional settings is editable. Tap to select the default currency symbol and tap backspace on the soft keyboard. On the soft keyboard, tap áü and tap £. It will appear in the currency symbol textbox. then press enter. Close
 Regional settings. The £ will now be available in the currency list. For example, if you want to format cells in Excel mobile to use the £ currency.

<p>Unfortunately for your needs, PPT the content you add to placeholders on a given slide atop everything that comes from the slide master or layout.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could include a sample slide in the template and instruct users to copy the slide then edit it rather than insert new slides.&nbsp; On the sample slide, you'd put the shape atop the placeholder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shapes atop placeholders *on slides* retain the stacking order you'd expect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Far less than the ideal solution, but short of providing an add-in to do the heavy lifting, it's the best way I know.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t activate Office 365 Education with my University Email</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft account with my school email (.edu) and it says I have a license for Office 365. But when I try to download the desktop apps, I face a notification that says I don't have a license. When I checked with my university IT unit, they said
 that all I needed to do is connect to microsoft account with the university wifi (eduroam). That didn't work either. It's really frustrating since I really need the Office apps for my thesis. Could you please help regarding to solve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            office 2016 activation key loses after windows updates windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Getting a few Surface Pro ready to be deployed. After installing office 2016, then I input a valid activation key.<br />
Open and close Word and Excel with no popup window to activate office.<br />
Windows updates run and when I try to open Word, Excel, and Outlook I get the activate apps.<br />
I can't work around this. I've uninstalled and reinstall office 2016, I've tried to reset the Surface Pro 4 and the activation comes up again and again.<br />
Any help to resolve this will be appreciated.</p>
