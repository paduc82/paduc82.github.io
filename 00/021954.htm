            Hello Ghassan,<br />
<br />
<br />
Issues with typing letters within the OneNote app for Android can sometimes be fixed by clearing its cache and data. To do that, head to settings, locate OneNote, and there should be an option to clear the cache and data in Storage. If the issue persists, you
 may need to delete and reinstall the OneNote app.<br />
<br />
If you require further assistance, feel free to reach out.

<p>Hi Jan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Corruption with your current Outlook profile may have caused the error messages to show when trying to open Outlook. To narrow down the issue and provide effective troubleshooting steps, we'd like to ask a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you have previous installation of other Office versions on the computer?</li><li>Are you also having issues with opening other Office programs? </li><li>Do you already have an Outlook profile? If not, we suggest that you <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-an-Outlook-profile-F544C1BA-3352-4B3B-BE0B-8D42A540459D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>create a new Outlook profile</strong></a>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you can <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">run an Office repair</a></strong> which may resolve the current issue. Office
 repair detects and replaces corrupted files which may be causing the error messages to pop up each time you attempt to open Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            I was desperate so I uninstalled my new Office Suite and installed my old Outlook 2010.&nbsp; I&nbsp; couldn't open that either, but for a different reason - Outlook wouldn't accept my password.&nbsp; So I&nbsp; downloaded a PST password breaker from www.outlookpassword.****.com.&nbsp;
 It displayed a password I did not recognize at all, and it broke thru it!&nbsp; My Outlook opened, to my great relief. To answer your questions, this is a brand new machine, it just arrived today, so there were no previous Office installations.&nbsp; I also had Word
 and Excel in the Office Suite I installed this morning and they seemed to be working well - no issues.&nbsp; I have a hunch that my old laptop, which was dying for the past week, may have corrupted my PST file so when I copied it to my new machine today, it was
 already broken.&nbsp;

            To clarify, I didn't see your reply suggesting I create a new Profile or do an Office Repair, until&nbsp; after I uninstalled Office Suite 2016 and installed my old Outlook 2010.&nbsp; That is working very well after I broke thru the password so I could open my
 Pst file.&nbsp; So maybe it had gotten corrupted. Here's where I am now - I'd like to use the new&nbsp; Outlook 2016 and Word and Excel which I've paid for.&nbsp; But I'm afraid to re-install the Office Suite 2016 on my new laptop - what if it still doesn't work?&nbsp; I don't
 want to mess up Outlook now that it's working.&nbsp; I can live with Outlook 2010.&nbsp; So I'd like to install the Office Suite 2016 on a different computer to see if it works, and if it does, then I'd install&nbsp; it on my new laptop.&nbsp; Will my license allow me&nbsp; to install
 it on 2 machines?&nbsp; thanks for your help.

<p>Thank you for the information and it's good to know that the error messages that you were getting in Outlook is no longer popping up. Regarding your concern in installing Office on another machine, as long as your computer meets the system requirements,
 you can install it. However, you will need to deactivate your licenses on the current machine and activate it on the new computer as it will only allow one computer at a time. You just have to manage your activation as we've just mentioned and you can do that
 by logging in to your Microsoft account. You can refer to this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Download-and-install-or-reinstall-Office-365-or-Office-2016-on-a-PC-or-Mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#InstallSteps=Quick_install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>The only passwords used in MS Outlook are those for a mail account or if you used a pop mail account and you had set a pst password.</p>
<p>The error msg you initially gave refers to an exchange/domain mail account, and if this was a new laptop, it means that whatever process you used to setup MS Outlook 2016 was completely incorrect.</p>
<p>Uninstall 2010 then install 2016, outlook 2016 will use the original outlook profile and all its settings, Outlook will be as it was before, and contain all your data.</p>

<p>I ended up resolving the problem by a chat with a helpful person at Microsoft.&nbsp; It turns out that years ago I'd activated an earlier installation of Outlook (on a previous computer) using a different email address.&nbsp; So when I tried to activate Office, the
 system found this old email address attached to my name (unbeknownst to me) - but I was trying to activate Office using my current email address.&nbsp; The employee I chatted with researched&nbsp;this and found that the license key for Office 2016, which I'd just bought,
 was linked, by my name, to an earlier email address I'd forgotten that I'd used when I installed Outlook years ago.</p>

            If you have an x64 processor and Windows 7 SP1, you'll get the 64-bit version automatically (the 32-bit version will be included and manages some processes as a subsystem, unless you enable "Enhanced protected mode" which disables all backwards compatibility
 to 32-bit controls, plug-ins, etc.).

            Are your documents being saved in Word's native .docx format? Saving them in the old Word 97-2004 format renders SmartArt non-editable, until you Save As into .docx. And if a document is in .doc format, you cannot insert SmartArt at all.

                    I tried to remove Quick Access from Windows Explorer the usual way, but it doesn't work. Are you guys (Microsoft) fix one problem and create another? When exactly are we going to see a product that really works?

            You should be fine as your phone is a tri-band<br />

Is your phone unlocked? This is cos when you want to use a South African sim card.<br />
<br />
If you have roaming with your network provider then there shouldnt be a problem.

</p><p>That is possible. You just have to initiate a video call then add the 3rd participant to link the video call.</p>

</p><p>Which Skype version are you using? Please indicate the <strong>version number </strong>
so I can provide specific instructions on how to do it.</p>

<h3> bruceulanet  say:</h3>
<h2>            How Do I Cancel Skype&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I got Skype several months ago as a free trial. I never used it and never will. I don't need or want it. Yet I am charged $6.99 each and every month. I have tried numbers of times to cancel it to no avail. Must I continue to be charged in perpetuity? I would
 love to cancel it so that doesn't happen. I alsso would like my money back, but I'm sure there is some goofy policy which will forbid it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, cancel my Skye account.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />At the bottom, click 'Payment Methods'
<br />
<br />From there, click 'Auto Recharge' can you cancel that from there?
<br />
<br />Then click 'Payment Details' can you cancel your method of payment form there?

            It didn't help. I followed the link but I couldn't do a think. I've even tried Microsoft customer chat but it keeps disconnecting me. On my account page it does not show an account, hence there is nothing to cancel.&nbsp;

<p>OK so you could Open a Administrator Command Prompt or Administrator Powershell and type&nbsp; &nbsp; sfc /scannow to see if anything gets fixed.</p>
<p>Remember the space between the sfc&nbsp; and the /scannow part and it takes a while to complete.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I bought a windows phone for my son and had set up recovery protection. He accidentally reset the phone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately neither my son or I can remember the recovery key and have no idea how to open his phone.

<p>Any suggestions on how to unlock the phone so that he can start using it again.</p>
<p>The screen on the phone says disable the phone using the recovery key, but I don't know how.</p>

<h2>            Right-click BPMN menu in Visio is missing events and activities</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a number of BPMN workflows in Ms-Visio (2013). But ever since our network was upgraded (resulting in updated access privileges to folders and files) I can't seem to get those Visio files to work correctly. In the illustration below the floating
 menu doesn't display the BPMN specific options (loop, task type, activity type etc) as shown at the bottom of this text.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've compared my Visio files to other still working files by checking every configuration setting in the Options menu.
</p>
<p>I've checked the location of the stencils.</p>
<p>I've copied objects from working files to my faulty Visio files, but they suffered from the same problem.
</p>
<p>I've searched for days on the Internet but to no avail. </p>
<p>I've asked my helpdesk for a solution but they just don't have clue how to go about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>Hi Surrogate/MVP</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what you mean exactly, but I have re-installed Visio 2013 Professional on my computer. I can now create new BPMN workflows that work correctly. However, the old workflows still do not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I relocate the 'broken' Visio files to my local hard drive, they don't work either</p>
<p>
</p><p>So all of this leads me to think that although the network upgrade may be the cause of the problem, the solution lies within the file itself. The number of developed workflows is so great that recreating them would take weeks to complete. That's
 not an option to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you (or anyone else) have other suggestions, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
        </p>

<p>I agree with Paul ! Usually Actions section looks like as</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dba64e66-a74b-4f8f-b7a0-3b633b602bd9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dba64e66-a74b-4f8f-b7a0-3b633b602bd9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Please check this section, if in columns Invisible you find True or 1. This option is hidden.</p>
<p>If you can't find Actions section then your documents corrupted ! </p>

<p>
</p><p>I've checked the Shapesheet of file for the Actions section, but it seems to be missing. It usually is positioned between the Connection Points and Controls sections. I've sent you the diagram. Although the files seem to be corrupted, I'm still rooting for
 a generic solution applicable to the rest of the diagrams.</p>

</p><p>Hi Surrogate,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think that someone has hid the section either purposely or unpurposely. Doing that to all of the shapes in all of the diagrams would be very tedious.&nbsp; The pop-up form below clearly shows that the Action section is not available instead of just hidden.
 I can however insert a new action row though, but that would mean I would have to manually insert a set of specific actions for each shape object in all of my diagrams. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Hi Danijai, I've had a look at the diagram that you sent me. In all the shapes the Actions section is missing. I then opened the Document Stencil and the Actions section is missing from all shapes ther asl well. So, the only conclusion is that someone has
 purposely removed the Actions section from all these shapes!</p>
<p>There is a cure, I have a utility that will help with this:</p>
<p>http://www.paulherber.co.uk/visio-utilities3/</p>
<p>This gives you a new SuperUtils menu on the ribbon</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open your diagram and then open the document stencil (More Shapes -&gt; Show Document Stencil) - call this document 1.</p>
<p>Now open a new BPMN diagram - call this document 2.</p>
<p>For each shape in the document 1 document stencil</p>
<p>&nbsp; in document 2 - drop that shape from the stencil onto the page</p>
<p>&nbsp; ensure that shape is selected</p>
<p>&nbsp; ribbon SuperUtils -&gt; Shape(s) -&gt; Copy -&gt; Actions</p>
<p>&nbsp; Goto document 1</p>
<p>&nbsp; in the document stencil, double-click that shape type and the shape editor will open</p>
<p>&nbsp; select the opened shape</p>
<p>&nbsp; ribbon SuperUtils -&gt; Shape(s) -&gt; Paste -&gt; Actions</p>
<p>&nbsp; Close the shape editor, it will ask you if you want to update all instances of the shape, select Yes</p>
<p>&nbsp; goto document 2 - delete the shape</p>
<p>repeat</p>
<p>
</p><p>This whole process should take no more than a few minutes per document.</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for looking at my diagrams. Right now my IT dept is looking into a linkfixer tool which they have used to analyze and migrate files. Something indeed caused the deletion of the actions sections, but I'm quite sure that's has not been done manually
 and certainly not purposely. I haven't tried your solution yet, but I'll let you know when I have. Thanks again for all of the effort.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I will assist you with the issue you are facing with the Word and Excel 97.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to access the program from the default location and check if it opens fine:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hold </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows key + R</span> </li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>In Run window type or copy and paste the following command</span><span style="font-weight: bold"> %programfiles%
</span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Go to Microsoft Office, and look for Excel.exe and Winword.exe</span> </li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>If you find </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Excel</span><span> try to open the program and check if you are able to access it.</span>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are able to open, then you may delete the short cut for the program from the start menu and then create shortcuts for the Excel applications on the desktop,<font><span>&nbsp;
</span>right click on Excel icon, click on <span style="font-weight: bold">Send</span>
<p><font><span>(</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span><span>: You may follow the same steps to create short cut for other Office applications)</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font>You may also try repairing the Office 97 installation and check if it helps:</font></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><font>Go to control panel, Add or remove programs, look for Office 97 and click change.</font></span></li><li><span><font>Follow the onscreen instructions to proceed with the repair process.</font></span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font>Since Office 97 is a obsolete<span>&nbsp; </span>program you may consider switching to the latest version of Office and enjoy the advanced features in it.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above steps helps. If you need further assistance on this particular issue or any other Office related issues let us know and we will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Tech Preview and Windows Server Essentials 2012 R2 Client Connector</h2>
                    <p>I have WSE2012R2 as a home server and upgraded one of our machines (the least complex one) to Windows 10 TP. It warned about losing Media Centre features (which is OK as we only used that for DVD playing and have Roxio on it anyway) but NOT warned about
 losing WSE2012R2 connectivity and backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to reinstall the connector, but as it is an "upgrade" and not an app, I have not found any way to get it to reinstall on the Windows 10 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two questions: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. has anyone found a way to get this reinstalled before there is a version of the connector available for those of us with WHS/WSE</p>
<p>2. will the WSE team be providing a "test" version of the connector</p>
<p>
</p><p>And a request:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please make it clear when installing the upgrade that this feature will be unavailable after the upgrade</p>
<p>

            <p>I had this problem too, I went to my local WSE2012R2 server to install the connector (http://server-name/connect). &nbsp;It downloaded but when I run I get:</p>
<p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">An unexpected error has occurred. &nbsp;To resolve this issue contact the person responsible for your network.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>That's it, no error codes, no hints, no connector. &nbsp;Just fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? &nbsp;Why did Win 10 break this so hard?</p>

            <p>I think the reason it "breaks" so hard is that, as an Windows Update style install rather than a Setup install, it fails the version test and does not know how to handle it gracefully and no way to use compatibility mode&nbsp;to see if it works anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on MS , please get something out in the coming months&nbsp;to allow WSE2012R2 to support Windows 10 Preview machines - at least so that this can be tested.</p>

            <p>I read a lot of Microsoft forum posts and it is very typical for the paid Microsoft Support Engineer that is monitoring the forum to deflect the question at hand and suggest that the original submittal was wrongly asked (by being placed on the incorrect
 forum).&nbsp; I wish the company would get the developers who understand their products to monitor the forums rather than people paid just to monitor and who don't know the product details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the question might be better asked in another forum, perhaps the Microsoft staff should call up the subject matter expert on this better forum and ask for an informed response to the original question.&nbsp; It is off putting to have the question deflected
 and no response provided.&nbsp; There is something wrong with your software and real users who actually are paying customers or in this case early adopters that will be the foundation for the success of W10 when released are asking for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respect the time we are putting into beta testing your products to provide a thoughtful and informed response.&nbsp; Don't deflect, do some research, contact the appropriate experts and when you have fact based solutions provide those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my humble opinion anyway.</p>

            <p>I totally agree with your comment.&nbsp; Microsoft Forums are a mess.&nbsp; I have not been able to find a comprehensive list of fora and what they cover.&nbsp; How is the user supposed to figure out to which forum to post a question?&nbsp; Maybe there should be a facility
 to post a question to the general forum area and get back a recommendation on which forum should be the target.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must say Microsoft support is abysmal unless you are willing to pay exorbitant fees to get it.&nbsp; I have been trying to find a solution that works to get Windows 7 client restore files with Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials.&nbsp; I have not been able to find
 anything specifically addressing a solution to this problem.</p>

    <title>LifeChat LX-3000 on Build 15016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jujuki  say:</h3>
<h2>            LifeChat LX-3000 on Build 15016</h2>
                    <p>As of early this&nbsp;year 2017, I have noticed that the Microsoft Lifechat LX-300 microphone headset is not working any more.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I plug the headset in, it seems to install the driver&nbsp;but I&nbsp;get no sound.&nbsp;I notice that the audio service&nbsp;shuts down. If I&nbsp;right click on the speaker button in the tray and show playback devices, it says&nbsp;- " Do you want to start&nbsp;the audio service" To
 which I say yes. Then the playback devices shows&nbsp;up and hangsin about 10 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried&nbsp;uninstalling the drivers and manually installing&nbsp;the drivers from the LX-3000 product site as recommended by https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/microsoft-lifechat-lx-3000-and-windows-10/1d4c625e-7969-4f33-a65c-a4491c4653dd,
 but that does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get repeated entries in the eventLog that the Windows Spectrum Service has crashed. (Audio service?) EventId-7031</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have the same problem with Denim with my Lumia 630DS and my wife's 640XL.</p>
<p>The difference is i can revert to Cyan, But there is no way for the 640XL.</p>
<p>There is no sim connectivity issue with 630DS in Cyan firmware, but the WiFi status is "no internet" most of the time.</p>

<h2>            Outlook scheduled folder</h2>
                    The scheduled folder in outlook keeps reverting back to an old folder name used for it in the past. It just cannot be renamed. Ive tried removing and reinstalling the app.

<p><span>Both Outlook android app for mobile and Outlook Web. Problem in both.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you receive any kind of error message?</li></ul>
<p>No error message. You have disabled folder renaming on the mobilecapp. On Outlook Web if I rename the scheduled folder it keeps reverting to an old name previously assignef to it.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If you are using an Office Outlook, is your account setup for IMAP or POP settings?&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>IMAP</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were you able to change the name before without this issue?</li></ul>
<p>Yes, on older version of your android app you still had this feature</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?I tried removing and reinstalling the app and even reinstalling older versions but these no longer install as microsot disabled them</li></ul>

    <title>Using Outlook to view emails downloaded from another Outlook account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> destryrides  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Outlook to view emails downloaded from another Outlook account</h2>
                    When I recently retired, my&nbsp;agency allowed me to download to a flash drive about 100 personal emails that I had saved during the years I worked there.&nbsp; That agency used Outlook as its email program.&nbsp; And on my home computer, I also have the Outlook program
 (part of the Office 365 Pro Plus suite).&nbsp; So I was hoping I could simply download the 100 emails and read them in my Outlook program on my home computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I&nbsp;inserted the flash drive, and when I double-clicked the Outlook data file on the flash drive, I
 got this message:&nbsp; "Outlook data files must be opened from within Outlook."&nbsp; OK, fine, I thought -- I'll just copy the data file from the flash drive and open it in my home computer's Outlook program.&nbsp; But when I open up Outlook, I simply get a welcome screen
 saying "Welcome to Outlook.&nbsp; Enter an email address to add to your account."&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;I don't have an "account" in Outlook, as&nbsp;at home I used&nbsp;Gmail for my

<br />(Based on advice I got on a prior post, I attempted to make a 'no mail' profile by right-clicking on the start menu, choosing Run, then typing "Outlook.exe /PIM Outlook," and then pressing "enter."  That didn't work.)
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Could elaborate on "That didn't work"? What exactly happens.
<br />
<br />This would have been the first piece I would have given. Once a "no email account Outlook profile" is created, you would need to add the PST file to Outlook via
<br />From within Outlook --&gt; File --&gt; Open &amp; Export --&gt; Open Outlook Data File

<p>Wow--this is a complicated set of processes to address the seemingly simple problem of opening Outlook without an already established email account!&nbsp; Especially for an amateur like me!!&nbsp; I began following the instructions in the four-page article you linked,
 and didn't get past step 1 in method 1.&nbsp; I'm not sure what it means to "Export the key to a REG file first," but in any case I continued with this method until I got to&nbsp;the instruction that says "Right-click on an unwanted entry in the right pane, and choose
 Delete."&nbsp; Well, in the right pane&nbsp;appear four entries:&nbsp; Default, HP Officejet, iCloud Services, and OneDrive.&nbsp; Obviously, none of these have anything to do with Outlook, so I just quit at that point.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If possible, it'd be helpful to have a dumbed-down version of these instructions.&nbsp; I don't even understand what you say in your brief cover note:&nbsp; "Try the process again using the command line options..."&nbsp; What is a "command line option"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or maybe it'd be better if I could set up a dummy email account in Outlook so that I can perform the seemingly simple task I'm trying to accomplish:&nbsp; read emails&nbsp;that were originally generated in Outlook and that can only be opened in Outlook (right?).&nbsp;
 Would that be a better approach?</p>

<br />Wow--this is a complicated set of processes to address the seemingly simple problem of opening Outlook without an already established email account!  
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />First, my apologies. Just noticed that the article link I included in the previous reply was related to another post I was responding to. The article that should have been included was
<br />
<br />Use Outlook 2016 without an email account
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-outlook-2016-without-an-email-account-477a1fc3-4423-4156-bef4-67489edfdbef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-ou...</a>
<br />
<br />(FWIW just tested the above and everything worked without any problems on a configuration that already had about 20 other profiles)
<br />
<br />Now, assuming that you actually changed your command line as was described in the sentence preceding the erroneous link, then would suggest creating a new Outlook profile using the following instructions to manually create an Outlook profile without an email account
<br />
<br />Create an Outlook profile without an email account
<br /><a href="https://www.contactgenie.info/how-to-create-outlook-profile-no-email-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.contactgenie.info/how-to-create-out...</a>
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />What is a "command line option"?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />It's the value that you enter when selecting &lt;Run&gt; from the Start menu - or in short, what is required to be run to create an "empty" Outlook profile.and am assuming that is how you completed the original attempt to start with.

<br />Any other ideas?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Did you try to manually create the "No Email" profile as per the instructions.
<br />
<br />What I would suggest to eliminate as much as possible would be to open the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app --&gt; click on &lt;Show Profiles&gt; --&gt; delete any existing Outlook profiles and then try to create the &lt;NoEmail&gt; profile either via the &lt;Run&gt; command or as per the manual instructions from my article.
<br />
<br />Also, just to cover off another possibility, does this by chance involve a &lt;relatively&gt; new computer? (new as in within the last year). 
<br />
<br />If yes, go to Windows --&gt; Settings --&gt; Apps --&gt; Apps &amp; Features --&gt; scroll down the list to see if you have &lt;Microsoft Office Desktop Apps&gt; in the list. If you do, click on it and select &lt;Uninstall&gt;. After that completes, go to Control Panel &lt;Programs&gt; --&gt; find Microsoft Office --&gt; select &lt;Change&gt; --&gt; select &lt;Online Repair&gt; (this takes longer then a &lt;Quick Repair&gt; but is more complete. The raason to do the Repair is to ensure that everything s reset properly after the uninstall of &lt;Microsoft Office Desktop Apps&gt;

            I really appreciate your patience.&nbsp; I followed your control panel instructions and deleted the existing Outlook profile.&nbsp; Then I tried to create the NoEmail profile via the run command.&nbsp; Then something new popped up on my screen:&nbsp; a message box saying
 "New Profile … Create New Profile … Profile Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;_____ "&nbsp; But then when I entered a name (tryng "NoEmail"), I got a "searching for accounts" message, which then took me back to the same old&nbsp;"Welcome" screen.&nbsp; (On that screen, as mentioned in a previous post,
 my Yahoo account pre-populates, because I attempted to link Outlook to that account several days agao.&nbsp; But that ends up at a dead end as well.)

<br />Gotta love when things change unexpectedly. Please give me little time (15-20 min or so) to get to and go through everything on a system with a perpetual license of '2016 installed to do some comparison checks between that and the current Office 365 Outlook version which I've been using.

</p><p>Is summing B3 to M3 and ignoring errors in the range.&nbsp; If you simply use =SUM(B3:M3) and there were errors in the range then the SUM formula wouldn't work. The&nbsp; "&lt;1e100" bit ignores the errors because any error value will always be greater then 1E100 which
 is simply a very large number in scientific notation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This formula</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IFERROR((AB3*$AH$3)+AB3,"")</p>
<p>
</p><p>is multiplying AB3*AH3 and then adding the value in AB3</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formula is wrapped in an IFERROR functions and if the result of the math is an error then that function evaluates as TRUE and returns a null string ""</p>
