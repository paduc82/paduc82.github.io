            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a Toshiba you would normally press 0 (zero) at Boot to start the Recovery Process back to Factory Settings&nbsp;from a Recovery partition if you never received a disk at purchase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also make your own Recovery Disk to keep in case your Hard Drive ever fails:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Type "recovery" in to the Search field. As you type, the number of results will start appearing below.<br />
<br />
After locating and clicking on "TOSHIBA Recovery Media Creator", select "Yes" when prompted with the question, "Do you want to allow the following program to make changes to your computer?"</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
If the Recovery Partition has been damaged contact Toshiba for Recovery Disks to reinstall from
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I change an icon eg VLC, to a thumbnail of the movie</h2>
                    Due to a virus I have had to format my laptop, Dell Inspiron 17200 Windows Vista SP1 Home premium Inc media. All of the movies which are stored on an ext WD hard disk and previously showed a thumbnail image of the movie have been replaced by an icon VLC.
 Also new movies downloaded display the icon and not a thumbnail image of the movie. How can I get the thumbnails back.
<br />
Many thanks

            Thanks a lot Lava. ell called today just to confirm that the reformatting( see first posting)&nbsp;had gone ok and no problems. That is when i told him about the loss of thumbnails. He said it was because windows media player didnot have the codex to read VLC.
 We downloaded a codex pack from softonic and now all the thumbnails are back. Thanks very much for all your help and advise it means alot to those who like myself&nbsp; don´t know too much have a place to turn to. Keep up the good work. Many thanks Al

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I need some urgent help with my Xbox Live account: I am unable to connect to Xbox Live because my account was originally set up with parental control and the parental account linked with my account has now been deactivated. Every time I try to login, I must
 accept the new terms and conditions, which requires parental approval and therefore, the username and password of the defunct account. Since the account is no longer in use and the password long forgotten, I have no way of connecting to Xbox Live. Please help!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Had the same problem here's what I did:</p>
<p>-reactivate the old email account that was used for the parental controls</p>
<p>-change information on above email account including password so that you know it</p>
<p>-log into microsoft and recover account (instructions on recovery will be sent to the email account you just reactivated)</p>
<p>-after recovering microsoft parental account change password.</p>
<p>-use this new password with the reactivated email account for the parental controls</p>
<p>-after accepting the new terms you will b able to make changes to your live account including changing it to an adult account</p>
<p>hope this helps</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth disappeared from Device Manager</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys, First time submitter, but I hope you can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Setup</p>
<p>MB: Asus B150I</p>
<p>Processor: Intel i7-6700k</p>
<p>Ram: 16 GB</p>
<p>GPU: Asus GTX 660</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>Bluetooth set: Microsoft Designer Bluetooth Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">What happened</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I was using my system (light browsing/youtube) and out of nowhere both the mouse and keyboard stopped working. After about a minute I heard the standard Windows unplug sound (as if a USB was unplugged).</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Since then I have not been able to enable any bluetooth device. I don't have any option to enable bluetooth anywhere in the system.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">What I've tried</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Roughly in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Checked Windows Updates</li><li>Uninstalled Bluetooth driver</li><li>Reinstalled Bluetooth driver from Asus driver for B150I</li><li>Checked Device Manager (No indication of any bluetooth device - Even under hidden devices/sorted by connection)</li><li>Attempted to reset system - Failed</li><li>Completely reinstalled Windows 10</li><li>Allowed Windows 10 to install all updates</li><li>Installed&nbsp;bluetooth driver from Asus driver for B150I</li><li>Installed WLAN driver from Asus driver for B150I</li><li>Installed Chipset&nbsp;driver from Asus driver for B150I</li><li>Checked Device Manager (No indication of any bluetooth device - Even under hidden devices/sorted by connection)</li><li>Disabled Bluetooth in BIOS, restarted, Enabled Bluetooth in BIOS, restarted</li><li>Started the 'Bluetooth Support Service' under 'Services' and set startup type to 'automatic'</li><li>Updated BIOS to newest version from Asus for B150I (Version 0501)</li><li>Uninstalled Bluetooth&nbsp;driver from Asus driver for B150I</li
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">The Errors</p>
<p>When trying to add a bluetooth device via 'Add bluetooth or other device':</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">Couldn't connect</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">here are some things to try:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">One this Windows device, turn on Bluetooth</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">If this device supports Bluetooth, but you can't turn it on, try to update your driver trough Windows Update in Settings</p>
<p>- Since I can't finde a device to update in Device Manager, this really does not help<br />
</p>
<p>When troubleshooting Bluetooth:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">Device does not have Bluetooth</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">Bluetooth is not available on this device. Please try using an external adapter to add Bluetooth capability to this computer.</p>
<p>-Once again not really that helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Final notes</p>
<p class="contentStandard">My System has been running Bluetooth devices just fine up until a few days ago. This is not a question regarding if my system has any bluetooth capability as I know it does. I did not do any system changes at the time of this error,
 so my best guess would be some kind of background update or operation affecting the Bluetooth adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clever people, who can help me you? :)</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Allan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I already answered this in my description. Sorry if it was not clear.</p>
<p>I use the Asus B150I motherboard which uses the Intel B150 chipset with a build-in bluetooth 4.1 connection.</p>
<p>I have never used a USB bluetooth adapter for this system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated the the chipset driver based on the Asus website as mentioned in point 10 of my 'What I've tried' list:</p>
<p>https://www.asus.com/dk/Motherboards/B150I-PRO-GAMING-WIFI-AURA/HelpDesk_Download/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically:</p>
<p>Intel(R) Chipset Software Installation Utility V10.1.1.7<br />
and<br />
Intel(R) Management Engine Interface V11.0.0.1160</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also just ran Driver Booster 4.4 today which did manage to install some extra drivers.</p>
<p>However, after a restart I still don't see any sign of bluetooth in the device manager or anywhere else.</p>
<p>And Windows Update shows everything as being up to date.</p>

<p>I have the same problem as Benjamin with an Acer Aspire Switch 10. Was working fine with Bluetooth speaker. Now all trace of Bluetooth has disappeared from Device Manager. The Bluetooth troubleshooter tells me my tablet is not compatible with bluetooth!
 I have tried re-installing the Broadcom Bluetooth Driver from the Acer site but to no avail and tried most of the other suggestions including windows update listed in Benjamin's post.</p>

<p>Hi Gerard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally doubt this is a driver issue. Mostly because I completely wiped windows and even at the very first boot up the bluetooth device did not work, and after all updates and a search of 'Driver booster', it also did not work.</p>
<p>I have not made any changes on my computer prior to the issue. The bluetooth connection simply disappeared while using the system for everyday browsing. I suspect a windows update was running in the background, but I have not way of checking this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried to contact Asus, as I don't think this is a hardware issue. but I can't rule it out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an update I ended up buying a bluetooth USB dongle, which is an annoying workaround but at least by system does have a bluetooth connection now. I managed to connect to both my Microsoft bluetooth mouse and keyboard, but for some reason the keyboard only
 works for about 5-10 minutes, and then it stops responding.</p>
<p>In Windows it appears to still be connected by it does not respons to any keystrokes.</p>
<p>I have disconnected and reconnected multiple times and changed the batteries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for now I am using an old wired backup keyboard and my bluetooth mouse. Not the desired setup, but what I can actually make work after way to many hours of troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Benjamin</p>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make &amp; model of your printer?</span></p>

<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you able to install other drivers or softwares correctly?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows Media Player won&#39;t burn any CDs</h2>
                    After creating a playlist of songs and selecting burn, I get the error message "Windows Media Player cannot burn some of the files. To investigate the problem, click on the icon next to the files in the burn list." There are no icons, or I'd remove the
 corrupted file and replace it or just live without it. I've tried restoring my computer to a previous date (in which case it burned a cd ONE TIME, but only half of the songs played in a CD player), I've tried the diagnostics test of which I could only select
 "hard drive and other devices", I've redownloaded Windows 10, and I've tried several different burn lists. I'm losing my mind, and the only option I have left is to remove WMP and redownload it, and I'll probably lose my library of over 4,000 songs. I'm at
 my wits end, please help!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not say if Windows 7 came preinstalled (Dell, HP, etc.) or you bought your own Retail License.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If preinstalled, you can contact your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.
</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost, IF they still have them available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you received&nbsp;your&nbsp;Laptop/computer there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall&nbsp;Windows back to how&nbsp;it was when new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the Key/s to press at Boot to start the Recovery Process back to Factory Settings (new condition). Under each Manufacturer in the list below are the instructions in the respective links for you to follow on how to use their Recovery Partition</p>
<p><strong><span>Acer</span></strong><span> – Press Left Alt + F10 Keys.</span></p>

</p><p>And if you do have a Manufacturer's Recovery Partition on your Hard Drive and you can Boot into Windows, you should be able to make your own Recovery Disks from it to reinstall the Operating System in case of Hard Drive failure.</p>
<p>Look under Programs &gt; your Computer Manufacturer's name &gt; then their System Tools or Recovery Software Headings for them, depending how it is worded.</p>
<p>If you can not find any reference to it, contact the&nbsp;Manufacturer for advice on how to make those Recovery Disks.</p>

            <p>One source you should consider is a friend.&nbsp; A windows 7 install disk is really not that attached to any particular computer or brand name.&nbsp; As long as it is Home Premium 64 bit, preferably SP1, you can use it. The proprietary part of the install is your
 25 character alpha numeric Microsoft Product Key, which is on a sticker on your computer somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hint:&nbsp; If yours is a Dell, you&nbsp;are using the&nbsp;hard drive that came with it,&nbsp;and it came with Windows 7 home premium 64 bit installed, the install process will activate itself without even asking for a product key.</p>

            Hi,  DominicCasilli 
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend reviewing the RAM Memory
<br />Using these steps requires you to restart your computer, so make sure to save any files you may have open and close any running applications before proceeding. Here goes:
<br />1.- Open Control Panel.
<br />2.- Click on System and Security.
<br />3.-  Click on Administrative Tools.
<br />4.- Double-click the Windows Memory Diagnostic shortcut. Quick tip: Alternatively, you can also use the Windows key + R keyboard shortcut, type mdsched.exe, and click OK to launch the tool.
<br />5.- Click the Restart now and check problems option.
<br />
<br />I would recommend you to check your Hard Disk with chkdsk.
<br />1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key and S key at the same time, then type cmd in the search box. 
<br />2) Right-click Command Prompt, then select Run as administrator. 
<br />3) Type chkdsk /f /r, then press Enter on your keyboard.  
<br />4) Press Y on your keyboard. 
<br />5) Press the Windows logo key and R at the same time, then type mdsched.exe. 
<br />6) Click Restart now and check for problems (recommended). Your PC will restart immediately. 
<br />7) Wait for the scans to finish.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

<p>so I have remove all my SSD and my hdd and it still freeze at 12% but then resumes at 100% after. I don't think the hard drive is the problem. This problem seems to be a confusing one because the black screen doesn't say anything unlike a blue screen. sorry

<p>I have done this before with keeping the files and removing them all by reformatting them all with windows 10 media usb. I did it about 1 week and a half ago. But it just magically returns. this usually accurse in like watching YouTube or reading an article
 but usually not during game only once in fortnite.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>In my Dell e7440 is broken the physical airplane mode switch . Turns on and off when it wanna . I&nbsp; disable it in the device manager -&gt; user interface -&gt; airplan mode swicht collection. When it deactivates this switch when the airplane mode is off (wi fi
 on), everything is ok and there is no problem with on / off airplane mode. However, during the computer restart I can not turn on the wi fi (the wi fi icon shows off). The switch is deactivated. I think that I need to change the computer settings during startup
 to automatically turn on wi fi from the software level without being connected to the hardware switch. However, I have no idea how to do it<br />

            Hello  Patryk 
<br />Please follow these methods 
<br />Method 1: Check the Toggle Switch to Fix the Windows 10 Airplane Mode Errors
<br />Usually, there is a physical wireless toggle on the Windows laptop or tablet that you could use to quickly control the wireless signal receiving. Only when the toggle is ON, could you turn on the Windows 10 airplane mode.
<br />Method 2: Use Shortcut Keys to Turn ON or OFF the Airplane Mode
<br />Besides the physical toggle, the Fn shortcut keys on a laptop are also the access to fix the Windows 10 airplane mode errors.
<br />
<br />Use the shortcut keys Fn + key with a radio tower icon (usually on key like F3) to see if the Windows 10 airplane mode is available.
<br />
<br />Method 3: Check the Related Settings on Windows 10
<br />Windows 10 Settings can help to solve the airplane mode stuck on or not working issues.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Airplane Mode in Windows Settings
<br />Step 1. Click the Start menu.
<br />
<br />Step 2. Select the Settings.
<br />
<br />Step 3. Go to the Network &amp; Internet menu.
<br />
<br />Step 4. Select Airplane mode on the left pane.
<br />
<br />Step 5. Turn ON/OFF the Airplane mode on the right pane.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Airplane Mode in Network Settings
<br />Step 1. Click the display icon on the Windows 10 taskbar.
<br />
<br />Step 2. If the Airplane mode icon is gray, click the icon to turn it on. If the icon is highlighted, click it to turn off the airplane mode.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Airplane Mode in Action Center
<br />Step 1. Use Windows shortcut keys Win + A to open the Action Center.
<br />
<br />Step 2. If the Airplane mode icon is gray, click the icon to turn it on. If the icon is highlighted, click it to turn off the airplane mode.
<br />Note: If the methods above fail to fix the airplane mode errors, keep reading the following content.
<br />Methods 4: Modify the Network Adapter Properties
<br />Step 1. Use Windows shortcut keys Win + X (or right click the Start menu).
<br />
<br />Step 2. Select the Device Manager.
<br />
<br />Step 3. Expand the Network adapters.
<br />
<br />Step 4. Right click on the network adapter of you device and select Properties.
<br />
<br />Step 5. Select the Power Management tab from the pop-up dialog box.
<br />
<br />Step 6. Uncheck the item Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power.
<br />
<br />Step 7. Click the OK to save the changes.
<br />Method 5: Disable Non-Microsoft Services
<br />Some programs or services can affect the Windows 10 airplane mode. You could try to disable some non-Microsoft services to fix the Windows 10 airplane mode not turning on or off errors. If you happen to know the program, disable it directly. If not, it may take your time to figure out the black sheep from the list.
<br />
<br />Step 1. Use Windows shortcut keys Win + R to launch Run.
<br />
<br />Step 2. Type msconfig in the text box.
<br />
<br />Step 3. Press the Enter.
<br />
<br />Step 4. Select the Service tab.
<br />
<br />Step 5. Check the Hide all Microsoft services option.
<br />
<br />Step 6. Click the button Disable.
<br />
<br />Step 7. Click the Apply.
<br />Step 8. Select the Startup tab.
<br />
<br />Step 9. Click the Open Task Manager.
<br />
<br />Step 10. Select the Startup tab on the new pop-up dialog and disable all the startup items.
<br />I hope it helps

</p><p>I am sorry to hear about your issue and let me set your expectation, that currently, we are encountering issue when it comes to sending instant messages but, this only affects the Skype for Windows desktop. For more information, please go through this link:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/status/59142925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click here</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For your other issue, it seems that you are encountering the same issue, just like on the Windows version. Can you try to uninstall and reinstall the app and check if it will work? Or try to sign out an then sign back in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

</p><p>What do you mean by reverting to the old version of Skype? Were you having any trouble to find it? If that is a yes, you can download it through this link:
<a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a> that is an installer for the Skype classic version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding to your other concern of Skype for Web, have you tried to use a different internet browser and check if it will sign you out after 15 minutes of idle?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will look forward to your update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Windows 7-Media Player 12.</p>
<p>A CD burns fine, but album art in the player does not transfer to the CD.&nbsp; Also the CD Name appears next to the art, but the other 3 lines of info do not.&nbsp; Everything else copies just fine.&nbsp; I tried adding art manually, does not work.&nbsp; Checked to make sure
 file was not read-only, so that is not the issue.&nbsp; Settings issue??&nbsp; I am new to WMP 12.</p>

<p>Are you burning the CD as an audio CD, or as a data CD containing MP3 files? You can check by clicking the&nbsp;<strong>Burn options</strong> 'checkmark' button in the top right corner.</p>
<p>Album art *might* be transferred to a data CD, but certainly not to an audio CD. Audio CDs simply don't support album art, so it's not possible.</p>
<p>Burning album information to an audio CD is a feature called&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-Text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
CD-Text</a> . WMP doesn't have built-in support for CD-Text but you can install the&nbsp;<a href="http://bmproductions.fixnum.org/wmpcdtext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">WMPCDText</a> plug-in to allow WMP to read it.<br />
<br />
To create a CD with CD-Text, you will need to use a different burning program, such as Nero Burning Rom or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.burrrn.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Burrrn</a> .</p>

            in order to see the HDD the BIOS / UEFI&nbsp;<br />
SATA HDD controller must be set in <br />
<br />
native / IDE / compatibility mode <br />
<br />
what ever the BIOS / UEFI has it named, <br />
<br />
and then after testing before booting into windows it must be set back to the<br />
SATA/ AHCI / RAID setting that windows was originally isntalled on<br />
<br />
boot up <br />
enter the system BIOS / UEFI with the system specified key <br />
eg.<br />
Dell = F2&nbsp; <br />
<br />
and change the HDD controller to an IDE compatibility before booting the system with the Seatools DOS disc.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
SATA AHCI / RAID doesn't use the same ports as IDE <br />
and therefore any OS that doesn't have native SATA drivers cannot see the disks or even the controller.

    <title>Frequent BSOD &#40;DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION&#41; on waking laptop from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cheekypoppet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Frequent BSOD &#40;DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION&#41; on waking laptop from sleep</h2>
                    <p>Hello there</p>
<p>I'm hoping someone can help. I have a Dell Precision M4500:&nbsp;<a href="http://1drv.ms/1OEtkqR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Spec</a>. Ever since I've upgraded from Win7 Pro to Win10 Pro, I get the above BSOD about 10 minutes after the laptop has been woken
 from sleep (or at least I've recently realised it always seems to happen in that situation, but I can't say 100% it hasn't happened at other times).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After much research, and in desperation, I reset Win10 (keeping my files) this weekend, but it's still happening. Here are the DMP files since the reset:&nbsp;<a href="http://1drv.ms/1MPHxQc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DMP</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no clue how to interpret these files but, from reading other posts, I suspect the NVIDIA drivers (specifically nvlddmkm.sys) could be the problem (it's one of the files listed under the driver details). The advice is to uninstall the driver completely,
 and install an updated driver (I believe NVIDIA have issued one for my GPU, but it's not easy to locate on their site) but I'm scared I won't have any display to work with if I do that. I've never attempted anything quite that brave...I will keep searching
 to see if I can find out if it's safe to do it, but would appreciate any insight on that!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having other problems with the laptop intermittently hanging when I ask it to restart, and not always loading properly when it does boot back up (not all system tray notifications load, Cortana/search won't work) but that tends to resolve if I can get
 it to restart and I get the feeling it may have something to do with this problem. Just thought I'd mention it in case it's relevant!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be very much appreciated - this issue has wasted untold hours, and I'm on a tight deadline I need the laptop for. I've already lost some (very hard) work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>With thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>C</p>

            <p>Hi Gerry</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is resolved now (at least so far, I'm touching wood!!). I posted it in the Technet forums before I found out this is where people like me should be posting this sort of thing. I couldn't delete it, although I did let them know I'd put it up
 on here. A very helpful member (ZigZag3143x) analysed the DMP files and identified the driver that was causing the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone else with the same problem, in my case (and, from my research, I gather it can be different for everyone) it was the Accelerometer Sensor Driver from ST Microelectronics (the freefall sensor) that was causing the problem. Mine was from 2011.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is a Dell Precision M4500 (full specs if anyone wants to compare are in the 'specs' link in my original post. Dell haven't released Win10 drivers for it for my machine, but I found a Win10 one for the Precision M4700 on their website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't completely uninstall the existing driver before reinstalling the new one as advised on these forums because the system wanted a reboot every time I did it, and the new driver wouldn't install with a reboot pending. Windows reinstalled the old
 driver when I did restart. However, it seems to have done the trick to install the new one over the old one. It gave me an error the first time I restarted, but it's been fine ever since. So far, it seems to have resolved the other problems I was having with
 restarts and everything loading properly on start-up too. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Long may it continue - the relief is intoxicating!! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone wants it, here's the link to the MSInfo32 output:&nbsp;<a href="http://1drv.ms/1MPHG6j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://1drv.ms/1MPHG6j</a>. And, in case it's useful to anyone, here's the link to the driver report requested:&nbsp;<a href="http://1drv.ms/1OGe2Sv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://1drv.ms/1OGe2Sv</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may be back if all is not resolved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again, Gerry, for taking the time to answer my cry for help!</p>

<h2>            Circle appears when touch and holding trackpad</h2>
                    I'm not sure if this is a windows 10 thing or an edge thing, but when I touch and hold for even a few seconds on my trackpad, this circle appears with "home," "end," "back" and "forward" on it. It's really annoying, and I can't even really figure out how
 to use it properly. I'd just like to turn it off. Anyone know what's up with this?

            I assume you have a Samsung computer.&nbsp; It is a Samsung feature called "press and go".&nbsp; Look for it in your Samsung settings and turn it off.

    <title>My Xbox One is crashing every time I download my account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meltyourtv  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Xbox One is crashing every time I download my account</h2>
                    
<p>I bought an Xbox One and successfully signed in with my old 360 account. I was playing it for 2 hours when I got an "E200 000000EF 00000000" error, which basically according to Google were the new red rings. I returned it and got a replacement, and while
 performing the step in the initial setup that downloaded my account, my xbox would crash. I was forced to create a new account, but I would like my old one back, especially since my gold membership has not yet expired. I have tried recovering my account to
 other peoples' Xbox Ones, but they crash as well. The only way I can access my account is by downloading it to a 360, which works perfectly fine.</p>
<p>I've attached a video to show the problem. Couldn't figure out how to attach it here:</p>
<p>Also note that when my first Xbox One crashed I was in the process of upgrading it from a child to an adult account on account.microsoft.com because the age was wrong.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>for an issue like this, I advise to contact Xbox Support (By Phone or Microsoft Support Chat) they should be able to take a more in depth look into your account to see what may be causing the issue.</p>
<p>To contact Xbox Support by Phone use this link for the number: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a> be sure that the country in bottom left corner matches your actual region.</p>
<p>To contact Xbox Support via Microsoft Support Chat use that option at <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a></p>

<p>in all honesty I get where your coming from on this ! &nbsp;since it most likely is due to some account related issues your in luck since you still have your profile actively on a xbox 360</p>
<p>I would recommend you follow this tutorial <a href="http://support-origin.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support-origin.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account<br />
in</a> theory once you've moved your account to a new Microsoft account (that has the right age) you should be good to go and not have that crashing issue since all the info is correct and the msa is a new one</p>

<p>@meltyourtv ! sorry I've been mia , but after reviewing that video and reviewing somethings you were once able to sign in on a xbox on and do you still have this profile in question signed in on both your xbox one and your 360, and after watching the video
 over and over I believe you might have some bad data on your xbox one &nbsp;if it gave you a e200 error which after researching that error &nbsp;this is what I found out
</p>

<p>if you follow the steps up to Step 3: What error code are you getting?</p>
<p>it corresponds to the error you were getting but obviously "powercyclying" isn't going to resolve the issue so Step 5: Try the Offline System Update Diagnostic Tool would be the best bet</p>
