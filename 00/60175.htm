<h2>            How to re-install Win 10 with no disk and no activation code&#63;</h2>
                    I did the free upgrade from Win 7 to Win 10 when available.&nbsp; My hard drive died, so I need a complete install of Win 10 to the new hard drive.&nbsp; How do I do this with no install disk and no activation code?

            Hi yourpaintballgod , you need to create your own Installation Media, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />You should just clean install Windows 10 rather than upgrading from Windows 7. This will have 2 benefits, if you have to reset again, it will reset to Windows 10, not 7 and your system will be more responsive and reliable . . . 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi yourpaintballgod,
<br />
<br />Because you have previously had windows 10 installed and activated on that device, you can reinstall windows 10 anytime you wish, for free. 
<br />
<br />to get the best install, with fewest issues, use the media creation tool to create bootable media and clean install windows 10. 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />make sure to get the same edition ( home, pro etc.)of windows 10 that you had before
<br />
<br />during install, skip the pages that ask for a key, it will activate automatically when you go online. 
<br />

The old Skype menu had tools and adjustable settings like changing the font, font size, and other adjustable settings. The "Alt" works fine to bring up the tool bar, but didn't let me find what I was looking for. I guess I'll just use Skype the way it is now.
 Thanks anyway....<br />

<h2>            Viewsonic VX239wm moniter goes onto the screensaver the audio no longer works</h2>
                    OT: Defualt Playback error<br />
<br />
Hello, I have a custom built PC and whenever my Viewsonic VX239wm moniter goes onto the screensaver the audio no longer works. The reason for this is that it says my audio device is not plugged in but I know it is as this is what the image goes through as I
 used HDMI so it must be plugged in. The only way to get the audio to work again is to go onto playback devices and it picks the device up and audio then works again! If anyone has a solution to this problem it would save a great deal of hassle of opening it
 each time. Many thanks!<br />

            Hi DanDelaney,<br />
<br />
Are you using any third party screen saver?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1</b><br />
I would suggest you to change the screen saver use windows default screen saver and check if the issue persists.<br />

<h2>            Restoring&#47;reinstalling accidentally deleted dll files. Help&#33;</h2>
                    Hi, I could really use some help.<br />
Quick backstory: so a few days ago I was trying to get VS17 to install on the dive I wanted it to be on and not my boot drive. Apparently, it won't allow that so copied the files to the right drive, deleted the original ones and changed the shortcut path to
 match their new location. When I tried to start VS17 though, I got an error that files were missing so it couldn't start. I decided to start all over. I went to delete VS but the Uninstall Program didn't show VS because I had moved the files.
<br />
At this point, I was pretty frustrated (I was also very tired, so this was a bad idea to start with), I went ahead and started deleting any files connected to VS17.<br />
I was on a rampage trying to find and remove all traces of VS17... And I also deleted the whole MSVCR.dll folder, permanently.&nbsp; Might have been a couple of other important things I threw out. Honestly, I don't know.<br />
Don't try and work on your computer when irritated and tired. <br />
Anyway, now I've been getting errors of missing .dlls from some of my programs. I followed instructions I found online to download the missing .dll files (I don't know how many I need in all) and place them in System32 and SysWOW64.
<br />
That seemed to stop the errors, but the program's that were giving errors are still not running.
<br />
<br />
Any advice? I don't know what else I can do to fix my mistake.<br />
My computer runs Windows 7 64bit.<br />

<p>System Restore (rstrui.exe) might restore the missing files.</p>
<p>Moving files or folders into a holding directory would be a far safer option than deleting them outright.</p>
<p>Keeping an image of your installation would also save you from the consequences of such rash actions.</p>

                    Each time I open an email in MS Outlook Express, it opens up in a small window, and I have to maximize to get the full message.

            INstead of maximizing, drag the borders of the small window larger, then close the window by double-clicking the icon in the top left of the window.&nbsp; The next time you open a message, OE should remember the window size.

            Just to add to Brian's advice, after you drag the window to the size you want, it must be the&nbsp;<strong><em> last</em></strong> window closed for the size to be remembered. Close the others first via the Taskbar.

<h2>            Windows Explorer stops working when add tags to images</h2>
                    <p>Windows Explorer stops working whenever I attempt to add tags to images in the&nbsp;Details tab under Properties.&nbsp; Every now and then it will stop working when adding other metadata in the Details tab also.&nbsp; But it always stops working when adding the 2nd or
 3rd tag.&nbsp; I get a message that Windows Explorer has stopped working and will close, but there is no error message #.&nbsp; Then it just closes and I have to restart the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've experimented with scanned images and images taken with a camera.&nbsp; At first I
 thought it was just scanned images, but it does it on everything.&nbsp; This originally was not a problem.&nbsp; Happening maybe for a couple of months.&nbsp; I've rebooted several times, but doesn't help.</p>

            You mean you see Installed memory as 8 GB and in brackets it is written 7.66 GB usable? If yes, that is quite natural. MB's have a specific amount of RAM that they can handle.

</p><p>&nbsp; I just get worried that I would run into problems.&nbsp; Do you know if I take many saved pics to my PC off and on to a CD if that would add memory to useable RAM?. I now store many pics in the cloud so it doesn't take any space from my PC. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

</b></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As it was an '.inf' file, I could see the install option and so I clicked on it. &nbsp;Windows threw up an error message saying "the inf file that you selected doesn't support this method of installation". &nbsp;</span></div>

<h2>            move stuff between accounts</h2>
                    
<p>Heya,<br />
<br />
I didn't really know how to put it but here's the thing: I have 2 accounts. The one I'm using to post this is the one I actually wanted to use, but I managed to get Xbox Live Gold on the other one so I have been (involuntarily nearly) playing with that one
 for over a year, and thus collecting gamerscore, achievements and microsoft points on that account. Now my Gold membership is finally about to run out and I want to buy Gold on this account, but then I'd lose all the things I've collected on the other account
 last year.<br />
<br />
I know I can move my gamertag to a different microsoft account but what I really want is to move everything from the 'wrong' account to this gamertag + microsoft account so I can just go on playing without having to start all over again. The only way I've found
 so far is moving my other gamertag to this other microsoft account, then deleting this account and renaming the other one. Next to the fact that I think there should be an easier way, I also think it's ridiculous that I would have to pay to keep the things
 I have now (both the name I want to use and all my achievements and such are mine anyway so why pay to put them together as 1)<br />
<br />
so my question is, is there any other way for me to do this, or is there any way a microsoft employee could help me with this issue. My Xbox Live Gold membership on my other account is due to run out on 18/04/2013 so I'd kinda like to have it fixed before then.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks a million,<br />
Peacehorses&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like Homegrown said, you cant combine them...</p>
<p>but you were on the right track as far as the closest thing you could do.<br />
<br />
You could unlink PeaceHorse from the windows I.D and then move you current gold account to this I.D and then change the name to something as close to Peace Horse since you wouldnt be able to use the same exact name.</p>

<p>I know it's frustrating, but unfortunately the reason it's so annoying is because of hackers. The 30 day rule is so they can't change the one thing that encompasses your account, it's your login credentials for one.

<p>Kimberlu, I have all information for both accounts, email, password etc., it's really that I just don't like the gamertag. I've been using peacehorses since forever but managed to get Gold on the other account, which was stupid but I wasn't going to buy
 another year's worth of xbox live gold on peacehorses as well. But now I have all my stuff on the other account (achievements, gamerscore etc.). And I'm not sure, but wouldn't be surprised, if the online passes would only be valid on the account I'm using
 now so I'd have to buy all of them again as well when I buy xbox live gold on peacehorses.</p>
<p>Is there any way for me to permanently delete peacehorses and then rename the other account to peacehorses, or will I never be able to rename it to peacehorses anyway?</p>
<p>I don't believe what you're saying about hackers by the way, it's all about money, think everyone knows that and it disgusts me, but there's not really anything I can do about that.</p>

<p>have you tried to see if you are able to get a refund when you are cancelling the xbox live gold subscription on the 'incorrect' account, so you are able to buy a new subscription for the 'correct' account?</p>

<p>Heya,</p>
<p>thanks very much for your answer but the Xbox Live Gold already ran out. I've been using it on the other account because I didn't know about moving it to my own account back then. I think there's nothing left for me to do than to rename it to something else
 and move it to my current WLID.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for your answers anyway.</p>

                    I keep getting a Bluetooth popup that is asking me to set up my keyboard...which is wireless, and does not have the connect button on it. I have been using it for months now, but at the same time (this started 3 days ago) I have no mouse operation. I'm
 using my USB type for the time being. The mouse is Logitech MX1000. I have tried several things, but have not done System Restore. I would appreciate a suggestion from anyone....Thanks .

    <title>Install Windows XP on blank hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edumald92  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install Windows XP on blank hard drive</h2>
                    I had Ubuntu installed on my computer, then I got tired of it and decided to go back to good old Windows XP. Since I could not format the hard drive by using the bootable Windows CD, I decided to format it by using an application called Gparted-Live. I
 erased the Ubuntu partitions and formatted the hard drive to NTFS. I figured that by doing so I could install Windows XP with no problem. However, now the Windows Setup gives me the same error as before and I can't delete or format the drive or install Windows.
 The Windows installation says the following prior to the computer crashing and giving me a blue screen error, "Unknown Disc" four times. If I press "D" to delete a partition, the computer crashes and gives me the following error, "the problem seems to be caused
 by the following file: setupdd.sys" and below that, "PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA". Then it says for Technical information:&nbsp;<br />
*** STOP: 0x00000050 (0xE50F7098,0x00000000,0xF77CA9A8,0x00000002_
<div>*** setupdd.sys - Address F77CA9A8 base at F77A3000, DateStamp 48025277<br />
<b>Will anyone please help me sort this out, I am very lost here and need help very promptly. Thank you for Cooperation in advance.</b>&nbsp;</div>

<p><span>It seems like the problem is caused due to faulty hardware or corrupt NTFS file system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can try the steps below to repair disk errors:</span></p>

<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you have a dual-boot or multiboot system, select the installation that you want to access from the Recovery Console.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When you are prompted, type the Administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Although this is very helpful it did not solve my problem. I don't have a dual boot system, and my other computer is too old to fit my SATA hard drive. I guess the way to solve it would be buying a new hard drive. Anyways thank you very much for the support.

            Hi there,
<br />
<br />Have you tried updating via the Windows 10 Update Assistant? I've found it to be far more reliable than updating through Windows. 
<br />
<br />Download it from here, by pressing the Update Now button; 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo</a>... 
<br />
<br />Run the file from your PC and it will walk you through the process.

<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Quite simple:
<br />
<br /><pre><code>

<br />
<br />
<br />0x00000003
<br />
<br />ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND
<br />
<br />The system cannot find the path specified.
<br />
<br />Possible for you to uninstall Forms and then try again?

<p>Dear Sumit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to uninstall Forms and I don't remember installing it. I've tried to find them (they appear to be some links pointing to Office 365 programs: Word, Excel and PowerPoint).</p>

            After trying to upgrade using Media Creation Tool and Windows Update Assistant (WUA) for a few consecutive times, WUA reported an error and asked me to restart the computer. As this is new, I'll report the outcome as it finishes.

            For this particular error:&nbsp;<span>0x80070003 - 0x2000D&nbsp;</span><span>The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during MIGRATE_DATA operation.<br />
<br />
I see a lot of generic solutions on the internet that can solve some update issues but this one can be a bit more complicated.
<br />
<br />
I found the easiest and quickest fix is to simply create another user account with administrator privileges, log out of your existing account and log into the new user account and run the update. Keep rebooting and updating the new account until there are no
 more updates then log out of the new account and log back into your old account and it should be updated. Run the updates again in your original account to double check and when you are satisfied that its all updated, delete the new user account and files
 so that you are left with your original account.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps someone.<br />

<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When do you receive this error message?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on your computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Perform the following troubleshooting methods:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.
 This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>To set the computer in clean boot, follow the steps from the link:

</p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>After checking in clean boot, follow
<b>step: 7</b> from the article to reset the computer to normal boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Perform System File Check to fix the corrupted system files and then check how it works.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Note:
