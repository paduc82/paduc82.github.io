    <title>Anti virus software for Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Anti virus software for Outlook 2016</h2>
                    I use McAfee Live Safe Anti Virus software on my W10 PC, since installed a few years ago, have had no security issues so see no reason to change. I recently changed from POP with McAfee anti spam as an "add in" to an IMAP account where I could not set
 up McAfee as an "add in". Sought tech support from&nbsp; McAfee and briefly, was advised that the McAfee "add in" was not compatible with IMAP only POP but as my whole PC including Outlook 2016 is protected anyway, I do not need the "add in". So why have "add ins"
 for anti spam email&nbsp; anyway if not required and does anyone have this issue with other anti virus software companies.? &nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hello, 
<br />I am Rob Independent Advisor, I am here to help you to solve your issue.
<br />Thank you for contacting the community It is a pleasure for us to help you out.
<br />-
<br />Thanks to advances in compliance intelligence, many anti-spam filters are able to automatically learn which messages are legitimate and which are not like (spam/malware/phishing) with minimal user intervention just at the server side, before you receive your email in your Inbox. 
<br />Because of this kind of threats are difficult to avoid new days, is a good practice to have an Antivirus solution in PC Side to be protected against that, once you receive your email in your Inbox.
<br />But, Enabling Outlook Mail Client Antivirus Integration will probably give you some headaches.
<br />-There are some considerations you need to be aware of before enabling virus scanner integration with Outlook 
<br />Virus scanner exclusion recommendations for Outlook
<br /><a href="https://www.msoutlook.info/question/virus-scanner-exclusion-recommendations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.msoutlook.info/question/virus-scann...</a>
<br />
<br />- So many Antivirus solution exist worldwide that can work as Mail scan protection, 
<br />Windows Defender Antivirus can be an option for mail scanning check: 
<br />Take a look at this:
<br />Configure Windows Defender Antivirus scanning options
<br />Email scanning limitations
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/configure-advanced-scan-types-windows-defender-antivirus#ref1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/securi...</a>
<br />My recommendations:
<br />-Let the server side detect the threat email (spam/malware/phishing). 
<br />- Keep your SO and Office up to date.
<br />- Keep your Antivirus up to date and perform regular scans on your PCs.
<br />- Avoid register in suspicious websites with the affected account
<br />-Avoid download attachments as well as clicking URLs received from suspicious senders. 
<br />- Use junk configuration to block suspicions senders.

<br />-Report to your email provider if received any email with
<br />(spam/malware/phishing)
<br />I hope this helps, 
<br />Please let me know if you have further questions.
<br />Remember, your feedback will be very welcome.
<br />Regards,
<br />Rob

<br />Hello Fitzarc
<br />
<br />A/V addins are completely unnecessary for the very reason you identified. There is no "one size fits all" answer to your question but from experience, A/V addins tend to cause more problems then whatever problems are claimed to be fixed.
<br />
<br />A/V and A/S are two entirely different functions but personally am no more enamored with A/S addins then I am with A/V addins for a wide variety of reasons.

<h2>            How do I remove&#58; Internet helper 3.1 toolbar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was able to remove unwanted malware Search Results LLc through the control and in the process noticed Internet Helper 3.1&nbsp;Toolbar is also in the control panel. The option to remove the 3.1 seems to be available, but when I click to remove it a page flashes,
 but doesn't open up. I believe&nbsp;this&nbsp;Internet Helper 3.1 is&nbsp;potentially harmful and&nbsp;should be removed. Could you advise&nbsp;a procedure? Is&nbsp;the&nbsp;Internet Helper related to the Search Results LLC?&nbsp;</p>

<h3> sakendrick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exceptions to rules in Outlook to move messages are ignored</h2>
                    I have a rule that moves messages to a folder based on words in the body. &nbsp;it works fine.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an exception to that rule for when the email comes from someone in my company - 'except with "company.com" in the sender's address'</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The exception is ignored and all emails get moved into the folder causing me to miss important messages. &nbsp;It sounds just like the problem listed here:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/817261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/817261</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem is - we use Office365 so our our exchange server is hosted by Microsoft... so has Microsoft not applied the hotfix?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any recommendations, work arounds, etc?</div>

<p><span>Hi Wynette,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This could be due to the account settings in Outlook.com not updating correctly after the password change of your Gmail account or this could be due to email protocol
 settings that need to be updated. To resolve your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Were there any other changes made to your email account aside from the password change?</span></li><li><span>Were there any error messages that showed up when you attempted to send an email using the email account in question?</span></li><li><span>Have you already attempted to remove and then re-add the email account?</span></li><li><span>What is the web browser you're using to access Outlook.com?</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We look forward to your response to our queries.</span></p>
        </p>

<p>There were no other changes made to the email account aside from the password change.&nbsp; After I changed the password and it was not working (&amp; after I checked all the settings)), I deleted it and reinstalled the email account. When I run the "test message",
 it shows that it is working but I never get the message in my Microsoft Office Outlook.&nbsp; It comes into my Windows 10 Outlook mail and to my phone but not where I most want it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have several email accounts coming into my Office Outlook, some yahoo and one
 other gmail account.&nbsp; The other gmail account is still working fine so I made sure all the settings were the same as that one, but it still would not received mail.&nbsp; I can send mail out but not received mail on the account in question.&nbsp; I've gone online and
 done various things that different ones have said helped them.&nbsp; I learned that I'm not the only one this has happened to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply and suggestions but I feel they were totally not applicable to my situation.&nbsp; It isn't that I'm not getting all of my mail in the subject account, I am not receiving any of my mail for that account. It had worked for years and suddenly
 quit working when I changed the password.&nbsp; I have another gmail account and two yahoo accounts coming into Outlook that are all working perfectly but I didn't change the password on them.&nbsp; When I run a test message it says it is sending and receiving but the
 test message never shows up in my Outlook.&nbsp; I can send a message out in that account but if I get an answer to it, it will not come to Outlook.&nbsp; The only way I receive messages to the account in question is in Windows 10 mail and that is not where I want it.&nbsp;
 There has to be a solution to this problem so please don't dismiss me.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Thanks for the update. Can you confirm to us if you're using the Outlook desktop app in managing your emails or are you just using Outlook.com? This will help us provide steps better suited to your concern. Also, email accounts from Microsoft have options
 to setup multiple verifications before an email client can access the account. This also goes the same for third-party email providers. We recommend that you verify the account settings of your third-party email for any settings that may require additional
 setup. An example would be two-step verification that Microsoft also uses.</p>

<h2>            I cannot connect to my work email account from Outlook 2016.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot connect to my work email account from Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed a fresh new Windows Pro 10 on my new PC and logged in using my Azure AD account.</p>
<p>I have also installed Office365 including Outlook (version 1810).</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT, I can't connect to my work email from Outlook.</p>
<p>I open Outlook, and it suggests to connect to email using my work email address, but I get the not very helpful "Something went wrong".</p>
<p>I also tried clicking on the Troubleshooting section, which does not help me either.</p>
<p>I tried a couple of suggestions I've seen on the net (adding account via profile mgmnt, disabling IPv6, setting ExcludeHttps... in registry) to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I'm unsure of is where the "app password" enters in to this?</p>
<p>I have created one, and I tried it when I tried to add account via profil mgmt (without success).</p>
<p>Should I have ben prompted for the app password when I started Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(NB: I have still my old PC with Outlook installed and it still works fine.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can add my hotmail-account in the Outlook app and I can use Outlook in the web-browser (with the same email address I tried in the Outlook desktop app).</p>
<p>So it's just the Outlook desktop app that doesn't work.</p>
<p>(And yes, I have tried reinstall of Office365 without luck.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated!</p>

<p>But, when I start Outlook and select that profile, I get this error:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>could you please try to explain that a little bit more?</p>
<p>When I set up my PC, I used my Azure AD user name.</p>
<p>I don't see that I can have another profile?</p>
<p>Do you mean a "local account" or something like that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if I sound ungrateful. </p>
<p>I understand that you are not working for Microsoft, but I cannot for my life understand why it is so difficult to setup a Microsoft email client (Outlook) for a Microsoft email user (Azure AD) on a Microsoft operating system (Windows).</p>

            I have a lot of experience in supporting Office, Outlook and email accounts. My daily work is support for Office.
<br />You say that the .ost was not created correctly, and the online repair did not help. That's why I suggest, that just to test you create a local account with administration permission on the PC.
<br />
<br />Also check the following link to see if that is the problem you have:

<p><br />
Hi,</p>
<p>First, make sure that your program shortcuts open 32-bit Internet Explorer. Flash Player will only install and run on 32-bit browsers.<br />
When you right-click the IE icons in the Quick Launch area, the Start Menu and the desktop then choose Properties, what's in the Target field?<br />
Targets should be either:<br />
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"&nbsp;&nbsp; (32-bit)<br />
"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"&nbsp;&nbsp; (64-bit)<br />
<br />
Modify those Targets to be "C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" (include the quotes) and the 32-bit version of IE8 should open.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>If you have attempted to install Flash Player run the uninstaller mentioned below, the follow the other steps.</p>
<p>Then uninstall/reinstall Flash Player.<br />
1. Download and save to the desktop the Flash Player Uninstaller<br />
http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/141/tn_14157.html<br />
<br />
2. Download and save to the desktop the Flash Player Installer<br />
http://www.macromedia.com/go/full_flashplayer_win_ie<br />
<br />
3. Right click the Flash uninstaller and run as administrator. After that's completed, restart.<br />
<br />
4. Right click the Flash installer and run as administrator. After that's completed, restart.<br />
<br />
5. Test Flash Player at http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/155/tn_15507.html</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br />
Don</p>

<h2>            KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE -- 14986 Won&#39;t install</h2>
                    <p>Hello all, new to the insiders club. Definitely excited to try out some of the updates to bash on windows!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly I cannot get the update to install, it always seems to hang around 70-90 percent with KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE. I'm not entirely sure how I can help debug the issue. My hardware is an MSI GS70 (something like this&nbsp;https://www.msi.com/Laptop/gs70-2qe-stealth-pro.html#hero-overview)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess really my question is what should I do to help make this install happen?</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>Can you uninstall SonicWALL.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>After uninstalling SonicWALL and configuring a clean boot can you try the upgrade again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If successful reset the computer to start normally and you could try reinstalling SonicWALL.</p>

<h2>            Update Cortana</h2>
                    I have discussed this before and the community loved the ideas i had. I wanted to do another one but have it become much bigger so hopefully Microsoft sees this and actually makes it happen. My self and others want an actual AI yes this takes time yes
 i know it is not easy but we are able to do this maybe no something you see in robo cop, but perhaps start with something like allowing cortana to talk back to us learn our personality and respond accordingly. Or use the text to speech function and have her
 read to us, add a function via right click high light what you want and then click cortana read. That would make my day i love being read to, i love hearing stories just do not like to read . Something like this would be awesome&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-YbZdaALHE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-YbZdaALHE</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/F-YbZdaALHE?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/F-YbZdaALHE?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>

                    <p>Hey there, I am trying to fix a One Note issue were the account is not syncing and the user has information that has entered for over a month that has not synced. I may need to log them out. Will that erase the users data or keep it there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>They want to re-synce but we moved from one domain name to another, and that might be causing an issue right now with the users account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are not using OneNote 2016, there using OneNote for Windows 10</p>

            Hi Ryan,<br />
<br />
Generally, logging the account out will not lose notes.&nbsp;About the sync issue for the free OneNote version , you may try the following:<br />
<br />
Method A:<br />
Right click the notebook in OneNote -&gt; sync -&gt; sync this notebook<br />
<br />
Method B:<br />
1.Close the affected notebook in OneNote<br />
Note: before you close the notebook, you need to backup the notes written in OneNote client which are not synced to cloud in case of data loss. For the free OneNote, as it has no export function, you may copy and paste pages to another notebook temporarily
 as a backup<br />
2.Sign out your OneNote account and close the OneNote client<br />
3.Go to your cloud location -&gt; open the notebook in OneNote client again<br />
4.Paste back the notes backuped in step 1<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Sky

<h2>            Groups missing in Outlook desktop client program</h2>
                    
<p>Using Office 365 ProPlus "Outlook 2016". &nbsp;If I go to outlook.office365.com in a browser, I see I'm a member of two groups and can interact with them. I even have one of them synced the files, and use OneNote notebook with the group, etc.</p>
<p>But in the Outlook desktop client, the left nav bar groups section says that I have not joined any groups.</p>
<p>I've tried repairing office quick and full, and removing my account. How do I get Outlook to work with groups?</p>

<h2>            How to change a live.com email address to an outlook.com email address</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I tried to set up a new Outlook.com email address after reading the good review in the NY Times by Pogue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I couldn't figure out how to set up the new Outlook.com email address (after a lot of time); but did succeed in setting up a new Live.com email address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my question is how can I change this new Live.com email address to an Outlook.com email address?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll appreciate your help with this,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    I click next to the magnifying glass in the skype web interface where it says "search skype." I type in a username that someone tells me is theirs, so that I can then contact them through Skype, but then nothing shows up. Am I doing something wrong to

<h3> mikebe_464  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 freezes when opening On-Prem SharePoint 2016 Approval notification email.</h2>
                    <p>Outlook Build Version 1708 (Build 8431.2107 Click-to-Run)</p>
<p>SharePoint 2016 on premise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a SharePoint 2016 Approval workflow (or any workflow) is started and an email is sent to reviews (same domain), the email will freeze Outlook 2016. Outlook usually goes into Not Responding mode while the email is in the preview panel or a user clicks
 on the email. This will occur with the email in any folder (Inbox or Deleted Items). Outlook will eventually respond after 20-40 seconds and the notification email will display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions why this behavior is occurring?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible&nbsp; that some settings are affecting Outlook's performance and making it freeze up whenever you open a workflow. Just to confirm, did you make any changes to Outlook recently, before this started happening? What troubleshooting steps have you
 done so far?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, we suggest starting Outlook in safe mode by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close <strong>Outlook</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>outlook.exe /safe</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Close Outlook again and launch it normally to check if the issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In case starting Outlook in safe mode didn't help, follow the rest of the steps in this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/outlook-not-responding-stuck-at-processing-stopped-working-freezes-or-hangs-5c313d04-64af-4441-82d2-44e5a43eee5a?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> for what to do when Outlook hangs. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response and the results of the troubleshooting. </p>

<p>Thanks for getting back to me so soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We updated from Office Version 1705&nbsp;<span>(Build 16.0.8201.2200 Click-to-Run) and this is when the issue started.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We first noticed this in November of 2017 when we first tested the most current release. At that point we rolled back to Version 1705. The 1705 version does not freeze or go into Not Responding when viewing emails in the Conversation History folder or when
 previewing/opening emails from SharePoint on premises and SharePoint online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on our testing the Outlook freezing issue <strong>is not</strong> in Version 1705, but it is in later versions., including the current Version 1708, which we are testing now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have done everything in the linked article, including starting in safe mode, being on the latest version of Windows, did an Office Repair, did an OST repair, and created new profile. And we are still experiencing very poor performance and freezing when
 scrolling down the email preview window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are not seeing any performance issues or freezing using Outlook.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We appreciate the information you provided, Mike. Given all the troubleshooting steps you've done and the lengths you went through to test which versions of Outlook are affected, we suggest posting this on our Outlook UserVoice forums.&nbsp;Our developers and
 engineers would definitely benefit from learning about your findings about SharePoint workflows affecting Outlook's performance in the most recent build versions of Outlook 2016. You can visit the Outlook UserVoice forums and post your feedback through this

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For in-depth isolation purposes, we would need detailed scan of Outlook. To do this, download and use the Microsoft Office Configuration Analyser Tool (OffCAT) through this
 Office programs and what the likely causes of any issues are. After using it, please post screenshots of the results and include all the pertinent information so that we could study it.</p>

                    <p>I am learning VBA and trying to put what I learn to practical use.&nbsp; I have an XLSM that, upon closing, I would like to prompt to archive a file by name and date.&nbsp; However, when I close, the procedure gets stuck at the "ThisWorkbook.SaveAs" line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent over an hour trying to figure it out without success and am now reaching out.&nbsp; I'm sure someone will see the issue immediately.&nbsp; Following is the code:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub Workbook_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dim Msg As String<br />
Dim Ans As Integer<br />
Dim FName As String</p>
<p>
</p><p>Msg = "Would you like to file an archive copy of this file?"<br />
Ans = MsgBox(Msg, vbYesNo)<br />
If Ans = vbYes Then<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FName = "C:\Users\user name\Archive" &amp; ThisWorkbook.Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' The path&nbsp;will actually be a share-drive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ThisWorkbook.SaveAs "FILE NAME (" &amp; Format(Date, "YYMMDD") &amp; ").xlsx"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>End If</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I appreciate the assistance.</p>
<p>

<p>However, when I close, the procedure gets stuck at the "ThisWorkbook.SaveAs" line.</p>
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>The reason is that the file is already saved and all objects in Excel (Workbooks collection, ActiveWorkbook, etc.) point to this file.
</p>
<p>The .SaveAs does much more as just to create a copy on the hard disk, use VBA.FileCopy instead to avoid side effects.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the quick response.&nbsp; I apologize if I don't completely understand and maybe I'm not clear on what I'm trying to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When archiving the file, I would like to take the XLSM (with all its data) and archive it as an XLSX (with all its data).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to look at FileCopy but perhaps I'm not doing it correctly.&nbsp; If FileCopy is the better way to do, I'm fine with it, as long as I can have it archive in a different folder with a pre-determined name.&nbsp; Here's what I tried for FileCopy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dim SourceFile, DestinationFile As String<br />
SourceFile = "ORIGINAL FILE.xlsm"<br />
DestinationFile = "C:\Users\user name\Archive\" &amp; "NEW FILE NAME (" &amp; Format(Date, "YYMMDD") &amp; ").xlsx"<br />
Name "ORIGINAL FILE.xlsm" As "C:\Users\user name\Archive\" &amp; "NEW FILE NAME&nbsp;(" &amp; Format(Date, "YYMMDD") &amp; ").xlsx"</p>

            <p>FileCopy will require you to use the same extension as the original workbook.&nbsp; And since you want to save a copy of the workbook as an .xlsx workbook, maybe this will do...</p>

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim Msg As String<br />

</p><p>I certainly don't doubt your solution, as I think I can track everything.&nbsp; Interestingly, I am not getting prompted for a YES / NO decision.&nbsp; Instead, the file just closes.&nbsp; More importantly however, is that I am not finding any archived file anywhere.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried Application.EnableEvents = True without success.&nbsp; It still hangs up on the ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs line.&nbsp; I think most frustrating is there's quite a bit out there on this relatively easy action (for an experienced programmer, not me) yet it's getting
 stuck somewhere.&nbsp; Here's what I have now.</p>
<p>

 screen updating.</p>

            <p>Domenic,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the delay but our internet was down all day.&nbsp; Following are some answers to your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Yes, I was getting prompted for archiving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; If memory serves me correct, I think I tried Application.EnableEvents as both True and False (out of desperation).&nbsp; It was always getting hung up on the same line</p>

</p><p>ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs Filename:="C:\Users\scott.a.white\Test\Archive\NEW FILE NAME (" &amp; Format(Date, "YYMMDD") &amp; ").xlsx", FileFormat:=51 'xlOpenXMLWorkbook</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; I did want to avoid the Application.DisplayAlerts (just to close and archive based on a Yes answer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; I finally got it to work with the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Private Sub Workbook_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dim Msg As String<br />
Dim Ans As Integer<br />

Msg = "Would you like to file an archive copy of this dashboard?"<br />
Ans = MsgBox(Msg, vbYesNo)<br />
If Ans = vbYes Then</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sFile = "Visual Basic Workbook (" &amp; Format(Now, "YYMMDD") &amp; ").xlsx"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs Filename:="C:\Users\scott.a.white\Desktop\Test\Archive\" &amp; sFile, FileFormat:=51</p>
<p>
</p><p>End If</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you again for the help.&nbsp; I know its different (and I'm certainly not savvy enough with VBA to know why) but it does achieve what I was trying to do.</p>

<h2>            Password change made Impossible &#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I am desperately trying to change my password for my hotmail account.</p>
<p>--I have a secondary email as required for verification....</p>
<p>I click 'options/account/change password - then am asked to choose either a phone number or 2nd email account for a verification code to be sent to.&nbsp; I choose my secondary email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when I pick up the verification code from that secondary email account and enter it where prompted in the primary Hotmail account . . I am expecting to now be able to change my password.</p>
<p>But no.</p>
<p>When I go to the Change password option under account settings , I am again asked to provide a secondary address so that a verification code can be sent before I can make a password change:</p>
<p>------So I do the whole thing again, and then again....</p>
<p>So now I am going round and round in circles and getting exactly nowhere.</p>
<p>What the **** is going on ?? </p>
<p>
</p><p>It shouldn't be this difficult.&nbsp; Somebody please help because I am lost.</p>

            Its possible you have somehow been signed into the wrong Skype account.
<br />
<br />Try signing out, restart your computer, sign in again using the email address and password associated with your Skype ID.
<br />
<br />See if your contacts then show up.
<br />
<br />If they don't...
<br />
<br />Also sign into Skype for Web to confirm if you are still unable view your contacts to send messages.

<p>Hi Marios,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why Ford SYNC 2 couldn't recognize the USB Mobile Broadband stick. One of these may be due to your mobile broadband not being activated yet. For us to isolate this concern, we'd like to know if you've tried activating the USB broadband
 using a PC or laptop before connecting it to your Ford SYNC 2. If not, we recommend that you activate it first and make sure that it is working. If you already activated the USB Mobile broadband and still didn't work, we suggest that you contact the manufacturer
 of the device (Ford) for in-depth support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>If you were able to activate the USB Mobile Broadband using a computer and verified that it is working, but it won't work with your Ford SYNC 2, it would be best that you contact the manufacturer(Ford). By reaching out to them, they'll be able to verify
 the compatibility of your mobile broadband with the system.</p>

<h2>            Converting text boxes, tables, and picture into placeholders in a new layout</h2>
                    Hi there,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I didn't start out a new design with slide master, and now if I want to convert everything from a normal slide into layout, how do I do that?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For example, I copy the picture in slide, open the slide master, insert new layout, and paste the picture, there's no way I can convert the picture into a placeholder. I have to manually insert a new placeholder, make sure the size and position is correct,
 which is very tedious. Same goes for my text boxes, tables and etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a better way to do this? Thanks.</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            It's really not clear at all what you are trying to do.<br />
<br />
You cannot really convert a normal slide into a layout.<br />
<br />
Maybe you mean that you made your slides using a blank layout and now you want to apply a layout from the master with placeholders and have the pictures, tables and text
<b>IN</b> the new placeholders on the slides?? Whatever I doubt you want to be working on the Slide Master and pasting things in.<br />

            Hi John,
<div><br />
<div>Yes you're right in fact. At first there wasn't any thought of the slides being reuse many times, only after that I realized that it is needed and layout maybe a much better options than copy paste. Reason being I have many many different boxes at a specific
 location, all in a single slide, if only two or three then it'd be really easy to just fix new place holders over the existing text boxes or pictures.</div>
