<h2>            Cannot connect Microsoft Active Sync 4.5 to Nokia N 95 Mobile Phone</h2>
                    I have on the laptop Microsoft Active Sync4.5, but it doesn't get contact to the mobile phone. As a problem it says to syncronize e-mail,calender, appointemts... with your Pc, Microsoft Outlook XP(or later) must be installed. I have Outlook Express 6 and
 msn Outlook and XP on the laptop. I need the syncronizing only to install the windows 2,5 skype Program to the Nokia N 95, I have an other syncronizing Program from Nokia&nbsp;for other Programs. I have on the Phone USB connection on. I cannot use Bluetooth on
 the Laptop. I first took SP3 away, but it didn't help, now I have updated all again.

<p>Greetings AnnPaKu!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Total Access forums!<br />
<br />
You will need to install the OTA (Over The Air) CAB file installer for Skype.&nbsp; Check the Skype website for such a link and use that to install your program through your data connection.&nbsp; If you are trying to use ActiveSync because you do not have a data connection,
 then you'll need to download the file on a desktop computer and then transfer the data via your SD card...<br />

<h2>            How can I see the animation details from the Slide Master when in the Normal View&#63;</h2>
                    How can I see the animation details from the Slide Master when in the Normal View. In the Windows version of PowerPoint, the Normal View in the animation pane asks if you want to copy the Slide Master text animation into the animation pane. HOWEVER, when
 in the Mac Version 2011, the animation pane is blank, even when there is text animation placed in the Master Slide View. How can I see and modify the text animation in the Normal View when the text is pre-animated in the Master Slide view?

            <p>The Mac version of PowerPoint does not have the Copy Animation feature, so it works differently on the Mac. You can suggest to Microsoft that they add this feature by using the Send Feedback feature of the PowerPoint Help menu.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may be able to get around this limitation by making slide designs and choosing them as needed.</p>

<p>Hi Vipul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, there is no other Office 365 API which used to trace the status of a message, especially for SMTP reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's a regular mailbox, <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-and-request-read-receipts-and-delivery-notifications-a34bf70a-4c2c-4461-b2a1-12e4a7a92141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
read receipts and delivery notification</a>&nbsp;in Outlook client may meet your request. But if it isn't a regular mailbox, it's not allowed to configure your account in Outlook client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can check if the application you are using to send email from Office 365 has the similar function as my first reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

<h2>            External antenna port on the phone needed</h2>
                    <p>Does the WP7 phone specification allow for OEM phones to have an external antenna port on the phone?</p>
<p>If not then could this please be added to the specification, because Internet Tethering is not implemented in WP7.5 it is essential that external antenna be used to maximize Internet connection speed, many users are in poor or marginal reception areas and
 need this feature.</p>

            Internet Tethering is supported in Mango, it however requires a certain network chipset, as well as OEM and carrier support. Your best course of action would be to contact to the OEM and see what they're doing with Internet Tethering.<br />

            <p>Thanks, I understand that and my carrier supports it and my HTC Mozart supports the correct chipset&nbsp;but my real question is:</p>
<p>"Does the WP7 phone specification allow for OEM phones to have an external antenna port on the phone?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not just Internet Tethering that would benefit from an external antenna, as I've already said, many users are in poor/marginal reception areas and an external&nbsp;antenna is a requirement and should be supported in the WP7 specification.</p>

<br />
Um, again, that might be something to ask the OEM. I have not heard of accessories that you can connect directly to the phone. What about those extenders some carriers offer to extend coverage? Have you contacted your carrier to see if they carry those.<br />

<p><strong>"Does the WP7 phone specification allow for OEM phones to have an external antenna port on the phone?"&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In other words does the Microsoft Windows Phone7 specification preclude any OEM phone manufacturers from including an external antenna jack/port on their phone models?</p>
<p>If the WP7 specification does not include the option of allowing phone manufacturers to provide an external antenna jack/port on their phone models then I want to suggest that Microsoft amend the WP7 phone specifications to allow the phone manufacturers

<p><em>"What about those extenders some carriers offer to extend coverage?"</em></p>
<p>These are not allowed in my country, so have to&nbsp;use an external antenna.</p>
<p>Up until recently many mobile phones had an external antenna jack/port on their phone models (e.g. Nokia) and this becomes even more necessary when a reliable Internet connection is required while tethering.</p>
<p>The purpose of an external antenna jack/port on&nbsp;a phone is to improve the radio reception with the use of a seperate external antenna which in marginal or poor reception areas is often needed.</p>

I have a Windows Phone and work in remote areas. As soon as I can buy a Windows Phone with an external antenna I will be trading in my existing phone to a new one so I would like an answer to this question.

<p>=NETWORKDAYS(TODAY(),A1) will give you then number of days excluding Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
<p>There is also an option to refer to a list of holidays not to be included, see the help for NETWORKDAYS().</p>

<h2>            Confused about AutoSave in Word Documents and OneDrive</h2>
                    I uploaded a bunch of folders and their contents to OneDrive. Many of them contain Subfolders, many of which contain Word documents. When I make changes to a&nbsp;<em>local</em> document and save it, I want it to save to OneDrive as well. I believe this is
 done with turning Autosave to ON. But every time I do this (and select OneDrive as the destination), it doesn't overwrite the previously uploaded file (in a OneDrive subfolder), but creates a new one in the OneDrive Documents folder. Why? How to change?

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, if you are sure all the documents you need have been uploaded to OneDrive for business and you have synced them to your local computer, you can just delete the documents in local Documents folder,
 then open your documents via the local OneDrive sync folder. The AutoSave feature will work by this way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tried to answer a thread from a PDA running Windows Mobile. It didn't handle how this forum was using toolbar etc. Isn't it WM compatible this site ?? Strange..well, it could be the brand new device I used, but don't think so. A forum dedicated

    <title>how create loop through dates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmcmillan3  say:</h3>
<h2>            how create loop through dates</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to set up a subroutine to loop through dates (entered by parameters) to get counts by date. I can't see how to set up the dates though.&nbsp; I would enter a begindate of 01/01/2010 and an enddate of 05/01/2010 for example.</p>
<p>What would I put&nbsp;in place of &nbsp;"date()-273"&nbsp; in the code below?</p>
<p>Public Sub getcounts(begindate As Date, enddate As Date)</p>
<p>select date()-273 as TheDate, count(*) as nbr_pts<br />
from copy_of_pateints<br />
where date()-273 between admitdate and [d/c date]</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>Thanks for any ideas.</p>

<p>It's not quite that simple. First of all, what are you going to do with the records? Did you want to display them? If so, you would use a query, not loop through a table.</p>
<p>Perhaps if you stated what you were trying to accomplish we could better help you.</p>

<p>As Bill says, looping in code&nbsp;may well be the wrong tool; a Query would be simpler, if all you want to do is enter a beginning and end date and get a list of all the dates within that range with a count of patients admitted on that date:</p>
<p>SELECT admitdate, Count(*) AS nbr_pts FROM copy_of_patients WHERE admitdate BETWEEN [Forms]![myform]![txtStartDate] AND [Forms]![myform]![txtEndDate] GROUP BY admitdate;</p>

            It's not very clear just what results you want here, but I suspect it might be the number of patients present on each day in the range.&nbsp; If so then the easiest way is to first create a Calendar table, which is simply a table of al dates over a period.&nbsp;
 One way to do this is to serially fill down a column in Excel and then import the worksheet into Access as a table.&nbsp; Another is to use the following function:<br />
<br />
Public Function MakeCalendar_DAO(strTable As String, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dtmStart As Date, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dtmEnd As Date, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ParamArray varDays() As Variant)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Accepts:&nbsp; Name of calendar table to be created: String.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start date for calendar: DateTime.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End date for calendar: DateTime.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Days of week to be included in calendar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as value list, e,g 2,3,4,5,6 for Mon-Fri<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (use 0 to include all days of week)<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set dbs = CurrentDb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' does table exist? If so get user confirmation to delete it<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strTable &amp; "?", vbYesNo + vbQuestion, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Delete Table?") = vbYes Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "DROP TABLE " &amp; strTable<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Weekday(dtmDate) = varDay Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lngDayNum = lngDayNum + 1<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dbs.Execute strSQL<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next varDay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next dtmDate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
End Function<br />
<br />
To create a calendar from this year for ten years ahead you'd call the function like so:<br />
<br />
MakeCalendar_DAO "Calendar",#2010-01-01#,#2019-12-31#,0<br />
<br />
Once you have the calendar table you can then join it to the patients table in a query like so:<br />
<br />
PARAMETERS<br />
[Enter start date:] DATETIME,<br />
[Enter end date:] DATETIME;<br />
SELECT calDate, COUNT(*) As NumberOfPatients<br />
FROM copy_of_patients, Calendar<br />
WHERE Calendar.calDate BETWEEN<br />
copy_of_patients.admitdate AND copy_of_patients.[d/c date]<br />
AND Calendar.calDate BETWEEN <br />
[Enter start date:] AND [Enter end date:]<br />
GROUP BY calDate;<br />

<p>Thank you for providing the requested information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype <strong>v7.30</strong> is an outdated version of Skype application which would be one of the possible reasons why you cannot sign in to it. The latest version of the new Skype application is
<strong>v8.xx.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>For testing purposes, please try to uninstall and install the latest version of the Skype application. You may refer to this link for the steps:

<h3> lamarirwin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 randomly doesn&#39;t send email...sends in Safe mode</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 Pro 64-bit, Dell Latitude E6510, 8 GB RAM</p>
<p>Purchased the annual subscription a month ago for that version of Office 2013</p>
<p>all other internet and software functions without problems</p>
<p>I ran the Quick Repair of MS Office in the control panel</p>
<p><br />
A couple of weeks ago there was email that should have been sent in my Outbox. Talked to my host server and verified all the settings. Settings were accurate and had worked for the 90+ days I had used them in the trial of this software. When I restarted the
 computer it all sent.</p>
<p><br />
Then a couple more times when mail would not send, I rebooted and they sent. Error was about not being able to connect to the mail server.</p>
<p><br />
But, not tonight. Tonight's error message was: Sending' reported error (0x800CCC13) : 'Cannot connect to the network. Verify your network connection or modem.'</p>
<p><br />
[BTW, I tried a telnet command to see if the mail server was reachable but that command doesn't exist anymore. Anyone know a replacement or where I can learn about the new commands?]</p>
<p><br />
I opened it in Safe mode and the Outbox email was sent. However there's this slight question that since rebooting pc fixed the problem... it may have just been more stubborn and the first 2 reboots didn't fix it and this 1 restart did.</p>
<p><br />
Presuming this safe mode will keep working can you point me in the direction of what to look for to solve the problem? And, I couldn't find in MS Support any procedure for what to check when Outlook works in safe mode but not normal mode.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for any assistance...</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your reply. I wanted to make sure I had done my homework before replying.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Answers to your question:</div>
<div>1. POP3 email using both secure and unsecure connections verified with my host provider.</div>
<div>2. I've confirmed this behavior with several Outlook restarts: In normal mode it receives but does not send email (same error). In safe mode it receives and sends email.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Add-ins</b> - I only have added one from my Trend Micro - mentioned below</div>
<div>Active: Lync, Exchange, SharePoint, VBA, OneNote Notes, Social Connector 2013</div>
<div>Inactive:</div>
<div>MS Access</div>
<div>Send to Bluetooth</div>
<div>Trend Micro Anti-Spam Addin</div>
<div>Disabled:</div>
<div>Splashtop MetaData Sync Outlook Quickinfo Addin - Outlook had disabled it a while back because it started slowly (2652 seconds)</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Additional info</b>: This problem may have started once I purchased the annual subscription.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I have 2 programs listed in control panel:</p>
<p>MS Office Professional Plus 2013 - was what I downloaded for my 90 day trial</p>
<p>MS Office 365 Home Premium - I guess this was installed when I bought annual subscription</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3 days ago when I opened MS Word I unexpectedly saw a screen that was like the screen when the subscription product key was first entered. BUT it refers to the MSO Pro Plus 2013???</p>
<p>Dialog box for that:</p>
<p>Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013</p>
<p>&nbsp;Configuration Progress</p>
<p>&nbsp;(progress scale)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Configuring Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope that helps to clarify</p>

            It will be best if you uninstall the trial Office 2013 suite and check if that resolves the issue.

<div>As it seems to be an issue conflicting between two versions of Office installed.</div>

            Pardon my delay in this...
<div>This problem got 'solved' by the new 1 TB hard drive I put in the laptop failing. So, when I get that laptop back together again I'll at least be starting from scratch. Fingers crossed.</div>

            I had the same problem, i.e. ramdomly sending emails. In addition, the character set was wrong in the sent email, resulting in regional characters to be unreadable by the receiver. I tried for hours different settings, running in save mode, etc.<br />
<br />
And hopefully this post highlighted my problem:<br />
- I used the Outlook Professional Plus 2013 for 2 months<br />
- I bought the Outlook Family and Small Business 2013 (not the 365)<br />
<br />
I realized that the Professional Plus version was still in the Program Manager. After removing it (and restoring my shortcuts that disappeared), everything seems fine ...<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
I can also add that it was a nightmare to buy it, the internet connection failed all the time, therefore I bought a key from an internet website, and finding the way to install took my a while, and the install it-self too. I probably spent half a day and 15
 reboots before looking as finished. Of course I'm unable to give any advise, it was just a nightmare!<br />

    <title>Word 2007 Index Compilation Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> writer2012  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2007 Index Compilation Problem</h2>
                    <p>I have written a book and I am in the process of publishing it with an index. I have methodically gone through the book to add index entries with sub-entries in Times New Roman 12pt type. I did some of the entries with "Mark All" but many of them I Marked
 individually, because of the sub-entries. When I compiled the index the first time, I'm having several challenges in correcting it:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Many of the entries are separated on different lines even though they are identical entries as far as I can tell.
</li><li>Some entries come out bolded, italicized, or different fonts even though I did not mark them that way. I have meticulously gone though and made many corrections, but no matter what I do, I cannot change some of the entries.
</li><li>Some of the entries in the index have commas after them and others do not. I want to make them consistent

 I thought the index would take out duplicate entries on the same page. My index doesn't do that. Even after making corrections and recompiling it multiple times, I still have separate entries for the same page right under the one above.
</li></ol>
<p>I appreciate any assistance to help me get through these corrections.<br />

            <p>I have experienced many of the same problems you report, and in some cases no cause could ever be determined (I ended up having to unlink the index and edit by hand). I later decided perhaps the document was damaged (you might try using Open and Repair to
 see if this makes any difference). A few tips, though:</p>
<ol>
<li>When entries that you believe should be grouped appear separately, the difference may be in a stray space in one of the index entries. Try copying one of the entries and pasting it into the other location.
</li><li>When entries have unwanted formatting, select the corresponding XE field and press Ctrl+Spacebar to remove any direct formatting. Disregard the fact that an XE field itself may be bold, italic, or in a different font;
 as long as this is the formatting of the paragraph it is in (the Default Paragraph Font), it will not be picked up by the index.
</li><li>If you have made sure that the XE fields themselves don't contain commas, then this is difficult to explain. Is it possible that when you selected text to mark it, a comma was included?
</li><li>My experience is that Word ignores duplicate entries on the same page even when it is isn't really the same page. That is, if I have an entry on page 4 and also one on page iv of the front matter, only one will be
 listed; this is very annoying, but it is also proof that what you have read is the way Word is supposed to work.</li></ol>

    <title>Filtering or Sorting columns causes message&#58; enter parameter value - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karenbeavercreek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Filtering or Sorting columns causes message&#58; enter parameter value  .fileURL</h2>
                    <p>A new bug has popped in Access 2010.&nbsp; I commonly link or import tables from an Oracle database using ODBC, and</p>
<p>after I upgraded to Access 2010 I now get error messages asking me to "Enter a Paramter value for Table.ColumnName.fileURL".This happens when I try to sort or &nbsp;filter certain columns in my table.</p>
<p>At first I noticed this for columns with a datatype of Decimal 1.&nbsp; When I changed the 1 to a 2 and saved the table, the problem was fixed.</p>
<p>Now it happens with other datatypes, most recently Double precision type.&nbsp; This is a bug of some sort, and makes working with Access impossible if I have to go into design mode for each table and convert datatypes.&nbsp; This never happened in Access 2007.&nbsp; I
 am an experienced Access user and developer, and am perplexed by this error.&nbsp; Any fixes on the way from Microsoft.&nbsp; Maybe a HotFix I dont know about?&nbsp; This is a serious error.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Thanks for any tips, tricks, or solutions!!</p>

            I had this issue and just a Compact and Repair fixed this issue. If you don't do an explicit Compact and Repair by clicking on the button and create an ACCDE, it will still show this error. It's very odd indeed. I've developed with MS Access for 24 years
 and only saw this problem today. I don't think it has anything to do with data types.

            <p>Mike, in my experience this happened to me once in a MS Access&nbsp;2010&nbsp;app that I created and have been using for 18 months. Front and back end is MS Access 2010 32-but running on Windows 7. My app does a compact and repair on close but the issue was only resolved
 when I clicked on the Compact &amp; Repair button. Also my issue popped up when opened a form that was sorted in the form designer. So maybe open your form, sort it to get the error and then close and save&nbsp;it. Will it give you the Error when you open it now? Also,
 is the rowsource for the form a table or a query? Is the underlaying data Oracle or Access? Does the table have a primary key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide as much detail as you can. If you can share the app then that would be even better.</p>

 in all connecting modes like PC Suite, Mass storage, etc.&nbsp;and the same,&nbsp;reset the phone, and same again, restart pc, restart the phone, even one tip on this page that says remove the PC from the cocket and press the On/Off buton 4-5 times to remove all the

<p>I had the same problem. Solved by e-mailing nokia technical support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There appears to be some conflict between the PC Suite and Nokia Updater Software on Windows XP. When I only installed the Nokia Software Updater on a separate machine without installing the PC Suite, my XpressMusic 5800 was recognised first time and the
 firmware&nbsp;update progressed without a hitch when before it was impossible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the necessary drivers&nbsp;are included on the Nokia Software Updater so you don't need to install any cable drivers separately. Also, the Connectivity Cable (CA-101D) that is included in the box is all you need to connect to the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have already installed PC Suite, use the Uninstaller Software from nokia to&nbsp;remove the PC Suite software and then reinstall the Nokia Software Updater program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download Nokia PC Suite Cleaner 3:</p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/get-support-and-software/download-software/nokia-pc-suites/how-to/nokia-pc-suite-cleaner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/get-support-and-software/download-software/nokia-pc-suites/how-to/nokia-pc-suite-cleaner</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to tech support, if the software update succeeds, you can then install the PC suite for other features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ps</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have assumed you've checked that your USB port on the PC is working and that you have allowed the connection to PC Suite on your Xpress5800 when the "pop-up" screen appears on the phone when you first plug in the USB cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my case, I could still sync with PC Suite but could not update my firmware as Nokia Software Updater keeps saying that the Xpress5800 was not recognised.</p>

<p><em>Hi,</em> thnx for your post first, even though there was no result, but i believed this would work too. as i read you part that says<em>"I have assumed you've checked that your USB port on the PC is working and that you have allowed the connection to
 PC Suite on your Xpress5800 when the "pop-up" screen appears on the phone when you first plug in the USB cable"</em> i realized&nbsp;two things and first,&nbsp;should&nbsp;i allow the connection between PC Suite in Xpreess5800 and how is that done, in the&nbsp;connectivity&nbsp;mine
 says USB Not Connected when i enter that&nbsp;it has USB Connection which is&nbsp;in PC Suite mode, and Ask on connection which i set to&nbsp;No, and second thing is the
<em>"pop-up screen appears on the phone when you first plug in the USB cable" </em>
in mine nothing happens or changes on the phone screen, whatsoever, nothing except the message in the low right corner&nbsp;in the PC Screen that says, "USB Device Not Recognized",&nbsp;so could this still mean that the cable is faulty, even though it shows the message
 as soon as i connect it in both ends.</p>

<p>If your PC and 5800 are both new, then chances are that the drivers for PC Suite have not installed correctly. Hence, the 5800 is not recognised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uninstalling PC Suite using the PC Suite Cleaner and then installing the Nokia Software Updater only may help to resolve this issue. Update the phone firmware first and then only install the PC Suite software again. This should work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the firmware update will retain all your pre-existsting information on the phone. However, I always perform a full back-up before I upgrade my firmware, just in case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good-luck.</p>

<p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Quite interesting your posts.&nbsp; My problem is similar, but a little bit different.&nbsp; I have got a Nokia 5800 EM for me and a 6210 Navigator for my wife.&nbsp; Then:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Whe installed my 5800 with USB cable provided CA-101D (latest Nokia PC Suite), everything went just fine.&nbsp; I mean, all types of connection, synch, etc.</p>
<p>- Now I want to maje my wife's mobile be connected also and: I find out that:</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Nokia 6210 Navigator does not connect with USB Cable CA-101 provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Nokia 6210 Navigator does not connect with USB Cable CA-101D</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Nokia 5800 EM does not connect with USB Cable CA-101.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, the only connection working fine is 5800 EM with CA-101D.&nbsp; In any other cases, my PC (Windows XP by the way) doesn't recognize it has something conected...&nbsp; and I don't want to lose that connection!!!!&nbsp; Anyway, since I want both my phones connected with
 the CA-101 (a lot more comfortable) and I want to install some things on my wife's 6210 Navigator, I will do what you recommend (uninstall PC-Suite, run Cleaner, installa Nokia SW Updater, and re-install PC-Suite) and let you know.</p>
<p>If this works... well, I'll let you know.</p>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Follwing my last post, here's the update (what I did and results):</p>
<p>- Used Cleaner to cleanup everything left from previous PC Suite</p>
<p>- Unloaded Noki SW Updater under 5800 XM link and also under 6210 link.&nbsp; They're probably the same, as the name's the same (I had to rename), but just in case.</p>
<p>- Installed the first one (5800) and restarted</p>
<p>- I connected my 5800 XM device with both cables (CA-101 and CA-101D) and recognized both!!!!&nbsp; (an advance).&nbsp; No way 6210 is detected.</p>
<p>- I installed the other SW Updater (kind of the same) and it gave the message it was "repairing" the installation.&nbsp; So it was for sure the same file.</p>
<p>- I restarted.&nbsp; About 5800 XM, again the same result: works with any USB cable.</p>
<p>- I connected my 6210 through CA-101 in other USB port than I have been using for these tests and my PC recognized the phone!!!&nbsp; BUT JUST ONCE&nbsp; :-(</p>
<p>- Never again did my PC recognize my Nokia 6210 Nav.&nbsp; Tried with both cables and all of the USB ports.</p>
<p>- I finally installed PC-Suite again (v7.1.26.0) and, of course, my 5800 XM still gets connection with any of both cables and in any port, but 6210 Nav. doesn't get connected again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my situation is a little bit better, because I can connect my Nokia 5800 XM with CA-101 USB cable (longer cable, so more comfortable for my desktop PC), but still cannot connect my wife's Nokia 6210 Navigator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea????&nbsp; Tks in advance.</p>

<p>Hello, first i thank you all for posting your thoughts, and second, i found the solution, and it is fixed now, for the first time i connected my phone to the pc, and the problem was the pirate (Fake cable CA 101), where i suspected was the post from you
 Maspen&nbsp;in which you mentioned the pop up screen on the phone and that's what i didn't see at all, even though i was thinking that the cable&nbsp;is ok, because it reacted on the&nbsp;PC&nbsp;when i used to connect&nbsp;it,&nbsp;when i went to change the cable, the guy in the shop
 said it is the same and the same thing goes on the PC screen when you connect them, that (USB Device Not Recognized) but what was the difference with the new cable, the pop-up screen appeared on the phone right away,&nbsp;and that's changed my mind so i took the
 new cable and did everything again from the beggining, so i uninstalled PC Suite, and installed it again, and connected through the USB Port behind the computer not on the hub as it is faster, and it works perfectly, i installed: Rotary dialer, Touch Guitar,
 and other new games and apps.</p>
<p>Hope this helps to solve anyones prblem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey, farton, good for you!&nbsp; Unfortunately, my problem's not the cable.&nbsp; Bboth my cables CA-101 and CA-101D work fine with my 5800 XM, but none of them works with 6210 Nav. (no popup window at the phone).&nbsp; I'm thinking there might be an incompatibility with
 having both devices connected to the same PC...</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010- category problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arsalan sadri  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010- category problem</h2>
                    <div>
<p><span>I have created some colour categories and assigned them to some items in Calendar in Outlook. Then I renamed some of those categories and therefore the new names appear on all the corresponding affected items.</span></p>
<p><span>However, I noticed that as soon as the next synchronization is done, all changes that I have made will be reversed i.e. both the old and the new names are now shown. In other words, all affected items have now 2 categories, under the new name and under
 the old name.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, I’ve renamed the colour category "NHS" to "RB-NHS". In this case, the old name is still there with no colour:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~sadria/rename.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~sadria/rename.png</a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Both categories NHS and RB-NHS will be shown on the all items that have been already affected.
</span><span>When I click on Categorize you will see it in the list followed by "Not in the master category list".</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~sadria/list.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~sadria/list.png</a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Even if I uncheck the box next to it, it will be removed instantly, but as soon as next synchronization is done, it will be back there.
</span><span>This is really annoying. </span></p>
<p><span>My understanding is that once a category is created and assigned to an item, it can no longer be deleted or renamed. It will be always shown on all the items that are affected.&nbsp;</span><span>If my understanding is correct, this is clearly a bug in Outlook
 and should be fixed by an update from Microsoft. The user “must” be able to “permanently” delete or rename a category such that it no longer appears there.
</span><span>And if my understanding is not correct, how can this problem be solved?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards</span></p>
<p><span>Arsalan</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 'not in&nbsp; master list' is correct - the sync merges the server copy with the local copy and the old name isn't in the master list but is on the item.

            <p>I'll bring it to the attention of the connector group but note that Hotmail doesn't use or understand categories. Categories are a blob of data to hotmail. When you change the category name in Outlook and sync up, it sees the updated item and merges instead
 of replaces. If you make the change on the item directly -&nbsp; make a new category, add it to the item and remove the old one from the item -&nbsp;it should work as expected.

            I am having this problem, too, and not through using Hotmail.&nbsp; I can't seem to permanently assign a name to a category or a particular color in my Outlook mail that I use at work.&nbsp; This is not web-based; it is just using Outlook 2010 on my work computer.&nbsp;
 It is extremely annoying and completely eviscerates the usability of categories.

<h2>            Antivirus and windows defender problems.</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so I downloaded Norton Antivirus 2 months ago. Ever time I log in Windows 10 asks me which firewall I want to use along with telling me that windows defender needs to scan my PC.&nbsp;A hand would be really helpful.</p>

<h2>            MSN home loads blank unless I use in private and then hit the home icon</h2>
                    This is on my wife's laptop, an ASUS G75V.&nbsp; When she was on the computer this morning the home page stopped loading.&nbsp; If you start explorer with the "e" icon a blank page loads even though the address window shows "MSN.com"&nbsp; If she opens explorer as an
 "In Private" session and then taps the home icon, MSN will load.&nbsp; I've never run into this before and cannot figure out how to fix it.&nbsp; Any ideas would be appreciated.

            <p>It was the strangest problem.&nbsp; If we went to homepage under "in private browsing" MSN would load, and we could go to any other web address and that would load, but click the homepage icon outside of "in private browsing" and MSN would be a blank page.&nbsp; I
 tried to reset IE and that made no difference.&nbsp; I tried the trouble shooter and that didn't work.&nbsp; I even upgraded to IE10 and still the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My solution that finally worked was to spend several hours doing the recovery disks.&nbsp; I hope that problem never happens again.</p>

            Redoing the OS isnt a viable option.&nbsp; As I recall, both ASUS and Dell use a manufacturer specific MSN.&nbsp; I can see now that mine doesn't show as manufacturer specific now.&nbsp; I'd bet the problem lies there.

            <p>My Silverlight&nbsp;is <span>Installed version: 4.1.10329.0.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I can't see how that matters.&nbsp; It works in protected mode and not in 'regular mode.'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Her is what I did to get ride of the problem:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>- Brought up IE - msn home page loads but is completely blank.</span></p>
<p><span>- opened a new tab</span></p>
<p><span>- clicked on browse in private</span></p>
<p><span>- clicked Home on in private browser, msn page showed fine.</span></p>
<p><span>- used options to change my home page to <a href="http://msnmember.msn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://msnmember.msn.com/</a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>All works AOK now, except of course its "msnmember.msn.com" and not msn.com.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It is pretty obvious to me that this issue coincided with the final phase out of MSN and migration of hotmail to outlook.&nbsp; I just wished someone at Microsoft would be able to answer questions and save me the time of figuring things like this out.</span></p>

            <p>Dear Sandeep,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry, but your advice is not good.&nbsp; I don't get that error <strong>Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage</strong>, its obviously a problem with IE and MSN as I said earlier.&nbsp; Wrecking configuration that took a long time to accumulate or reloading
 the OS are not very customer-friendly options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe MS should research a problem and fix it rather than give cookbook answers that cause consumer pain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            Your home computer would have to be running to do this. <br />
<br />
Use this option. It does to require Entourage to be open: (edited for clarity)<br />
<br />
Log into your Hotmail account and have it forward your emails to your account. Your account needs to be POP-enabled.<br />
<br />
On the top right under your Profile | Log out<br />
<br />
Options &gt; More Options &gt; Managing your account &gt; Sending/receiving email from other accounts<br />
<br />
Now you can use your browser to view your email in Hotmail.<br />

<p><span>Hi raquibraihan,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Proper configuration of your account is needed in the Outlook application for the Windows Security not to appear. If you are using an Exchange account, we suggest that you unchecked
 “Always prompt for logon credentials” in your Outlook Account Settings. Here are the steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open <em>Outlook</em>, go to <strong>File</strong> tab &gt; <strong>Info</strong> &gt;
<strong>Account Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Account Settings</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Highlight your account and click <strong>Change</strong> button.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>More Settings</strong> button and go to the <strong>Security</strong> tab.
</span></li><li><span>Under the <em>User Identification</em>, make sure the <strong>Always prompt for logon credentials</strong> option is not selected and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Relaunch Outlook and check if the issue persists. </span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using other types of email server, please make sure that you have ticked the option “Remember password” on your Account Settings.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open <em>Outlook</em>, go to <strong>File</strong> tab &gt; <strong>Info</strong> &gt;
<strong>Account Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Account Settings</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Highlight your account and click <strong>Change</strong> button.</span></li><li><span>Under <em>Logon Information</em>, tick <strong>Remember password</strong> and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Once it’s completed, click <strong>Close</strong> and <strong>Finish</strong>.
</span></li><li><span>Close all of the windows including Outlook app, relaunch it and check if the issue resolves.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you continue to have this issue even after performing the above steps, please reply to this thread. The system will notify me so I can get back to you and provide you more answers.</span></p>
