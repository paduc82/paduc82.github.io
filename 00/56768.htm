            <p>Hi Diana206,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to ask the following questions so we can fully understand the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the issue occur when launching or when you are doing something on Photo Gallery?
</li><li>What are the steps you have taken on solving the issue? </li><li>What is you operating system? </li><li>What is the version of your Photo Gallery? (You can check this by pressing <strong>
ALT</strong> and <strong>F</strong> simultaneously and click <strong>About Photo Gallery</strong>.)</li></ul>
<p>In the meantime, I suggest that you repair Photo Gallery as an initial troubleshooting. Here's how:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;Press
<strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>R</strong>, input <strong>AppWiz.cpl</strong>, click
<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
2. Select <b>Windows Essentials 2012/Windows Live Essentials</b>, click <b>Uninstall/Change</b> -or-
<b>Remove</b>.<br />
3. Click <strong>Repair all Windows Essentials Programs</strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Furthermore, based on the error you have given, we can try fixing this by changing your UAC settings. Kindly follow the steps below:</span></p>

            Hello Richard,<br />
<br />
I have restarted my computer and the photo gallery program works now. I just need to know how to get the pictures and videos back. This is what I have done: start&gt;computer&gt;search .jpg this brought me to some of the deleted pictures. I also searched .mpg and
 got some of the videos back. I saved the pictures and videos in folders. I do not know where the rest are, could you please help me with that? To answer your last 2 questions, the operating system is Windows 7 and the version is Windows Live Photo Gallery
 2011.<br />

            <p>Hi Diana206,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since there are a lot of file formats for both video and photos, then you may try searching .PNG, BMP and GIF for the photos then .MPEG, .AVI, .WMV and&nbsp;.MP4 for the videos.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are still unable to search for the deleted files then you may opt to do System Restore. You may also post your question to our Windows Support forum found on the link below:</p>

            Battlefield Bad Company 2 is very compatible with Windows7 and Windows7 is one of the minimum requirements to play BC2. In order to update, you need a hardwired internet connection. Sometimes it will update several times. After one update completes, it
 will tell you an update is required in order to play. The first update didn't fail, its just that the updates need to install in order. If you are just installing BC2 you might need as many as six updates.

            What a novel idea, Afzal Taher. The only problem is that BC2 was released in March of 2010 and designed for use with Windows7.

<p>Hello Boss, long time, no see!</p>
<p>There are two ways to install BC2 when you enter the activation code; 1) Activate using disk &nbsp;2) Activate on-line. &nbsp;The advantage to activating using the on-line method is that you are permitted to install your copy on ten different PCs and is why I chose
 to do it that way. The game doesn't update every time that you play, but it does always check for updates before you start. I'm not sure if it does this if you do a disk activation. What the game does is automatically install any new patches available when
 it finds them. I don't know how large they are. I didn't play for almost a month and it updated three times before I could play. After it updated it notified me that I needed an update in order to play, again, and again. Where it gets confusing is that it
 updates MP and SP at the same time, with the SP update panel covering an identically sized MP panel. I thought the update stopped responding and then noticed the task bar had two updates listed so I used my mouse to 'drag' the SP panel and uncover the MP update
 that was still running.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The owners of the previous edition of Battlefield: Bad Company did some complaining about BC2 but I like it. It took me some getting used to as I was more familiar with the Modern Warfare games. BC2 is a lot less linear and you can make your own path if
 need be. In MW and MW2 if you shoot at a door or wall the bullets only leave marks. In BC2 you can shoot a door and it will shatter and you can enter a building. The enemy can do the same. What was once a good wall to hide behind can get demolished by a tank
 round, so the game is always changing and is never the same twice. At the same time, if you're not careful, the whole building can collapse on you. This is why I like it, it keeps you thinking and rethinking your tactics.</p>
<p>I can legally license eight more computers. So if you can find a bit-torrent download, send me an e-mail at live-dot-com and I'll send you a key.&nbsp;</p>

            My PC is hardwired to the router and always has access, so I don't know what would happen as I've never tried or had the service go down. I can give it a try a little later and let you know. My internet package started as 5/1 Mb/s with unlimited access.
 Every time FIOS changes their cable channel lineup I have to get a more expensive package so that I don't lose some of my favorite channels. In order to get a better price, I'm always nudged into upgrading my internet. Right now I'm at 25/25 Mb/s and paying
 $105 USD per month. I'm far from being wealthy but since my residence is in an old apartment with lots of interference and sits in a depression (around 75 feet below street level) I don't really have any other choice. There has been talk of late about an interactive
 satellite dish service that would allow two-way data transmission but no word on cost or availability. I know what you mean about dial-up service. Although I have the 25/25, when I had to use Steam to reload MW2 after a system cra

<p>Alternatively you could switch from Cox email to Gmail IMAP service. IMAP is nice because it perfectly syncs email between multiple devices like desktops, laptops, smart phones, etc. I use a Gmail account between my laptop and an iPod Touch device for my
 MSFT-MVP email.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade Bug - Password Incorrect</h2>
                    I have upgraded my laptop to Windows 10 and now my password will not work to log into windows. &nbsp;I have not forgotten my password, caps lock is not on, function key is working properly...I have changed my password via the directions with no resolve. &nbsp;I
 called Microsoft and was told by the representative after trying to fix the problem that this was a known issue. &nbsp;This was two days ago and now the Microsoft phone number does not connect me. &nbsp;I have a presentation on Thursday and of course the only copy is
 on the hard drive. &nbsp;Please help, I can not even restore the computer or get into any startup settings without the password.&nbsp;

Have you recently added Window Blinds or ANY Stardock application?<br />

player recently or an addon for WMP?<br />

    <title>Does new surface pen &#40;without a clip&#41; tilt functionality work - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Does new surface pen &#40;without a clip&#41; tilt functionality work on Surface Book and other&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>I could&nbsp;not get the new pen's tilt functionality to work on my Surface Book. I tried it in Photoshop and Clip Studio. My Surface
 Book is up to date with all the updates available as of today Feb 2 2018.</span><br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft site(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/accessories/surface-pen) states that the new Surface Pen with tilt function is compatible with the following devices:<br />
</p>
<p><span>Surface Studio</span><span>Surface
 Laptop</span><span>Surface Book&nbsp;2</span><span>Surface
 Book</span><span>Surface Pro<span>1</span></span><span>Surface
 Pro 4</span><span>Surface Pro 3</span><span>Surface
 3</span></p>
<p><span>So
 what is going on? Does the tilt functionality work on the listed devices or not? If yes, how to get it to work?</span></p>
<p>Tilt functionality is the only reason I spent 100$ for a new pen!</p>

Programs (for the most part) do not roam with a user in an active directory environment.&nbsp; Some small ones (portable apps) could be made to do so - although since you would have to download and upload those files each logon/logoff - there is a tradeoff.&nbsp; There
 are other things you could do with other tools to make this happen, however.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
What about the question I asked - what version of Windows 7 do you have on everything?&nbsp; Is it Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate edition (if not - you cannot JOIN an active directory domain.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
The macbook could be made to 'authenticate' off the active directory domain - but it's not going to do all the tricks the WIndows systems will do.&nbsp; Pretty much you get central authentication.&nbsp; ;-)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
A windows laptop is no different than a windows desktop as far as Windows itself is concerned.&nbsp; You might have to configure the wireless devices differently (so you can be connected without being logged in) or tweak a few other things - but only because you
 might be using wireless networking as opposed to wired.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Admin rights - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Admin rights</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just started using Windows 10 and I'm having issues with giving my account admin rights. I have a local account at the moment.</p>
<p>Under Settings &gt; Accounts, I don't have the option to add family &amp; members. When I try to manage my Microsoft account online and add a family member, I'm asked to enter a phone number, but nothing actually happens. I tried it several times with two different
 cell numbers.</p>
<p>Could anyone please help?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance!</p>

<h2>            Login problem with no internet connection.</h2>
                    <p><em><strong>Original title</strong></em>: Login problem </p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot login for some reason to my windows 10.&nbsp; When I enter my password it says its invalid.&nbsp; I also seem to have no internet access.&nbsp; Since I cant get past the sign in screen I have no way of fixing the internet.&nbsp; It just says no connection is available.&nbsp;
 I know there are connections as I am able to use all my other devices.&nbsp; So then I tried to reset my password from another device, but of course without having internet access the computer with the login problem doesn't know I have reset the password.&nbsp; Is there
 a way to either get past the login screen, add another user without signing in or fix my internet connection from the login screen.&nbsp; Can someone please help me?&nbsp; My computer is virtually dead as is.&nbsp; I cant sign in, I cant do anything!&nbsp; I checked to make sure
 the password had been reset and I can login to my outlook.com account no problem from another device using the new password.&nbsp; that is when I realized that the reason it isn't resetting on the computer I am locked out of is that I have no internet access.&nbsp;
 At least that's what I am thinking.&nbsp; I tried safe mode but of course without being able to login that still doesn't help.</p>

<p><span><span>Once the bootable media is created, follow next step:</span></span></p>

<h2>            Multiple Dell XPS 15 issues - Looking to return laptop unless solved</h2>
                    <p><span>I am currently working to return this laptop, but will cease my efforts if I'm able to resolve these glitches. I&nbsp;</span><span><span>NEVER</span></span><span>&nbsp;had issues with my last
 two Macbooks. This computer is way too expensive to be having these issues. I would appreciate any direction in helping to cure these issues.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue #1:</strong> PIN when logging in from sleep mode has an error message that states:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Something went wrong (Code: 0x8009002d). Restart your device to see if that fixes the problem.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue #2:</strong> Scrolling on Chrome/online is very lagged and makes for an incredibly frustrating web browsing experience</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue #3:</strong> Sound when playing music on Spotify freezes for 1-3 seconds once every few songs and makes a weird warped noise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue #4:</strong> <strong><em>(RESOLVED)</em></strong> Computer would not hold an internet connection out of the box and therefore needed to be returned to receive an Intel replacement wifi card.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I solved issue 1 by updating my tpm firmware. This firmware update is provided by Dell on their website when navigating to the drivers and software section for your XPS 15.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are the steps I followed: </p>
<p>1. Create a bootable DOS usb drive. (This is to install the tpm firmware for reasons elaborated on below). Search for "Create a bootable DOS usb drive" on google to find a plethora of guides on how to do this.</p>
<p>2. Copy tpm.exe (name will be something arbitrary) downloaded from Dell onto the bootable usb. Keep note of the name of this file as you will need to execute it later.</p>
<p>3. Clear the TPM of current ownership. I am not sure as to the implications of this clear, but I cleared mine and nothing went horribly wrong. Again, type "Clear the TPM of current ownership" into google to find some guides on how to do this.</p>
<p>4. Computer will restart as part of ownership clearing process. DO NOT SIGN BACK IN. I found that signing back in automatically assigned ownership to the TPM, and so the installation of firmware would not complete. Instead, restart again and boot into the
 bootable DOS usb created earlier.</p>
<p>5. Once booted into the usb, type the name of the executable of the tpm.exe you copied earlier and hit enter. If you forgot the name of the executable, type "dir" (without quotes) into the console to list all folders and files in the directory.</p>
<p>6. Let the magic happen</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Where is DCA&#63;</h2>
                    I have a new computer with WINDOWS 8 PRO.&nbsp; Got the WMC feature.&nbsp; Loaded it and am trying to set it up with my Hauppauge 2650 Cable Card Tuner (which worked fine on my WINDOWS 7 machine).&nbsp; During setup, it asked me to run DCA.&nbsp; It was not in the EXTRAS
 gallery, but when I try to install it from the setup process it says that it is already loaded.&nbsp; Where is it?&nbsp; How do I run it?&nbsp; It will not let me install it because "it is already installed", but it does not appear in EXTRAS.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; It does appear in control

            <p>Hi videogreg,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Digital Cable Advisor is in the Extras Gallery in Windows Media Center in Windows 8.
</p>
<p><span><br />
<span><span>a. </span></span><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X </strong>key and click
<strong>Control Panel.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>b. Go to<strong> Programs and Features</strong>. Then see if it shows <strong>
Digital Cable Advisor is installed</strong>. </p>
<p>c. If it's <strong>installed</strong>, right click and select “<strong>repair</strong>”.&nbsp;<span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note: </strong>I would also advise to see if the cable tuner is on the Windows 8 Compatibility List. You can also try&nbsp;getting a firmware update from the manufacturer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>You can also see the screen shot below which show's Digital Cable Advisor in the Extras Gallery.</span><span><br />

 "install disc" first.&nbsp; Well when he tried to install the install disc, he kept getting the message " Grand Theft Auto V requires a one time 8GB installation on an XBOX 360 hard drive or XBOX 360 formatted USB 2.0 flash drive".&nbsp; So can someone tell me what
 I need to do from here?&nbsp;&nbsp; It is hard not being where the game and console is to diagnose and fix the problem.&nbsp; I figured that is where you smart people will come in.&nbsp; Can anyone help me to troubleshoot this?&nbsp; I had him send me a pic of the console, so maybe
 you guys could tell me if this version of the game has a hard drive or if the problem could be there is not enough memory to download the install disc........HELP&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; Putting the content that's in this game in a 10 year-old's hand is borderline criminal and at least grossly irresponsible.&nbsp; It's more hard-core than a lot of R-rated movies.&nbsp; Would you sit him down to watch Scarface?</p>

<p>The message displayed is telling you exactly what the problem is:</p>
<p>" Grand Theft Auto V requires a one time 8GB installation on an XBOX 360 hard drive or XBOX 360 formatted USB 2.0 flash drive". &nbsp;</p>
<p>-the message is specifically stating that 8GB worth of Hard Drive space is required to play the game. What you should inquire with your son is if he has an 8GB Hard Drive for his Xbox 360. If he does not, he will need to do one of the following:</p>
<p>1) Get an 8GB HDD</p>
<p>2) Get a USB with 8GB Storage Space</p>
<p>Umm, I don't see a picture. I'm not sure if you can post pics on this particular forum (I tried once and I don't think it worked).</p>
<p>In order to diagnose your son's HDD capacity, he needs to go to SYSTEM SETTINGS-&gt;STORAGE. There should be a value that shows how much HDD space is available. If it is less than 8GB, this is why your son is getting this message when he tries to install the
 disc. Unless he frees up the space, gets a bigger HDD or gets a USB with 8GB of storage space, he can't play the game.</p>
<p>Also, in my own personal opinion, your son is too young to be playing this type of game. The ESRB rating system is there for a reason!</p>

<p>Maybe he is trolling you all? Its simple he needs room on his hard drive or his mother put parental settings on the x box. Clear space or use a memory stick.

<h2>            Problems downloading ebooks</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to download an ebook on wirecreations.com and it is not working. I have been intouch with the business and he says that there is nothing he can do but everybody who has Vista has this problem and somehow managed to get by the problem and download.
 He does not know how though.<br />
<br />
This is the exact process: I click on "click here" to download. // Box pops up "do you want to run or save this file"? I choose save. // Box pops up "Save as" and I save file name and application for "save as type", I hit save. // Box pops up with scale showing
 how much is downloaded, and then says download complete with choice of run or open folder, I choose run and a window pops up that says "C:\Users\Downloads\beadring.exe is not a valid Win32 application." //Also at the bottom of the download box it says " SmartScreen
 Filter checked this download and did not report any threats.<br />
<br />
So, any ideas? Please break things down for me, I'm not great with a computer.<br />
<br />
Aloha,&nbsp; Jon

<br />
Clear out your temporary internet cache etc, run check disk and try the download again.<br />

            <p>Hi Keshav,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link which you have&nbsp;provided shows only Windows 7/8.1 versions&nbsp;are the supported operating system. But, please be informed Windows 10 is compatible mostly with all the latest software's released.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest you to install the software in Windows 10 and check if it works, if you&nbsp;face any issues then,&nbsp;try installing the software in compatibility mode and check for the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow<span><span>the steps below on how to install&nbsp;the software in compatibility mode:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;Download the&nbsp;software from the manufacturer’s website and save it on your local disk.<br />
2.&nbsp;Right click on the setup file of the&nbsp;software and select <strong>“Properties”.</strong><br />
3.&nbsp;Select<strong> “Compatibility”</strong> Tab.<br />
4.&nbsp;Place a check mark next to “<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>” and select operating system from the drop down list.<br />
5.&nbsp;Let the software install and then check the functionality.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this helps.<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> For further assistance, you can post your query in Microsoft Community</span></span></span></p>

    <title>Adding kid account problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fyrnaga  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding kid account problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I want to add to create a kid account for an xbox 360 to have the live connection for his game (mindcraft).</p>
<p>I created a microsoft account for him. I tried then to add him to my account and it did not worked. It gave me an error every time. Itried both on my computer and on the xbox to do so. On the xbox , there is only a mention of an error occured after filling
 all the information. On the PC, it gave me a long error code which did not explain the situation.</p>
<p>I opened an investigation yesterday (SR&nbsp;<span>1279179039) and i was asked to create several account to try. He asked me to fill the billing information. I was not able since it was only showing united states in the country. I am from Canada and it would
 not work. i was told to try myselft. I just tried again today and I tried something new. By the default the country select is good. So I changed it and put it back and now the country is now canada (bug for the website by the way). So now I was able to add
 the billing information for my kid.</span></p>
<p>Next step, i tried to go on the live.xbox.com and register my kid again under my account. Same error code. can somebody technical can look and tell me what is wrong. Is it my account or a specific scenario that causes this.</p>

<p>The error occurs after i am authenticated with the parent account. It asks if I want to confirm. I click on I accept and here is the error I got.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Il semblerait que vous ayez trouvé une faille dans le système.</span></p>

    <title>Turn Windows Features on or off presents empty dialog box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anshul rastogi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turn Windows Features on or off presents empty dialog box</h2>
                    I go to Control Panel&gt;Programs and Features and then click on "Turn Windows Features on or off". I get dialog box titled "Windows Features" that says "Please Wait". After 45 seconds this dialog box turns blank and nothing is displayed.<br />
<br />
I ran System File Checker twice but it shows no problem. I did Startup repair (pressing F8 key while Vista boots) but problem persist.
<br />
<br />
As suggested on some support sites, from the command prompt, I ran reg delete HKLM\COMPONENTS /v StoreDirty but got "Error: the system was unable to find the specified registry key or value"<br />
<br />
I already tried out http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931712 and it's of no help to me.<br />
<br />
I cannot do a system restore as I do not know from when this problem started may be 1 month back or may be 6 months back because&nbsp; previously I didn't have any need for turning on optional vista features.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am using a standalone HP Laptop (Intel core2 Duo 2.0 Ghz) with Vista home premium pre-installed and I have SP1 installed too.Please do not suggest me to format my laptop and do a fresh install of vista as HP never gave me Operating System DVD.<br />
<br />
What should I do now ?. Please HELP !<br />

<p><span>Hi Anshul Rastogi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your response.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you able to run any updates on your system?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If so please make sure that you have all the current updates installed on your system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer to the following KB article to walk you through some troubleshooting steps:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/934538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/934538</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please run a system update and also walk through the troubleshooting steps in the KB article above and let us know if either of these resolve
 your issue so that if not we may take the next step and find a resolution for you. The next step being restore your system back a month to see if that helps and if not then do a system restore back to the next restore point until we find one that allows your
 system to function as you are wanting it to.</span></p>

<h2>            Blue Password Box</h2>
                    
<p>When I boot my computer, after&nbsp;the logo appears, a blue box comes up asking for a password. This is not a blue screen, but a blue box that says "Enter Password" and an eight character entry box.&nbsp; It seems to be hardware related, but I'm not sure if it's
 Windows or Dell.&nbsp; Any insight would be helpful!</p>

<p><span>Hi KristenT,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. What’s the make and model of the laptop/desktop?
</span></p>
<p><span>b. Did you set an administrator password in BIOS (Basic Input Output System), by any chance?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d suggest you to get in touch with Dell support in this regard for further assistance:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Dell Support
</span></p>
<p>
<span><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/index.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.dell.com/support/index.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen</span></a></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Warning:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Be careful when changing BIOS settings. The BIOS interface is designed for advanced users, and it's possible to change a setting that could prevent
 your computer from starting correctly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Updating BIOS should only be done if necessary (to solve a compatibility problem, for example). It can be a complicated process, and if an error
 occurs, your computer could be rendered inoperable. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions exactly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Hope this information helps.</span></p>

<p>Hi ItzChrisC,</p>
<p>"Anna" is the default voice for Windows 7 text to speech program. If you want to change it, I'd suggest you to reset the region and language settings. Also remove any non-Microsoft text to speech convertor program if installed on your computer.</p>
<p>You can configure text-to-speech on your computer.</p>
<p>Refer these links for more information.</p>
