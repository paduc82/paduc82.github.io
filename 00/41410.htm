<h2>            iMac as a Monitor</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone please tell me if they have used an iMac as a screen for the Scorpio? I have read this thread https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204592 and it would appear to be possible, however, I would like to know if anyone has and if so was there any lag?</p><p><br /></p>

<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p>We have lots of compression software and each has&nbsp;a different compression ratio. But we have to compress a file as much as possible and should decompress within a limited time, like KGB archiver&nbsp;pack the data well but takes hours to decompress a large compressed
 file. Then I came across&nbsp;UHARC and I&nbsp;worked with it and found that <strong>UHARC</strong> is best among all Compression software if we are focussing on Compression rate and Decompression time.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When comparing UHARC and 7 zip depending upon the packing ability of all software where 7 zip is pretty amazing software but the UHARC won our test always. Even though 7 zip utilizes one of the compression algorithms that UHARC uses the 7 zip failed to compete
 even with RAR compression. You can see the result of a 512 kb files compressed by three various compression software. So UHARC is perfect for compressing large and small files.</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>We would like to confirm what exactly did you update on your laptop, was it a Windows update or you updated something else?</li><li>If the update that was installed was for Windows 10, we would like to confirm what was the update installed?</li><li>What troubleshooting have you already completed?</li></ul>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Asus Zenbook UX 303 LA netbws02.sys BSOD</h2>
                    <p>I bought this laptop last year. Ever since then I have had random issues where the computer would suddenly drain itself while it was asleep or turn on and overheat then drain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fixed that by uninstalling the ethernet adapter driver that I had installed. Now, after I updated with whatever Windows Update ther was (this was back in August), I get the netbws02.sys BSOD. I didn't download anything new other than Anaconda and Java
 (for class) and I have tried system restore to before then but that didn't do anything. I also trie updating wifi drivers and that didn't do anything either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I do? I only crash on public wifi networks and it doesn't happene every day, but when it does, it happens 3-4 times within the hour. It also sometimes wakes up from sleep and drains the battery while I am at home.</p>

<h2>            Blank tiles&#47; no profile picture&#47; 0 gamerscore</h2>
                    <p>To start things off I have never had any problems with my Xbox One S until just a few days ago. An update for the Microsoft store appeared, but every time I put it to update it would stay stuck on 0.0%. After awhile I would select "pause all" or "cancel all" and the update would still stay, not allowing to update or install any other app/game. This eventually led me to do a "console reset," but opting for the "keep game and apps." Now after doing so all my game tiles stay blank, gamerscore appears as 0 (zero), profile picture has been removed and I can't even change the background color. I even did a full factory default reset and the problems are still there. I have no idea what to do, I spent about an hour on customer service, but it seems nobody can help me out.</p>

<p>These 4 players are very racist towards black people. They also like to mention how superior white people are and say the like to recognize the KKK</p>
<p>and when ever a black player tells them anything they tell them that &nbsp;if they met them in real life that they " would kill them on site just for being
<strong>[Removed by Moderator - Profanity]</strong>"</p>
<p>is what they pretty much said word for word. And kept spouting out derogatory racist comments. Its players like this that should have console bans.</p>
<p>As I was told is that they have each already had been banned once or twice each and just bought a new gamertag. Cant they just be console banned.</p>
<p>No one needs the likes of players like them saying stupid things like that all the time.</p>

<p>Hate to break it to you but blacks on XBL are just as bad. &nbsp;Can't punish one race of idiots and not the others in my opinion.&nbsp; To be honest this is one of the main reasons why I don't voice chat on XBL anymore because it seemed anytime I was on it for every
 3 lobbies out of 5 that I would be in I would be called a racist hick just because I have an accent.&nbsp; I guess if you are from anywhere south of the Ohio River you must be racist, right?&nbsp; People are stupid.</p>

<p>People are getting more vicious and hateful everywhere. &nbsp;I posted a pretty standard comment on youtube that was pertaining to a video I saw about a group of motorcyclists and an SUV and I got called names and had my life threatened. &nbsp;As I scanned down the
 comments it was all hate. &nbsp;There was no intelligent discussion going on. &nbsp;Hate, namecalling, wishing people dead, etc. &nbsp;Anonymity has made monsters of us. &nbsp;</p>

<p>HardRecoil is correct, you should simply mute any of the players that were being racist / vulgar, file a complaint / submit a bad player review and if you had received any messages from those players, upon opening the message you should block communications.
 However I hate to break it to you, this behavior tends to continue on Xbox Live and it is not only white people who tend to use racist comments. I myself have witnessed both black &amp; Asian players shouting racist comments at each other in game lobbies. No particular
 race is worse than the other.</p>

                    <p>Original title : percy</p>
<p>I have been using windows 10 for some weeks.The only problem I have is that when I print out my bank statements for one month I only get one page of printout which is about 7 items.Windows 7 works fine.HP tell me that the printer drivers are up to date.I
 have tried other printers and they give the same results.I have now gone back to win 7 until someone comes up with an answer to this one.</p>

            <p>I am aware of what you are saying it appears that when using win 7 you can specify a start and end date and it will print just that.With win 10 you cannot use a start and end date if you do you get an incomplete printout.By downloading in pdf&nbsp; all the statements
 appear from the middle of one month to the middle of the next month but you do get the whole months statement if I am to continue using win 10 I will have to get used to that thanks anyway</p>

            I guarantee you: Windows has nothing to do with the start and end dates of your bank statement. That is determined by your bank's software.

<h3> alexiwalker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless &#40;bluetooth&#41; headphones disconnect, reconnect without sound if pc stops playing sound</h2>
                    <p>Windows version: 10 pro, version 10.0.17134 Build 17134 (according to system information)</p>
<p>
</p><p>headphone brand: 3sixT wireless bluetooth headphones</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Headphones connect to laptop (surface laptop), listed in bluetooth settings as connected for voice,music</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I don't start playing any sounds (music, youtube etc) in the next ~30 seconds after connecting, the headphones alert me that they have disconnected and reconnected, but now they list only voice connected. Same thing happens if I was listening to something
 and stop/pause it for too long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are no longer available in the audio output changer in task bar when this happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The device manufacturer (3sixT) does not provide any custom drivers and they seem to use the standard bluetooth headphone drivers available on whatever system they are connected to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These headphones connect without issues to my phone (android); issue only seems to be with my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unable to find many discussions of similar issues, and those that I could used outdated advice / settings that no longer exist (one suggested something in power settings for the device under the device manager page, but that setting doesn't exist now...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how I can resolve? (EG, headphones don't disconnect and reconnect without sound if sounds stop playing?)</p>
<p />

<p>1: troubleshooters never detect any problems. as far as they are concerned, the device is working for the services connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2: there are no drivers to rollback to that worked. There are no drivers that work for it. I've updated every driver on the machine multiple times (removed + reinstalled them, automatically and manually)</p>
<p>2c: its so obvious that this is a standard copypaste response for anything regarding to BT and that you never read the original post, because I literally provided that info to begin with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3: all that is about devices that don't connect. This problem is not that, and my issue is never mentioned there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4: did that, didn't change anything.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Was your hard drive supplied from new with the console or a later addition you made yourself?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>There are a lot of "fake" hard drives that are not capable of playing Xbox original games.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Please check the following thread for suggested solutions if you are 100% sure your hard drive is a genuine Microsoft hard drive.</p>

    <title>Windows 8&#47;8.1 Domain Trust Relationship issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamvorbroker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8&#47;8.1 Domain Trust Relationship issue</h2>
                    <div><br />
</div>
<div>We recently purchased a batch of 25 Windows 8 laptops. &nbsp;Initially, I had no issues with these machines. &nbsp;I was able to join them to our domain and the event logs were clean. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After a month or so, I came across the following error when users were prompted to routinely change their domain passwords:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>The security database on the server does not have a computer account for this workstation trust relationship.</i></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Having worked on our Microsoft domain for about 12 years now, I was familiar with this error. &nbsp;I disjoined the machines from the domain and then rejoined it. &nbsp;Unlike other systems I did this on (Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7), this did not resolve the issue.
 &nbsp;I tried repeating the procedure, including manually removing the computer from Active Directory, with no success. &nbsp;I tried disjoining them, changing their names and then rejoining them with no success. &nbsp; I even tried upgrading the machines to Windows 8.1
 and applying all Windows patches with no luck.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This issue only seems to affect our new Windows 8/8.1 computers, and unfortunately, seems to be affecting all of them. &nbsp;I have tried to work around this problem by issuing a group policy to these machines so that their Computer passwords don't change,
 as opposed to them cycling every 30 days. &nbsp;The only way I have repaired the issue is to completely restore the computers to factory defaults.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have researched this issue online. &nbsp;I have verified in Active Directory that the "dNSHostName" and "servicePrincipalName" attributes are correct. &nbsp;The entries in the DNS server are accurate and I am not having any problems with my DNS infrastructure.
 &nbsp;Our domain is running at a Windows 2008 R2 level.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm running out of options here. &nbsp;I have no objections to deploying Windows 8 in our environment, but this is a very major issue. &nbsp;I have purchased a Windows 8 desktop computer to see if it is affected, but I have to wait 30 days for the computer password
 to cycle before I will know for sure. &nbsp;Any suggestions are appreciated. &nbsp;</div>

<h3> mw0987654321  say:</h3>
<h2>            Increasingly frequent BSOD&#39;s</h2>
                    <p>HELP!&nbsp; I'm getting increasingly frequent BSOD's, 6 in the last 5 days, including one yesterday and 3 today.&nbsp; I have Windows 10 installed, its up to date.&nbsp; A few days ago after I got the 2nd BSOD I ran CCleaner to clear junk from the hard drive and also to
 clean up any registry.&nbsp; I also did a disk defrag.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I've now had 3 events in one day I've installed crystaldiskinfo to monitor the hard drive and am trying to run sfc and dism.&nbsp; The first few events I suspected I was overworking the hard drive as I often run quite a few programs concurrently:&nbsp; MS word
 with files up to 10 MB, large excel spreadsheets up to 33 MB, adobe acrobat and often with QGIS, google earth, firefox, skype, dropbox, windows explorer, AVAST and mail running in the background.&nbsp; After crashing a few times I cut back to mostly just having
 word and acrobat running with AVAST in the background and tried to keep use of the other software to a minimum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Model&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;HP ENVY TS 15 Notebook PC<br />
System Type&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;x64-based PC<br />
System SKU&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;E3B82PA#AKL<br />
Processor&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4900MQ CPU @ 2.80GHz, 2801 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s)<br />
BIOS Version/Date&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Insyde F.65, 20/11/2014<br />
SMBIOS Version&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2.7<br />
Embedded Controller Version&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;147.82<br />
BIOS Mode&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;UEFI<br />
</p>
<p>Any help much appreciated.&nbsp; How do I upload the MSinfo32 and *.dmp files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>OK, so I disabled swivspnt.sys and worked away for an hour or more without any problems.&nbsp; I then set up the verifier to run.&nbsp; When I rebooted it crashed repeatedly a number of times very quickly before getting to the windows login screen.&nbsp; Eventually a windows
 recovery (?) screen came up, I was able to get to advanced options, reboot in safe mode, turn off the verifier, then reboot again normally; however there was no dump file created.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems there is something going on at a fairly fundamental level.&nbsp; I guess another driver.&nbsp; I'm quite wary to run verifier again, or to run memtest.&nbsp; Any other tips on what it might be?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be some misunderstanding.&nbsp; Of course I would have made the dmp files available after setting verifier to run; however as stated above, after starting verifier,, upon rebooting as soon as the boot process started there were a series of rapidfire
 BSODs.&nbsp; A windows recovery screen then came up and I was able to boot in safe mode.&nbsp; Later when I checked the minidump directory THERE WERE NO DMP FILES THERE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I couldn't boot with verifier, I stopped it from running, was hoping that by disabling swivspnt.sys that might have resolved the situation; however subsequently I had another BSOD and I've uploaded the dmp file to https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kt2nji1z3cdry98/AACoANE_9uQ09ENQWcuXrbpda?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem evidently isn't resolved so I'll make a back up, try to run verifier again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I enabled verifier and rebooted.&nbsp; My laptop ran normally for a day, then I had 3 BSOD's in quick succession. I uploaded the dmp files to here:&nbsp;
<br />
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w14bd1rkfvx1gxe/AACt3OwKkOsxWmx-AX0KWxDYa?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed in settings that there's an update for windows 10 available. Presumably its better that I get this sorted and don't allow the upgrade?</p>

<h2>            Alarms app - preview sounds</h2>
                    Hi, I just installed a fresh copy of 8.1 x64 on my PC. When setting an alarm in the Alarm metro app i am unable to preview any of the sounds. The alarm will sound when it goes off and all system sounds work, but I don't want to add a new alarm every minute
 with a new sound just to hear them. Any ideas as to why this is happening?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            hi, thanks for your reply, much appreciated.
<div>The volume was at max and the apps troubleshooter did not find any problems with any apps.</div>
<div>I have found that the same problem occurs in another 3rd party alarm app and the videos in the facebook app do not play/load, not sure if it is related but I thought I would mention it anyway.</div>

            I would like to know how to "preview" the sounds. Everything works on my computer but when I click the sound to select for an alarm that I set, I can't preview the sound to see if it is what I want to hear. The alarm does go off with the sound I previously
 selected at the time set but I would like to know what all of the alarm notification sounds sound like so I can pick one I like. How do I do this?<br />

<h2>            Downgrade to original Windows 10 from a native Windows 10 Anniversary Edition computer</h2>
                    I recently got a new computer which came pre-installed with Windows 10 Anniversary Edition. &nbsp;I have had so many issues with glitches, that I think it is on the same level as Vista. &nbsp;I had none of these issues on my previous computer running the original
 Windows 10 and when i upgraded to Anniversary on that computer, i got the same glitches, so i had uninstalled the update on that computer as i would like to do with my new one. &nbsp;My question, therefore, is, is there a way to downgrade to the original Windows
 10 from a native&nbsp;Windows 10 Anniversary Edition computer?

<p>hi, have you tried to get the original windows 10 through your manufacturer?&nbsp; but i would do same as above reply is to go to microsoft download centre and download the updated creators using media creation tool the update method is fine but the better superior
 method is a usb recovery media and a clean install</p>

<p>There are 2x copies of WMP on 64-bit. The 32-bit one is in C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Media Player. The 64-bit one is in C:\Program Files\Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>32-bit and 64-bit WMP don't share codecs at all. 32-bit WMP only uses 32-bit codecs. 64-bit WMP only uses 64-bit codecs.</p>
<p>If you've installed a codec pack, you might want to see if there's a 64-bit version available.</p>
<p>A couple of utilities to use:</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.codecguide.com/windows7_preferred_filter_tweaker.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.codecguide.com/windows7_preferred_filter_tweaker.htm</a>. This will allow you to set your preferred codecs for both 32-bit and 64-bit environments.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://gspot.headbands.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gspot.headbands.com/</a>. This 32-bit only tool will scan your 1080p files and tell you which codecs are used.</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://blog.monogram.sk/janos/2009/06/14/monogram-graphstudio-0320/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blog.monogram.sk/janos/2009/06/14/monogram-graphstudio-0320/</a>. Comes in both 32-bit and 64-bit flavors. This will show you the DirectShow graph that WMP builds to apply the codecs to your media files. It also allows you to set the merit of DirectShow
 codecs.</p>
<p>You may have to run these tools as Administrator to get things to stick.</p>
<hr />
Never underestimate your own stupidity.

<h3> computerwunder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 start button does not bring up tiles when left click is used.</h2>
                    Recently I have noticed that when carrying out a left click on the Wjndows 10 start button nothing happens. normally this will bring up the tiles. Also, when left clicking on the notification icon to the right of the task bar, nothing happens. Right clicking
 on either does bring up a menu. I have corrected this by carrying out a system restore. A colleague of mine also has the same problem. Is this an intended change in Windows 10, or is it caused by a recent critical update on the 9th March 2016? When this update
 is reinstalled on my pc will I have the same problem again? Your help appreciated.

<strong>Windows Resource Protection (WRP)</strong> file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows corruption errors may prevent Windows updates and service packs from installing. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The
<strong>DISM</strong> <strong>scan </strong>or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong><span>Open an <strong>Administrator command prompt
</strong>window by</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press<strong> Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> option.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Yes</strong> and <strong>continue</strong>. Provide administrator password if prompted.</span></li><li><span>Check if it says <strong>Administrator: Command Prompt</strong> at the top of the command prompt window.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong><span>Type the following commands in the
<strong>CMD Prompt</strong>:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>Dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 3: </span></strong><span>Close the command window and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>If the issue persists, create another administrator user account by referring to

<p>
</p><p><span>The corrupted user profile does not function normally such as not launching

            <p>As previously mentioned, I originally corrected the problem by carrying out a system restore.</p>
<p>However, a few days later the problem returned. It also affected the Cortana question bar and the notifications bar. Left click did not work. A right click on these icons did bring up an available list of options, but some did not appear to work. Fortunately
 I have another user on my computer. So by signing is as this other user and then returning to my own sign it restored everything as it should be. I had previously carried out a 'sfc /scannow' but it did not find any errors.</p>
<p>I did check if my AVG antivirus had&nbsp;removed anything undesirable, but this was not the case. I am still unaware what initially caused the problem, but the system is working as it should at the moment.</p>
<p>I trust other users have had more success in finding the cause of the failure and can post what they did to correct it.</p>
<p>Thanks for the assistance.</p>

<h2>            Settings won&#39;t stay set</h2>
                    I just did the free upgrade from Windows 7 Professional to Windows 10.&nbsp; None of my settings will stay.&nbsp; When I log in, it creates a new desktop every time.&nbsp; When I change my background or install apps, it is as if I am just logging in for the first time.&nbsp;
 The apps aren't installed.&nbsp; I have mapped my drives to my server and the drive mapping doesn't stay mapped.&nbsp; How do I keep the settings, programs I have installed and drive mapping to stay every time I log in?

            Yes, my desktop is connected to a domain.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was using a local account.&nbsp; We have a server, for work, which is connected to two desktops.&nbsp; I was so frustrated with the whole Windows 10 and the problems I had.&nbsp; I was online, then on the phone with Microsoft
 help for 5 and a half hours.&nbsp; I was told repeatedly that I could "roll back" the system to Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; There wasn't anything that helped.&nbsp; I decided that I couldn't spend any more time in trying to make Windows 10 work.&nbsp; I had to format my hard
 drive and put Windows 7 Pro back on.&nbsp; I found it very interesting that when I would boot from the Windows 7 Pro disk, my DVD drive was working just fine.&nbsp; That was another problem which I had under Windows 10, my DVD drive was not found.&nbsp; As for my experience
 with Windows 10, I will not be using it any time in the future.&nbsp; It caused way too many problems.&nbsp;

                    <span>Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor says upgrade from my Vista Ultimate on a Gateway DX441X desktop is all OK except for one problem: my Intel Management Engine Interface (IMEI)&nbsp;is not compatible
                    <span>Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor says upgrade from my Vista Ultimate on a Gateway DX441X desktop is all OK except for one problem: my Intel Management Engine Interface (IMEI)&nbsp;is not compatible
 with Windows 7. My IMEI driver version is 3.0.28.1060 dated 3/13/2007 and is built by WinDDK. My system is just over a year old and is a home system. What would happen if I installed Windows 7 on my system? Would I lose any functionality with any devices or
 any software? Is a driver update available for the IMEI that is compatible with Windows 7? I&nbsp;could not find anything on this problem with&nbsp;over 2 hours of searching the Intel &amp; Microsoft&nbsp;websites.</span>
