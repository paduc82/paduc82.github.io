<h2>            surface pro 5 has unexpected battery &#37; and very quick drain</h2>
                    <p>I've noticed that my surface pro 5 shuts off by itself quite often. The most recent occurrence was just a few minutes ago. The battery life indicated 34% and then just a few minutes afterward, it just shuts itself off. I cannot turn it back on without plugging
 it in (it only displays the batter icon). Is there something wrong with my battery? I have the device on battery saver and have turned down the brightness to as low as possible. It only lasts for 1.5 hours!&nbsp; This is terrible compared to when just purchased!
 I'm really disappointed with how terrible the battery life is now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Wilson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This kind of issue will require us to check the current setup and perform a series of troubleshooting. If the battery icon appears when you connect the PSU, it means the battery has been drained. Recharge the battery to 100% without interruption, then let
 the battery drain without reconnecting it to a power supply. When it reaches low level or shuts down, connect the PSU and let it charge to 100% without using it or running any apps. Do this for up to three times. This will recalibrate the battery and correct
 unusual performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While running on battery power, check your update history so we can see if an update was recently installed, resulting to the problem. Go to
<strong>Settings </strong>(<strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>I</strong>) &gt; <strong>
Update &amp; Security</strong> &gt; <strong>View update history</strong>. Apart from that, can you also tell us what apps are running when the problem occurs?</p>
<p><br />
Let's check the app usage on your Surface as well. From Settings, go to <strong>System</strong> &gt;
<strong>Battery</strong> &gt; <strong>See which apps are affecting your battery life</strong>. Select the
<strong>Time period</strong> depending on which is closest to the occurence of the problem, then under
<strong>Show</strong>, choose <strong>Apps with usage</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p>Another important report we need to check is the reliability history. In the search bar, type
<strong>reliability </strong>and open <strong>View reliability history</strong>. Share the details of the errors that you will find if there are any.<br />
</p>
<p>I also recommend that you <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download and run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong>.
 This will ensure that you have the latest driver and firmware updates, and check for other software issues that could be affecting your Surface's performance. After running the tool, perform a forced shutdown by pressing the power button for about 10 seconds,
 or until the device shuts down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, install definition updates and perform a scan <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/17464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">using Windows Defender</a></strong>. You can also run the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool to check if the device's
 memory is working properly. Type <strong>memory </strong>in the search bar and open
<strong>Windows Memory Diagnostic</strong> &gt; <strong>Restart now and check for problems (recommended)</strong>. The device will automatically restart once it's done. See if the issue will continue to manifest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll await your reply so we can check if there's anything else we would need to perform. I will be notified when you respond and I'll get back to you the soonest I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>I tried resetting the battery as you recommended. There is no change in the battery life at all. In fact I think it's gotten worse over past few weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just running the memory diagnostic drained the battery from 100% down to 31% with no windows open over the span of 20min or less.&nbsp; That should be indicative of something wrong with the battery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Surface Diagnostic Tool and it found nothing wrong with my surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the software and updates have been installed and there were no errors corrected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I normally use my Surface, I have around 15 tabs open on Edge. It is the program using most of the resources-about 70%. However, this should not explain the very quick drain of battery power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just typing this message over the last 2 min has led to at least a 2% drain on my battery. Nothing is running except for 1 tab on Edge. There is no windows update running in the background either. Please give me information so I can get my surface fixed.
 There are only a few days left for the warranty, and I'm rather disappointed that the battery could not even last 1 year.&nbsp;</p>

            I have tried the above. There is no difference in battery performance. The battery dies after 30min of just browsing the internet on Edge. Please send me a replacement Surface. I'm getting annoyed by poor battery performance.&nbsp;

                    My computer keeps telling me that my date and time are not correct. I've checked both and they are correct. How can I fix this problem? Also it sometimes says "Security certificate problems may indicate an attempt to fool you or intercept any data you

<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />

<h2>            Skype for web not sending files&#47;not updating</h2>
                    <p>The standard answer seems to be to link to a forum post asking/suggesting that the user make sure Skype for web is the latest version but offers no advice or answers as to how to get and apply this update. Skype for web is not sending files to contacts,
 it is not the updated version 1.115..etc but 1.113.3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please don't just tell me to close and restart. I've signed out of Skype, closed my browser, deleted history, cookies, and just to be sure, run disc clean on my computer before restarting the computer itself. Logging back in to Skype does not force any updates
 and I'm still stuck with the not completely working version 1.113.3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does one get the update to 1.115.21 and apply it to Skype for web?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to me.</p>
<p>I'm including a snip showing the version number here to show you that Skype for Web is not automatically updating. That little sad face is what I get as far as an error message about the failed send, it's not even helpful, just failed. This file is less
 than 46kb in size and wont send to any of my contacts.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what part of the interface you might be looking to see but I'll try to get a shot of whatever you need to get this fixed.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Unrelated but annoying, every time I try to get around on Microsoft here I'm directed to sign in, despite being signed in and I have to sign completely out and back in to keep from getting stuck in the 'that email is already registered' loop. Is there something
 I'm missing that I need to do to eliminate that series of hoops?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for yout time&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ugh. The skype for web linked to my Microsoft account is up to date, but the Skype for web I actually use still hasn't updated. Is this possibly because it's not linked to a Microsoft account? That would suck.</p>

<p><span><span><span>Behaviour of Skype for Web is now more or less unpredictable.
<strong>You can have different versions when using different Skype accounts.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I have tested Skype for Web on
<strong>the same computer</strong></span><span> (Windows 7) and
</span><strong><span>the same browser</span></strong><span> (Internet Explorer IE11) with different Skype accounts. With some of the accounts the version was the latest
</span><strong><span>1.115.21</span></strong><span>, while with other accounts, the version was still the older
</span><strong><span>1.113.3</span></strong><span>. No particular pattern on which account the version was updated and on which not.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3e88d7b-7189-4bdb-a7a7-4a7ea75998b7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3e88d7b-7189-4bdb-a7a7-4a7ea75998b7?upload=true" /></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Additionally, on version 1.115.21, the Plugin was not installed and calling was not available.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>On version 1.113.3, Plugin (and thus calling) was available. This is specific to Internet Explorer, as this browser requires Plugin for making video/audio calls on Skype for Web.
 Plugin is not required on the Edge browser on Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>According to information from Microsoft, the issue is under investigation, but so far, there has been no response yet.</span></span></p>

<p>Thank you for continuing to try to help.</p>
<p>I use Chrome, but even with Comodo Skype for Web is showing version 1.113</p>
<p>The only Skype for web that is up to date is the one linked to my Microsoft account, even in the Chrome browser.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Ruwim,</p>
<p>Thank you for providing that information. I don't want to have to switch browsers to use an up to date Skype for web and it looks like that's not the issue, which is a relief. I haven't used Skype for voice or video in years so that's not a huge deal for
 me. My main problem is that Skype suddenly stopped sending files and answers to other queries about this suggest that using the most up to date version, 1.115 is the way to solve the problem.
</p>
<p>If that will be the fix, that would be great, provided I can get it to update. I prefer the lighter weight and less needless updates and additions of the browser version.&nbsp;I know Betas are iffy but different versions for different Skype accounts when I can't
 control the update seems like a flaw.</p>

<p>If you are sure that your personal files have been deleted then System Restore will not help you. It only restores system and program files&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> personal files.</p>
<p>I suggest you just reinstate your personal files from your backup.</p>
<p>A genuine Java update should not have affected your personal files in any way. I suggest you uninstall the version of Java you currently have via&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Control Pannel-&gt;Programs &amp; Features</strong> then go to&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.java.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.java.com</a> and download/install the latest version form there.</p>

<p>Hi Dennis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need more information about your concern. Is it that your mouse activates/opens a link when you hover the mouse on it? Or is it that your mouse activates other windows opened on your device when hovering over it? We suggest checking the
<strong>Ease of Access </strong>settings, you can do this by going to <strong>Control Panel &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Ease of Access Center &gt; Make the mouse easier to use &gt;</strong> Uncheck the option that says
<em><strong>Activate a window by hovering over it with the mouse</strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
In System Information - Components - Display - Adapter RAM.<br />
<br />
Also check the specs for the Video/Display&nbsp;Adapter&nbsp;at the System maker (who made the computer) and then
<br />
Device maker (who built the video/display adapter) respective sites.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

            This is from EA support on <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Need-for-Speed-Rivals/DXGI-ERROR-UNSUPPORTED-quot-unsupported-quot-error-with-Need-for/td-p/2679374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://answers.ea.com/t5/Need-for-Speed-Rivals...</a>
<br />Hopefully it’ll also apply in your case.
<br />The general ‘fix’ is to clean install your graphics card drivers.
<br />
<br />
<br />This is an article published for Battlefield 3 and 4 but also applicable to Need for Speed Rivals.
<br />
<br />Error: Dxgi_error_unsupported or dxgl.dll error
<br /> 
<br />If you receive the error message: 'Dxgi_error_unsupported ' while trying to play Battlefield 3 or 4, there is likely a problem with your graphics card. 
<br />
<br />The error message is triggered when your graphics card doesn't support DirectX 10/11. You may have the "software version" of DirectX 11 installed, but Battlefield requires this specific Direct X hardware support.
<br /> 
<br />Most Intel and laptop graphics cards fall in this unsupported category. Please refer to the minimum system requirements to determine what machines will run Battlefield.
<br />Vista players need to upgrade to Service Pack 2 before installing DX11. 
<br />Players may have success getting around this error by performing a Clean Install of their graphics drivers.
<br />NVIDIA players can find directions on how to install the NVIDIA Display Driver directly from NVIDIA.
<br />AMD players can find the AMD Clean Uninstall Utility and further instructions from AMD's support site.

<h2>            Windows 10 DVR Error code 2184327189</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to record a game, and normally I have no problems, turn it on today and it will not let me record for the life of me. It gives me the error code&nbsp;2184327189 as if my Mic is not picking something up. I&nbsp;have looked into several&nbsp; area's on the troubleshoot websites and not a thing is mentioned as if it's unheard of. I clicked on the Windows logo +&nbsp;G several times just to get the number correct, looking these up and I come up with nothing. I can record the video but i can't record up to the 4 hours and I can't record voice as before, I have done both before and would like to do again. would like this matter fixed.</p>

<p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your computer needs to have a fax modem so that you can connect your fax to your device. A fax modem is a piece of add-on hardware that allows your computer to communicate with a fax machine over a standard phone line. Once you have this hardware, connect
 your fax to your computer and access this <strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/30220.windows-10-ctp-windows-fax-and-scan.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to know how to set up fax in Windows 10.
 Even though the link is for Windows 10 CTP, it is also applicable on your edition of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

                    <p>Good afternoon folks,</p><p>I came here because I'm totally disappointed with Microsoft, first of all, we must pay each year for Gold to be able to play any multiplayer online games, that is already bad as hell, and the worst, now we have the Game Pass monthly service, which is like a netflix that provides games while we pay for it, why don't we have just one service that provides us monthly games and let us play online, why must I&nbsp;pay for Live Gold and also Game Pass to enjoy my console 100%&nbsp;with no restrictions? I think this is wrong!</p>

<h2>            Halo 2 Game Saves</h2>
                    
<p>Is anyone else having issues with game saves during the Halo 2 single player campaign? &nbsp;Essentially, I cannot use the "Save/Quit" option during H2. &nbsp;Checkpoints work if I die, but any attempt to save a game after a checkpoint is futile. &nbsp;Instead of leaving
 me at the most recent checkpoint, a game save simply restarts the mission.</p>

<p>Having same issue in Halo 2, but it seems random... sometimes reloads at the last checkpoint and sometimes reloads at the beginning of the mission even though I saved after a checkpoint well into the mission. Can't figure out any pattern to know when it
 will save correctly or when it will make me restart at beginning of mission.</p>
<p>Haven't played the other campaigns to know if they have the same issue or not.</p>

<p>It is extremely annoying as you gentlemen have stated. I'm done with this crap until a patch comes out.

<p>Same thing is happening to me so I'm glad to know it's not just my console/game at fault. The plus side of this is that restarting a mission allows me another chance to see the terminal movies which 50% of the time don't play even though the achievement
 pops. It's like The Halo Channel App crashes when I unlock a new clip.</p>
<p>This really is a bug-ridden game but overall I'm still having a blast.</p>

<p>*** you 343. i just played through the worst garbage rapefest horseshit on legendary where a bunch of brutes *** your life over. you die immediately over and over and the only way to make through is sheer LUCK after maybe an hour (maybe more) of trying.
 and it doesn't save that progress after a checkpoint??? hey 343, do you know what the *** CHECKPOINT even *** means? what's the point of the term SAVE/QUIT if it does nothing? go ahead and ban me. it's not worth being a part of this broken *** mess. this is
 a *** joke. nothing works. multiplayer is ***. progress won't save. can't even watch the dumb ridley scott shitfest either because the menu music won't stop playing (i'm not joking - the menu music WON'T STOP PLAYING). every aspect of this game is a broken
 pile of ***. Can't wait for the Halo5 beta (probably a broken pre-alpha piece of garbage)...</p>
<p>WHAT A GODDAMNED JOKE!</p>

<p>Having save game issues as well. Very frustrating. Always restarts at the beginning of the current mission. This is happening to me on Halo CE and Halo 2 anniversary. Disappointing and frustrating to say the least. Hopefully a patch will be issued soon.</p>

            <p>This appears to be a common problem. Happens to me 1-2 times per day. Does it start working again after a reboot?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I chatted online with MS tech support last week. They acknowledged this as a known issue. Suggested solution was to boot to safe mode and then back to normal. Not sure why this would make a difference, but was happy to try. In my case, the problem
 returned today. The other solution suggested by the tech rep, and one I plan to try this afternoon, was to do an in-place upgrade of Windows 10 (essentially an OS re-install that preserves all apps and files) via the Media Creation Tool.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#91;Windows 10&#93; VIA HD Audio cant manually update to latest driver V11_1100F from 6.0.11.800 &#60; Windows Automatic install</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a problem with my Game Zero's headset microphone volume and I noticed my VIA HD audio drivers -may- not be up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OS is Windows 10 64 Bit</p>
<p>My Motherboard is a Z77X-UD3H Rev 1.0&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>*To start off with I have used wushohide.diagcab to "hide" the VIA HD automatic update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*I have follow multiple uninstallation guides both offline and online (with an without an internet connection)</p>
<p>
</p><p>*I have tried manually installing the latest driver from VIA Portal "VIA_HD_Audio_v11_1100f_Win10RS1_logo_11012016"</p>
<p>
</p><p>*I have uninstalled via Device Manager several times both before and after using wushohide.diagcab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>*I have updated drivers to "High Defintion audio Device" instead of "VIA HD audio" however that makes my problem worse, as I can't use the mic "levels" in recording under sound to give my microphone a +20db boost to boost the sound but reducing the quality
 of my microphone or use any "MicArray's" such as Beamforming and Noise Suppression etc. I also experience an issue on High Definition audio Device, and less relevant in VIA HD audio because of the +20db boost, is that my microphone tends to drop it's volume
 even more during long conversations, despite already being low enough as it is. I have ruled out the theory that it was just my headset because I just recently sent my old pair back to the supplier, and they provided me with a brand new pair under warranty,
 both have the same issue therefore it is most likely a driver issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I have in Device Manager with the driver itself is despite blacklisting the automatic update, once I uninstall the driver and restart my computer, VIA HD Audio STILL automatically installs itself back onto my PC and despite all the guides I have
 follow I cannot prevent them from installing to do a manual installation of V11_100F to also install Vdeck. I've even disconnected my internet, uninstalled the driver and delete the files, restarted my computer and it still comes back. It's rivatuner 2.0,
 just can't get rid of the damn thing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The VIA HD audio automatically installs driver version 6.0.11.800 (and also my current) and when I update my driver to High Defintion Audio Device that driver V is 10.1x.xxx (forgot rest)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I'm going through all of this trouble is because as I aforementioned is I wish to update my drivers to the current available to rule out any problems to do with the headset itself, despite myself being convinced it is my audio driver that is the
 problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That error means that Windows cannot find the driver for your device. To better assist your issue with your headphone, we strongly recommend contacting the manufacturer of your device. They are the ones who could really help you about driver issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have more concerns, feel free to post.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for the reply- My main concern was I was not able to update the Audio driver with an manual installation to rule out any issues with the headphone themselves. As I stated windows 10 automatically installs an out of date audio driver, not allowing
 me to do any sort of manual installation to solve the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will branch out and try and solve the issue, thank you.</p>

<h2>            Disable Startup Repair on Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We were asked to "Disabled Startup Repair" on all Windows7 computers.</p>
<p>OS version: Windows 7 Enterprise SP1</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little confused on which options this is refer to for Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time we unplug/plug a physical&nbsp;computer (or Power off/on a VM) - it will show the "Windows Error Recovery" screen:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea88944e-6170-4aa9-ba2b-eb8c8b5d8e1a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea88944e-6170-4aa9-ba2b-eb8c8b5d8e1a" height="199" width="406" /></a></p>
<p>then Press F7 - will bring us to the "Windows Boot Manager" screen:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fee35649-e686-434b-bcbd-266e4808150a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fee35649-e686-434b-bcbd-266e4808150a" height="302" width="417" /></a></p>
<p>then Press F8 to go to "Advanced Boot Options" screen:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a3d9d480-5649-4cc7-b388-a5c6bad89201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a3d9d480-5649-4cc7-b388-a5c6bad89201" height="495" width="421" /></a></p>
<p>In here there is this "Repair Your Computer" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question:</p>
<p>- Does this "Repair Your Computer" option referring to the "Startup Repair" option?
</p>
<p>- How can we get to this&nbsp;"Launch Startup Repair (recommended)" on Windows 7? (or&nbsp;this&nbsp;screen&nbsp;does not exist in Windows 7)?
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3625fb14-b83b-4377-bf89-cf4488b32696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3625fb14-b83b-4377-bf89-cf4488b32696" height="424" width="461" /></a></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried running this cmdlet alone</p>
<p>bcdebit /set {default} recoveryenabled No</p>
<p>
</p><p>it did not work. But if we run both cmdlets</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bcdebit /set {default} recoveryenabled No</strong></p>
<p><strong>bcdebit \set {decault} bootstatuspolicy IgnoreAllFailures</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>then the it skipped the Startup repair from auto booting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>question:</p>
<p>1. Thought that bootstatuspolicy is set to IgnoreAllFailure by default? why need to ran "...bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailure"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. In windows &gt; In Computer &gt; Properties &gt; System Properties &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery, there is this option&nbsp;"time to display recovery options when needed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>From understading, by<strong> selecting </strong>this option and set to <strong>
0</strong> -&nbsp;this will stop startup repair screen from showing too. correct? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If we have this&nbsp;option is selected for future MOE deployment , and then also push the above cmdlets via gpo.&nbsp;will there be&nbsp;any issues of doing so?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>or, the above&nbsp;cmdlets has nothing to do with&nbsp;the&nbsp;"time to display recovery options when needed" option?</p>
<p>

            <p>It is a peculiarity of the wireless management on Windows RT that once a connection is made it never brings up the connection settings again even if they fail to connect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When in range of the WiFi network right click (hold your finger on for a few seconds if using touch) the wireless network and select "Forget this network".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when you select Connect again it should ask you for your credentials.</p>

<h2>            Battery Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>So this laptop's battery doesn't charge. I believe this can be fixed simply by updating the battery firmware. However, my laptop is at 0% and it's relying on the power given by the surface dock. The battery firmware update requires the battery to be at 40%.
 Because of this, I am unable to update my laptop and fix my battery issues. Can anybody help?</p>

See, I can’t update it because it takes way too long. When i tried, I left it for a day and it has yet to complete. It made no progress whatsoever. Regarding to the uninstall the battery &nbsp;drive, that didn’t work and the battery &nbsp;still said not charging.
