<h2>            Outlook not syncing to webmail - able to send&#47;receive but emails do not get filed, deleted or marked as read on web</h2>
                    <div>
<p>This issue started about a week ago. If I ignore all the known issues with Outlook 2011 since moving to Mountain Lion, I would say Outlook has been running fine until last week. I couldn't see anything on the forum that was similar to my issue. I have also
 posted this to the Apple support forum.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here's my computers info:</p>
<ul>
<li>OS X (10.8.2(</li><li>Processor: 3.1 GHZ Intel Core i5</li><li>Mem: 12 GB 1333 MHZ DDR3</li><li>Office 2011 Version 14.2.5</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here's the issue:</p>
<p>My work email is set up in Outlook 2011 version 14.2.5 using IMAP. I go through my day as usual reading emails, responding to them, and filing them away in folders (on the server). I can go through 100 emails in my inbox to only 10 by the end of the day,
 all have been read. Emails that are no longer in my inbox have been either read, responded to, filled away and/or deleted. I am able to receive and send emails with no errors. However, once I leave work and view my emails online or on another program (such
 as MacMail), I see those 100 emails still in my inbox! I see no pattern to it either. (The most recent email in a conversation has been marked as read but several earlier ones were not).
<br />
</p>
<p>The strangest part: All those emails I filed away in folders on the server or deleted are in those folders AND in my inbox. Therefore, if I refile the emails, or delete them I will have duplicate emails in those folders. I've tried repairing the folder but
 that only put the server inbox back into my outlook but I still can't make any changes that show on the Webmail. We've also rebuilt the identity and that didn't do anything.
<br />
</p>
<p>If I make any changes in Mail (On a different computer that is on Snow Leopard) or on the web, I just sync Outlook and it shows the changes in Outlook but it won't show any of my Outlook changes in the webmail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially this is the syncing issue:&nbsp; </p>
<p>Other programs --&gt; Server --&gt; Outlook = OK</p>
<p>Server --&gt; Outlook = OK</p>
<p>Outlook -x-&gt; Server = NOT OK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to reiterate that this started last Tuesday (Nov 20) and I can still receive and send emails just fine and no email has been lost.&nbsp; Our IT can't figure it out.

            Are your IMAP accounts with Yahoo, ATT or AOL? If yes the latest update no longer works with these services. It's possible the update also affects other IMAP accounts as well.

            <p>I've seen that when there is a difference in the Region and the Language settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, start typing Region to display the Region &amp; Language&nbsp;System Settings box.</p>
<p>Check that the Country or Region&nbsp;matches the Language that is&nbsp;showing as the Windows&nbsp;display language.</p>
<p>Click&nbsp;the Additional date, time &amp; regional settings link shown under Related&nbsp;Settings</p>
<p>Under Language, click Change input methods</p>
<p>Click Options and make sure the Input method is set to the correct language keyboard layout.</p>

                    All of a&nbsp;sudden some people are not receiving my emails that had in the past. This is using both the web and Outlook. I do not receive any type of error message that the email is not being delivered but am&nbsp;receiving phone calls&nbsp;from the people saying they
 never got my emails.&nbsp; This is very disruptive as I use this email for my business.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is not&nbsp;isolated to one domain and some of my emails are being received just fine.

            Hi Stephanie,
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with Outlook.
<br />
<br />Are you using Microsoft Office Outlook?  
<br />
<br />A troubleshooting suggestion:  Have you tried asking intended recipients to e-mail you a test e-mail and reply to that person's e-mail?
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

            I am not an exchange administrator but I am familiar with some tracking  exchange gets feedback during delivery of e-mails as delivery status notifications.  Are you recieving those?  If you do, that might help you troubleshoot.

            I'm not receiving any delivery status notifications as I normally would when an email doesn't go through.&nbsp; When I send an&nbsp;email, I have no way of knowing whether the intended recipient received the email - unless I pick up the phone and call them.&nbsp; So
 I'm not receiving anything that would lead me to believe the emails aren't being delivered.

<h2>            How can I play my OneDrive music on my Windows device</h2>
                    <p>Now that Microsoft has once again shown that is does not care about their customers by ending music streaming from OneDrive, what is the real solution?&nbsp; Please do not point me to the worthless FAQ or Spotify.&nbsp; I've also tried playing directly from OneDrive
 within the browser, also not a real solution.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid that the only option that appears available is to move my music collection off of OneDrive (which I pay for), to another platform that supports music streaming across devices.&nbsp; Is this Microsoft's intention, to drive consumers away from their
 products? &nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm looking into a suggested app called Sonca. It is supposed to be able to stream from your music from OneDrive. I just downloaded the app yesterday and I'm beginning setup today. It does have and option to include OneDrive as a media source.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let us know how it goes.&nbsp; I see in the MS Store that 2 versions are offered, a free light version, and a fee based version.&nbsp; Reports from another website state that the app wants access to all of your OneDrive data, true or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question is, why has MS abandoned streaming from OneDrive, when a 3rd party offers an app doing just that?</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to export playlists?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does seem that since Nadella took over, Microsoft's main goal is to drive consumers away. I just wish they would be upfront about like, "we are no longer interested in consumers as customers, so leave our platform now and make preparations.&nbsp; Not just
 pull the rug from us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Understood. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the issue is all my music is on my PC's hard drive and played by a stand-alone app that isn't good for anything else.&nbsp; Taking my music out of the cloud limits my ability to play across devices, a huge step backwards (why?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solution for now has been to move it all over to Google Play Music.&nbsp; I can once again stream my personal collection to my phone, which once was a WP and could do that and do it well.&nbsp; I can play my personal collection within a browser using the Google
 Play Music webpage, something we also used to be able to do within the MS ecosystem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid all of this is falling on deaf ears, just look at the number of views in almost a month, 54.&nbsp; There is no MS community, they've all left.</p>

<p>I just started using Sonca to play my music from OneDrive. It's fine. Takes some PC resource to sync, but I've got a lot of music too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for looking at all of OneDrive, I don't really know. However, I discovered I can tell Sonca to look only in my OneDrive Music sub-folder, which implies it's not looking anywhere else, but who knows? (I should ask them!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line, so far so good.</p>

<h3> mikelloyd-jones  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bizarre issue with Office Lens and Office 365 for Business on IOS</h2>
                    <p>Running IOS 10.1.1 on an iPad Air and an iPhone 7, with Office Lens / same O365 for Business account on both.</p>
<p>Both are also under O365 MDM and using the exact same device policy</p>
<p>Problem is in trying to transfer images from Lens to OneDrive for Business..</p>
<p>iPad is fine. iPhone has nearly been chucked out of the window. No matter what I do - uninstall/reinstall the apps, recreate O365 account settings etc etc I just get the highly unhelpful "cannot upload, click to retry" error. This then goes around in circles
 asking to log in to O365 again..and again...and again. I've even removed the MDM profile from the iPhone to see if that would make a difference. No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is, when I get this error, if I go back into settings in Lens, the O365 account settings have disappeared and I have to recreate them again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help !?!</p>
<p>TIA</p>

<p>
</p><p>Accessing the web from another computer on my network was so slow it took 1 hour to download a 5MB file. This happened while a windows 10 desktop was updating and again while a laptop was updating. I tried several throttling methods but nothing worked. As
 soon as the update download completed my network was back to normal.</p>

            Well, are you using a router? If so-there are settings that would prioritize the traffic according to your wish to a certain device/function. Older routers do not have that feature, so the prioritization of traffic goes for the first machine that starts
 downloading. The second receives just a bit of the network bandwidth and any subsequent devices would throttle the connection further.

<p>I often do large downloads (4-15GB) and this has never happened before or now, except with the win10 update download. So its not my router.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I haven't seen the download problems, eating too much bandwidth, though it DOES affect the connection. &nbsp;What I *did* see is the 'cloud updates' when you LOG IN eating up bandwidth, and causing my internet radio to stutter. &nbsp;A 'fix' for this is to disable
 networking just before you log in, then re-enable afterwards. &nbsp;Then it's not a ginormous pile-on for background "schtuff" trying to download everything like it's some kind of freaking emergency, and fighting over it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then again, I run into the same 'bandwidth steal' problems when I update a Linux machine, so there ya go. &nbsp;'apt-get upgrade' and spend several hours downloading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would fairly say that it's NOT really Windows 10 doing this, nor Microsoft's servers. &nbsp;In fact, I would think that ISP's would WANT to deliver 'certain content' (streaming whatever, for example) at a HIGHER priority. &nbsp;But they can't. &nbsp;It would be *illegal*.
 &nbsp;THAT is the problem. &nbsp;And a bit off topic now, so I'll stop.</p>

            <p>Never had problems with my Ubuntu, MAC, Windows 7 &amp; Android devices. Only the BSD Joule updates like forever, so I'd usually wait for a new release &amp; reinstall it by downloading the ISO.<br />
There were couple of times when new Windows 10 builds would not download, but gave the error "0x80d02002=download of a file saw no progress within the defined period". &nbsp;So I had to hit the Retry button a few times (at least 10+). On the other hand I have two
 Windows 10 installations &amp; usually the issue occurs with one installation (not a specific one), while the other would download the update as expected. Also the Windows 10 installations are on the same rig, so I cannot run them both at the same time. So maybe
 this has something to do with the&nbsp;"get updates from more than one place" option in Windows update settings.<br />

            <p>Update seems to spawn a few processes for checking the download that creates a lot of CPU and disc activity as well as seeming to take Internet bandwidth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However: it is mostly on the computer downloading the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a router, usually three computers sharing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a Store app by Microsoft called: "Network Speed Test".</p>
<p>I run that on another computer (on the shared router)... it shows full download speeds... so the router and the backbone connection are not being hit very heavily.</p>

            I ran a download speed test while win10 was downloading, It came back at 1 - 3% of what my normal speed is, so the win10 update download was using 97 - 99% of my bandwidth.<br />

            When a disk clean up is performed it will ask what to delete and what not to delete, so if you deleted Windows.old, the only way to go back is to reinstall your Win7 from the media that came with your system, if no media you can go on line and download
 a WinISO using your win7 key

            @JoeNamco, Thank you kindly for your reply and appreciate it. The disk clean up did ask me if I wanted to delete previous Windows version and I said no and then it proceeded to clean up the rest I had checked. They only asked me when I did the clean up
 for system files, which I clean only occasionally which is after Windows Updates. That went on for awhile and then noticed they didn't ask any more. That's when found out didn't have previous Windows version any more. They say that should be in Windows.old
 file or folder and that is nowhere to be found on this machine. Gone forever. Thanks again for your help. Will try both you suggested and hope one of then works as the 30 days is about to run out.
        </p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 Initial Launch Errors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathanwallace  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 Initial Launch Errors</h2>
                    We are upgrading our clients from Office 2010 to Office 2013 and are migrating from a different email system to Office 365 with hosted exchange server. These computers have never used Outlook before. I am having issues troubleshooting an error with Outlook
 2013. When we open Outlook 2013 for the first time, it creates a profile and then gives an error message: "Outlook cannot log on. Verify you are connected to the network and are using the proper server and mailbox name. The connection to Microsoft Exchange
 is unavailable. Outlook must be online or connected to complete this action." If you click "OK" you get the next error message: Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook window. The set of folders cannot be opened. Your profile is not configured."
 The only way around this is to delete the mail profile and re-launch Outlook 2013. Any ideas on how to resolve this so we don't get the error messages? Thanks.

            <p>Outlook doesn't automatically configure an Exchange account without your input unless you have deployed a configurations script (prf-file) or set Group Policies to completely automate the configuration.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you are using roaming profiles, then the user's settings will be loaded from your profiles server. If they attempted to configure Outlook before, then that mail profile will be used.</p>

            Could you explain your problem in little bit more detail? This would help me to give you the right solution.

<br />Are you asking for your sheets to be named as Jan, Feb.....Dec when you insert a sheet or Jan-18, Feb-18........Jan-19 something like this?

            Excel has no function for it, but you could do that with a macro.
<br />
<br />Select a worksheet that is just behind a worksheet named with a month name and run the macro below.
<br />
<br />If your sheet or month names look different, you'll need to adjust the code.
<br />
<br />Andreas.
<br />
<br /><pre><code>Sub MonthSequenceInExcelTabs()
  Dim i As Integer
  If ActiveSheet.Index = 1 Then
    'The first sheet is January always
    ActiveSheet.Name = MonthName(1, False)
  Else
    'Check the previous sheet for all other sheets
    For i = 1 To 12
      If Sheets(ActiveSheet.Index - 1).Name = MonthName(i, False) Then
        ActiveSheet.Name = MonthName(i + 1, False)

<p>HI,</p>
<p>Try running Scapst to check for any errors in the PST file.&nbsp; also, try creating another calendar folder, move the calendar items there, sync and them move them back until you find the items that won't sync.&nbsp; The possible causes are long notes,
 embedded files in the notes and reoccuring appointments without an end date.</p>

<br />
<br />Safelinks feature is introduced to ensure the safety of your organization by automatically filtering out the links which are harmful or have threats of virus or malware. 
<br />I know it might be annoying. I think if you contact a Microsoft engineer they might remove it (is just a suggestion, not sure about it.

    <title>pasted tables lose formatting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lynnba  say:</h3>
<h2>            pasted tables lose formatting</h2>
                    I'm using Word 2007. When I copy a table, or any portion of a table, and paste it elsewhere, either in the same or another document, the table cells lose all formatting and return to plain text. This occurs whether or not I have Keep Source Formatting
 selected in the options. When I try to Paste Special, I have only two options, Unformatted Text and Unformatted Unicode Text, and the Source says Unknown. This is driving me crazy not to be able to cut and paste tables. Any thoughts?

<p><br />
It would seem that the Section Break is too close to the TOC.</p>
<p>Ensure that there is at least one paragraph between the end of the TOC and the section break, so that when the TOC is refreshed the section break is not caught in the update.</p>
<p>If space is an issue then format the paragraph(s) as 1pt.</p>
<p>Best of luck</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to ask a question on pages.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Many objects might belong to more than one classification. For example, if we have a section “<b>Hollywood actress</b>”, and another is “<b>British actress</b>”, and when we want to create a page for
<b>Rachel Weisz</b>, who can be classified into both, then there might be duplicate pages and modifications on these pages are not necessarily synced.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One way to solve the problem is to create links on one page in “Hollywood actress”, keep is content blank, and point to link to “British actress” page; Aside from this, is there any built-in functionality, something like
 “alias” page, to do the same thing?</span></p>
