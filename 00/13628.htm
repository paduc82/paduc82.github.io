            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your query to Microsoft forum. I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be because of several reasons such as the security software you may have installed on the computer, any program or application running on the computer at the back ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Method 1:
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Perform Clean Boot
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned
 below to perform a Clean Boot</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Uninstall security software</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to uninstall if you have any trial version of Anti-virus or any other security software you are using.</span></span><span>
</span></p>

<p><em><span><span>Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></em></p>

<h2>            Word 2016 Mac - Cannot Create Labels</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having trouble with Word 2016 Mac. After the last update (16.11.1) I am unable to create labels or envelopes. I get the error "There is a problem with the label information you are trying to use." I have tried removing Office altogether (from all places
 I could find, including /private/var/, etc.) and performed a clean install. It all works fine until AutoUpdate runs and updates to the latest version. I've tried it with a default, and also customized Office install (sans Outlook and OneNote), and the same
 thing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should mention that I'm on High Sierra (10.13.4), and that I am using a case-sensitive APFS (back in the day with HFS+ it mattered sometimes, but lately it's all been good).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've included two screenshots to help the issue. Does anyone have any ideas? Switching to the Office Insider Slow does not fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- g</p>

<p>Hi George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delays, I'm a developer on the Mac Word team and I just wanted to give you an update that we are looking into your problem. Thank you for the information you've given us, it is incredibly helpful and we really appreciate you taking all this
 time to give us some thorough data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The team is currently looking into this issue.</p>

<p>Hi George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We looked into the issue and it turns out that Office for Mac does not officially support case-sensitive file systems. By default both&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;</span>HFS+
 and APFS are case&nbsp;<strong>insensitive</strong> and that is what we currently support and test on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we really appreciated the effort that went into this the team went ahead and fixed your issue :) . Come next update mail merge with labels should work with APFS + case sensitivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For future APFS related bugs please feel free to alert us but I cannot guarantee we will have the resources to fix them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your patience,</p>
<p>Diego!<br />

<h2>            How are notes sorted within a section&#63;</h2>
                    I've just started using OneNote on my Windows 10 PC as well as my iPad and iPhone.&nbsp; I can't figure out how Notes are sorted within a section.&nbsp; I've seen comments on this forum that indicate it's not possible natively to sort alphabetically (which is a
 great surprise) but I can't figure out how they <em>actually </em><em>are</em> sorted.&nbsp; It's certainly not by creation date or by any order I can figure out.&nbsp; Thanks for any help.

 I use, especially my Microsoft account; however, I am unable to make an "alias" since I have never verified Email A and cannot verify Email A which means I cannot make Email B my primary Microsoft email. Someone please help me with this or direct me to where

            <p>I am not sure who marked this as the answer, or helpful. I hope that it wasn't the original poster, because this answer does not address the problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If your original account is not accessible (the email address no longer exists), then obviously "No just get access again okay [ticket closed]" is not a helpful or even useful reply from technical support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How are we supposed to add a new email address to our account if we cannot verify the email that is the primary alias of the account?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seemingly, the answer is "You can't". This is why you either ask people to verify immediately or provide other means of verification when you build your authentication system. Any support would be great.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, linking to a publicly accessible help page off of the FAQ is NOT support. Oh, and "notify me when someone responds" is also nonsensical for account issues.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Latest Office Update with the &#39;Auto Save&#39; feature has Offices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul_858  say:</h3>
<h2>            Latest Office Update with the &#39;Auto Save&#39; feature has Offices apps crashing 3-4 times a day</h2>
                    <p>So this just started with the latest update that added the 'Auto Save' feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel, Word, Power Point will all crash at very random times throughout the day - nothing even close to this was happening before this update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is all up-to-date. &nbsp;Office is all up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also use One Drive for Business with these Office apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else experiencing this since the 'Auto Save' was implemented?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only silver lining is that the Auto Save feature (which is on and working), is recovering everything after each crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's still annoying though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The crashes are also happening when I am away from the computer, and when the programs are in the background - so it's not some specific thing to do with me interacting/using them that is causing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing your experience with us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The AutoSave feature was added in Office 1707 version and please make sure you have installed the latest version of Office 1707(8326.2076).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, to verify this issue whether related to AutoSave feature, please try saving your files to your local machine(such as desktop), then AutoSave is disabled and check whether Excel crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we would like to confirm the following information with you:</p>
<p>1) Where your files saved, OneDrive for Business or SharePoint Online?</p>
<p>2) Do all Office applications(Word, Excel &amp; PowerPoint) crash?</p>
<p>3) Go to Excel &gt; File &gt; Account to capture a screenshot about <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/About-Office-What-version-of-Office-am-I-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems like I was one version behind. &nbsp;I just updated to the 1707(8326.2076) version from 1707(8236.2073).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will monitor it and see if it still happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All files I work with are on Sharepoint using One Drive for Business. &nbsp;If it persists, I will try copying to local and see if that solves it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am still experiencing the crashes - and it looks like it's only for Sharepoint saves files. &nbsp;The ones I test on my local hard rive haven't made the Office applications crash yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the main office applications with Sharepoint saved files are crashing - PPT, Word, and Excel. &nbsp;The crashes still seem random. &nbsp;I can leave my computer for 10 mins and come back and one of the Office programs has crashed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's happening about 3-4 times a day in the normal course of working on them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to the last Office update before the Auto Save feature, I didn't have this issue - if anything, I could count on one hand how many times Office had crashed over the past two years.</p>

<p>Hi William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed all of the credentials related to Office (there were many).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted and Office automatically logged me in under my business account, and my personal account become a 'connected service'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to have solved the problem. &nbsp;I went for a whole day yesterday without a crash - which hasn't happened in a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Paul</p>

<p>So I am now back to daily crashes again after removing all the credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's almost as if the credential removal solved it, but when they all came back it started again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's still really random. &nbsp;I won't even have PPT focused and I will just get a crash message. &nbsp;If anything, they seem to crash more while in the background than when I am using them.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Look, this is getting a little silly. &nbsp;Of course you can't replicate the issue on your end - there are endless combinations of logins/locations/files/ etc. that are probably causing this. &nbsp;There must be some log file somewhere that is detailing
 out what's happening on my machine? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To re-cap, since Auto Save for Sharepoint/OneDrive files was added, my apps are crashing every day, multiple times a day. &nbsp;I am going to be turning Auto Save off on everything.</p>

</p><p>I understand that you don't want Outlook.com to show the frequent email list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this feature can not be turned off. Alternatively you can X the frequent email contacts, so that it wont pop up.</p>

<h2>            Author visit using Skype</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Planning an author visit in a few weeks via Skype because the author lives in another country.&nbsp; Is there a way on Skype to videotape the author visit?&nbsp; I'm hoping to have the interview available as a resource to make available to students,
 teachers, parents.&nbsp; Just wondering if Skype had a feature to videotape?&nbsp; Thank you.

</p><p>Skype does not have a native option to record any audio or video calls. If you wish to do so, you may need to use a third party recording app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you're using the new Skype (UPW), unfortunately, it does not support any third party recording&nbsp;apps. In this case, if you have previously installed the classic Skype 7.40 and still have it, you can initiate the video call from there then use
 whichever third party recording app you installed to start recording the video call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the side note, the classic Skype was removed from the Skype's download page due to an issue with the program that installs lower version of Skype.</p>

<h2>            Files are getting deleted automatically whenever I left click on them&#63;</h2>
                    So, whenever I left click on a folder or a file it gets deleted automatically. Then again when I try to recover my files from recycle bin a pop up comes up which says "do you want to delete your files permanently". My icons are also disappearing from my
 desktop whenever I left click on them. I have reset the windows several times but it didn't&nbsp; work out . Then I decided to reinstall windows but again it didn't work out. I have scanned the whole pc with windows defender but no threats were found.&nbsp; The problem
 still exist.

<p>I'd check whether your mouse or track pad device has some form of macro or similar configuration capability that allows it to be programmed to perform a sequence of key-press combinations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this were programmed to perform a select, delete sequence, that might explain it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also possible that some key on your keyboard is "stuck" either physically or logically, such as the delete key appearing to be pressed which is causing any file selected to be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, since you've already tried both a reset and complete reinstall of the operating system, it seems unlikely the problem is within that software and instead found in either hardware or possibly firmware that identifies and creates the key code
 sequences from your mouse/pad or another physical device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can easily swap that specific mouse and/or keyboard device with those from another PC, that's typically an easier way to trouble-shoot such hardware issues.</p>

            Hi ARNAB 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Sounds like an issue with your mouse.
<br />Try using another one.
<br />This maybe an issue with your drivers. 
<br />Try these steps. 
<br />
<br />Select the Start button, type Device Manager, and select it from the list of results. 
<br />Expand Mice and Other Pointing Devices then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select Update Driver. 
<br />Select Search automatically for updated driver software and follow the on-screen instructions to update the drivers. 
<br />If no updates were found, then right-click on the mouse select Uninstall. 
<br />Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />And if none of the above works then best to go to the vendors site and download the latest drivers for your device.
<br />So for example, if your computer is a Dell Latitude then you would go here.
<br /><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/latitude-3570-laptop/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/produ...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure to download the drivers for the system type of your machine.
<br />To find this out go search and type system.
<br />Look for the system type.
<br />It will either be 32bit or 64bit.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Hoping I can find an answer here. I'm trying to find out how I can reduce the Outlook cache from the default 12 month to something less. I want to enforce this at the exchange (online) level for all users.</p>
<p>I can't find anything obvious in o365 EAC and google didn't help out much hence why I hit the forums.</p>
<p>Let me know if any more info is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>This is when more information would really help. have you done what I suggested. Looks like you are using WU. Is this a tablet, what capacity is the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you just download the ISO image and copy that on a USB flash card. Right-click on the ISO image to mount the file, and then run setup.exe from within windows. You can get that here:</p>

<h2>            Where did &#34;my favorites&#34; go&#63; - How can I go back to Internet Explorer 8</h2>
                    I am not computer savvy but, I could get around in IE8. I can't even find my favorites and that was something I used all the time. Can I just go back to IE8 and if so will it be easy because again, I am not computer savvy?

            You mention Outlook 2010 but have posted to an Office 2013 group, you then mention both outlook.com and office 365 - All in all its completeley unclear what office/outlook version you are using with what mail account<br />
And without knowing the basics no one can offer anything

<h2>            Mailbox stays hidden from address lists</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would like to unhide a mailbox for the purpose of sharing it's calendar. I tried sending an invitation request but it's unable to find the calendar (presumably because it's hidden). We use dirsync. So changing the "Hide from address lists" checkbox in
 the portal is not possible, instead I changed the AD attribute "msExchHideFromAddressLists" to false and performed a sync. However it's not changing anything, when I check the operations in Synchronization Service Manager it seems to replicate fine, even tried
 doing a full sync.</p>
<p>I'm not 100% sure anymore but I think this mailbox started out as a shared mailbox and later got converted to a user mailbox, I probably ticked the box "Hide from address lists" while it was a shared mailbox. If I can avoid it I'd rather not convert it back
 even if it is temperately.</p>
<p>Any clue on how to solve this?</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br />
Sir 007</p>

<p>I can't believe how this was solved, my colleague pointed out an empty mailnickname attribute might be an issue. So we filled it in equal to the UPN. Mailbox is no longer hidden after sync, didn't even need to install a server :)</p>

<h2>            No Sounds after upgrading to windows 10 PRO 64bit</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently using Sony Vaio model: VPCEG35EG.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded my Windows 8.1 Pro yesterday to Windows 10 Pro and I noticed that I don't have any sounds. The current driver installed is Conexant Smart/Audio HD. I tried searching for the appropriate driver in Sony Vaio Website Support but could not find one
 for windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that whenever I tried to type "@" symbol it would came out as a " symbol instead of a @,&nbsp; When I type "#" it comes up with a £ symbol instead of a #.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

Thank you for your reply. I have tried signing into portal, but again, I was directed to the new Onedrive. The thing is that, both old and new Onedrive use the same email account as I sent you in the PM.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(117, 117, 117, 1)">&nbsp;I did asked the Shool's IT department. They have tried everything to help me. Here are what they did:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(117, 117, 117, 1)">- They removed the new licence from my account. Then I tried loging in again, but I still be directed to the new Onedrive.&nbsp;<br />
- They tried to block my email from the school's office 365 service in hope that I may be directed to the old Onedrive. But then I could not log in any more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I will try to contact the IT admin again to try following your instruction, or do you have any other susgession please tell me.
</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>

<h3> kronflux  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Infinite &#34;This PC&#34; bug</h2>
                    <p>It seems that when you show the "This PC" icon on the desktop, then delete files(files that are protected or undeletable seem to be more likely to cause the issue), a new icon appears on the desktop.</p>
<p>If you keep doing it, it keeps filling up the desktop.</p>
<p>If you refresh the desktop, they all disappear, but it's still interesting, and annoying.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>From the issue description, I understand that you are facing issues while accessing "This PC" on the computer. We will help you to resolve the issue with the computer. Please provide us with the following information to assist you in a better way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Do you get any error message when you are accessing "This PC"?</p>
<p>2. Have you made any recent hardware or software changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be facing this issue due to several reasons like virus attack, third party software conflicts, corrupt user settings etc. I suggest you to try the following steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can&nbsp;perform Microsoft Safety Scanner&nbsp;and scan for your computer for infections.<br />
To download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner, follow these steps: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the Microsoft Safety Scanner site at: Microsoft Safety Scanner <br />

&nbsp;<br />
b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Download Now.<br />
c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If prompted, click Run. Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the Microsoft Safety Scanner. When prompted, add a shortcut to the Microsoft Safety Scanner to your desktop.<br />
d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From your desktop, double click the Microsoft Safety Scanner icon. When the Microsoft Safety Scanner program launches, click Scan Type, then click Full Scan, then click Next.<br />
e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the scan is complete, remove all detected malware entries<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, you can try the following step and check.</p>

 Miliseconds to ACTUALLY READ what was written above, they would realize that ABSOLUTELY NOTHING they replied with is even REMOTELY relevant to the issue. In ABSOLUTELY NO WAY was it helpful to ANYONE nor did it address the BUG REPORT I was trying to provide.</p>
<p>I provided a way to reproduce the issue, as well as a screenshot showing the result of the issue if performed many times.</p>
<p>This was performed on a clean installation for the very purposes of confirming the issue. In no way was it intended to receive support, but rather to report the issue to the developers working on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a computer technician and general nerd who makes a living fixing Microsoft's mistakes, I am absolutely outraged at the ridiculously useless and quite frankly, dumb people Microsoft has employed.</p>

<p>Contact AVG and Norton for problems regarding those products.&nbsp; Also, you cannot have more than one realtime antimalware product installed.</p>
<p>If you are trying to install Microsoft Security Essentials, remove all other realtime antimalware, then use the manufacturer's cleanup tool, then restart the PC, then install Security Essentials.</p>
