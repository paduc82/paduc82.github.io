<h2>            McAfee Anit-Spam in Outlook &#40;how do I disable&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>This sub-folder just appeared under my Inbox folder in Outlook.&nbsp; I want to remove or disable the McAfee Anti-Spam.&nbsp; I've looked on the net for instructions.&nbsp; The only one I could find that was close to what I'm looking for is under File&gt;Options&gt;Add-ins&gt;COM
 Add-ins then hit Go...and deselect McAfee Anti-Spam option.&nbsp; I don't have that option to deselect. It's not even listed to deselect. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read to start the Norton or McAfee program on my PC (Windows 10 Pro) and deselect the email anti-spam program function that way, but I don't even have Norton Anti-Virus or McAfee Anti-Virus installed on my PC. I've never installed or purchased it. I've
 searched the programs/apps/System list with the name Norton or McAfee and nothing comes up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read that the McAfee Anti-Spam folder is part of Outlook, but everything I've read through Outlook says it's separate, or controlled by Norton/McAfee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what to try or look for. I have not contacted Norton or Outlook for help, yet.&nbsp; Hoping for some answers or guidance here.</p>

            What type of email account do you have configured in Outlook? POP, IMAP, Outlook.com, or Microsoft Exchange?  Some  IMAP servers use a folder named Spam for junk mail they filter at the server level. 
<br />
<br />If you don't use a 3rd party antivirus/antispam program, that wouldn't be the source of the folder.

            Hello sirbob8,
<br />
<br />I understand that you are creeped by McAfee Anti-Spam folder in your email account since you do not have a McAfee antivirus installed in the first place. I personally have one, but only after I have used my Microsoft email account on a computer with a complimentary McAfee antivirus installed.
<br />
<br />Since so, have you tried directly deleting it on Outlook.com? Right-click on McAfee Anti-Spam folder &gt; Delete folder. If it does not work, what is the error message?
<br />
<br />Hope to hear from you soon!
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />XP

            It doesn't look like they do spam filtering.
<br />
<br />Did you open the mailbox on another device that has MacAfee installed?

<p>HI XP,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did see that I could right click on the McAfee Anti-Spam folder and select delete. I'll be honest, I didn't initially do that as I wasn't sure if it would just delete the folder listing but still have emails labeled as [SPAM] and go somewhere I wasn't
 able to find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did delete the folder and it did disappear. I have not had the folder reappear as of yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<p>Hi Diane,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your patience and help.&nbsp; I did recently purchase a laptop that did have a free trial of McAfee Antivirus protection that I thought I disabled.&nbsp; I will check and see if I can disable it or delete it from my laptop as I have a subscription that
 lets me use Outlook on multiple devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will report back what I find.&nbsp; Thank you again,</p>

            If you aren't going to use MacAfee, uninstall it... and yes, that is likely where the folder came from. Once its uninstalled, you should be able to delete it from outlook.

            Hello sirbob8,
<br />
<br />I'm delighted that your issue is now resolved. It's my pleasure assist you.
<br />
<br />You don't have to worry about your spam protection because like you correctly said above, McAfee Anti-Spam isn't an Outlook.com function. You still have the Junk Mail folder.
<br />

<p>There is a program in the Windows 10 store called WP Message Backup which will bring your text message down to your PC. It works although it is not optimal because it brings all previous message down and I seem to be having an issue deleting the unwanted
 messages but they are all there so you would have your son's messages. It is worth checking out in my opinion.</p>

</p><p><em>Also, I tried this and it worked but secondary attempts I've had issues with although I'm probably doing something wrong. It works fine for textx but in trying to send MMS, it worked initially but future attempts are failing to accept the email address.
 (<strong>Update: </strong>So I was able to send a few more MMS text messages and they went through. So it is not perfect but is a way to do it particularly if you want it in email format to save or forward)</em></p>
<p>

</p><p>I'm not sure this is the best option but it will work for texts. I just tried it and was able to get it to work. I created a new contact and
<em>Step 1</em>
<p><em>Open the "Contacts" list on your cell phone. Enter a new contact, listing the email address where you want your text message to be sent. Give it a name you can easily identify to avoid sending the message to the wrong contact. Click "OK" and check to
 see if the address is listed in your contacts.</em></p>
<em>Step 2</em>
<p><em>Open the text message in your inbox. Open the "Options" for the message and select "Forward." Select the contact you created in Step 1 and click "Send."</em></p>
<em>Step 3</em>
<p><em>Check your email inbox. Keep in mind that the message may not arrive immediately, but if it has still not arrived after a few hours, attempt to send it again. Depending on your cell phone provider, the message may be delivered as an attachment or as
 text within the email.</em></p>
<em>Step 4</em>
<p><em>Download the text message attachment and click "Save" when the download pop-up appears. Create a name for the file and save it as a text file, like a .doc or .txt. If the message was sent as text only in the e-mail, copy and paste the text into a text
 editor like Notepad or Word. Click "File," and then "Save as." Give the file a name when the "Save" pop-up appears. Press "Save." Your text message is now on your cell phone, in your email inbox and saved as a document on your computer.</em></p>

<p>I've got to admit that I'm basically just goofing around by complaining about this thing that Microsoft has designed into Windows 10 Mobile to help us set up Appointments based on certain words that it detects in Texts.
</p>
<p>I've seen it do it for airplane flights too. That might be a handy thing if it automatically fills in enough stuff.</p>
<p>I've also been having UPS shipments from Amazon stuff that I've ordered show us in my phone's Calendar as to when they're supposed to arrive and of course the same Appointment ends up displaying on my home computer's Outlook 2016 Calendar stuff on the Outlook
 Today main page.</p>

<p>Roy, can't you just uncheck the Notify Me box each time you Reply on something and then it won't harass your wife? Then you can just login later and your Profile Activity page will show you if anyone has Replied to your Replies.</p>

            Yes I suppose I could do that but I kind of like sitting in front of the tv and talking to people in the community and I like my phone alerting me when there is a response basically I'm saying I am lazy and like you earlier in basically just fooling around
 complaining about it to plus deep down I think my wife likes the fact that she can keep tabs on who I'm communicating with over the webb😈

<p>
</p><p>Even if you may not use Skype on a Windows operating system, adding new contacts on the New Skype desktop or mobile app is the same: the process has been streamlined, so the separate contact request is no longer needed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, the contact invitation is included within the first instant message you send to a new contact. When they click or tap on the Accept button within the app, they are added to your contact list and in turn you are added to theirs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This FAQ has more information:</p>

<h2>            IE10 is blocking pop ups windows fromn dynamics CRM online</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are using Internet Explorer v10 with CRM Dynamics Online (2011) and have found issues with IE blocking content.&nbsp; This ranges from icons to opening records.&nbsp; I have added our instance of dynamics to the safe list, lowered protection level to low AND tried
 disabling pop up blocker without any joy.&nbsp; The content being blocked is not bespoke but off the shelf (i.e. new booking).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            File extensions are changed to _exe, _zip ,etc&#47; while trying to download</h2>
                    Not sure if upgrading to IE10 caused this, but I don't think I had ever this problem before. &nbsp;Having said that, her is the story.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Whenever I try to download ANY file using IE10 (or even IE9 after I uninstalled 10), the file extensions are changed to _exe, _zip, etc., and obviously can't RUN the file. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- The download bar on the bottom can't be even closed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- IE 9 has the same issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Reinstalling IE10 doesn't solve any.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-Tried to run FixIt, but since it requires running a link - .exe file -, it can't even begin.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- As a bonus problem, again although I'm not sure if it is related, Netflix is bugged with DRM management error, even after trying all the possible solution like removing .hds file on /playerready/ folder, or even reinstalling Silverlight, or running FixIt.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- CCleaner shows a registry problem like this :&nbsp;Unused File Extension<span> </span>
{80b8c23c-16e0-4cd8-bbc3-cecec9a78b79}<span> </span>HKCR\{80b8c23c-16e0-4cd8-bbc3-cecec9a78b79}. &nbsp;Even after being fixed, it comes back just one page loading on the explorer.</div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>What shall I do now? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Addendum: Just ran FixIt - "IE Performance and Safety" - by downloading it on Chrome. &nbsp;It detected and fixed below, but IE still has the same issue, and when the FixIt was run again, it detected the same issue again, as if it has been never fixed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Issues found</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Data Execution Prevention disabledData Execution Prevention disabled</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; leave the computer vulnerable to remote code execution threats.Detected</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Enable Data Execution PreventionNot Run</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Addendum 2: Ran WindowsUpdateDiagnostic, and it showed,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Problems installing recent updates &nbsp;- Not fixed</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Check for missing or corrupt files - Detected</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some security setting are missing or have been changed - Fixed</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Service registration is missing or corrupt - Fixed</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After restart, WindowsUpdateDiagnostic shows the same message again. &nbsp;I repeated it a few more times with always the same result. &nbsp;I checked the update history, and there I found the same Silverlight security update (KB2818124) have been installed three
 times. &nbsp;</div>

            Thank you for the step-by-step instruction. &nbsp;I will try it when I get back home. &nbsp;Just to clarify, is it going to solve the problem with other extensions besides .exe? &nbsp;Also, can you verify the text again? Is that correct the first line has "-" in front
 of HKEY? &nbsp;

            Same issue. I have fixed it in the past and it just comes back. Chrome or Opera will always work, hassle free. Is it a Registry Cleaner that could be changing this? I frequently use CCleaner, Glary, Spybot to clean IE 11 on Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You are confusing things here by introducing the VERY SEPARATE concept of a .bat file vs that of .vbs file. (to be honest, it was me introducing this confusing).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A vbs file is a windows scripting file and has little or nothing to do with a windows BAT file.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The example I posted allows you to DIRECTLY call a VBA subroutine in a standard Access code module. However, you don’t have to necessary use windows scripting.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you going to use the /x and a bat file, then of course you are not wanting anything to do with vbs scripting.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So your file should have the file extension .bat. (perhaps your example you have was a type-o).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>With your example, then your file should be beeptest.bat</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>And your command inside of the bat file looks ok.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So from the command prompt, you will type in beepTest.bat</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You will of course have to provide the full path name to beepTest.bat, or at the cmd line prompt “navigate” and ensure that you are in the same folder (documents) as per your example.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The command prompt usually “starts” out in the folder:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>C:\Users\&lt;your user name&gt;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You have to do a cd to the documents folder first, or as noted type in the full path name to the BeepTest.bat file at the cmd prompt.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h3> carash429  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to auto fill in a summary sheet in Excel 2007</h2>
                    <p>I'm creating a summary sheet to summarize values from&nbsp;current existing detailed worksheets.&nbsp; I just can't figure how to do an auto fill on the summary sheet. to reference cells on the detailed worksheets.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The worksheets are named 100, 101, 102, 103 etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On&nbsp;the summary worksheet I have as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In&nbsp;cell A3 I've typed&nbsp; ='100'!$M$1 and it returns the proper value from Sheet "100" cell M1</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get it to auto fill down column A to read as follows</p>
<p>
</p><p>A4 - '100'!$M$1</p>
<p>A5 - '101'!$M$1</p>
<p>A6 - '102'!$M$1</p>
<p>A7 - '103'!$MS1</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have many other cells to summarize the&nbsp;summary worksheet, not just the one column of cells, so I'd really like to learn how to do it automatically versus manual entry.&nbsp; I feel this is something so simple that I'm overlooking, but I'm stumped and can't
 seem to find a posted answer.</p>

            ROWS counts the number of rows between whatever is within brackets. Hence $1:100 gives 100 rows. When you drag it $1 remains as it is because it has $ with it but 100 gets incremented by 101. Hence, ROWS($1:101) will give you 101 and so on...

<p>Thanks for posting this John. As of yesterday, for some reason, using Edge I am seeing the working threads without the listing choice again. Have they reverted back, as all seems to be as it was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: Replied to another thread to help someone, got the famous Oops Error. I removed the link I posted, and then it went through. Had to edit my comment to put the link back in. Why all the issues?</p>

<p>No, it's still the same, I'm afraid. The default you get is assigned randomly, which is why you will see it change. Hopefully, this experiment won't go on much longer. I've no idea why the other problems are occurring. I tried to connect to CK's FBH post
 but I got the message 'Your account doesn't have access to this feedback'. I tried five times with the same result then, on the sixth attempt, I got in.

            That's because the options are assigned at random. You're one of the lucky ones that got Sort by Oldest reply.

    <title>Pulling Data From Mileage Chart Based on Selections from Two Drop Down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> exceldude420  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pulling Data From Mileage Chart Based on Selections from Two Drop Down Menus</h2>
                    <p>I've created a mileage chart showing distance in miles between multiple locations.&nbsp; The mileage on the chart is pulling the data from a separate sheet that is using a Google Maps code module to autocalc the mileage.&nbsp; I'd like to be able to pick two destinations
 from two separate pull down lists and have a cell that shows that distance.&nbsp; For example, in cell A2 select the starting location from a pull down list.&nbsp; In B2, select the end destination from a pull down list.&nbsp; In C2, show the mileage between those two destinations
 based on the data in the mileage chart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've shown an example below.&nbsp; In red is the formula I'm using in C2.&nbsp; I keep getting a N/A answer.&nbsp; Again, the mileage data show in each cell in the chart below is referencing another sheet that has the mileage between all locations (='SHEET1'!C2, etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a second note, I left the upper left half of the data chart blank since the information is essentially redundant with the lower left data on the table.&nbsp; I tried to cut and past the data from the columns into the rows but I can't seem to get that to work.&nbsp;
 When I copy C6 to D5 and then try to drag copy to fill in the rest of row 5, I'm unable to transpose the data from a column to a row.&nbsp; Instead each progressive cell references data from the subsequent columns on the reference sheet...&nbsp;</p>

<br />Get Mileage from Excel Lookup Table
<br /><a href="http://blog.contextures.com/archives/2013/05/09/get-mileage-from-excel-lookup-table/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.contextures.com/archives/2013/05/09...</a>
<br />By Debra Dalgleish, on May 9th, 2013
<br />There is a new sample file on my website, in response to a lookup question that someone asked on my Contextures Facebook page.
<br />I'm staring at a huge spreadsheet showing the distances in miles between a few hundred job sites…Our data is accurate, but the users often enter the wrong mileage data because it's easy to make a mistake when scrolling…
<br />How can I automate this process so that I can just enter the departure site and the arrival site and retrieve the distance between the two?

<p>That worked perfect... Thank you!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding my second question, I need to populate the upper right cells on the chart in my example... I was able to drag paste everything on the lower left of the table but I can't drag and copy into the upper right without the formula referencing the wrong
 cells from the other sheet.&nbsp; Is there a way to do this without creating a reference for each individual cell (my real spreadsheet is huge!). &nbsp;</p>

            I am not sure I understand what you want to do with the data, but it sounds like you are trying to "transpose" the data, converting rows into columns.
<br />
<br />These articles show how to do that:

<p>Let me try to clarify (as i'm having trouble translating into words...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see below.&nbsp; My cells above and to the right of my zero values are blank.&nbsp; If I copy the cell containing the value "19" in Cell B3 (distance between point B and point A) and paste it into the blank cell for distance between point A and point B
 and then try to drag copy that to the right to fill in the other blank cells, it doesn't transpose correctly.&nbsp; For example, I create the formula =B3 in Cell C2.&nbsp; I try to drag copy cell C2 to the right to fill in all the values for row 2. When I do so I want
 each subsequent cell to reference column be but reference the next row... =B3, =B4, =B5.&nbsp; In essence I want to lock the column but not the number (I know you can lock with "$" but doesn't seem to work to just lock column or row within the formula).&nbsp; Rather
 than cell D2 showing a formula of =B4, it references =C4.&nbsp; I want the column to stay static when I drag copy and the reference row to stay the same.&nbsp;</p>

            OK.  
<br />
<br />It sounds like $b4 should work to do what you want.
<br />
<br />Lets try a slightly different approach.
<br />
<br />Take your data and define it as a table. You can use the &lt;CTL&gt;&lt;T&gt; shortcut or Inert tab &gt; Table group &gt; Table button. 
<br />
<br />After you apply the table definition try entering the equations you want. At some point Excel will try to guess an match the pattern you using. If it gets it wrong, undo it and keep going until the automation works. 
<br />
<br />Excel tables are really a great feature. I can give you some more links about them if you are interested.

            Sure, that was going to be my next suggestion.  Strip it down, removing any sensitive data while still providing enough examples to work with.
<br />
<br />Include comments describing what you want to do. Give us an example row (or column) or two to show us what you want to do if you can create them manually (by formula if you can, or by hard coded values if you must). 
<br />
<br />Then upload it to your onedrive. Copy a Share / Edit link and paste it in to a reply here so we can look at it and down load it to "play" with it.

            T9 supports the languages you can change the phone user interface to use. As far as I know, additional T9 languages cannot be added individually.

            I have just bought an N73-1 in Syria. It has predictive text dictionaries in English, French and Arabic. I actually need English, French and Italian. How does one change the dictionaries for predictive text?

            Dear Petrib,<br />
I did read your post.<br />
Am I able to substitute the current dictionaries on my N73 for the T9 dictionaries that include English, French and Italian? Nokia have suggested that I can get the dictionary from the "Software Market" on their website.

            No. The T9 dictionaries are tied to whatever languages the phone firmware supports.<br />
<br />
Separate dictionary apps like SlovoEd, etc., you can install as many you wish (from Nokia Software Market or where ever), and they can support various language dictionaries, but they will have no effect whatsoever on what T9 languages are supported.

            If I update the firmware of the phone from the Nokia UK site, will that give me the T9 dictionaries that include English French and Italian?<br />
<br />
All I need is these dictionaries for the predictive text feature of text messaging.

    <title>downloading file issues with ie 11 since upgrading to windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seapro220  say:</h3>
<h2>            downloading file issues with ie 11 since upgrading to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have several users that are experiencing issues download files.&nbsp; those files could be 'hyper-linked' files from websites that are actually .pdf, .xls, .doc or even .ica files which launch in citrix.&nbsp; this seems to be a wide spread issue since windows 10
 sp1 has come out and it is getting worse.&nbsp; I used to be able to get the users to 'download/launch/open' those files by switching to Edge but even that is failing now.&nbsp; I've tried resetting IE - file associations and applications to be sure that .pdf opens
 with adobe, or .xls opens with the excel program.&nbsp; I've tried adding those 'sites' to their trusted sites locations but am not getting anywhere.&nbsp; sometimes one of the listed 'patches' mentioned above works - but only for a few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>anybody else out there having these issues - or know a fix? I can always install Chrome but our company policy is to use IE and out clients require IE for connecting to their citrix farms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
<br />
The downloading issue you're experiencing on your Internet Explorer and Edge might be due to corrupted system files.<br />
<br />
Is your PC under a domain? Do you have administrator rights on your PC? Are the web browsers inside Citrix?<br />
<br />
Have you tried turning off your Internet Explorer add-ons? How about on Edge?<br />
<br />
After upgrading to Windows 10, did you make sure that you got the latest updates for it?<br />
<br />
If you have administrator rights and turning off the add-ons didn't work, let's <strong>
reset the Internet Explorer</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Close all Internet Explorer windows. Select the <strong>Tools </strong>button, and then select<strong> Internet options</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, and then select <strong>Reset</strong>.<br />
</li><li>In the <strong>Reset Internet Explorer Settings</strong> dialog box, select <strong>
Reset</strong>.<br />
</li><li>When Internet Explorer finishes applying default settings, select<strong> Close</strong>, and then select
<strong>OK</strong>. Restart your PC to apply changes.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes the machine is part of a domain - and I am using the domain admin (even local admin) accounts whenever I log in.&nbsp; I have even elevated those users' accounts to 'admin' and it still doesn't fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No citrix browser here.&nbsp; Not to be confusing - but whenever I try to download the citrix .ica file, is when I experience the issue.&nbsp; this is true for 'other' applications also - maybe a webpage with a .doc, .xls, or .pdf file.&nbsp; The browser doesn't seem to
 recognize that the 'hyperlink' is actually a 'file' of some type (.ics,pdf,etc) but rather treats it as some type of long filename w/o any references to a application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge seems to work as a backup - for then after a couple of days it begins to do the same thing and I have to install Chrome to have the users work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting IE doesn't seem to work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Citrix side I've found a strange work around with IE.&nbsp; If I boot the machine up in the am and try to launch the citrix application - it fails.&nbsp; If I restart - not shutdown and restart, but restart - then I can launch/open the associated .ica file
 as a download.&nbsp; how about that option ???</p>

 on the go, and access files occasionally for emails when neither are an option. Now obviously I can connect a NAS no problem to the pcs, but I can't seem to nativly add a network folder tp the phone. I could use either a cloud device, but I could also build
 a rack style Nas no problem. What would the best option be to access these files?&nbsp;</p>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>the Excel Mobile functionality is a very reduced sub-set compared to Excel on a PC or Mac. You cannot expect the full functionality of Excel to work on a mobile phone, especially an iPhone, which has a completely different operating system from whatever
 Excel has been developed for.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Printing a spreadsheet is not a trivial task. Cells need to be sized, pages need to be broken, etc.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Excel Mobile for iOS currently struggles with some VERY basic Excel functionality like conditional formatting or data validation.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>In this context it does not surprise that printing does not work. It's about a hundred times more complex than data validation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, if you really, really need to print the Excel file on your iPhone, and you happen to be in range of a printer that actually talks to your phone, chances are that this printer is also connected to a computer and that said computer is connected to the
 internet.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The easiest and fastest way to print your file is to log in to your Skydrive account on the computer and print from there.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm sure Excel Mobile will get there in the end. But the product has only been released a few months ago as an iPhone application and there are still a lot of functionality gaps compared to the mature Excel on Windows that people have been using on PCs
 for the last 20 years.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            using the Proper function</h2>
                    My spreadsheet text is all capital letters. I want the first and last names and addresses to have the first letters capitalized. I have tried using the function Proper, but I can't make the letters change. what am I doing wrong?
