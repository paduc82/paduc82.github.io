                    <p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I have noticed that I am "missing" emails coming in, i.e., the emails themselves are not missing but I am not spotting them coming in. This happens particularily when I close the cover of my Macbook Air (for a few hours).....it goes into Sleep mode, and when
 I come back and open my email programme.....new messages have arrived but they look "read" not unread, as compared to when I am just sitting here using my computer, a new message will arrive and remain "bolded" until I read it.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I don't think this has anything to do with the Preferences....Reading...mark mail as read after ___ seconds because presumably when my cover is closed, the laptop is not "reading" the mail.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Does anyone have any ideas why, when my mail downloads from the server when my laptop is closed, the incoming mails all show as read even when I haven't read them yet? (they are no longer bolded which means I am not noticing some of my new email.</p>

            <p>Hi Arshad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply-yes, I do have the same account configured in a Windows Live Mail program and on my iPhone, however I'm quite sure (not 100%) certain-that even when the emails haven't yet downloaded to the other devices (they are both configured as
 pop3) I still receive unread messages that appear "read"-not bolded. I am testing this out now as I left my work computer to *not* download messages tonight so I will see in the AM whether I can see any "unread" emails on my Mac.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account with the issue is a btinternet.com account. All of my email accounts are btinternet.com</p>
<p>

            Mine are also coming through as read on my new PC running windows 10. I had to set the account up as an IMAP as POP3 was just not working (talk talk). I have unticked the 'mark as read after....' box. I also have the same account on my windows tablet an
 Blackberry phone, which I assume are set up as POP3 accounts (and leave email on server is ticked) - could this be the problem and any ideas how I stop them coming through as read?

<h3> philgf  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2010 can&#39;t connect to Windows Live</h2>
                    
<p>I have Office 2010 which is updated on my Windows 7 {64bit} on my computer. The OS is updated too.</p>
<p>I bought a Windows 7 phone {Samsung Focus} and I created a Windows Live account plus I installed Live Essentials on my computer. If I'm correct, I need to use Skydrive to sync OneNote between my computer and phone.</p>
<p>The problem is that OneNote can't connect to Live. I've been trying for days. I have 6 notebooks in OneNote. I choose to share on the web, the web location is Windows Live. After the pop up of contacting server comes up I get the message " Unable to connect
 to Windows live. Below this there is just the icon "Share Notebook" which is grayed out.&nbsp; I've tried this with all of the notebooks. I have tried this while my Live account is open on the browser. As I understand a login window should pop up, however this
 never pops up. OneNote on its own is deciding to locate and log on with the credentials.</p>
<p>I'm going crazy over this, any help is appreciated!</p>

            I have figured this out, after trying all the things above. &nbsp;It came down to one thing, two-factor authentication. &nbsp;If you have this enabled, to sign into OneNote on your PC you have to use your App Password, not your actual password to your Live account.
 &nbsp;So log into your Live account, Click on Security Info, and then click create a new app password. &nbsp;It will then display the current, or new, app password. &nbsp;Now use that password that it gives you in OneNote and everything should sign right in. &nbsp;Now I am able
 to sync all my files from OneNote to my phone without any issues, without messing with IE settings, and all that other stuff.

            Hi There,<br />
<br />
Not sure if you have resolved this issue yet!<br />
<br />
I recently had the same issue on my Windows 7 64-bit pc, when I tried to connect to my Sky Drive account through One Note I was experiencing 'Can't Connect Error', Tried restarting WebClient and cached credentials this did'nt work, found out this was not related
 to any services but related to IE settings, by performing a reset of all settings and advanced settings this corrected the issue, I am now able to connect Sky Drive via One Note with out any problems<br />

    <title>Free &#34;Windows 10 Home with Bing&#34; Edition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> musafir_86  say:</h3>
<h2>            Free &#34;Windows 10 Home with Bing&#34; Edition</h2>
                    Hello and good day,<br />
<br />
I have one suggestion: Microsoft should make "Windows 10 Home with Bing" (or something similar) available directly to the general public at no cost (free of charge). Instead, Microsoft could have a continuous revenue stream/sources from the built-in Bing-based
 services. Here's how:<br />
<br />
1. Make Project Spartan/Edge browser as the default browser, and it CANNOT be changed. But third-party web browsers should be able to be installed and used as usual; just they cannot be set as the default web app only. Alternatively, the user may choose between
 Edge or Internet Explorer to be the default browser.<br />
<br />
2. Make www.bing.com the only default homepage for Edge (and Internet Explorer), and it CANNOT be changed.<br />
<br />
3. Make Bing the default search engine/provider for Edge (and Internet Explorer), and it CANNOT be changed.<br />
<br />
4. Place the Edge icon (and maybe Internet Explorer too) on the Desktop, and it CANNOT be removed.<br />
<br />
5. Pin the Edge icon (and also maybe Internet Explorer) on the Taskbar, and it CANNOT be unpinned.<br />
<br />
Microsoft may choose to apply any of the options above (one or more), or maybe all together. Any modification attempts (directly or by ‘hacking’ the registry) will be greeted with a message/dialog box, such as “Sorry, this feature isn’t available in this edition
 of Windows. To use this feature, you can upgrade to a higher Windows edition. For more information, click here (link to Microsoft Store)”.<br />
<br />
If the user somehow successfully makes the changes (by editing the Registry or modifying system files), it’ll reverted back to the default (immediately, or on next logon/reboot). A warning message may appears, such as “Windows detected an attempt to tamper
 the default settings which violates your current Windows license agreement (EULA). For more information, click here (link to Microsoft Support/Store)”.<br />
<br />
The user could opt to upgrade to a paid Home or Pro editions easily by buying a new Product Key from Microsoft (a.k.a. Windows Anytime Upgrade).<br />
<br />
Furthermore, if necessary, Microsoft may make this free edition of Windows a bit ‘lighter’, i.e. it only contains a subset of Windows 10 Home features (e.g. as Windows 7 Home Basic to Windows 7 Home Premium). However, all core and primary Windows 10 features
 (that’s been advertised front and centre) should not be excluded. Also, the support options could be limited to community forum (Microsoft Answers), or by paying per-case basis.<br />
<br />
To clarify, this suggested free "Bing edition" for the general public is intended to be acquired and obtained directly from Microsoft (i.e. manually downloaded by the user). It is NOT to be bundled/pre-installed with any PCs or notebooks (and it should NOT
 be - as it will definitely trigger anti-trust complaints).<br />
<br />
The point here is for Microsoft to offer choices; there will be free edition, and there will be paid editions (normal Home and Pro) - the consumers can make their own choice. Those who choose not to pay, they can download, install, and use the free "Bing edition",
 and for those who don't like the limitations, they can choose to buy and use the paid editions - as usual.<br />
<br />
I believe there should NOT be any antitrust issues here as the user knowingly and willfully download and install the software (the EULA will be presented to the user first and foremost), and they have the option to buy the normal Home or Pro editions which
 don’t have the above limitations.<br />
<br />
Lastly, if somehow Microsoft cannot make a free edition for some reasons, a very low cost edition (under $10, with the above characteristics) is really, really welcomed.<br />
<br />
I’m positive that this move is in-line with the spirit of making Windows as a Service, as Microsoft planned.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

Furthermore, if necessary, Microsoft may make this free edition of Windows a bit ‘lighter’, i.e. it only contains a subset of Windows 10 Home features (e.g. as Windows 7 Home Basic to Windows 7 Home Premium). However, all core and primary Windows 10 features
 (that’s been advertised front and centre) should not be excluded. Also, the support options could be limited to community forum (Microsoft Answers), or by paying per-case basis.<br />
<br />
I believe there should NOT be any antitrust issues here as the user knowingly and wilfully download and install the software (the EULA will be presented to the user first and foremost), and they have the option to buy the normal Home or Pro editions which don’t
 have the above limitations.<br />
<br />
Lastly, if somehow Microsoft cannot make a free edition for some reasons, a very low cost edition (under $10, with the above characteristics) is really, really welcomed.<br />
<br />
I’m positive that this move is in-line with the spirit of making Windows as a Service, as Microsoft planned.<br />

To date, Windows 7 introduced the most editions (Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate, Enterprise, Embedded). Since the release of Windows 8, many of these editions have been consolidated to more specific devices and form factors. In addition to SKUs, Microsoft also provides Windows specific architectures that target the CPU (brains of your computer) in what are known as 32 and 64 bit versions. The capability is determined specifically by how much memory your computer is able to address. The more memory, the more programs you can run and the more tasks you can complete at the same time.

<p><strong>How much will Windows 10 cost?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft has not revealed all the details about pricing for Windows 10 yet, but they did announce that Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device

<br />
-One of the reasons I'm suggesting this partially because I don't like to install unlicensed copy of Windows every time someone send me a PC/laptop for me to repair, but they don't have a valid license nor they want to pay for a new license (due to currency
 exchange rate, Windows (and Office) licenses here are exorbitantly high, costing nearly half the cost of a new entry-level PC/laptop).</p>

            I'm pretty sure that "Windows 10 of any version" = "Windows 10 with Bing". Users will have to change their default settings if they don't want Bing baked into everything.

            Also I would be willing to bet that Windows 10 Home is going to remain a free upgrade even after the first year.&nbsp;I think they&nbsp;are putting the first year limitation on it to get people to upgrade right away. Assuming that is true then there is no need for
 Windows 10 with Bing because that's what the Home edition is.

            <p>I don't see this happening. I should say, I don't see anybody intentionally downloading and installing an OS like this for very long. As EULA's are notoriously contained within the "package", once people find out that it's nothing more than "adware", they
 will stop downloading it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember when I bought Office 97, the box contained a paper envelope that had a label stating: By opening this package, you agree to the EULA enclosed (or something to that effect)(the EULS was on the CD). Now tell me, how you can agree to something you
 can't read? NO, it wasn't on line either! (This must be where Nancy Pelosi got the idea for "let's just pass this thing so we can find out what's in it!", when the PPACA was passed).</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible solution? And I would<br />
update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are you positioned from the router? Are there
<br />
obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's tab - write
<br />
down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then<br />
Right Click on Wifi Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />

<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions. (The<br />
ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated drivers as Vista loves<br />
updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests one just HIDE it as they<br />
are almost alway old and you can look for drivers manually as needed.<br />

    <title>Using the SUBTOTAL Formula in conjuction with Sorting or can you use - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using the SUBTOTAL Formula in conjuction with Sorting or can you use SUBTOTAL to count strings of text&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using the SUBTOTAL formula to only count unhidden cells when using filters, but when I use sort, the cell names in the formula do not move around with the sorting at my results become wrong</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is my dataset not showing formulas:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6471dd89-edc4-45ec-b3f3-058b2b4a4bdf" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the formula view:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75833e17-4b85-4be1-bec1-c3cbf9e301c6" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lets say I filter the software column to just show Excel, here are my results:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a70b91f-fc31-4ae9-a8a0-4040e2f2f1c6" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the results that I want. (I don't want to count the hidden cells)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then lets say I sort the name column so the names now appear in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>This will change the order of my rows and usually&nbsp;formulas will change as well, but the cell names I put into the SUBTOTAL formula do not change I my Software totals become wrong when I use filter (see last screenshot):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2802878-0c6c-4303-a979-f6c75ff66284" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/560e4866-b524-435f-97ad-239fc9b29b34" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see, the totals now show 1 Excel and 1 Word which we know is wrong.</p>
<p>Is there anyway the SUBTOTAL formula can be used with a string of text so "Excel" will always be counted instead of the actual cell.</p>
<p>Or are there so other formulas I should be using to do this.</p>
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Sorry for all the pics, but I felt like an example would be the best way to explain my problem)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-Dan</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may simply create a Pivot Table- drag the Software column to the row labels and to the Value area section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hello Ashish,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been busy at work and finally got around to trying the Pivot Table Method, but it does not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I created the Pivot Table as you instructed (shown below):</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c6c49d3-87f9-4d9e-8d76-803d59a806ce" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But When I use the filters, the "Count of Software" Column does not update. see below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ex: lets say I just want to see Bob's software count, so I fiter the "User" Column to "Bob":</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a9d9f37-fb74-44e1-bcd8-cdd6d7786ca2" /></p>
<p>As you can see the Pivot Table shows all the software and not just Bob's</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need the counting to work with Filtering (by not counting hidden rows) AND Sorting (so when I sort it doesnt mess up my formulas, as I explained in my first post)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly apprieciated as this would make my record keeping and report making easier</p>

<h2>            IE 8 will not open all graphics or pictures on a website</h2>
                    After upgrading to IE 8 Ver: 8.0.6001.18702 when opening some web pages (not all)&nbsp;I get a message IE cannot open this page. Then I click the refresh button on the address bar the page opens okay,&nbsp;however some (not all)&nbsp;of the graphics or pictures on the
 page do not open (only an X place card appears) <br />
<br />
If after the cannot open message appears I click on the diagnostic link, the page will open in the backround behind the message. I then close the message (not running it) the page is okay. However&nbsp;some of the time all graphic open and sometimes graphic&nbsp;will
 not open as mentioned above.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Try adding those to your trusted sites in IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security - Trusted Sites.<br />
<br />
2. What antivirus/antispyware/security product do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER has on this<br />
machines including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause strange issues).<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
3. If no joy something maybe blocking it.<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;-&nbsp; click reset all zones to default - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
Close and restart IE and/or IE with no addons<br />
<br />
any better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java still installs it<br />
and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look right. Permitted<br />
are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program ask about it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and run - not all<br />
are bad however some can cause your issue (Toolbars are BHO's).<br />

<br />
4. Try these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
Run DiskCleanup - Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools - Disk Cleanup<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />

<br />
Then run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />

<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
5. Start - in search box type -&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; command<br />
<br />
at top of list find COMMAND - RIGHT CLICK on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Type the following commands (or copy and paste one at a time), each followed by pressing enter.
<p>ipconfig /flushdns</p>
<p>nbtstat -R</p>
<p>nbtstat -RR</p>
<p>netsh int reset all</p>
<p>netsh int ip reset</p>
<p>netsh winsock reset<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
That resets your TCP/IP stack<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
6. Perhaps using Compatibility Mode will help.<br />

<h2>            Internet Explorer 8 opens and closes immediately on Windows XP</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have read through many of the posts asking this same question, but I still can not get IE8 to work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Problem:</div>
<div>When I attempt to open IE8, the window flashes open for a few seconds and then closes immediately.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My System:</div>
<div>Windows XP Pro with SP3</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>First Noticed:</div>
<div>Noticed it after finding some kind of "7" search bar or toolbar on my PC (can't remember the name exactly) but also found some other things like 'Free Offers from Freeze', 'Free Music Downloads', 'Free Games!!', and 'Free Dolphin Screensaver'</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I deleted and uninstalled all that I could, then I started having problems with IE8 AND, I can not get my address bar to display anymore (even though it is already checked, the toolbars aren't locked and it isn't hidden anywhere that I can see) including
 in Windows Explorer, and I have to go in and re-enable Quick Launch every time I reboot and log in.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I have tried so far (from the best that I can recall because I have been working on this for 5 days now):</div>
<div>1. 'Restored Advanced Settings' for my internet options through Control Panel</div>
<div>2. Ran Mr Fix It to reset Internet Options (#<span>50195)&nbsp;</span>but it came back This Microsoft Fixit Failed to Process</div>
<div>3. I uninstalled IE8, and when it comes up in IE6, IE6 works except that it doesn't have an address bar.</div>
<div>4. I reintalled IE8, and I get the same problem.</div>
<div>5. I uninstalled and reinstalled IE8 several times, even turned off Norton firewall and antivirus during installation, and I get the same thing.</div>
<div>6. I ran Spybot Search and Destroy and Malawarebytes Anti-Malware (Spybot found a few things that I resolved and then running Malawarebytes came back clean)</div>
<div>7. Tried reinstalling IE8 after the scans, still the same thing.</div>
<div>8. Tried running a Mr Fixit for '<span>Fix Internet Explorer add-on problems when IE hangs or freezes'&nbsp;</span>but when I run it, I get 'troubleshooter
 has experienced and unexpected error and can not continue'</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So that is where I'm at. I tried researching the net, Microsoft Support, and the forums here but can't find a solution, and I REALLY don't want to reinstall XP.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />

            I fixed it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<div><br />
<div>You guys are NEVER going to believe what fixed it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As I was reading Robert's suggestion of starting in Safe Mode (which I had done before but was going to try again) I was running IE6.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Keep in mind IE6 wasn't 100% either...it was running, but I had no address bar and I couldn't print from IE or from Windows Live.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So to try that, I was going to reload IE8 but I was thinking that I've been going back and forth between IE6 and IE8, uninstalling IE8, but never uninstalling IE6.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So as I was going through the Add/Remove list of programs, I noticed the option on the left to remove Windows components.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So for the heck of it, I clicked on that and was going to remove Internet Explorer, but saw that the size was 0.0, so I thought that it wasn't there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But I still checked Internet Explorer and unchecked everything else and said to remove it, and it started removing stuff, also removing the Fax stuff.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After it completed, I clicked on the Internet Explorer icon and IE6 opened and I had my address bar back, and it was back in Windows Explorer too!!!!!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then went in and downloaded IE8 for XP, restarted, and IE8 came right up and I had an address bar on that too!!!.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That was it!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I spent a week working on this to avoid reloading XP because I didn't want to lose a bunch of stuff.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this helps someone else somewhere.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Thanks to the folks that took the time to read my question and respond with suggestions...even if it wasn't an exact fix, it helped lead me in the right direction to an eventual fix.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks All!!!!!</div>

    <title>Adding an electronic signature to a PDF&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob is interested  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding an electronic signature to a PDF&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It would be a good fax replacement if one could add an image of my signature to a document and email it to someone so it looks like I signed a piece of paper, scanned it, and sent it as a facsimile. &nbsp;But what about the background I wonder? &nbsp;Not all documents
 have the same background. &nbsp;Maybe a scanner is the best way but when you're traveling and don't have access to a scanner or fax? &nbsp;You could keep your electronic signature encrypted in the cloud; maybe various versions with different backgrounds.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had no idea what category to put this in!</p>

            Use a graphics format which allows a transparent background such as PNG format and replace the white background from your scanned signature with a transparent background. You can then insert the signature on any coloured background.<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows Defender behavior changed and now blocking almost all Adobe - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Defender behavior changed and now blocking almost all Adobe activity.</h2>
                    <p>I can only imagine this is related to a Windows recent update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been doing everything I can to keep up with all the errors in the Event Viewer but everytime I download and install a new Adobe product it hiccups again.&nbsp; While this was troublesome I was dealing with it as I could.&nbsp; Recently it cost me money because
 it interrupted a one time installation and the Adobe key no longer works.&nbsp; Please help me its now hitting my wallet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are all the programs that caused the Defender issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf73d63c-34f4-4e6c-88f6-3be47d91c769?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf73d63c-34f4-4e6c-88f6-3be47d91c769?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Im running Windows 10 Home edition.&nbsp; have an x64 based system</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again I had no problems with any of this until a recent update.&nbsp; version 1803 was successfully installed on 5/23/2018</p>
<p>2018-19 was successfully installed on 12/20 18.&nbsp; I also noted over 5 updates for Adobe Flash Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw some input with regard to programs installed directly by the user.&nbsp; I am the only "user" except for Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I could come up with was Adobe file locations.&nbsp; Some are in x86 Programs and the rest are in Programs as noted below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>x86 Programs:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6cd9a885-f5ee-4671-bf94-ce79fd841ac3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6cd9a885-f5ee-4671-bf94-ce79fd841ac3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Programs:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/533e2a28-7aab-41f8-bad5-a1eadf775077?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/533e2a28-7aab-41f8-bad5-a1eadf775077?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont know where to go with this any longer.&nbsp; Again this is a recent issue, never had a problem with any installations until 2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will look for responses but my direct email is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help is greatly appreciated.</p>

            Hi Phil.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Since Adobe is a paid product they should provide Support for this including patches if necessary.  I would not rely on Microsoft to push these out as they have too many fires to put out for mostly free users, while Adobe is focused on their apps and tending to subscribers who pay premium prices.  
<br />
<br />You can try disabling Controlled Folder Access to see if it resolves these problems.  It's been problematic from the start.  It may need more time to mature since it's relatively new.

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I appreciate that but one would think that the problem may be related to Microsoft's definition of what "friendly" is.&nbsp; It seems too obvious to suggest otherwise.&nbsp; How can Adobe change their installation so that Microsoft deems it as "friendly".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are saying they can do this, via a certificate or some other embedded piece of code then I understand.&nbsp; I will pass this along to them but I feel its going to be each one pointing at the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might suggest a solution is when Defender has issue to block something in the same screen you have the option to include it automatically in the list of exceptions and permit the update.&nbsp; Another alternative is to "trust all programs from Adobe".&nbsp; This
 clearly is under the control of Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the same operational behavior as most firewall issues.&nbsp; Pop a window, alert user to activity and allow user to pass it through (one time) or add to list (all times).&nbsp; Perhaps Im looking at it from the users perspective (although also a developer
 for 30 years).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont believe the issue is to disable it, but to alert everyone to an issue which needs to be added to the developers todo list.&nbsp; I gather this is not considered a priority yet and as more people speak up about this problem it may get moved up the queue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again I greatly appreciate your response, understand the issues surrounding it, and only hope that in the future it can be rectified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy 2019!</p>

<p>Hi PhilbertD,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are right in not wanting to kill your Ransomware protection. Really no need to anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">know</span> that Microsoft has already implemented the procedure that you are requesting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In W10 v1809 when you receive a "blocked" message regarding an App, you can easily allow</p>
<p>it to be White-Listed. Click on the notification, or on a notification in the taskbar regarding the</p>
<p>same, and you will be directed straightaway to the "Add an App" routine in WD. Clicking on the</p>
<p>+ sign (add an app), and a list of "all recently blocked Apps" is offerred. Open the list, and all that is required is a single click on&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">any</span> App contained in the list to add it to the "allowed" list.</p>
<p>Use caution, there may be some in the list that you might not want to allow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new procedure eliminates the need to obtain the full path of an App. No more searching</p>
<p>in the Event Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably the reason that Adobe keeps repeating is caused by its updates, making it look like</p>
<p>a different App. No way for Controlled Folder Access to recognize this. Or maybe just because</p>
<p>there are several different Apps within Adobe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,&nbsp; Glen</p>

<p>Thank you for a reasonable response, great minds think alike :)&nbsp; Sounds like a great way to eliminate a lot of issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have to figure out how to get Adobe to allow me to redownload the application *Dreanweaver" which was paid for and failed to load properly.&nbsp; Probably should have gone the way of free Expression Web 4&nbsp; :)</p>

            Phil -
<br />
<br />If you want to suggest this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback and may interact with you. But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your completed feedback (see Share link in feedback box) others can vote it up and add to it, and I will endorse it with my MVP badge and track the issue for you.

<p>Hi PhilbertD,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I failed to pick up before, that your problem with Controlled Folder Access, occurred as the result of the installation of a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, Microsoft's improvement to CFA, does not apply to an installation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to avoid a repeat of your problem, is to momentarily disable CFA when you install a program. If you are sure that it is safe. And re-enable CFA after the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you work it out with Adobe.&nbsp;&nbsp; Glen</p>

<h2>            Problem playing youtube videos on windows phone</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Nokia Lumia 520 phone. Until recently everything was fine, but lately, when accessing youtube videos, I get the message "Sorry, We cannot play this file on your phone." It was okay until around last week. The problem started out of nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to follow someone's suggestions on the forum to turn off cloud sync, but I couldn't find the cloud sync/backup options in music settings, but I have already turned off all backup in the Backup settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any information about how to solve the issue, request you to reply.</p>
<p>

<h3> rclaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to &#34;Mark all&#34; entries of a phrase to add to the index, regardless of formatting&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying to use the Indexing feature for Microsoft Word. When I highlight a word or phrase and click "mark entry", and when I click "Mark All" it seems to be formatting specific, for instance, it won't mark the same phrase in the document if it's underlined,
 or bold.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, I have a massive study guide. In some cases I have underlined text, sometimes I've bolded stuff, and sometimes they're big headings that are italicized, bold, different font, etc. What I would like to do is have the "mark entry" feature working exactly
 the same as find and replace. In other words, if I ctrl+f "fuzzy seals" I want all the results to be marked in an index entry under "fuzzy seals". Please help.<br />

<p>I replicated your text, but went full throttle with different formatting and it missed one of the document words. I'm including a screenshot. While it got&nbsp;<em>most</em> of them, it missed one. And in fact on my main document, it's missing ~4/5ths of them.
 Maybe this will help figure out what's going on. I might add, I made an extra page and highlighted the LAST "document" word on the second page (you can see which one I highlighted in the screenshot:</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>RCLaw,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We appreciate your efforts in providing us a screenshot. We noticed that a change in the letter case is the factor why you&nbsp;</span><span>missed one of the 'document' words. We tried replicating
 again using the same phrase. However, this time, we tried changing some of the letters to upper case. Here's a screenshot:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>An explanation of why the indexing code doesn't ignore letter cases may forestall some complaints.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the major uses of automatic indexing is to list people's names. However, many people's names are also common words all in lower case. If you're indexing a document about British Prime Ministers, you wouldn't want every occurrence of "may" to show
 up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps it would be useful if the Mark Entry dialog box had an option for "Case sensitive" that was checked by default but could be cleared.

                    <p>I attempted to add an Exchange email from my work and, I guess, I entered the wrong information. &nbsp;The startup window stops at "Loading Profile" and eventually says "The server is unavailable. Retry, Work Offline or Cancel." &nbsp;When I try to work offline it
 says "Outlook cannot log on. &nbsp;Verify you are connected to the network and are using the proper server and mailbox name. &nbsp;The connection Microsoft Exchange is unavailable. &nbsp;Outlook must be online or connected to completed this action." &nbsp;I hit OK and it brings
 up a small Microsoft Exchange box with my work email and server settings. &nbsp;I've verified the settings and it still will not connect, but now I cannot get any further. &nbsp;I can hit OK or Cancel. &nbsp;Both of them close Outlook and will not let me use the existing
 email accounts I have on there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling Outlook and even all of Office 2010, then reinstalling it but it keeps showing up with that Exchange email and won't let me go any further.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>As I do the send/receive, I recently began to get the error 0x800CC92 which stated "your e-mail server rejected your login... Server responded: -ERR Authentication failure: unknown user name or bad password."&nbsp; And it included something mentioning a &lt;CACHE
 FAIL&gt;.&nbsp; I am running multiple email accounts, but it's my hotmail account that gets the error.&nbsp; The account logs in perfectly the online outlook.com, but not with my desktop Outlook&nbsp; This has begun just this morning while I didn't even shut down my computer
 overnight.&nbsp; With plenty of experience working with Outlook 2010, I have had no issues for the last year.&nbsp; The previous, I ended up removing this account and adding it again, but that caused problems with a lot of internal settings and contents.&nbsp; In my research
 trying to fix this without causing problems again, all I could find is errors in the process of adding an account. With multiple accounts run through the outlook.com server, why am I getting this error on just one account suddenly?&nbsp; I have tried restarting
 the app, restarting the computer, quite a few re-logins, and the repair account which didn't 'establish network connection' , none of them worked.&nbsp; So, tell me what the problem would be and where I can find it so I can fix it letting me use my email again.&nbsp;
 Let me know if there's something I need to include to make it work again.<br />

            I am unable to send/receive on hotmail.com account via my client Outlook. I, like you, am managing multiple e-mail accounts (gmail is working for example). I can go to live mail for my hotmail account and see that everything is fine - I view unread emails,
 I can send emails, etc., but it is not syncing up with Outlook. The lower bar in Outlook keeps displaying "Disconnected" and if I do a send/receive all folders, only the hotmail account is showing errors. For the next 24 hours, I will work via live.mail rather
 than Outlook in hopes Microsoft can get this fixed.

<h2>            This email address is part of a reserved domain</h2>
                    <p>I accidentally deleted my live account and now all I get is this email is part of a reserved domain when I try to sign in. I have tried every way I can find to access the account and now tearing my hair out with total frustration. I need to access the account
 as it is the account I have used for most of my on line accounts. The added frustration also comes from the telephone number on these accounts no longer exists, the only way I have available to me is via email to change everything over to new details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This error “This email address is part of a reserved domain” usually occurs when you’re creating or associating a new email account. If you accidentally deleted your account, you’ll have 60 days before it’ll be permanently deleted. We suggest that you log
 in to your account through this <a href="https://outlook.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>. If in case you’re unable to do so, we recommend resetting the password by following the procedures on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026971/microsoft-account-how-to-reset-your-microsoft-account-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you have any other concerns, don’t hesitate to let us know. </p>

<p>Sorry, but I have already tried that one and just realized I didn't give all the info. When I try to sign in I get the message this email does not exist, so I try to set it up as a new email address, then I get the message telling me it is part of a reserved
 domain. I am presuming Microsoft security protocols have a safeguard in place for deleted email addresses, so as to stop any less honest people from being able to pose as someone else by using someones old email address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help, but without talking direct with Microsoft and giving them endless security info to prove I am the holder of the account, I have now managed to contact the accounts that were attached to my old email and change my details direct with
 them. It was a full two days of phone calls to different parts of USA and Europe, but, I am now back to normal, just nursing a well battered phone.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            DOCX &#40;or Word&#41; ZOOM CONTROL</h2>
                    <p>Okay I'm not a user of Word/Docx but it is the program my library offers. I have 2 questions, both having to do with the Menu/Toolbar:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't "Table Properties" have its own, <strong>permanent</strong> menu tab? It just seems so needlessly click-heavy to have to have the table created first to get the tab to display.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the program's "Zoom" feature so constricted?&nbsp; It's too difficult to let the User do what millions of other computer programs do: CTRL+ how ever many times you want the display to zoom in; CTRL- likewise, zooming out. It's a core feature? It's nuts!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or am I missing the menu option for selecting customized keystrokes?</p>

<p>The various table commands can't be used unless the insertion point is inside a table; that is why the Table tabs on the ribbon are hidden in other contexts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Word abandoned the classic menu interface in 2007, contextual tabs were a big part of the new design. Older versions only had contextual right-click menus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you hold the Ctrl key, you can then zoom with the scroll wheel on your mouse; this works the same in most Windows applications. If you want to save the zoom and view with a specific document, you'll need an add-in. Look for the SaveView2013.zip file on

<p>I know nothing about the program you referenced so I cannot comment.&nbsp; You can try it ... they say it is free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, I would recommend Spb TV.&nbsp; It is FREE and it works so check it out.</p>

<p>SPB TV is a highly usable IP-TV solution, optimized to run on mobile devices. SPB TV provides users with lots of live channels in multiple languages with easy-to-use features and settings. No subscription fee!</p>

            I had the chance of picking up my 128M iPAQ 210 from home and thoroughly tested Online TVx. In a word: it needs some MAJOR playback optimizations. All streams played with definitely inferior frame speed even in Portrait mode. This has further decreased
 to about 1-2 fps(!) in Landscape. Of course, there're no such poblems with either Spb TV (tested the latest version of it; it works wonderfully on my iPAQ) and only to a lesser degree with the built-in WMP (both in full screen mode) on the same PDA.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, give the trial (which plays back for 5 minutes uninterrupted) a thorough try on your phone before paying anything for it. It may behave far better on your phone than on mine. However, I'd still start with the Spb TV
 + wiitv combo – at least on my equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if you need more info on how you can easily add the stream addresses as favorites to IEM so that you don't end up having to fire up wwitv.com all the time you want to watch your favorite TV channels. It needs a bit of
 file editing and hacking.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail&#58; accounts don&#39;t sync&#59; can&#39;t remove&#47;edit accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows 10 Mail has been broken for a while and it's driving me crazy. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have four accounts: two gmail, one exchange and one Outlook account. The gmail and exchange accounts stopped syncing completely. I've tried to edit or remove them through account settings, but clicking the account in the "manage accounts" dialog doesn't
 produce the popup that allows you to edit or remove the account. I've tried resetting the mail app in settings &gt; apps and features, and I've tried completely removing and reinstalling windows 10 using windows powershell. None of this works: I get a pop up
 to tie a new account to windows 10 mail, and whatever I do (cancel, enter outlook..) I am presented with my old 4 accounts, three of which don't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on a Microsoft Surface Pro 4, running insider preview (slow ring).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
