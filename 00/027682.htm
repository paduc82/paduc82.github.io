<h2>            Rounded Rectangle Shape</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using&nbsp;Rounded Rectangle Shapes and when I add more text in them, I have to manually increase their height to see it. Is there a way I can see additional text without manually increasing height like it happens automatically in tables when we add more
 text? I just want to add more text and shapes increase their height automatically. Please guide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Which Office application? 
<br />
<br />Specifically which "shapes"?
<br />
<br />If you are using something like Word &gt; Insert tab &gt; Illustrations group &gt; Insert command, then NO, they do not autoresize.
<br />
<br />Try WordArt. The objects do not resize, but, the text resizes to fit.
<br />
<br />You could also use single cell tables, they can be set to resize to fit the text. You just can't make auto resizeable rounded corners (you can make rounded corners that you resize manually).

    <title>Sync MMS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cplush  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sync MMS</h2>
                    i was wondering if the syncing of MMS messages will appear in a&nbsp;upcoming update. SMS syncing is&nbsp;great, but i would also like to sync my MMS messages. i know it will take up more bandwidth etc, but that&nbsp;is a easy price to pay to have those backed up&nbsp;without
 haveing to forward the pics to my email. just&nbsp;easeier that way.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Great job so far&nbsp;for a&nbsp;beta!! its been working almost flawlessly for me, did have one instance on my&nbsp;initial sync where i recieved a phone call and it made me&nbsp;reauthorize&nbsp;the sync (something i think it should automatically do). &nbsp;

    <title>How can I get Word 2010 back&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronwy jones  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I get Word 2010 back&#63;</h2>
                    Word 2010 opens very slowly and 2 error boxes come up when I close - 'word has stopped working' and the other will close and report problem. &nbsp;It also shuts down suddenly and I lose the work I was doing. I have to click into another user where it opens
 and closes OK but doesn't save in docx - just doc. &nbsp;How can I get both to work properly? &nbsp;I currently have to use a 'shared' file (in 2nd user) and flick from user 2 to my main user. &nbsp;I don't want word 2016 though I got windows 2010 downloaded in the hope
 it would sort out word 2010 problems - it hasn't. &nbsp;I have spent the last 2 weeks searching microsoft sites for help, paid £80 for local expert help but all failed. PLEASE can someone help desperately? &nbsp;Is microsoft blocking the word 2010 version so I have
 to upgrade to 2016?

            Try repairing Office first. See <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Thank you for trying to help me but doesn't work. When I try and repair it isn't possible to find Word 2010 anywhere. &nbsp;Office 14 is listed but not the Microsoft Office Professional 2010 I originally bought through download - all I get with every attempt
 (tried every one listed) is 'Invalid Location'. &nbsp;I can't uninstall because I won't be able to re-install as Microsoft refuse to accept my original key for anything. &nbsp;The feeling I have is that my word 2010 has been taken out and there is nowhere now for me
 to redownload and re-activate. &nbsp;The only option I am given after extensive searching and countless attempts to somehow get Word 2010 is to buy Word 2016 or Office Home &amp; Student 2016. &nbsp;I don't want it because I cannot risk losing my very important files and
 the reviews are so bad.

            <p>Have you tried searching for the winword.exe executable file? Also, do you see an entry for Office 2010 in Programs and Features in Control Panel?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that Office worked with another user account; if that is still the case, you could create a new user account, copy over your files, and then simply delete the faulty account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that if you have a product key for a full version of Office 2010, you can download a backup installation file from

            <p>Yes the WINWORD.EXE file is there and when I clicked it did the same as Word file - slow to open and close and 2 messages - 'word has stopped working'. &nbsp;I see the original Excel and Access (which I use) in the list dated 2011 but not the Word. &nbsp;Also note
 the Built-in Building Blocks.dotx file (within same list as winword.exe) opens and closes word in the same troublesome way.</p>
<p>There is an entry for 'Microsoft Office Professional 2010' (installed 24 January 2016) which I bought with my Dell computer (£900) in 2011 and used up to December 2015. &nbsp;when I search my C drive I can only find Office 2014 (valid from 4 June 2015 to 4 September
 2016) but the files don't seem to have anything in them when I try and repair. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to get the backup download but it says my key is invalid though I am 100% certain it is the right key as it's written on my Dell.</p>
<p>The compatibility troubleshoot only tells me 'a paid version is available' goed to French site where it offers Word 2016! &nbsp;Obviously I don't wish to pay again as original was over £300.</p>
<p>The 'other user' account has a limited Word save facility - doc. - not docx PDF etc. - I think it is 2003 version.</p>
<p>The 'other user' is shared via 'c' drive but it doesn't have the Outlook. &nbsp;I am convinced Microsoft updates have scuppered my Word 2010 app (original on my windows 7) and though I have downloaded Office 2010 I am left unable to use Word unless I pay for
 Word 2016 which I don't want as it is online - I wish to work offline as internet connection is too poor in this rural area.</p>
<p>Thanks for your input but as it is 12:22am here I bid you 'Nos da' (good night) from Wales</p>

            <p>There seem to be several issues going on here...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you purchased Office 2010 along with the computer, then you most likely have an OEM version that you can't reinstall from the backup site; instead, you'd probably have to restore your computer to factory defaults, which you may or may not be prepared
 to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure that I understand which user accounts you are referring to, but generally any user account should be able to access any program installed on the local computer.

<p>I am the main user (1) signing in. &nbsp;I set up another (2) to share folders via c drive and another (3) as administrator after reading something suggesting it might work!</p>

            <p>Office 14 is Office 2013. If you also have that installed, as seems likely given your comments, the two versions will conflict due to the resources they share, so your first task is to uninstall Office 2013. Then you can repair Office 2010, to put back the
 shared resources that uninstalling 2013 removed. Finally rename the normal template - normal.dotm to normal.old. Then you can restart Word. See

http://www.gmayor.com/what_to_do_when_word_crashes.htm</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If repairing Office 2010 didn't add a link to the Windows 10 start menu, locate winword.exe and make a link to that in the Windows task bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is not blocking Office 2010!</p>

If you yourself wrote the key, then it might be the Office key; if it is printed on a sticker on the computer, then it is the key for Windows, not Office.

    <title>Hotmail account will not add to Outlook 2007 - multiple email or 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> confused, again....  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail account will not add to Outlook 2007 - multiple email or 365 problem&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Running Windows 10 64 bit and Office 2007 - specifically Outlook 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have three email accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two Hotmail and one IMAP.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not wish to merge the two Hotmail account (hence the reason for two accounts).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The IMAP account has no issues.</p>
<p>Hotmail Account 1&nbsp;is a MAPI - never had issues.</p>
<p>Hotmail Account 2 was through the Outlook Connector and I never had issues.&nbsp; Then it was moved to the new server (365 I guess)&nbsp;and I had to change it to an IMAP.&nbsp; Had nothing but problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost emails, not syncing, some spam filter that I could never find
 that moved or deleted emails, no deleted folder, somehow it had two operating junk folders (not sure how that worked), and overall it was exceedingly SLOW....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to reload it today in hopes of making it better, but now I cannot get it to add to Outlook 2007 with whatever way I try.&nbsp; Auto, manual, through Outlook 2007, outside of outlook 2007...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Current errors include "Your server unexpectedly terminated the connection.&nbsp; Possible cause include server problems, network problems, or a long period of inactivity".&nbsp; Another (in part) is "The server responded: 530 5.7.0 Must issue a STARTTLS command first".</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I address this improvement in technology?</p>

</p><p>#1 - If your Outlook.com account has been migrated, it will show &lt;Outlook Mail&gt; (or &lt;Outlook Email&gt; for some regions) when you log into the account via webmail</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97908b81-69ea-4285-89a3-dcf3bca0b51f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97908b81-69ea-4285-89a3-dcf3bca0b51f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - If it has been migrated, you need to add it back into Outlook at which point it will be configured using the &lt;Exchange&gt; protocol. The old account needs to be removed and as has been mentioned, the Outlook Hotmail Connector should be uninstalled since
 it no longer is of any use</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - In OL'2007 - only ONE Exchange account can be added provided that SP3 has been installed&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>You will need to create a separate Outlook profile for each Outlook.com account (or upgrade to a newer version of Outlook which supports multiple &lt;Exchange&gt; Accounts</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 - Yes, changes made on one computer to a migrated Outlook.com account will appear on other devices provided those devices are properly configured.</p>

            <p>Well,</p>
<p>Somewhat helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1/2) Account 1 still says Outlook.com (not Outlook Mail).&nbsp; So this should still work with Outlook 2007 until it moves, correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I guess that is the passive/aggressive nature on Microsoft to force you to upgrade from a product that works just fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess I will have to start saving my dollars (used to be pennies).</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That brings another question.&nbsp; Can I connect one of my Hotmail accounts to Outlook 2007 in another way than Exchange?&nbsp; Or is that no longer allowed either?</p>

<p>
</p><p>#1 - The Outlook.com account that hasn't been moved will continue to work with the Outlook Hotmail Connector which needs to remain installed for that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - Just a general comment re: "...............force you to upgrade". The world changes and you're using software that is now on the verge of being 10 yrs old. This has absolutely nothing to do with forcing anyone to change but dealing with the realities
 of using new functionality. Not making this statement to defend MS but as a software developer/publisher in my own right. There comes a point where support is removed since it's not remotely reasonable to expect backwards compatibility for everything for all
 eternity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#5 - Any Outlook.com account can be configured as a POP or IMAP account in which case, you can configure as many of them as you want in the same profile. Downside is that you cannot sync the contact/calendar data for any Outlook.com account across multiple
 devices without using 3rd party software.</p>

 a while for the reset to finish.)</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So if it were mine I might try a hard reset to see if it brings it back to before the update. You have nothing to lose trying it in my opinion.....

<p>I am trying to save a OneNote2010 notebook but each time it says that it has "encountered a problem and cannot complete the operation".</p>
<p>My notebook is shared on the skydrive and synced from there but I have had a few errors on it in the past so i am trying to save a copy to my computer incase it messes up again. last time the pages all got deleted / corrupted.</p>

<p>The steps can be tried on Onenote 2010, because the reason for the issue is the same.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Nuron 5230&#58; downloading applications from Ovi Store</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently got a new Nokia Nuron and I absolutely love it. But when I began browsing through the Ovi Store and decided to try and download some free apps, I get to the downloading screen but that's as far as I can go; the downloading bar never goes past
 0%. Does anyone know what I can do to fix this? Is it maybe because I have no internet plan? I've tried to make new screen names and looked up online everywhere on this issue but still can't find an answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated. Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            This is not exactly a solution but to get an idea of exact problem.<br />
<br />
after you click "Download" on any app in ovi store, minimize Ovi store and open "Connection Manager" and see if internet connection is working fine (sending/receiving) and take a look at signal bar too.

<p>Thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah so I tried to dowload an application and right afterwards I checked my connectivity manager and it showed that my phone was receving and sending. But then abiut 8 seconds later, the connection was lost and when i checked back at the progress of my download,
 it was still at 0%. Any idea?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

            You are using Internet Destination? (Access Point) or WAP?<br />
Use internet access point.<br />

<p>Yes, I checked and verified that my access point was to the internet; specifically web2go internet with the access point epc.tmobile.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find it funny that even when I try to send my phone the download application link from a computer, when I get to that link, I am told to download the Ovi Store (which I already have) and then afterwards again nothing happens. I'm starting to think that
 maybe it's just a problem with my own phone? But then again it's only a couple weeks old.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any further input.</p>

<p>some time ago i was not able to download anything with default browser (Browsing was ok) and later i learnt that i was connecting to internet via proxy server (My operator's default internet destination) this is what i did;</p>
<p>1; settings&gt;&nbsp;connectivity&nbsp;&gt;destinations&gt;internet&gt;"my operator destination"&gt;options&gt;edit&gt;"Noted down only "access point" which was "p.internet"</p>
<p>2; Closed editing, back to Destinations&gt;internet&gt;options&gt;new access point&gt;didn't changed anything but "Access Point" to "p.internet", saved destination and selected it as default, so i was no longer connecting via proxy server, and problem solved.</p>
<p>(Basically i manually created internet destination with my operators access point "p.internet" which bypassed proxy server)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but i m not sure this'll help in ur case. anyways u can try a reset; Backup ur data and enter *#7370# &nbsp; &nbsp; default lock code; 12345</p>
<p>Good Luck.</p>

            I'm thinking that it is not working on our two phones because we both do NOT have internet plans. Our access pts are set to tmobile- I think they are preventing the downloading because we don't have plans.

    <title>Mail User Cost - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gilespapworth- &#91;o365&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail User Cost</h2>
                    
<p>Good Morning,</p>
<p>Here is a scenario. We need say 3 external users to only have access to a shared mailbox / send as functionality for a limited period of time. They do not need the Office 365 suite so really only need an account to send email to and from an account we designate.</p>
<p>Mail contact allows us to add them to a distribution group but as an external contact will not allow us to send as that distribution group, this is at no cost.</p>
<p>Mail user -&gt; does this allow us to give them send as permission without a cost?</p>
<p>The reason i ask is these users may only need this email functionality for a short while (matter of weeks) and do not need to have access to the whole suite of facilities that other internal users do. Would creating a mail user work by giving them an alias
 '*** Email address is removed for privacy ***' allowing them to 'send as' this address until we remove them?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Giles,</p>
<p>I understand your requirement. However, the mail user will not be able to use the shared mailbox features without licenses. Is that what you meant by “cost”?</p>

<p>Hi Giles,</p>
<p>As Toby said before, you need to assign Exchange Online license for this mail user firstly and assign send as right to this user. Then this mail user can use the send as feature in OWA.</p>

    <title>Modem resets itself randomly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Modem resets itself randomly</h2>
                    Gotta type fast because my modem resets on its own -- it's possessed.<br />
<br />
I have a Dell Dimension 4550.<br />
<br />
I have DSL connection, using a Touchstone Telephone Modem.<br />
<br />
I run Winsdows XP and it was installed at purchase.&nbsp; I use Explorer 8.<br />
<br />
My firewall is on and I also use Lavasoft Ad-Aware, Anniversary Edition.<br />
<br />
The model resets randomly. Sometimes it's working for an hour, other times it resets every other minute.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have a Linksys wireless router attached&nbsp;to&nbsp;allow access to my son's laptop. It has&nbsp;worked flawlessly.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have called my ISP support center. First, I replaced the modem. They've come to the house and my connection is fine and the modem is in good health. They cannot find a problem from their end to mine. Now, I suspect something in the software is causing this
 issue.<br />
<br />
I have updated the modem driver, reinstalled my anti-virus software and am now firmly stuck with this annoying problem.<br />
<br />
When I lose connection, sometimes the Network Diagnostics tool can re-establish connectivity. When it does, I get this diagnostic log report:<br />

    <title>Favorites Import Discards Structure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregorylatiak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Favorites Import Discards Structure</h2>
                    Nice to be able to import my Favorites into edge from my other browser -- CHrome. But unlike every other browser import I have ever used, the Edge import discards the categorization structure and replaces it with a simple alphabetic list of ALL imported
 items. This is pretty useless. Better to not do it at all than trash the logical structure that makes it intelligible.

<h2>            Slow loading time of Access Web App &#40;AWA&#41;</h2>
                    <p><span>Our Access Web App (AWA) stored on SharePoint Online (Office 365 Small Business) suddenly started to load (start-up)&nbsp;very slowly. This got really slow&nbsp;few days ago a</span><span>fter we added some queries and new tables and enable index on 2 fields.
 The startup time of the app in Chrome and Edge decreased from 1--3 sec to 25-40 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span>This happens every time someone in our team loads it since several day back.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We removed the changes but that did not help. Tried several browsers and computers. Slow! Note! Once the application loads (starts up) then all views and pop ups are fast.&nbsp;
</span><span>Another 'much simpler' AWA deployed on same ShardPoint subsite loads superfast. So SharePoint subsite setup works OK I guess. Note!
</span><span>When connecting with SQL Management Studio to this DB opening tables works MUCH faster than from Access client!?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Our Access We App&nbsp;is quite complicated. About 4 big tables with many columns and 30 small ones. 100+ queries and subqueries. Maybe 1500 records maximum in some Table.&nbsp; Many indexes set on the columns in several tables.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">We got stuck and need help</span></strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Does anyone know if several “not optimized” queries, subqueries and “not optimized” table structure can affect loading time of the app in browser&nbsp;up to&nbsp;30-40 seconds, while out-of-template app in same site loads in 0,5 seconds?</span></li><li><span>We understand that not optimized queried and a lot of indexing affect searches and loading of views as you use the app, BUT why would that affect the initial loading time of the access web app at start, when it is loaded from Azure?
</span></li><li><span>Is there any profiler too for databases auto created on Azure for Access Web App that we can monitor performance and the DB/Tables? SQL Profiler seems not to support profiling of Azure.</span></li><li><span>What is going on behind the scene before the first OnStart macro in Access Web App is loaded (how can it take 40 sec?)</span></li></ul>
<p>(I put this question on Sharepoint but they rejected it. Now I try with Microsoft Office 365)&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to change the color of bubbles in a bubble chart based on either - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tianyifoster  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change the color of bubbles in a bubble chart based on either values or text&#63;</h2>
                    Basically, bubble chart already contains three dimensions of information. I am wondering can we use a macro to incorporate a fourth dimension of information? For example, the color of the bubble will be determined by either a value or definition attached
 to each object. Thanks for the help.

                    I have been using my 6670 for 2 years now with no problem. All of a sudden I am not able to navigate to either Calendar or To-Do List. When I try to go to either of these two apps I am being sent back to the main menu.<br />

I have re-formatted the memory card and restored factory settings but the problem remains.<br />

I suggest you backup needed data from smartphone and reformat it by *#7370#. After that restore your data and try check Calendar and To-Do list.<br />

    <title>2016 Excel cannot save files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> burjuvaazi  say:</h3>
<h2>            2016 Excel cannot save files</h2>
                    <p>I’m using Office 2016 Professional Plus 64-Bit on my Windows 10 computer. It’s a relatively new install (two weeks old), both the Office suite &amp; OS itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently my Excel started to go bit weird. When I’m working on a file, it suddenly decides that the file is corrupted so it stops AutoSave and recommends me to save it manually. When I try to do that it doesn’t let me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried changing file format (.xlsx to Binary etc) it doesn’t work. Excel asks me to repair the file, I let it, then it cannot save the document and it’s an endless loop. There are files that I can just copy &amp; paste the contents to a fresh book and get away
 with it without losing any data, but there are ones that it’s impossible to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft’s call centre has been really unhelpful as they kept asking me if it’s pirated (it’s on my work PC, and I’d really doubt that, besides none of my coworkers have this problem) and if it’s not I should reinstall the Office or the OS itself (which
 is a huge loss of time). Are there anything else I (a non-Admin user) could try before going to IT and asking them to reinstall everything again?</p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures:
<br />
<br />Try working with the Word Safe mode and check if it helps.
<br />Hold the windows key + Letter ‘R’ on the keyboard to launch the Run command &gt; Copy and paste the following command line in the open box and click Ok.
<br />
<br />For Excel: Type excel /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Outlook: Type outlook /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Word: Type winword /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For PowerPoint: Type powerpnt /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Publisher: Type mspub /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Visio: Type visio /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />If, word works properly do you need to disable add-ins:
<br />Go into Word / Excel/ PW:
<br />Click on File menu.
<br />Click Options.
<br />Click Add-ins.
<br />Click on Go button besides Manage: Com-Add-in.
<br />Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox to disable them.
<br />Close the Word and restart it.
<br />
<br />In the link below explain how disable add-in:
<br />

<br />
<br />If, the procedures above didn't work, I refer to repair Office in the following link for more information:
<br />
<br />Go to Control Panel &gt;&gt; Add and Remove Programs and highlight Microsoft Office. Click on Remove. A menu will pop up allowing you to choose repair or reinstall. Try a Repair Online and verified after repair it fix.

            Hi Elisha,<br />
<br />
This record is used by Office 365 to direct authentication to the correct identity platform, so that you'll be directed to the best server for certain authentication processes, so you'll get faster response.<br />
<br />
When you run a client application that works with Office 365 such as Skype for Business Online, Outlook, Windows PowerShell or Microsoft Azure Active Directory Sync tool, your credentials must be authenticated. Office 365 uses a CNAME record to point to the
 correct authentication endpoint for your location, which ensures rapid authentication response times.<br />
<br />
If this CNAME record is missing for your domain, these applications will use a default authentication endpoint in the United States, which means authentication might be slower. If this CNAME record isn’t configured properly—for example, if you have a typo in
 the Points to address—these applications won’t be able to authenticate.<br />

<h2>            adding another account to OneNote</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to add my husband to OneNote. When I reach a certain point it asks me to verify who I am. I add the password, then it asks for a PIN. I type every PIN I can think of but it says it's the wrong PIN. What PIN are they talking about? My husband
 even changed his PIN on his computer and told me his new PIN but it still says it's the wrong PIN.</p>
<p>The check boxes below are wrong. My issue is with One Note, not one drive, but there was no option for onenote and it wouldn't let me skip that step.</p>

                    Running W7 64bit with 64 bit version of Outlook 2010.&nbsp; email from one or two "trusted senders" is consistently placed in the "junk" folder.&nbsp; How can I stop this so that all email from "trusted senders" is placed in the "inbox"?

<p>Mention the type of email account configured in outlook (POP, IMAP, MAPI or exchange?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try changing

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also set the Junk E-mail Options filtering level to "No Automatic Filtering" and verify the results.
