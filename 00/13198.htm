<h2>            Build 10122 failed - error message 0xC1900101-0x40017</h2>
                    <p>Sending this from Win8.1 - rationale follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had booted to Win10TP Build 10074 - automatic download of Build 10122 - installation started and rebooted a couple of times and failed - reverted back to 10074; which is working ok. Got error message: 0xC1900101-0x40017. Google search of error message -
 found many similar issues - most going back to Win8.1 and early 10. Error mainly about problems with AMD video drivers - my card is Radeon7990. Did notice that I could not uninstall Microsoft installed AMD drivers - appears that most of whatever had been installed
 for Catalyst Control Center was missing - either removed or corrupted by failed install of Build 10122? (Have no idea how or why.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searched the registry and removed all instances relating to Catalyst Control Center - concerned that next boot to Win10 would result in Windows Update trying to install, again, the Microsoft AMD Catalyst Control Center and drivers and update to Build 10022
 - which is unacceptable - do not want automatic updates to, again, fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why I'm posting this from Win8.1 and why I despise the Win10 Windows Update system as presently designed - we need the previous: Control Panel &gt; Windows Update with user controlled options to select or hide updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem now is how to boot to Win10 and use it without an automatic download and possible failed installation of new build and/or Catalyst Control Center and AMD drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a clue as to what to do now?</p>

    <title>Emails to Hotmail.co.uk and to Hotmail.com - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Emails to Hotmail.co.uk and to Hotmail.com</h2>
                    <br />
A few months ago, our son inadvertently changed our email account from Hotmail.com to Hotmail.co.uk.
<br />
<br />
We continued to receive and send emails as normal and not had to advise or change any of our internet banking or other personal or household suppliers etc., but we have had one issue with an energy company which has resulted in us complaining as they state
 they sent us emails to the .com address (which we never received) but they are saying that we wouldn't have received them due to us changing to co.uk.&nbsp; No-one else has had any difficulties with the change of .com to .co.uk, so is this right in what they are
 saying.&nbsp; This currently has led to a dispute betweeen ourselves and the energy supplier.&nbsp; Any guidance/answers on this would be gratefully appreciated.

            Hi there.&nbsp; I have received both of your emails via our hotmail.co.uk account and I can confirm that the account which EDF suggest that they sent emails to which we did not receive were sent to the original hotmail.com account.&nbsp; However, as previously stated,
 no other person who has our email address had any difficulty in replying and us receiving any emails and therefore we did not feel the need to notify anyone that we had changed to .uk from .com.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, EDF are basing all of their case upon this one thing and have also stated to the Ombudsman of whom we have also complained, that they were able to provide evidence to support this.&nbsp; However, we have not seen this evidence even though this has
 been requested by both ourselves and the Ombudsman.<br />
<br />
We have also tested from other outside email accounts from businesses if they could send two emails, one to our current hotmail .co.uk account and then to the hotmail.com account.&nbsp; We have on numerous occasions received both emails to our .co.uk account.<br />
<br />
If you are able to also verify this and confirm that this is the case, then we have a better chance of fighting our case with EDF.&nbsp; Any assistance in this regard would be gratefully appreciated.<br />
<br />
Kind regards, Claire<br />

<h2>            False Positive by Windows Defender &#63; Win32&#47;Critet.BS</h2>
                    <p>Have you guys knows about Heroes of Newerth (HON), the MOBA game like DoTA 2 or LOL ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>well...that's the point. I've been play this game since long time ago, and yesterday ... suddenly Defender alerted me that 'hon.exe' is the virus, name: Trojan:Win32/Critet.BS... 'hon.exe' is the main program EXE file of 'Heroes of Newerth'...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although HON had been updated to 4.4.0 recently which changed the most UI design and elements, but still I think it's really low probability that it would contains a virus in the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had deleted all of HON files and redownloaded through the downloader that came from official website...but during installation progress... again... Defender caught a virus named hon.exe and same virus name..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another e.g is Shadowsocks if you guys knows it. The Shadowsocks 4.0.9 which is the lasted version also trigger the Defender alerts that the same virus name contains in it...but actually it has been released since Mar.14 and none of any AV detect it as a
 virus... plus...It's an open-source program that published on GitHub. So... again... i think it's very low probability that it could contains a virus... and here's the discuss page of this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><span>github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-windows/issues/1746</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been search this on Google, and find out there is an update of Defender definition when Mar.16 2018 2:59 AM UTC, version number: 1.263.598.0, and it says 'new definition
<span>Trojan:Win32/Critet.BS, &nbsp; Alert level : Severe</span>' . I think maybe this is the reason that cause this false positive.. or is this a false positive....I don't know &gt;_&lt; &nbsp;</p>

<p>

Trojan:Win32/Critet.BS</a></p>
<p>or that Nicolas Coolman says that the Windows Defender detection for supercopier is a false positive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a link/reference for comment from Nicolas Coolman?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Updated Windows Defender definitions to 1.263.740.0 and downloaded ZHPCleaner from author's site. It passed security scan so hopefully the issue has been resolved with false positives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try manually updating through Windows Defender Security Center - Virus and Treat Protection Updates and determine if supercopier is still detected.</p>

<p>Hi Bethany,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the file is not searchable in File Explorer, it's possible that you have not saved the document properly. It's one of the reasons why you're getting the error message "the file can't be found and maybe been renamed, moved or deleted" when you tried to
 open it in the "Recent" section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to ask few questions so I can isolate your concern properly. Kindly answer the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any recent changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Regarding the "Recent" section you're referring to, is it from the File Explorer or Word app?</li><li>Did you try to check your Recycle Bin?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I suggest that you follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Perform a system restore. <span>Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made. To do this, you may refer to these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;button, type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>control panel<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>and<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>then choose&nbsp;it from the list of results.</li><li>Search&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Open System Restore</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Finish</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Note: If you’re not seeing any restore points, it might be because system protection isn’t turned on. To check, go to the Control Panel, search for Recovery, and then select Recovery &gt; Configure System Restore &gt; Configure and make sure Turn on system protection
 is selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Check the <strong>Recover Unsaved Documents </strong>option in Word 2010. Go to File&gt; Info&gt; Recover Unsaved Documents. See the photo below.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/758ef7f0-670b-4f0e-bc15-27d0fbe6ab50?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/758ef7f0-670b-4f0e-bc15-27d0fbe6ab50?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: Follow the several troubleshooting steps on the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/316951/how-to-recover-a-lost-word-document" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
how to recover a lost Word document</a> article.</p>

<p>I use a laptop at work and frequently have to telnet into customer radios and cell site radios via their ip address.&nbsp; I was using IE 6.5 and when I would click their IP address a command prompt would open and telnet into the ip address.&nbsp; Now I have recently
 upgraded to IE8.&nbsp; Ever since upgrading I can no longer click on the IP Hyper link to telnet into the radio via a command prompt.</p>
<p>When I click on the hyper link, it opens a new window inside IE8 and will not connect.</p>
<p>How do I get the IP Hyper link to open a telnet session in a command prompt again?</p>

<h3> art2011  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to pin and make message High priority - I see no pin option in menus...</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I cannot find new pin option in menu or anywhere else - please see attached. According to olutlook help this option should immed. follow to "Mark as read" menu option. I do not see it anywhere if I expand menus or navigate to message. It worked for the first
 couple of days outlook changed to the new version. Then it disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions that requires plain English answers please are:</p>
<p>1. Where is the Pin option and how to find/set it please?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. How to prevent messages that I pin from being deleted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In previous version all I had to do was simply flag my messages that would set them important and apart, and prevented them from deletion. I'm lost in new version and will never understand why do I need 2 or more clicks in new version, or set up some special
 rules, I assume, for not deleting important messages. All of this and more required only 1 click in previous version.
<br />
The last part does not require any answers, only first 2 questions please - pin and no delete option/rule. This is all I need to know and use.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Art.</p>

            <p>Hi Mohammed Ali,<br />
I do see Outlook Mail at the top left corner. I'm using browser version of hotmail.com. I do not need anything else, just online, browser version of outlook/hotmail.&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for the link but I doubt anyone has time reading articles to do some very simple thing that was available in prev version with a single click? I want to open my hotmail and use it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If I must use some pin now then all I need to know where is it? Why I do not see it? And how to make my select messages important and not to delete them? This is all I need.&nbsp;<br />
In previous version if I flag a message it prevented it from being deleted and moved it to the top, above all the rest, to High category. The select all option did not select flagged - I was able to delete all but important, flagged. All of this was avail with
 a single click in prev. version. This is what I call friendly and common sense.&nbsp;<br />
Most of us are not geeks and do not need anything that outlook.com may offer. All I and many others need is to read/write emails, do not delete important ones, keep them separately. And I can only repeat - all of this was available with a single click in prev.
 version. Whoever changed this from friendly to ...., full of pins and ...., etc... should be fired as this person makes us hate outllok and windows in general. Nothing personal. Forward this to Satya... LOL!<br />
<br />
If you have answers about pins and/or my other question then please reply.<br />
Thank you very much, Art.<br />

<h2>            Lumia 930 Denim or Cyan - No Field Test mode</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys, I have the UK variant of the 930, which I am using on Cricket and getting H+ speed. &nbsp;Sometimes however, I'd liek to reduce it to Edge, but the section in cellular for HIghest Connection Speed has Edge missing and only gives you 3G and 4G options.
 &nbsp;I figured, ok, let me use the Field Test Mode, but that also doesn't work on Denim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a positive side note, Cricket Tethering works on UK Variant Denim 930 :)))</p>

            Hi. If you could stay with using VBA, there is an InputBox() function you could use or you could use a FileDialog object to let the user "browse" to the folder and select the Excel file to import. Otherwise, if you want to use macros, you may have to use
 a popup form to ask the user for the file name. Just a thought...

            <p>Hi. Unfortunately, I don't think macros have an InputBox action. You could try modifying your VBA above by adding the following lines:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Function accrualuploadmacro()</p>
<p>On Error GoTo ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dim strFile As String</p>
<p>strFile = InputBox("Enter&nbsp;the full path to the Excel file...")</p>
<p>If strFile &gt; "" Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet acImport, 10, "WTC Accruals Upload", strFile, True&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenQuery...&nbsp;</p>
<p>End&nbsp;If&nbsp;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>End Function</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that&nbsp;helps...&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Conversation view in Outlook 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    Conversation view shows messages BY SENDER. So you only see THAT SENDER's contributions to the conversation. You then have to go to the NEXT SENDER to see their contributions to the conversation. Can this be fixed?

            <p>If there is no "Thread-Index," then those messages without it will probably be grouped together.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because we don't have any widespread reports of conversation mismatches (and the current matching algorithm has been in place for a couple of years), I suspect that either 1) the Kerio server is not properly stamping a "Thread-Index" on messages or 2) another
 email client may be changing the "Thread-Index" field so that subsequent messages no longer appear to be part of the same conversation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If nothing else, you can use a partial workaround of sorting by subject. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            change of personal details</h2>
                    hi there, i have a hotmail account, which i can access, but hackers have changed my date of birth etc, so i can't stop them sending emails from my account. How can i fix this problem as changing of my password hasn't stopped them as they have altered my
 personal information. Microsoft keep saying they will send me a code my mobile however this isn't working as they ask for the last 4 digits of my mobile including 60 however you cannot fit in any more than 4 digits...it them asks if XX60 are the last 4 numbers
 of your mobile, which it isn't, i then changed it so i didn't include 60 and just sent the last 4 digits of my mobile but i am yet to receive the code to update my privacy security information. I have put in a request to change info which i used through my
 work account as they asked to try and use a different email address, the message i keep getting is
<div>We're not ready for you yet</div>
<div>We'll send you an email on 8/09/2014 when you can replace the following security info.</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>*******60</span></p>
<p>Can you please help as despite me changing my password twice, the hackers are still sending spam from my account.</p>

<p>Well, I know that it works on Windows 7 because I have it installed, but this was an upgrade install from Vista 64 bit. Have you tried installing in compatibility mode?</p>
<p>You can find more information about compatibility modes in the articles below:<br />

<p>I tried it but the same...</p>
<p>I checked out your link, is says it is not compatible with the 64 bit version :(</p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Software&amp;p=Microsoft%20Office%20Accounting%202009%20Express&amp;v=Microsoft&amp;uid=4&amp;l=en&amp;pf=0&amp;pi=6&amp;s=office%20accounting&amp;os=64-bit</p>
<p>But I remember that I had seen running MOA2009 on a win7 laptop, but that was a 32 bit version...</p>
<p>So there is no chance to install it on a 64 bit win7? Maybe something with MSQ server?</p>

<p>I guess not, its a free version that you can download from everywhere (MOA2009USExp, 161 MB), like:</p>
<p>http://download.cnet.com/Microsoft-Office-Accounting-Express/3000-2066_4-10599757.html</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-Office-Accounting-Express-2009_program_24104.html</p>
<p>I will only buy it (and the patches I suppose) if it works and I like it...</p>

            I tried installing in Wndows Compatibility Mode, which suggested Windows XP SP2.<br />
<br />
It failed with the same error message, so that's not the solution.<br />

    <title>Using O365 to backup local PCs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johngwinner4591  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using O365 to backup local PCs</h2>
                    
<p>I've extensively searched, and so far it seems like the suggestion is for each user to use OneDrive to sync their files.</p>
<p>I don't want to do that as it'll double drive space - files go from the local PC (NOT ALL OF WHICH IS IN "MY DOCUMENTS") and would go to a backup folder in OneDrive, then turns back around and gets synced to the users OneDrive folder.</p>
<p>We use "GoodSync" which will sync to a sharepoint site, but I'd have to setup permissions and subsites for everyone - could be a lot of work.</p>
<p>Azure has a PC backup app, but this costs extra, and we're not using our 1TB of space on O365 as it is.</p>
<p>Is there another way to do this?</p>
<p>Note I am NOT asking to backup O365, I'm asking to backup users PC data TO O365; preferably the registry hive, bookmarks, etc. - not just 'my documents'.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>== John ==</p>

<p>hi john,</p>
<p>about the question, may i know if you would like to back up the local files on your computer to the onedrive for business site in office 365? if so, we can use
<strong>open with explorer</strong> to back up the local files to office 365 as below:</p>
<p>1. go to the onedrive for business site or a sharepoint site with the internet explorer browser and open a library where you would like to store this backup.<br />
2. click <strong>library &gt; open with explorer</strong> as below:<br />
<br />
3. open the folder on your computer. drag and drop or copy the files in it to the library opened with explorer as below:<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=4ff0132e-6eb8-4d30-ac90-c09db5dd5daf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d4ff0132e-6eb8-4d30-ac90-c09db5dd5daf" /></a><br />
4. refresh the onedrive for business site or sharepoint site to check if the local files are backed up to the online site?<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=11bb155b-de8c-43bb-899c-a5d6faad49a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d11bb155b-de8c-43bb-899c-a5d6faad49a5" /></a></p>
<p>about open with explorer, i would like to explain that the changes of these files you made on local computer after backing up can’t be synced to the online site automatically. if you would like to back up any changes on the files to the onedrive for business
 site automatically, we would suggest you use <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/get-started-with-the-onedrive-for-business-next-generation-sync-client-in-windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
next gen onedrive for business sync client</a>&nbsp;with which we can choose which folders to sync.</p>
<p>from your description, i noticed that you are concerning about double drive space with onedrive for business sync client. we can change the location path for these files to the local onedrive for business folder instead of adding a copy to the backup onedrive
 for business folder via right clicking on the folder <strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>
properties &gt; location &gt;</strong> copy the local onedrive for business folder path into the box
<strong>&gt; ok</strong>.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Thanks but, that didn't really help. This is a manual solution or switching the 'documents' directory over, which is not what we needed.</p>
<p>What we need is to map a drive letter. This is EASY to do with OnPrem SharePoint, but apparently difficult or impossible with O365.</p>
<p>The reason we need a mapped drive is that our documents are in places other than 'my documents' (etc) due to 3rd party software (Oracle).</p>
<p>We have software (Goodsync) that will do the synchronization, but I can't seem to find the URL to sync TO. If I setup a sharepoint site that WILL browse through explorer, for example using the:</p>
<p>2. Click <strong>LIBRARY &gt; Open with Explorer</strong> as below:</p>
<p><a href="https://mycorp.sharepoint.com/Backups/JBlow/Documents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mycorp.sharepoint.com/Backups/JBlow/Documents</a></p>
<p>this opens in Explorer, but it's a "one time shot"</p>
<p>If I take the same URL and try to 'map a drive' or 'open a network location' it does not work (yes, we have the Internet options, etc. setup correctly).</p>
<p>In Explorer, if I take that directory and past into our "Goodsync" software, it reports these errors:</p>
<p><span>151013 WebDAV OPTIONS returns HTTP error: Server says: FORBIDDEN (status code 403)</span></p>

<p>This question has been asked repeatedly but without a real answer: There's multiple archives on this, for example:</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/154/t/5216</p>
<p>So, how do we map a drive letter to SharePoint, or OneDrive?</p>
<p>Thank you for trying, I appreciate the help and would love to close this loop. It would do all of your customers a huge service.</p>

<p>I may have found the answer. If you go to "Map a drive" in Explorer, and use this exact URI form (https:// doesn't work), it will work and assign a drive letter:</p>
<p>\\m****p.sharepoint.com@SSL\DavWWWRoot\SharepointFolder\SubFolder</p>

<p>I spoke too soon - although I was able to map the drive once using that form, I disconnected all network drives, then went to share a smilar folder, but got the error "The network folder specified is currently japed using a different user name and password.
 To connect using a different user name and password, first disconnect any existing mappings to this network share".</p>
<p>No, I'm not ... </p>
<p>I tried it on a users PC and despite the fact we did log in, updated the security settings to add to the trusted list, checked the 'remember me' on the login page, and she had no other drive mappings, we got an error about 'you have to add to the trusted
 sites list, logon once, and make sure the password is remembered'.</p>
<p>Dropbox and Google docs are not this hard.</p>

<p>Sad to say, there isn't one. You need a reliable, permanent connection between SP online and a local environment and because of the poorly designed authentication process, O365 doesn't provide that. SP wasn't engineered for the cloud the way Google Drive
 and dropbox were - and clearly Msft is struggling to extend its shelf life by trying to make it something it's not - a cloud solution..

<p>hi john,</p>
<p>thanks for your clarification.</p>
<p>about the issue, may i know if you configure mapped network drives that connect to sharepoint online as mentioned in

<p>Dang straight was a reply to mchv2.0</p>
<p>For Shirley:</p>
<p>2. IE. Understood that Firefox, etc. doesn't work, and this was not the problem.</p>
<p>Regarding the article: Yes, we have followed that before I opened this ticket, and that still does not show how to obtain a drive letter. My \\ URL, above DOES. Please update the document to reflect the proper URL.</p>
<p>Not all software uses the Explorer to browse, and we're using software other than Office.</p>
<p>We need drive letter mapped file access.</p>
<p>We'll try the hotfix on 2 user PC's and see if that resolves anything aside from no drive letter access.</p>
<p>And, to the larger issue, we still haven't talked about a proper computer backup. How does mapping a network location help to backup the registry? Will the Windows Backup copy to Sharepoint?</p>
<p>Due to the inadequate authentication scheme that mchv2.0 mentioned, the phantom mapping that was giving me the error yesterday did not repeat today. This does not mean it was user error - there is a problem here.</p>
<p>Steps to duplicate:</p>
<p>1. Log into Sharepoint.</p>
<p>2. Map a network connection</p>
<p>3. Disconnect the network connection.</p>
<p>3a. Possibly connect via OneDrive and/or One Drive for business</p>
<p>4. Attempt to map another network connection with the same O365 account (I have only one)</p>
<p>You will get the error (no screenshot, but this is the exact text): The network folder specified is currently mapped using a different user name and password. To connect using a different user name and password, first disconnect any existing mappings to
 this network share". </p>
<p>This is despite the fact there are no other network mappings to Office except OneDrive, which is not a drive letter or 'my computer' mapping, but instead is a subdirectory synchronized on my C drive.</p>

<p>hi john,</p>
<p>thanks for your clarification.</p>
<p>about the issue, may i know if you run into the error as below?<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=9a9b274d-dbc2-4540-97a2-b203565036d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9a9b274d-dbc2-4540-97a2-b203565036d1" /></a></p>

<p>Shirley,</p>
<p>It's odd that your response implies that this should work when you know for sure (after 6 years of complaints) - . it doesn't.
</p>
<p>Secondly, you can't be serious suggesting 6 elaborate steps to connect SP to a local pc, when every other service does this out of the box?</p>
<p>And finally, the question is about backing up a pc - not creating a duplicate synced copy of one directory which is all ODFB does. Not to mention it doesn't even work properly.
</p>
<p>Why not just be honest and answer the question asked? The right answer is &nbsp;- "no, O365 can't do that".

                    Whenever I take a photo using this set, and go and see the file size it shows like 1.7MB. but if i open the file, after few seconds the clarity of the file changes and now if i check the file size it comes below like 358KB... something happens behind the
 scene.. is that a built in feature? or a issue with my set? It has been 10 days i Bought it. It hanged up 4 times. restarted itself several times.And my set casing is poor. Will Nokia replace my set with a new One.

settings should accessible through options in your camera application.<br />

<h2>            Updater says no new F&#47;W for 6630 with old F&#47;W &#40;2.39.151&#41;</h2>
                    Hello ppl,<br />
<br />
First of all - a big thank you to Nokia for providing this phone firmware update service!<br />
<br />
I'm having problems updating my old 6630 firmware with the following details:<br />
<br />
V 2.39.151<br />
19-11-04<br />
RM-1<br />
UK English<br />
<br />
Nokia Software Updater correctly identifies the phone (Nokia 6630 RM-1), and starts searching for updates, but after a good few minutes searching, returns back with the message 'No updates for selected phone'. If I recall correctly, the latest 6630 update is
 at least V 5.xx, so quite honestly I'm baffled.<br />
<br />
Any ideas as to what may be the cause?<br />
<br />
Thanks and keep up the good work!!<br />

            I would suggest contacting a Nokia repair centre. They could probably confirm what the latest firmware is for your network. If you dont have the latest I would give nokia a call and tell them there might be a problem with the updater.

<h2>            How to change &#34;Reserved by user ID&#39;  in a password protected Word 2007 document</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;have created a password protected Word 2007 document (.docx). When I open it, it says, the document is reserved by &lt;user loginID&gt;. How do I change this to the Author Name? It works fine in Word 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, my login ID is 12345 and for this Word doc, in Document Properties, I have specified "EFG Corp" and I turn on the password protection. When I open the file, the password prompt should say "this documnet is reserved by EFG Corp,&nbsp;instead it says
 "12345". How do I correct this error?</p>
<p>This was working absolutely fine till Word 2003 versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help Please!</p>

<h2>            Slide automatically scrolls to last slide while I&#39;m still editing</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I edit a previous slide, Powerpoint suddenly moves forward to the last slide. This is annoying bec I have to catch Powerpoint before it does this by clicking quickly to what I'm editing. Is this some odd feature by PPT I don't know about, and if
 so, can I disable it?</p>
<p>

            <p>Do you have a Mac mouse (1 button) or do you have a two-button mouse with some kind of scroll wheel?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a couple scrollwheel mice that routinely trigger out-of-control scrolling when I'm trying to use the wheel to scroll.&nbsp; I think it has something to do with clicking the scrollwheel while scrolling instead of just turning the wheel.
