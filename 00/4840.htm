<h2>            Exporting Local Mail Folders - Mac Outlook 2011</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to reinstall Mac outlook 2011 and need to export all the local folders in "On My Computer" first. &nbsp;When I try the export function it's only exporting a couple random folders and not exporting everything. &nbsp;Any idea why it's not exporting all the
 folders? &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also tried to drag out each folder to create individual mbox file instead. When I import them, it's empty.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any tips on how to export all my local mail folders?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't want to retrieve from timemachine or replicate the identity&nbsp;because I'm having issues with Outlook and want a fresh install.&nbsp;</p>

            Your best option is to export as .olm file under File &gt; Export. I suggest you duplicate the Identity then open Identity and delete Exchange and any IMAP accounts you have so you only export your "On My Computer" folders.<br />
<br />
Note: you can select only messages or all items in the export window.<br />
<br />
File &gt; Import select the .olm file.<br />
Drag the items from the exported folders to the local folders.<br />
<br />
You'll need to select the messages in the default folders (Inbox, Drafts, Sent, Deleted Items) and move the local folders. You can drag any custom folder to it's correct location. You can delete the imported folder structure after you move all the messages.<br />
<br />
You'll also need to move the contacts, events, tasks, notes to their local folders.<br />
<br />
Tip: Data in "On My Computer" is vulnerable to corruption. Be sure you backup to Time Machine or have some other frequent backup strategy to prevent data loss.

Sorry, I should've noted that i tried those steps already. &nbsp;I was looking for a solution and came across that tip in another thread. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The steps didn't resolve the issue. &nbsp;Export to OLM file seems to only be grabbing a couple folders. &nbsp;It seems to only export the same folder and subfolders each time I export to OLM and ignoring the rest.</div>

<h2>            Windows Account Problem</h2>
                    I had to reset my Windows phone, but I started it up again with the same Microsoft account. Now, in order to download or update any apps, and do some other things on my Microsoft account, it tells me I need security code that they will send to an email
 address that I had registered with the account. The problem is I don't have access to that account anymore. I tried to change the email address, but it says that the information won't be changed for thirty days. It doesn't give any other options of how to
 receive the code. What can I do to get the code before 30 days?

<h2>            Embedded videos doesn&#39;t work when converting the presentation into video.</h2>

I am interested in converting my PowerPoint slideshow that contains embedded videos, animations, and audio clips to a video. &nbsp;However, whenever I do this directly from PowerPoint, the embedded videos do not show up.&nbsp;

<div>Am I doing something wrong or is this not possible? &nbsp;If it's not possible, how can I make this happen?</div>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community and providing us an opportunity to assist you.<br />
<br />
I would require additional information about this issue for better assistance. <br />
<br />
1) What is the extension of embedded video files?&nbsp; <br />
2) What do you mean by 'videos do not show up'? Does the video appear blank or it doesn't play at all (provide more description)?<br />
3) Are you able to play the video in PowerPoint before converting it into video file (*.wmv)?<br />
4) Which is the default media player? Is it Windows Media Player or something else?<br />
<br />
Try creating and new PowerPoint presentation with different video file and convert it to a video file and verify if it works as expected.<br />
<br />
Reply with necessary information and the result for further assistance.<br />
<br />
Thank You.<br />

            1) What is the extension of embedded video files? &nbsp;<b>the embedded video files are MOV. &nbsp;</b><br />
2) What do you mean by 'videos do not show up'? Does the video appear blank or it doesn't play at all (provide more description)?&nbsp;<b>The videos do not play - the only thing that plays is the sound coming from them.&nbsp;</b><br />
3) Are you able to play the video in PowerPoint before converting it into video file (*.wmv)?
<b>Yes</b><br />
4) Which is the default media player? Is it Windows Media Player or something else? I believe it is Windows Media Player.&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for replying.<br />
<br />
Did you try creating a new presentation using different video file and then convert it check if you're be view the video?<br />
<br />

If the above step fails, you may insert the video as a media player object and then convert it to media file and verify the result:<br />

<h2>            Lumia 640 - Internet Explorer  can&#39;t zoom in or out of webpages</h2>
                    I just upgraded from a Lumia 520 to a 640.&nbsp; I was able to use the touch screen to zoom in and out using Internet Explorer with finger motion on the screen on the 520, but I can't zoom in or out in internet explorer in the 640.&nbsp; I've tried changing settings
 but I can't figure it out.&nbsp; This is a deal breaker for me if this feature is not working on my phone.&nbsp; The user manual says that this should be possible to do but there hasn't been a single web page that I can zoom in or out.&nbsp; Does anyone have any suggestions?&nbsp;
 I don't want to return the phone, but I will if this can't be fixed.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

<h2>            Flagged emails - Mail app - What&#39;s the point&#63;</h2>
                    Hello Microsoft,<br />
<br />
I frequently use Windows Mail app on my Windows 8 PC as well as on my Windows Phone 8 (Nokia Lumia 920) to synchronize my Outlook.com account (plus some others). However, I have set it to synchronize emails only from past two weeks as I don't want all 1000+
 emails to synchronize and fill my inbox. But, the flagged mails are also shown from the past two weeks. Quite the way it should work. BUT what's the point of calling it a 'Flagged email' when you can not read it instantly just by opening the inbox? There is
 no such option of showing the flagged email on top in these apps, further, flagged mails also sync as per the settings of inbox. So, I would request you to kindly include this feature where ALL the flagged messages are synced to the app irrespective of whether
 I'm syncing inbox for past two weeks or two months. It'd make it more logical to call it a Flagged message, when I can read any of my flagged message, be it a day old or a year old.<br />
<br />
I'm including this in Windows Phone 8 Forum, but please note that this applies to Windows 8 Mail app too.<br />
<br />
I hope to get some positive response from Microsoft on this.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
M.<br />

            Hello, I am sorry to hear that you are having some issues with Outlook. you are able to delete multiple emails at a time. Check out this article for more info:
<br /><a href="https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/outlook/4472-outlook-delete-multiple-all-emails.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/outlook/...</a>
<br />(DISCLAIMER that this is not an official Microsoft account, and isn't associated with Microsoft in any way)
<br />Also, have you tried to empty the trash from the webmail page? This may be the reason why the storage isn't going down. If you are sure that you have completely deleted the emails, it may just be a bug on the Outlook server side. Update me if the problems still persist.
<br />Hope this helps! :-)

            When I bulk delete, they go away temporarily and when I refresh, they reappear. &nbsp;I have tried to delete everything. I've contacted support multiple times. &nbsp;I'm not sure what else to do. I'm sure it's a problem on Outlook's side but don't know how to get
 it resolved.

            That seems like a much bigger problem than I thought. Try logging out from your account on all devices, and log back in after a few hours. This may do something although I can not say certainly that it would help. Outlook official support should give some diagnostics on your account if you try asking them explaining the situation.
<br />Hope this helps

<p><strong>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; Well I came across this N95 8GB of a china wholesale sites.&nbsp; Lots of cheap chinese made stuff and also lots of fake.&nbsp; I saw that the phone was cheap than the original price so I ask the seller and he said it was the real N95
 8gb with GPS, Wifi and Symbian OS S60, Made in China.&nbsp; But there are other similar prices for that phone and they advertise it having GPS, wifi and etc&nbsp; But when I ask them if the phone have GPS or wifi.&nbsp; They reply to me saying it don't but it's high quality
 copy of the N95 8GB.&nbsp; I went through a few and they all say it's High Quality Copy with NO wifi or GPS and don't have Symbian OS S60.&nbsp; But this one person that I came across .. said it does and that it was the real N95 8GB Made in China. .. Here's the link
 to the product&nbsp; <a href="http://www.dhgate.com/p_ff808081200d548501200e8d916a6af2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>So if this Real or just a high quality copy and the seller just want to sell it.&nbsp; If its real, Are the quality the same as the n95 8GB Made in Finland.

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Look too good to be trus cus of the cheap cheap price. </strong></p>

<h3> psalm14517  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple IF comparisons in Word mail merge</h2>
                    I am trying to write an IF statement in a Word mail merge. I need to compare multiple "true" statements on a single field, with one response if
<i><u>any</u> </i>of those statements is true and a different response if <u><i>all</i></u> are false. I have tried several nested IF statements and I get the correct deposit amount for the international trips, but nothing for the domestic ones...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's what I need. I'm creating confirmation letters for trip reservations. If the trip is international the deposit fee is higher. Unfortunately our horrible database doesn't have a field to designate something as "domestic" or "international", so I'm
 trying to say:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;IF the location is Belize, OR Jamaica, OR Nicaragua, OR Yucatan, then the deposit is "this amount." IF the location is NONE of these, then the deposit is "that amount."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone help?? Thanks in advance!</div>

<h2>            Why is outlook.com adding a ATT13799.HTM file when I forward an e-mail with a file in it &#40;test.xls&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since i've moved from GMail to Outlook.com something weird is happening when I send files or forward an e-mail with a file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like the outlook.com web server is adding a ATT****.HTM file for every file that I am sending. It is happening when i'm sending an e-mail to anyone with a file in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if i'm sending an e-mail to my friend with an excel file, he will receive my e-mail with the excel file + a ATT13799.htm file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My recipient are scared of opening my emails now...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's happening ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Peter</p>

<h2>            Corsair Link software has compatability issues in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have recently updated to Preview build 10049 and now my Corsair Link software is saying it has compatibility issues and then closes. This was working fine on all previous builds including 10041. I have tried running in compatibility mode with Windows 7
 and Windows 8, but still wont work. What has changed and will this be fixed in a later build?</p>

</p><p>Thanks for your reply, but something has changed within Windows 10 as the software was working fine on the previous build of 10041.</p>

            <p>I'm currently using build 10130, and I was&nbsp;getting the same error. Windows was telling me that the program was dangerous and could damage my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a video on YouTube that claimed to show a way to fix the problem. It suggested making a copy of CorsairLink.exe in the same directory and naming it CorsairLink1.exe. I was skeptical because the copies would be identical except for the name, but apparently
 the Compatibility Assistant is flagging on the name of the executable because CorsairLink1.exe runs fine for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got no idea why the name of the executable should be causing a problem, but changing the name fixed the problem for me. I hope it fixes the problem for others.</p>

            <p>This is totally a windows 10 issue.&nbsp; Dave Ballard isn't kidding.&nbsp; I too was having issues with corsair link on every build even&nbsp;10240 . I too though it was corsairs fault. The funny part is that with each build it would run fine the first time I logged in.
 However once I restarted every time no matter what I was getting some error saying that corsair link could not run because it might harm the computer. After changing corsairlink exe to corsairlink1.exe I was able to run just fine. Even after a restart which
 to me means that corsair link does not run on windows 10 because it was black listed. I have not looked where yet. I am guessing that it's either in the registry or there is a new black list database built into windows 10. If that is the case then MS will
 be able to push black list updates using windows update and block what ever they want. Which would suck because there is no option to choose which updates with 10 unless you have pro.

<p>Hi Glenna,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. I post the wrong link by mistake. Sorry for the inconvenience and I have correct it. You can refer to the article about
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/find-your-product-key-for-office-for-mac-2011-670b19d6-7743-45ae-a53c-66080cec7e33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Find your product key for Office for Mac 2011</a>. It lists the ways how to find the key back in different scenarios of the way you got the Office. You can check the list and try to remind how you got the Office. Unfortunately, the product ID is the product
 information you have, it can’t help in this activation case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rena</p>

            10532 is handling memory differently - how will an after market av program inspect or protect your new memory&nbsp;methods&nbsp;?&nbsp;&nbsp; Think its&nbsp;the av company's job to work right, not a Microsoft problem.

            Windows needs to fix this. &nbsp;If it's the memory compression with the new build that causes issues with security programs like AVG ( has worked very well for me in the past): it's up to Windows to fix it. &nbsp;Windows caused the problem, Windows should fix it.
 &nbsp;Unless. ... does Windows want everyone to use Defender? And PAY for upgraded protection.&nbsp;

            I tried everything I could, including having discussions with Support people from AVG and other groups try to fix issue. It belongs to Microsoft and Windows! If it cannot be fixed, is there a way to return to the previous build? I tried and received a
 message that it would not be possible, files were no longer there to do this.&nbsp; Huh? To reset the computer would remove too many necessary files and applications needed for my laptop to run correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I have been using AVG internet security for a number of years and really like it. Never had a problem until this build. I am not really up for changing security programs as AVG still works great on my other computer with Windows HOME edition build 10532.
 Is it something in the PRO version that is killing other security programs?

<h2>            lumia 950 office 365 subscription will expire, renew now message</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lumia 950 on Windows 10, up to date as far as I know as had an update the other day, Core ID is 1132.6 (01078.00027.15506.020000)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looked already for an answer to this and even tried re-install in the Office Apps for Windows Phone to gain the same message as below:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Office 365 subscription will expire 6th January 2016 renew now to keep using your subscription benefits.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I have an active Office 365 Home account that does not run out until Feb 7th 2017 and have not used any licence on a phone yet, cannot see how to activate it unlike on a desktop or my Surface Pro, the only thing I can remember is until I decided to update
 to Office 365 my phone and the Office apps did not have this message when creating a new file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when I click the check licence in the Office App it says upto date, when I use the same app or a different one later on I get the same message as in bold above. I'm thinking it may auto update on Jan 7th 2016 but I hate loose ends and messages on licences
 when I have an active one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions and thanks in advance?</p>
<p />

<h2>            HELP&#58; 4 pages lost in Onenote. Pages stuck on &#34;Loading&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to move some pages (8 pages total) from one section to the other section in my notebook, on my desktop OneNote. However when I highlighted them all at once and tried to move them together, each time OneNote got stuck on the spinning wheel and
 I had to Force Quit. I finally gave up and just started moving the pages one by one. It seemed like it was working fine. On the last page, the spinning wheel appeared again so I had to Force Quit OneNote once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem came when I reopened the notebook. Only 4 pages had successfully moved to the new section. The last 4 pages disappeared. I ran a search for a keyword that was in one of the pages, and that search yielded the page result. However, when I clicked
 on the link to the page... the screen appears with a blank "Loading..." and it is stuck on this screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4 of the pages I originally wanted to move to the new section were like this. Stuck on "Loading..." I can't even recover them from the old section because they are no longer in the old section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried accessing from the online version of OneNote, and the pages aforementioned will turn up with this: "Sorry, it looks like this page was added from another computer and hasn't synced yet."</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my "Recent" or "Recycled bin" folders- I cannot find my lost pages either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I am assuming that the Sync messed up because I had to Force Quit, and I officially lost these 4 pages.<br />
</p>
<p>This is very upsetting. I really hope these issues on OneNote get fixed because I just lost 4 hours worth of material.</p>

<p>Hi Danielle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your situation, this must have cost you time and effort. As you mentioned, “<em>I ran a search for a keyword that was in one of the pages, and that search yielded the page result</em>”, most likely the pages are not deleted but you may still
 try looking in the Deleted note, check if you can find anything, see <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Recover-deleted-notes-in-OneNote-for-Mac-57a5aab4-09ba-4c4e-a6ce-91b56169d5a4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recover deleted notes in OneNote for Mac</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try the suggestion for this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macofficeo365-maconenote/onenote-for-mac-recovering-data-from/3ea9f7ec-3b3a-4369-9263-6713a454e9f1">
thread</a>, see if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to explain that in OneNote for Mac, when we create a notebook, we can only store notebooks in cloud. If the pages are not synced to the cloud and there is no backup, then we can't get them back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Neha</p>
