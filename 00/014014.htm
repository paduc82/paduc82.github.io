    <title>Finding out ESN number for Lumia 950 &#40;And how Microsoft should - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Finding out ESN number for Lumia 950 &#40;And how Microsoft should really do something about their help desk.&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased Lumia 950 from the Microsoft Online Store.</p>
<p>I am using two phones now, one for my personal use and one for the business. I often forget to bring one of the phones when I go out, so I decided dual SIM feature could be helpful.</p>
<p>The second SIM slot on this phone only supports 2G connectivity,&nbsp;and I had to find the ESN for this phone because my local service provider specifically required me to give them this number in order to register this device to their systems to get the 2G&nbsp;service.
 I could only find IMEI number and decided to ask the help agent, since I heard from the local SP that I should be asking them for the ESN in case I cannot find one.</p>
<p>After struggling for hours on that talking ARS which never seem to understand me, and agents bouncing me between two phone numbers, I decided to try the chat support. Then this word "legit" that I half-mindedly said turned around this conversation to a very
 weird direction:</p>
<p>

<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Hi, thanks for visiting Answer Desk! I'm [Agent].<br />
12:52 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
I'm your dedicated Windows technician. How are you today?<br />
12:53 am<br />
Me<br />
Hi. I have a question about Windows 10 Phone.<br />
12:53 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
Yes Sure.<br />
12:53 am<br />
Me<br />
I just got a Lumia 950, and my local service provider wanted me to tell them the ESN number<br />
12:54 am<br />
Me<br />
the Phone only shows IMEI number, so I wonder if there is any way I can find the ESN number for this phone<br />
12:54 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
I see.<br />
12:58 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
Before we proceed, can I have your name please so that I can address you properly?<br />
12:58 am<br />
Me<br />
[Me].<br />
12:58 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
Thanks [Me], give me a minute or two please for me to check this out. Okay?<br />
12:59 am<br />
Me<br />
okay.<br />
12:59 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
Thanks for waiting [Me].<br />
1:03 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
Can I ask for your full name please, and your current location?<br />
1:03 am<br />
Me<br />
My name is [Me], and my current location is Korea<br />
1:03 am<br />
Me<br />
I purchased this Lumia from America store because this phone hasn't been released in Korea<br />
1:04 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
Thanks for this [Me].<br />
1:06 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
[Me], can we please do this. Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; about &gt; more info<br />
1:07 am<br />
Me<br />
I'm in the menu<br />
1:07 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
Then settings please.<br />
1:08 am<br />
Me<br />
yes i pressed the more info button.<br />
1:08 am<br />
Me<br />
I see the imei but not the ESN<br />
1:08 am<br />
Me<br />
Also, I need the ESN for the "second" SIM slot. it looks like the menu you showed me is only showing the information for the first slot<br />
1:10 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
Okay, can we try to plug another SIM [Me]?<br />
1:10 am<br />
Me<br />
just a moment.<br />
1:11 am<br />
Me<br />
I plugged the new SIM to the second SIM slot<br />
1:12 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
Okay, then do the same process. This:&nbsp; Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; about &gt; more info<br />
1:13 am<br />
Me<br />
no difference. just the info for the first SIM<br />
1:14 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
Okay.<br />
1:17 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
Thanks for trying [Me].<br />
1:18 am<br />
Me<br />
so what's next?<br />
1:19 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
Are these two sims are coming from two different network [Me]?<br />
1:20 am<br />
Me<br />
they are coming from the same network provider, but each SIM slots are supposed to have different IMEI and ESN<br />
1:21 am<br />
Me<br />
as a matter of fact, I can find two IMEI numbers on my phone; they are written on the sim slot. But I specifically need the ESN number<br />
1:22 am<br />
Me<br />
which cannot be found on the phone. This is wierd because every legit phones are supposed to have one.<br />
1:22 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
Yes, I agreed with that [Me].<br />
1:23 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
We must be using a device that is being reproduced illegally.<br />
1:24 am<br />
Me<br />
what do you mean by that?<br />
1:24 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
Its not legit [Me], accordingly Lumia Phones don't have dual sim, its single only.<br />
1:25 am<br />
Me<br />
that's wierd.<br />
1:25 am<br />
Me<br />
because I purchased it from microsoft online store<br />
1:25 am<br />
Me<br />
and I got the new phone sealed in a box and I opened the seal myself.<br />
1:26 am<br />
Me<br />
and the product description did say dual sim.<br />
1:26 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
Okay.<br />
1:27 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
May I ask, when did you purchase that [Me]?<br />
1:28 am<br />
Me<br />
last week<br />
1:28 am<br />
[Agent]<br />
Okay, let me check it.<br />
1:28 am<br />
Me<br />
http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Microsoft-Lumia-950--Unlocked/productID.326602600<br />
1:29 am<br />
Me<br />
on the tech specs page, look at the connectivity line. It clearly says Dual Nano SIM<br />
1:30 am<br />
Me<br />
Are you sure we are talking on the same page here?<br />
1:30 am<br />
System<br />
Chat has ended.<br />
1:32 am</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not the first time Microsoft help desk was not helpful (and to be honest I wasn't expecting much from this chat), but an agent assuming my phone was an illegal copy and just disconnecting on me was really beyond my expectation.</p>
<p>I really like Microsoft products, and that is why I am using MS products for years now. Now I see that the biggest trouble with Microsoft products are not with the products, but with the help and support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sharing this experience in hope of inspiring Microsoft to make some changes, and to see if anyone knows what I can do about this ESN thing.</p>

<p>No model of the current Lumia 950 series support 2G networks in Korea (CDMA), because the antenna amplifiers (hardware) are missing for those frequencies. Microsoft Mobile had no intention to sell this series in your country. Why ever. Anyway therefore,
 you do not find an ESN. Therefore, you are limited to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/network-bands.php3?sCountry=Korea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">these 3G/4G services…</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest trouble with Microsoft products are not with the products, but with the help and support. […]&nbsp;I'm sharing this experience in hope of inspiring Microsoft to make some changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft does not leverage Microsoft Answers as feedback channel. Why ever. Therefore here, your comment drowns in the Internet swam. Actually, Microsoft is driving this discussion board as any 3rd party board – not only does Microsoft loose a lot of possibilities
 with that, Microsoft gives a false picture to their customers here, and because there is no difference to any other board, Microsoft even wastes money here – Microsoft could achieve the same with existing boards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, that support agent did several obvious mistakes. First: He should have forwarded you to the support of the subsidiary ‘Microsoft Mobile’. It is their job to answer such questions, not the general AnswerDesk. Second: Microsoft Mobile should have forwarded
 you to the Microsoft Mobile support in Korea, because the guarantee is not worldwide but restricted to your current (!) region. Why ever. And there we have the issue. Microsoft Mobile is not active in Korea. You&nbsp;<em>exported</em>&nbsp;a Lumia 950 to a country not
 covered by Microsoft Mobile. Third: Why ever, a lot of outsourced employees are not trained to tell such facts and because of their natural habits rather quit a conversation. As Korean yourself, you know how difficult it is to say ‘No.’ You did not do anything
 wrong – you did not know it. However in Korea, when it comes to Microsoft Mobile Support, your are limited to community efforts actually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One question remains: How did you get that phone over from the US to Korea:</p>
<p>A) Did you ship the phones to an address in the US or</p>
<p>B) did the Microsoft Store sent you those devices directly to Korea?</p>
<p>The latter would be an issue in the webpage of the Microsoft Store because there should be warnings of the mentioned 2G limitations in Korea. Therefore, please, clarify.</p>

            <p>I eventually found out the 2G limitations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just one example of Microsoft help agents not being helpful, and I did actually tried filing complaints or feedback to more official (and nearly inexistent) routes, which I never received a single follow-up on. This posting is not something that's
 out of ignorance on how Microsoft handles the community, but a last effort to give them a feedback. I've already saw those feedback pipelines not working, and I decided at least I could post this publically, so that someone could at least read it rather than
 letting this 'drown' in an seemingly unmonitored DB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your question on the last paragraph: I had my phone shipped to my address in US and had it shipped again to my place in Korea. I know Microsoft Store does not have any responsibility of clarifying the details of using this phone in Korea,
<strong>and I have no intentions to raise any complaints against that</strong>, and that's why I contacted the answer desk to ask, instead of calling the store and complaining about the lack of information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted US support rep. because as you said this phone was not released in Korea, and since my question was a general hardware inquiry-all I was looking for was that number, not whether it would work in Korea or not-, I thought&nbsp;US rep. shouldn't have
 any trouble answering my question. The ESN number is something every country used before IMEI and&nbsp;MEID became common, so&nbsp;I think it's reasonable&nbsp;to expect&nbsp;agents&nbsp;from any country to at least know what it is, if they have received appropriate education and
 training.&nbsp;Instead, none of the agents I talked on the phone didn't even really know what it was.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. By the way, I don't understand why I should know as a Korean how hard it is to say 'no,' and what it has to do with incompetent help agents. Sure I know they are outsourced, but it doesn't mean it's okay for them to not know about the products they should
 be supporting, or closing the chat on the customer. If they thought it was okay to act like that or made such behaviors their habit, these outsourced agents shouldn't have been in the outsourcing market in the first place, and Microsoft still deserves blame
 for having&nbsp;outsourced their support to them, or for not providing them with proper training or authority.</p>

<p>Not a very straightforward solution though. You need to invoke the ellipses menu from the first screen to export data to SD card, and then open the file in a text editor.</p>

<p>Yes, for sure. I just explain, why that happens. Those people are used to lie or to end the conversation rather than giving a ‘No’. This is a failure in training for sure.</p>

<p>That is more than welcome, because you did not turn around and stepped away. However, Microsoft does not leverage Microsoft Answers as feedback channel, either. Just explaining it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>ESN is only known to those countries which had CDMA services. We do not know where that support agent was located – anyway, this is quite an uncommon question outside of Korea, because (the few) CDMA carrier in the US, those operators do not add other phones
 normally, either. Anyway, this should be a question/answer which is in reach of knowledge thanks to the Internet nowadays. However, the 1st failure was trying to answer your question. That support agent is not responsible for your question and should have
 told you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>In some cases, after uninstalling those Windows Store apps and trying to reinstall, you get such error messages.</p>
<p>A possible solution:</p>
<p>1). Open Admin command prompt and type "wsreset". then hit Enter key;</p>
<p>2). Trying to reinstall the application will result with an error, but if you click Try Again, it will eventually install after a few unsuccessful attempts.</p>
<p>This helped with my PC, at least.</p>
<p>If this did not help, you might have to take ownership of some folders and delete the app versions there manually, as I have explained&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_tp-windows_store/windows-store-applications-fail-to-update-with/28869d1a-75a2-4f51-8703-81223cc0e0de?page=2">here</a>.</p>

            <p>1). Take ownership of the C:\Program Files\WindowsApps folder;<br />
2). Find all the different application versions there and delete them manually;</p>
<p>3). Restore default ownership of the folder;<br />
4). Go to C:\Users\{UserName}\AppData\Local\Packages\{PackageId} and delete the same packages there;<br />
5). Restart your PC;<br />
6). Empty your Windows Store cache (Admin command prompt "wsreset") and try to reinstall the application.<br />
That's the final way and it did the trick for me. I have no more suggestions.</p>

            I had the same error yesterday, and it was practically impossible to repair (even with several different methods), so finally I decided to install Windows 9879 again from scratch using the Windows 10 Build 9879 ISO, and now the apps are working fine (at
 least for now).

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I sorry for that. I have two possible suggestions:</p>
<p>1). After clearing the Windows Store Cache and before trying to update, press the link to sync your licenses;</p>
<p>2). Probably there are some keys remaining in your Registry, that need to be deleted; but that's risky as you might destroy your installation. Anyways, if you are willing to try it, you can use the CTRL + F key combination to search for obsolete keys and
 delete them.</p>
<p>Other than that, you can reinstall; And in such case I would suggest to set it up as a new install and enable OneDrive sync later, after you update your apps.</p>

<p>- rebooted computer (does not work otherwise)</p>
<p>- go to windows store and re install them (mail, onenote, reader)</p>
<p>- click retry a couple times when it says they cant install</p>
<p>
</p><p>they finally installed and everything is fine</p>

                    Hi.&nbsp; I have a user here that can't send a meeting invite from office 2010 to a particular recipient, it doesn't go out, it will immediately place a message undeliverable email in the inbox.&nbsp; I have tried, he can send meeting requests to others in the same
 company, and can send a plain text email to the person he can't email invites to.&nbsp; I have tried forwarding that same invite to myself from his computer and it works, and I can then in turn forward to the intended user, and that works.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp;

    <title>windows clipboard disabled when using Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noreen kilby  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows clipboard disabled when using Outlook</h2>
                    The clipboard is disabled when Outlook is open. I cannot use copy nor paste in Word or Outlook. If I exit Outlook, the clipboard works as expected in Word, but once I launch Outlook, the clipboard is disabled. I am using Windows 2007, Office 2007 and Outlook
 2007 (12.0.6661.5003) SP3 MSO (12.0.662.5000). I don't know the specific version of Windows and Office I'm running - but if you tell me how to find it, I will provide. My Windows did an auto update within the past week and this issue has cropped up since then.

            <p>Hi Noreen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting Microsoft Community. I will help you in determining the cause so that we can fix the issue with clipboard disabled while Outlook and word are opened simultaneously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us follow the steps:</p>
<p><br />
Try opening Outlook in safe mode and check. Follow the steps:<br />
1. Click on <b>Start</b> -&gt; <b>All Programs</b>.<br />
2. Go to <b>Accessories</b> -&gt; Click on <b>RUN</b>.<br />
3. Type <b>Outlook /safe </b>(leave a space after Outlook) -&gt; Click <b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we are able to preview the attachments in Outlook in safe mode without any error, then disable the add-ins and check if it helps. Refer the following steps on how to disable the add-ins from Outlook 2010:</p>
<p><br />
1. Open Outlook.<br />
2. Go to <b>File</b> -&gt; <b>Options</b> -&gt; <strong>Add-Ins</strong>.</p>
3. Select Com <b>Add-ins</b> -&gt; Click on <b>GO</b>.<br />
4. Uncheck the available Add-ins -&gt; Click on <b>OK</b>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps in fixing the issue. If not, the reply and I will be happy to help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>

            Thanks, this helped. However, to get to Add-Ins, the path in Outlook (for me at least) is Tools&gt;Trust Center&gt;Add_ins and then I selected "COM Add-ins" from Manage at the bottom of the window and then Go...<br />
<br />
In the Com Add-in window, I tried to deselect each available Add-in. I could not deselect some add-ins -- I got a message that said "This add-in is installed for all users on this computer and can only be connected or disconnected by an administrator". I guess
 I am not an administrator (this is an employer-owned computer, not my personal computer). I deselected all the Add-ins that I could, closed and re-opened Outlook and my clipboard worked correctly. Then I turned on each add-in individually and tested and the
 clipboard continued to work correctly. However, at some point in this process, I got a message that about the "Send to Bluetooth" add-in. This is one of the add-ins that needs an administrator to turn it off or on. It is turned off now (it was on at the beginning
 of this whole process) and with it off, the clipboard continues to work correctly. So, I suspect it was the "send to bluetooth" add in that was not working. I don't use it anyway!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!<br />

            This post below from QuarterWorthy under the topic "PowerPoint Crashes When I Type" solved both that problem

Hope this helps.<br />

<p>I recently ran into this problem and doc mck solution for changing the keyboard lay out really helped. &nbsp;I'm running Windows 7 x64 on a MacBook Pro with Powerpoint 2007. &nbsp;I had to go into the Control Panel &gt; Region and Language Settings &gt; Keyboards and Languages.
 &nbsp;Selected "Change Keyboards" and added "English (United States) - US" to the input languages and now everything works. &nbsp;I guess Microsoft no longer enjoyed the "English (United States) - &nbsp;United States (Apple)" input any longer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Today is the first time I had this problem, but Powerpoint 2007 had worked earlier in January without issue.</p>

<h3> melissamchugh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moved from UK to US, Want to Change Subscription Currency</h2>
                    <p>I signed up for the monthly subscription at Office 365 while I was attending graduate school in London for a year. &nbsp;I set it up with the UK pound (£) but then I moved back home September 2014. I still subscribe monthy, but my payments come from my US bank
 account rather than my UK one, so my payments are converted from $ to £, which ends up being a bit more money than a US subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my information is now listed as being in the US, but I can't see a way to fix this problem. I've cancelled my subscription for now, with hopes that when it expires at the end of the month, I'll be able to start a subscription in the US.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But on the off chance I can simply fix this problem now, I'd like to see what can be done.&nbsp;</p>

            I've read every single page on that link already. I've tried those options. Not one of them allow me to subscribe to the US plan rather than the UK plan. I can change (and already have) payments from my UK bank to my US bank, but it still charges it in
 the UK currency and converts it accordingly.&nbsp;

    <title>2018 Visio Shape Reports.. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colinski76  say:</h3>
<h2>            2018 Visio Shape Reports..</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to run shape data reports from some marked floor plans that i've created for our business. However, I cannot seem to run the report without "extra" data being associated within it. For example, the master shape data name appears, but then
 it has a number included next to it despite not having the number associated with it in the created data field. (Example: SMOKE DETECTOR.341) In the shape data I obviously named it "SMOKE DETECTOR". But where it's coming up with the ".341" I cannot seem to
 figure out. Is this a hidden field or something? What would it be called?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I also don't seem to have the option of any other report formats other than HTML, and XML. Is there a reason I don't have 'VisioShape', or "Excel" formats as options? Seems to very from computer to computer where someone else has access to these formats
 but I do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas or thoughts on these two features?</p>
<p>
</p><p>-CD Allen.</p>

<p>I can't see your document and report.</p>
<p><strong>IMHO </strong>It is default shape names ! Each shape in page must have unique name - most time it consist of Master-shape name and shape ID</p>
<p>Or you rename your shapes ?</p>

                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just received an HTC HD7 and have installed Zune. Zune has recognized some of my media (88 songs out of 250).</p>
<p>I looked under settings&gt;software&gt;sync options and checked to see if Zune had the correct source for my music and I added all file types of media.</p>
<p>I would like to sync all my songs, does anyone have any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>

<p>I tried playing one of the old songs with zune but it did not play, what do you suggest I do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
</blockquote>
It's almost certain that the ones that don't play have Apple's old DRM called 'Fairplay' &nbsp;
<div>You can right click the files and look at properties to see if they're protected (means DRM.)</div>
<div>If you find that this is the issue, your options are limited. &nbsp;The old (now gone) zune DRM allowed you to burn protected songs to an audio CD (audio, not mp3...) which you could then re-rip. &nbsp;(This is the only reliable method you can use to back up protected
 music...) &nbsp;iToons probably allows the same. &nbsp;</div>
<div>iToons also allowed (at least at one time... don't know about now) users to upgrade protected songs to DRM-free formats for a small price. &nbsp;You can check that out as well.</div>

You have not mentioned about your pc info. Uninstall existing Nokia pc suite, Nokia connectivity cable driver, PC Connectivity cable solution, run pc suite cleaner, reboot the pc and install latest Nokia pc suite and then connect your phone using USB. Hope
 your issue will be rectified :)

<h2>            Unknown Emails in my draft folder&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
I have noticed recently that on one day I have received like 40 emails in my draft folder that I have never written or send or even moved.<br />
I don't know who is the sender, and I don't know why they are in my draft folder.<br />
I never open my email using any other computer or phone rather than my personal ones.<br />
And I don't have IPhone neither .</p>
<p>I have changed my password just in case,but still want to know why those emails are on my draft knowing that all of them are received in my draft folder under the date 9-9-2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a screenshot of the emails I got in my draft.<br />

<h2>            Unable to print the Emails. It just shows a blank page on the print preview</h2>
                    <p>Since updating to Windows 10 Pro I have not been able to print emails.&nbsp; I can print other things but not that.&nbsp; I know to select the little dots then the print on the next window. But after that it just shows a blank page on the print preview.&nbsp; What can
 I do I use my emails a lot for business at home and this has been very frustrating.</p>

            The tile displaying the time is actually the <strong>HTC</strong> app. So go to the list of all apps, find HTC, tap and hold the app and choose to pin it to your start screen. If you accidentally uninstalled the app from your phone you will find it under
<em>HTC Apps</em> in the Windows Phone Store.

 slide (clicking a topic on the overview slide takes you to a separate slide that is an identical slide, except the "submenu" text box including more information is showing. Then, a box covering the entire "duplicate" slide links back to the original). Is this

</p>
<p>PowerPoint 2011 on the Mac supports triggers if they exist, but can add and maniuplate triggers only via Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). I don't remember whether or not Powerpoint 2008 has any trigger support.</p>

            <p>Hello Andre:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having syncing your account with your Windows Phone.&nbsp; This sync error indicates the phone is not properly connecting with the Microsoft account servers.&nbsp; The following have been found to resolve
 errors like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try a soft reset of the phone.&nbsp; First, go to settings &gt; application &gt; Internet Explorer &gt; delete history.&nbsp; Once this is done press and hold the volume keys, power button and camera together for 3-5 seconds.&nbsp;
</li><li>On the phone go settings &gt; time + date &gt; set automatically to OFF &gt; set the time, date and time zone.&nbsp; Once you do this go to settings &gt; emails + accounts &gt; tap and hold the Microsoft account &gt; select sync.&nbsp;
</li><li>If the account still will not sync the next thing to do is go to the following site and sign in with the same Windows Live account that is on the phone,
<a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.live.com</a> .&nbsp; Once signed in here, go to password &amp; security.&nbsp; Look at the section related to "two step verification".&nbsp; If you see the option to disable this, you will need to create an app password on this
 page or disable two step verification.&nbsp; If you create the app password, that password would be used as your sign in password on the phone.&nbsp; If you see the option to ENABLE two step verification, you will want to reset your account password.&nbsp; Make sure the
 password is 14 characters or less.&nbsp; </li><li>The final thing you can try is to change the server name that is listed on the phone.&nbsp; You can do this by going to settings &gt; emails + accounts &gt; tapping the account &gt; tapping past the error.&nbsp; Go to the bottom of the account setting page and you will see
 a server name field.&nbsp; Here enter each of the following and they try and sync the account after each one; m.hotmail.com, bay-m.hotmail.com, blu-m.hotmail.com and dub-m.hotmail.com.</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns we can assist you with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>

<p>Sometimes windows (PowerPoint's and other programs) can get bumped totally or partially off screen.&nbsp; Try this to get it back to where you can work with it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press ALT+TAB until the presentation is active (even if off screen)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press ALT+Space bar then press M</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the arrow keys to move the window back onto the screen.&nbsp; Once you get it to where it's controllable, press ENTER to quit move-mode.</p>
