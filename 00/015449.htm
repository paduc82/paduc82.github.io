<h2>            Outlook Calendar Prompts to Save Meeting Even When No Changes Made</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>I am using:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I open a <strong>meeting </strong>from the calendar to view its contents (attendees, notes, location, whatever...), on closing the meeting&nbsp;Outlook displays the following prompt, even though no changes have been made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For <strong>appointments </strong>with no attendees or rooms/resources allocated, the calendar item just closes without this prompt as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has only started happening for me in the last month or so.</p>
<p>Is there a known fix for this?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Do we know which MS patch introduced it?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Have Microsoft acknowledged and published a fix date?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The work around is to select "Don't save changes" but it is very annoying and introduces doubt as to whether I have inadvertently made a change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Sorry all, I think I've solved my own issue.</p>
<p>In writing this question I have discovered that if I open the meeting on my main laptop screen, I don't get the prompt to save changes.</p>
<p>However, if I open the meeting on my extended desktop screen, the prompt is displayed every time.</p>
<p>I don't know the cause but at least I now know how to stop it happening.</p>

<p>Interesting, as today I purchased a low-cost "Windows 8.1 with Bing" tablet. It has a 100MB EFI System Partition, 24.01GB C: partition and a 4.88 GB recovery partition.</p>
<p>"This PC" initially showed 20.1 GB free of the 24GB C: drive. I then allowed it to install updates. It now shows 17.1GB free of the 24GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to have a strategy. There is no information about SD cards except "only use compatible SD cards", which is not very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken a full image of the C: drive using the facility in Control Panel, but I have no idea how or if it is possible to boot to install, for example, Windows 10, or to subsequently&nbsp;recover the 8.1 installation.</p>

            <p>Don't bother try installing build 9879 on it, since there is a bug in there that duplicates drivers requiring a minimum 20 GBs of free space. Unless Microsoft is gonna require that you backup personal files to OneDrive in addition to syncing your apps and
 settings to OneDrive and restore them after a fresh install. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not great for those without the bandwidth. Especially since most of these cheaper Windows based devices with limited storage end up in places where high speed Internet is a premium.

<p>I found it did work, partly at least, &nbsp;when there is some time between the upgrades. Keep your

            Share with them your Skype Name. To find Skype Name / Skype ID / Skype Address
<br />
<br />Click on your profile picture in top left corner &gt; In the resultant screen, scroll down and you will have Skype Name which is also called Skype ID or Skype Address
<br />OR
<br />Click on 3 dots on top &gt; Settings &gt; Account &amp; Profile &gt; On right side, you will have Skype Name
<br />OR
<br />Another way to get Skype Name / ID is to type following command in any chat and Enter. One of the fields is Skypename: in the output
<br />/dumpmsnp
<br />(The output will be displayed to you only. The contact whose window did you entered this in will neither see the command nor the output)

<h2>            How to stop Excel file from connecting</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open a particular excel file of 8mb, it shows as connecting 
\\ntserver&nbsp;and other sources&nbsp;like \\nasweh54 ,&nbsp;\\CCC,
\\150.0.22.222 etc and the file takes around 5min to just open. How do I stop this as it is very irritating. Below is the screenshot of the issue.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In excel /safe , I was still facing the same issue... </p>
<p>
</p><p>But finally I was able to solve this problem. I downloaded the MS Office Professional Plus 2013 Service Pack and after installing it, the issue got resolved. All excel files opening fine now.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>URL:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2817430/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what changes the service pack made in excel but now its working fine. I found that on another colleagues system the same file was opening fine and when i cross verified the version i found that both had 64 bit MS Office but the numbers were
 different. So i googled out for any service-pack available for MS office 2013. And i found that it was available. Ran the Service pack and restarted the system. Opened the excel file and it opened within 10 seconds without going to contacting etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for all guidance. Appreciated the support.</p>
<p>Thompson Britto.<br />

    <title>Styling endnotes. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geekgirlinfurs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Styling endnotes.</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to make endnotes conform to a style guide that requires that they be marked in regular numerals (not in roman numerals) and that they not be superscripted. The document was created with both the endnote as it appears in text, and at the document
 end, in superscripted lowercase roman numerals. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far I've been able to get both the endnote as it appears in both places to be regular numerals. I've also been able to get the endnote at the doc end to not be superscripted. But I have been UNable to remove the superscripting in the text.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what I've been doing:</p>
<p>First, I go to the Footnote and Endnote formatter (lower right corner of the Footnotes ribbon section) and change the number format to regular numbers. This makes the numbers regular in both places, but still superscripted.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I go into Manage Styles where I find two endnote styles:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Endnote Reference (Hide Until Used), which is indicated as a character style, and
</p>
<p>2) Endnote Text (Hide Until Used), which is indicated as a Linked paragraph and character style.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I modify the first one by unchecking the Superscript box on the fonts panel. This removes the superscripting from the endnotes at document bottom, but the in text endnote number is still superscripted.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried editing the second Endnote style, but it is not set for superscript. I've also tried reversing the order in which I make these changes, but I get the same results.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question then is, how do remove the superscripting from the inline endnote reference numbers. And can I create settings that would make this the default in my Normal template?
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks much!<br />
</p>

            <p>The Endnote Text Style is for the Endnote Text, as its name implies. If you were getting superscripted endnotes, that suggests you were formatting the text with the Endnote Reference Style.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, after modifying a single Endnote Reference Style entry, you select it, right-click and choose Styles&gt;Update Endnote Reference Style to Match Selection, that will reformat all of the Endnote References in the endnotes and in the document body. However,
 it would be an odd style guide that requires endnote references in the document body to not be superscripted. How then&nbsp;would you differentiate between an ordinary number and an endnote reference - especially an endnote reference&nbsp;for an ordinary number?</p>

<h2>            N8 Home button not working</h2>
                    the home button on my nokia n8 is not working. When I press it nothing happens, I have to press really hard then it'll show me my open apps. I think theres something loose in there. I can't tab out of applications so i have to close it one app first before
 opening another its really frustating. Can you fix this?

I thought I had tested the migration from Office 2013 Pro to Office 2016 Pro without problems until I ran into this:
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
Presentations in Office 2016 have text corruption that looks like this:&nbsp;</p>

<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
Unfortunately, I have 12 hours to figure this out, as I have to present then, and I would rather use a VM with Office 2016. Please note I have ruled out the possibility it's a file problem, a machine problem, or a Windows problem, or most other things. Has
 any one ever seen anything like this? The corruption appear random, and does not always appear in the same place on the same slide. THX!!!<br />

<p>There does not seem to be anything there, but a list of all the recent updates (all applied, last one Oct 10).&nbsp;</p>

            CONFIRMED, there is a problem with running windows 10 and latest Parallels Desktop 12 with DirectX10. You have to go the control panel for PD, hardware, and select DirectX9 instead of the default 10. Then all is well.&nbsp;

 you may need to run them in Safe Mode (but try to download, install, update, and run full scans with them normally in normal mode first before resorting to those procedures).&nbsp;These may or may not remove the infection, but will probably not repair any damage
 caused by it. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected, you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip
 over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).&nbsp; If possible, try to run the Microsoft Safety Scan as well:

<p><span>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you
 can ignore the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</span></p>

<h3> richardbunting  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE11 doesn&#39;t automatically open links in a new tab</h2>
                    IE10 used to have the option of always opening a link on a page in a new tab. This is particularly useful when using a search engine to find something, as it kept the search engine tab in the window, whilst allowing you to look at the new sites on separate
 tabs. Now I've got to go back to right clicking and "open in new tab". Is there a way of restoring this IE10 feature?&nbsp;

    <title>Why is a single updates 3x as large as the full Office 2016 ISO&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> -elmer-  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is a single updates 3x as large as the full Office 2016 ISO&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lately I'm struggling with a question for which I, surprisingly enough, haven't been able to find a satisfactory answer yet. Why are the updates so ludicrously big? The latest update for Office 2016 for Mac was&nbsp;3260,8MB, no it's not a typo: 3.3GB. That is
 almost 3 times the size of the iso for Office 2016 for Mac (1.2GB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think something goes wrong in Microsoft's update system: take, for example the Powerpoint 15.16.0 update, for 723,1MB I expect quite a few improvements, but what does it really offer? According to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3102925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="MS15-116: Description of the security update for Office 2016 for Mac: November 10, 2015">
Microsoft</a> the update brings the following:</p>
<span><br />
<span><br />
<em>PowerPoint</em></span>
<ul>
<li><em>Software updates that include the following:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Text editing improvements in tables</em></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>What? Is all I get for 723,1MB are few text improvement in tables? That should be no more than 10MB including a couple of library upgrades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not solely the updates that became way bigger since the switch from Office 2011 to Office 2016. Also the installation. The total disk usage for Office 2011 is 1252MB whereas Office 2016 consumes 6736MB. That is an increase of more than 5 times! One
 might wonder if Microsoft has bought a bunch of shares in Samsung for the production of Apple's SSD's....</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm wondering if I'm the only one with this question and whether it's just my Mac or a general OS X/Office 2016 related thing. And also, why, there must be some major difference in how Office 2016 is installed on OS X compared to Office 2011.<br />

            That's true MS updates&nbsp;for office products on mac versions are usually pretty big in size. I have seen those on my end too. AFAIK.. the are a bundle of packages to fix various issues.

            <p>Chalk it up to Progress in Electronics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My First everMac was an SE/30 using:</p>
<ol>
<li>Motorola 68030 Processor</li><li>512 System RAM. </li><li>And each 128MB RAM SIMM cost about $750-$850 Dollars. It could use up to 4<br />
even then required they be inserted in pairs. <br />
(remember this was a time when you could get a Silverado Long Bed Truck with all the bells and Whistles for less than $4K, similarly equipped today about 12 times as much)</li><li>It came with a 256KB Hard drive That was considered as large as you get<br />
And if it was not Factory could be purchases for about $1K and used a SCSI (Scuzzy) interface.<br />
The actual meaning = Small Computing Systems interface.</li></ol>
<p>Now consider todays days a typical 3 TB Terabyte Hard Drive uses a Choice of USB 2, USB3, (there is also a new version of USB out that is only used in certain model Macs), FireWire or lightning or Thunderbolt interface. They can be had for around $80.00.
 RAM DIMMS now come for apple in &nbsp;four or 8GB sizes. And 8 MB might cost $200. &nbsp;In the PC World they are also available 16GB and 32 GB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now consider the Modern Mac. We now use almost the identically same Intel Chips that PC's do&nbsp;</p>
<p>Processor speed is upwards 3.2 GB</p>
<p>System Ram list limited to a Maximum of 16GB (though larger amounts are available)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For $1k extra you can get a 1TB SSD. Based on past development within next couple of years that $1k (if the World is still here) will get a 10 TB SSD or it successor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Naturally with all this extra room the software companies are salivating and thinking like a Puppy about to get a ham bone to chew on. Oh Boy look at all That Ram&nbsp;I can use up for our applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today Yosemite and El Capitan alone just sitting and idling use close to GB of Ram to operate. And each component in Office 2016 probably close to 1 GB. That means if you have&nbsp;a 4GB machine you dead before you get started. My next machine which hope to purchase
 after Christmas will have 16 GB Ram and the 1TB SSD. I figure by the next System Update apple will come out with 32 GB machines and software engineers will be working there little hearts out to use it all up. There is such a thing as too much &nbsp;progress, much
 to fast.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Microsoft has never been forthcoming about what they change during updates. The list of changes is actually a lot larger than what they describe in their update messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, the 15.16 update brings lots of changes to the Ribbon that developers can use to make add-ins. Crash fixes and other bug fixes are included.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the size of the updates there are two factors that have caused update sizes to be enormous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - Apple now requires "sandboxing." A consequence is that a complete set of fonts must be downloaded and installed for each application in every update. Crazy, yes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Microsoft is now ensuring security by making sure all the ingredients of the application is replaced at once so that should any evil doers got into your Office software after updating everything will be clean and fresh (at least for a few seconds before
 an evil doer re-does what they did previously).</p>

<h2>            Lumia 640 XL does not ring for all... - Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hello!!! Windows!!! We still need help!!!</p>
<p>This is not my first post about this but I and others did not get any answers.</p>
<p>Lumia 640 XL, Windows 8 DOES NOT RING! The soft reset does not fix the problem. It rings for ALL advertisers but not for regular people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should we all switch to Google? Please fix it, it should not be that hard.</p>
<p>Satya! &nbsp;Are you there? )))&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Art.</p>

    <title>Can I install only Outlook&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> k4gdw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I install only Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    My tablet only has 6 GB free on the SSD. I'm perfectly happy with the web apps for Excel, Word, etc. However the Email client and calendar on the start&nbsp;screen &nbsp;suck rocks. I could probably get by if the calendar app allowed me to add my Google Apps calendar.
 Even if it did, I'd much prefer Outlook2013. None of the free, open source alternatives even come close.

It's an x86 based tablet running Win8 Professional. I do have a current Office365 subscription and I use the desktop apps on my laptop as well as my desktop. I would really like to install only the Outlook bits on the tablet.<br />

    <title>formula to copy cells from one sheet to another - Microsoft Community</title>

            <p>OK, so you need to return multiple items from a lookup, you can't use VLOOKUP for that.&nbsp; Take a look at this:
<a href="http://www.ashishmathur.com/lookup-where-search-string-appears-multiple-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ashishmathur.com/lookup-where-search-string-appears-multiple-times/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if you just want to return the result of the sum of all the charges next to Yellow, use the SUMIF function:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUMIF($A$2:$A$500,"Yellow",$B$2:$B$500)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>if on the same sheet</em></p>
<p><em>or</em></p>
<p>=SUMIF(Sheet2!$A$2:$A$500,"Yellow",Sheet2!$B$2:$B$500)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>if on a different sheet</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that from Office 2007, worksheets contain over a million rows, so using A:B references to reference an entire column can be quite a resource drain.&nbsp; It is good practice to avoid this if possible.&nbsp; Just use a sensbily large number to cover your data
 (I used 500 in the above example).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            edit skype profile</h2>
                    <p>Just tried to use Skype for the first time since Microsoft take over.&nbsp; My original user profile was wiped out and replaced with a profile generated by Microsoft which is unacceptable.&nbsp; I have attempted to edit the profile, especially the screen name, with
 no success.&nbsp; How do you edit it ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also seems that all my email addresses have been associated with the Skype account and I cannot open a new Skype account without creating a new email address that has not been hijacked by the program?</p>

            Hi Crispy
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience caused.
<br />
<br />Since October 2016, Skype accounts are now linked to Microsoft Accounts just like other Microsoft Services such as OneDrive. Due to this change, it is no longer possible to delete your Skype account without also closing your Microsoft Account. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Can you try signing out of Skype, then sign in using your Skype ID and password associated with the account to see if your messages and contacts show up?
<br />
<br />Please note, you cannot change your Skype ID name, that is permanent. You can change the display name though. Here is how you do that:<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/732b3f41-74ae-4a56-b60f-66b1e2f76077?upload=true" />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            What is the difference between a Skype ID and display name?&nbsp; Is one public and visible when Skyping, and the other private and visible to only Microsoft and me? I am stunned that Microsoft did not allow me to choose my ID and associated emails, particularly
 since I would have to delete my Microsoft account to edit their decisions.

            Hi 
<br />
<br />Thanks for your follow up. 
<br />
<br />Your Skype ID and Display name are the same.
<br />
<br />A Skype ID is like a nickname, it is often auto-generated by Skype itself or chosen when you first setup your Skype account. 
<br />
<br />The Skype Display name can be changed at anytime and its often another way fellow Skype users can find you. 
<br />
<br />For instance, your Display name could be John Doe, but you could change it to Johnathan Doe or Johnny Doe. Your Skype ID could be a autogenerated 12847575858 or it could jdoe55.

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which name can be seen by other Skype users and which name is private? Are both Skype ID and Display Name visible to all?</p>

            Neither is private, its just a means of finding you either way. Sometimes its easily finding you through your Display Name, since its easier to enter an English name. 
<br />
<br />You can remove yourself from the public directory, so only trusted friends and family can find you. 
<br />
<br />    Sign in to your account in the Skype website.
<br /><a href="https://secure.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com</a>
<br />    Scroll down and click Edit profile.
<br />    Scroll down to Profile settings then disable discoverability

<p>Okay, I disabled discoverability and changed my display name.&nbsp; Who can see my email address?&nbsp; Please be explicit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's decisions have violated my privacy.&nbsp; Even Facebook has better privacy settings.&nbsp; My Microsoft account email is used for a Microsoft Exchange, linking my contacts and calendars across devices.&nbsp; That email address is private for security purposes
 and is not used anywhere other than my Microsoft account. Microsoft's&nbsp; poor decisions regarding Skype integration has made my private information public!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has made bad, short sighted decisions regarding their integration of Skype and preexisting Skype users.&nbsp; If I am forced to close my Microsoft account, I loose everything (contacts, calendars, etc) and Microsoft looses nothing.&nbsp; Microsoft has left
 me no alternative other than to stop using Skype.&nbsp; If everyone stops using Skype then Skype becomes a bad investment for Microsoft. FIX IT MICROSOFT!&nbsp; And, do not use a naïve, inexperienced person to fix it.&nbsp; Your decision making completely lacked a mature
 perspective.&nbsp; You are allowing anyone to associate names and email address, and leaving users no way to set privacy to meet their needs.&nbsp; Additionally, I have no control of my public information. Research how Facebook offers privacy setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a perfect example of why I have avoided cloud based exchange platforms to link my devices, contacts and calendars.</p>

            Only contacts that are in your contact list or persons you have explicitly shared your profile with. If you click on your Skype profile in Skype, then click Share Profile, you have the option of sharing through a direct link or email.

    <title>Probably data bug - Keeping Data Formatting from Excel to a CSV file - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Probably data bug - Keeping Data Formatting from Excel to a CSV file</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When converting an XLS file from Excel to a CSV file format, it will not allow me to keep column formatting. I have a requirement to keep multiple "0's" in a field that, in Excel, is allowed by changing the format from General or Number to Text. When i save
 as a CSV, it will change "0000" to a single "0". I need to keep the multiple "0's" to import into a program that will only accept the CSV file format. Any suggestions on how to keep multiple zeros in a column?</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the image below with the actual status (the format is as text in the initial state, but when converting the format changes to general):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initial .XLS file: &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cdeae0cb-efab-4a53-b40b-9126bf1c980c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cdeae0cb-efab-4a53-b40b-9126bf1c980c?upload=true" height="483" width="132" /></a>&nbsp;
 .... and then converting to .CSV: <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d371358f-3afe-4314-a993-12a33fea616f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            It is not possible to have the leading zero's in the CSV if they are generated using a number format in the cell.
<br />
<br />You have to convert them first using a formula like
<br />=TEXT(E4,"0000")

<br />Would this work?

            Hi Rafael 
<br />
<br />If you highlight the whole of Column E, then do Ctrl+1, which brings up the Format Cells Dialog, on the Number tab what is the Category that is selected.
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

<p>The first screenshot shows the column in text format, you can tell because it is left justified, with leading zeros.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second screenshot shows the column after importing the CSV some place else. The import recognized the numbers and changed it to numeric format, stripping leading zeros.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you have to do is during the CSV import, find the column and explicitly define it as text, NOT numeric.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This article has a section specifically about this problem:</p>

<p>PS: </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not a "bug", it is a "FAD".&nbsp; There is no sense complaining to MS, they won't change the way this works. They have built in automation that works as designed. Which in your opinion is "Failing As Designed".
