<h2>            Problem with PLAY TO, since upgrading to windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Same here. When I was using win 8.0 my LG TV though not a windows certified device but it was detected and i ws able to push media to it using 'Play to' from windows media player. This was the reason i shifted to win 8 as it was not working on win 7. Now
 since I have upgraded to win 8.1 that is since the update became available - my TV is not recognised at all. it does not appear in the devices section, I have tried 'Troubleshooter' and all the things and turn abouts mentioned in many forums but alas nothing
 seem to work.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying with more information. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like Windows Compatibility center states that the device is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=LG%20Electronics%2042LW5700%2042%22%203D%20LCD&amp;vendor=LG%20ELECTRONICS&amp;Locale=1033%2C2057%2C3081%2C4105%2C16393&amp;ModelOrVersion=42LW5700&amp;BreadCrumbPath=42LW5700&amp;LastSearchTerm=42LW5700&amp;Type=Hardware&amp;tempOsid=Windows%208.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
compatible </a>with Windows 8.1. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However from LG support we could not find the exact driver for the device.&nbsp;The similar device&nbsp;suggests that&nbsp;it is compatible with Windows 7 operating system.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey Baryah,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The changes that you see regarding "Not Windows Certified" is an expected change between Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 / 8.1 Update 1.&nbsp; However, the certification requirements were needed to have a device listed via Store apps and the Devices charm.&nbsp; The
 classic PlayTo scenarios (e.g. with Windows Media Player on desktop) should not have been impacted by certification scenarios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said, please take a look at your network settings (Network and Sharing Center).&nbsp; You'll want to ensure that you are on a private network (vs public) and ensure that you have enabled network discovery and sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please double check these things and perhaps before we can do some additional troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked both the things. I am on a private network and network discovery is turned on (please see the attachments) I could not find 'Network Discovery and Sharing' which used to be there in Windows-7. I again checked both my TV and PC are on the same
 network and the TV appears in the 'Network'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also enabled streaming in Windows Media Player, But still cannot find my TV in the Devices or the 'Play To' Menu in Windows Media Player. It says no media devices found.</p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.&nbsp;</p>
<br />
<p>
</p><p>If you do not find the drivers for the exact device, you may have to locate a similar device to get the drivers from. You may have to get in touch with LG support for this. If you receive the driver, you may install the driver in Windows compatibility mode
 and check for the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I would suggest you to un-install and re-install the LG TV drivers in compatibility mode for Windows 7.<br />
<br />
a. Download the drivers from manufacturers website.<br />
b. Right-click on the driver setup files and click on ‘properties’.<br />
c. Click on the ‘compatibility’ tab and check the box ‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’ and select Windows 7 operating system from the drop down.<br />
d. Click on ‘Apply’ and click ‘OK’ to install it.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>If the issue still persists, you may run the Hardware troubleshooter</span></strong>.
<br />
</p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + W’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type troubleshooter in the search box and then press enter.</span></p>
<span>c) Click hardware and sound and run the hardware and device troubleshooter.</span><span><br />
<br />

            <p>Those settings are definitely inline with what I would expect to see working here.&nbsp; We have seen several LG TVs continue to work so am not sure.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the network configuration between these devices?&nbsp; Are they both wired to the same switch?&nbsp; Going through a router?&nbsp; One wired / one wireless?&nbsp; With the device not showing up it would seem as though some notification is being dropped between the TV
 an the computer.&nbsp; The odd piece of the equation, assuming nothing else changed, is that the upgrade broke it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to continue troubleshooting we are likely going to have to run some diagnostic tools and gather additional logs from you.&nbsp; It may be most beneficial and the quickest resolve to get a case opened with our support organization.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Even wired connection does not work. Everything is the same. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My connections - TV and Computer connected with wire to a switch which is connected to my router **** modem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just one more thought .. This had happened in the past as well. I had to reinstall windows as my hard disk crashed. As I had to install win 8 and upgrade to 8.1 (I could not find a way to directly install 8.1 with my existing win-8 licence key). the things
 worked with win 8 and stopped working when upgraded/updated to win 8.1 </p>
<p>

<h3> _gjg  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I look in other photos in the WIndows 10 Photos app&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to open whatever folder you want (that is not in the default Photos folder) in the Windows 10 Photos app? &nbsp;The 'folders' button only brings up the default Photos folder, and trying to add a folder takes me to the settings page which would
 permanently add a folder. &nbsp;I just want to open a folder that I choose. &nbsp;I know I can just go to that folder and open one of the photos, but is there a way to do it from the app? &nbsp;And if I open it this way the menu at the left is gone. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, how do you get it to view an array of Photos the way the Reader app does with pages of a PDF by just zooming out? &nbsp;(See screen shot below) &nbsp;The photo viewer on Windows 8 did this well, now that feature is gone? &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I would like you to provide the information stated below which will give us a clearer image of the issue in hand.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate the statement "&nbsp;if I open it this way the menu at the left is gone"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin with, I would like to inform that you can add folder location onto Windows Photo app. This will give you direct access to the location where the photos are saved via the app. To do so follow the steps outlined below</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>photo app </strong>and click on the<strong> Settings icon </strong>
located on the bottom of the left menu pane.</p>
<p>2. Here under <strong>Sources </strong>you can click on the <strong>+ icon</strong> to add the location of the folder your desire.</p>
<p>3. Once done the said location will be added onto the <strong>Folder</strong> option on the left menu pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the view of the pictures, in photo app how the pictures are displayed as titles depends on the size of the original picture.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, but this only partially addresses the issue. &nbsp;I don't really want to pin folders here permanently, just to be able to navigate to a specific folder temporarily without having to go back to Windows explorer. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I mean by "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">if I open it this way the menu at the left is gone:"</span></p>
<p>If I open a photo directly (rather than opening the app first), the tab at the left with Collections, Albums, Folders, does not appear:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a87291e-e8b4-400f-ab9b-e59b6296aa59" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a87291e-e8b4-400f-ab9b-e59b6296aa59" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I now realize that if I click on 'View All Photos' it goes back to the home screen and this menu re-appears. &nbsp;The problem is, in doing that it exits the folder that the image I opened was in and goes back to the default pinned folders. &nbsp;There doesn't seem
 to be any way to view all the photos in THIS PARTICULAR FOLDER unless I permanently pin it by adding it in the settings (and yes I know it's not 'permanent' in that I can remove them later, but how annoying is it to have to go into the settings every time
 before and after I want to look in one particular folder?)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the delay in response and the inconvenience&nbsp;caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin with, I would like to inform that you will not be able to navigate to a location or folder via the photo app to view pictures. You will have to add the location of the folder to the app in order for you to&nbsp;view the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you open an image, it will directly open with Photo app with out the left menu pane. This is how the app has been designed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend that you post your suggestions and concerns about the same is our feedback app. This will help our developers to know about the current issues and they will make the improvement necessary to enhance Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
Is your printer online?<br />
Is your printer a network printer or locally attached printer?<br />
<br />
I assume you are clicking on the Printer ICON when you want to print something?<br />
Try printing by doing the CTRL-P option.<br />
<br />
Re-install the printer driver.<br />
<br />
Open up wordpad and/or Windows mail and try to print, if you still have the issue, try printing the pages by pressing CTRL and P which should bring up the Print dialog box for you to print and see if that makes a difference.<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 10 and cursor stuttering - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xiahou  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and cursor stuttering</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my computer to Windows 10 about one year ago. The problems started about 3-4 months ago. My cursor starts to stutter, like missing and skipping some movements of my mouse. It's not so much about lag, as cursor isn't doing any "old commands". Only
 thing that works is unplugging and plugging again the mouse. This is getting extremely annoying especially when it is about gaming. Seems like the problem arises the most during those.</p>
<p>And I do not have any realtek stuff on my computer, so no FMAPP either.</p>
<p>Also it happens with every mouse.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading through your post it appears that your headset\mic is working with other programs and you are only having a problem with FlatOut.&nbsp; If this is the case then you can try a couple things.&nbsp; You can perform a&nbsp;<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Clean
 Boot</span></a></span>&nbsp;on your system.&nbsp; This will help determine if some other software may be causing the problem.&nbsp; Also if you have not uninstalled\re-installed the game you may want to try that as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;To remove the game from your system use the&nbsp;<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Windows
 Installer Cleanup Utility</span></a></span>&nbsp;then restart your system and re-install the game.&nbsp; Also verify that all your hardware drivers are up to date.<br />

                    <p>Original title:&nbsp; Webcam issue?</p>
<p>Okay I have a question my computer is running fine. So I run into an issue with my webcam by logitech, the video works fine but the problem seems to be the recording. I don't know if this is the main culprit but my desktop does not have a soundcard installed.
 I was wondering if that is essential for recordings and such. I can play music fine but I can't record sound. Is that the problem? Thank you.</p>

                    <p>When the November build came out (10586 ) I started the update but part way through it failed giving me the error message to try again. &nbsp;Ever since then I have been having some major issues with the OS. &nbsp;It will now randomly freeze to where I have to do
 a hard restart and this occurs at random intervals, be it reading news on the internet, playing games or just watching netflix. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ever since then I have tried updating and I always get to "Preparing to install updates 0%" and wait about 10 minutes before getting an error.</p>
<p>I have tried using the <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Windows Update Troubleshooter but that just stalls at updating registry and nothing happens even after an overnight try.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have heard other people have been having similar problems and thought that it would be nice to be able to download the most recent update through Microsoft's webpage like they did
 with older systems because right now I am stuck not being able to update with a broken OS.</span>Basically, I am hoping someone has a fix for this because after reading other posts none of them came out and had a fix for the issue I am having.</p>

                    <p>I've been trying to change the default save location for documents on my computer from being "Onedrive" to a local hard disk. However no matter how many times I try, the option keeps automatically reverting back to "Onedrive". Below is a screenshot;</p>

            Bri-bee, I recommend you visit the following page to contact OverDrive Media Console's support, this is a 3rd party product and we are unfamiliar with its requirements to provide support:<br />

One thing you can check is that Windows Firewall:<br />

    <title>Unstable sound volume, windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smtahami  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unstable sound volume, windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded windows ver. 8.1 to 10 on my laptop last night, but since then, I have been experiencing a problem with my sound volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to listen to musics in youtube, every time the next music plays, the music plays with a higher volume level and when I just push the button on my keyboard to reduce the volume, it reduces suddently and unusual and comes back to the previous level.
 I did not use to have this problem with windows 8.1, and do not know if it is related to the new windows, drivers or hardware etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please help me to solve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time,</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sm Tahami</p>

            I had a similar problem with sound after upgrading from MS 8.1 to MS 10 and after many attempts to resolve I went to Micro Center here in Michigan and they recommended a HI-Speed USB 3-D 7.1 Sound Adapter and whola it is fixed.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is that my laptop is not old, and I purchased it about 7 months ago. It does not seem so reasonable to change sound hardware because of a bug in windows. I am expecting still to get help from microsoft experts, as it is not just my problem, there
 are also others that experience the same problem as well.</p>

<p>If you mean on your own account, there is no way through Microsoft to accomplish this to my knowledge aside from simply logging out when you're not at your console. If your children have children accounts, you can block all purchases in the privacy settings.
 Here's the link to Xbox's privacy options page which walks you through the process: &nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/online-privacy-and-safety/online-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../online-safety</a> &nbsp; I hope this
 helps!</p>

<p>No. There is no way to add a password just for purchases. The best option would be to not keep a payment method on file. However, you cannot remove a credit card while you're on a valid gold subscription.

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade is stuck in a loop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade is stuck in a loop</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title: </strong>Asus Transformer and Windows 10 </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, I bought an Asus t100taf about six weeks ago, but since being scheduled for the Windows 10 upgrade it is stuck in a loop.</p>
<p>I have Restoring your previous version of Windows showing on reboot, it sits there for a minute or two, reboots and hey presto, right back to the same screen again. I can enter the BIOS using F2 and that is about it. All previous suggestions of holding the
 power button and volume up, f9 and f8, power on and off three times etc. does not get me into the Windows Recovery screen, so following the advise on the Asus support page to revert back to Win 8.1 is useless. Can anyone shed any light on this as I now have
 a useless Transformer book, an almost brand new useless Transformer book?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Rick</p>

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I've had the Surface Pro 4 for only a week now and I've run into quite a few scaling issues. My latest is with my second screen:</span></p>
<p><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">LG 22" Class Full HD LED Monitor&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">- 1920 X 1080, DVI-D, D-SUB, 5 ms, 60 Hz, 16:9 - 22M37D-B</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows 10 (to my knowledge) won't allow different scaling options for a second screen, so my options are either VERY small text on my Surface and a clear image on the second monitor, or normal resolution
 and text size on my surface and a fairly blurry and zoomed in image on the second monitor.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Any ideas to rectify this?</span><br />

            To revert you will need to do clean install again. Seems you are already going to do this as you are talking about Media creation tool.
<br />
<br />The license will not be impacted. The same license will be applicable for you.
<br />
<br />If you had your Windows 10 license activated previously, you got a digital license. You will never need the product key again once you get digital license. Since, you have a digital license, hence when you do clean install, the license information is automatically picked up from Microsoft activation servers. Windows will activate your Windows license from this information.
<br />
<br />Make sure the version installed is same as it was previous. For example, if it was Windows 10 Home, you need to install Windows 10 Home only not Windows 10 Pro. If at any point during installation it asks for the key, choose you will do it later on / skip.

            Hi Qazi
<br />
<br />Did you have activated Windows prior to joining the Windows Insiders?
<br />
<br />If so, your licence will be unaffected by re-installing Windows 10, it will revert to that licence . .. 
<br />
<br />Or
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Windows Insider Program
<br />
<br />Click Stop Insider Preview builds
<br />
<br />Select the option that suits your needs
<br />
<br />Click Confirm and Restart Now

            Current Media creation tool is for 1803, hence you will be going back to 1803.
<br />
<br />You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

            You have two options:<br />Keep getting Insider builds until the next release(which is a bit far from now)<br />Do a clean install of 1803/Restore Factory partition.<br /><br />I do not suggest doing a clean install of 1803 as 1809 is soon hitting public as stable release. So doing a clean install later when it releases is what I recommend.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Your best option is to make clean install:

<br />
<br />If Windows is activated, after reinstall, it will be activated automatically. Just skip the part where you're asked for product key during clean install.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
1. When exactly do you get these error message?<br />
2. What happens when you try to insert the CD/DVD to the Targus DVD ROM DRIVE?<br />
</p>
<p>3. If Targus DVD ROM DRIVE is listed in device manager, Is there any exclaimtion mark?</p>
<p>a. Click "Start" and Type "Device Manager" in search Box and Press Enter.<br />
b. In Device Manager, Expand DVD ROM and check for exclamation mark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Is the DVD ROM recognized by the computer?If not then does other external USB devices working and getting recognized on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try to connect Targus DVD ROM DRIVE by changing the USB port.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If any USB devices are not working, Please use following instructions:</p>
<p><br />
As all the hardware devices have drivers associated similarly USB devices also have it. Sometimes proper drivers do not get detected after the initial installation so reinstallation of the drivers helps resolve the issues.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You may check after uninstalling and reinstalling the USB drivers if you are able to connect. You may disconnect all USB devices and then perform the following steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click Start, and then click Control Panel.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Click System and Maintenance, click System, and then click Device Manager. </p>
<p>Note:If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click System, and then click Device Manager.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or clickAllow.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. In Device Manager, double click to expand "Universal Serial Bus controllers", right click on the Host Controller, click "Uninstall" and click "OK".<br />
Check if at all there is an exclamation mark along the driver, it suggests issues with the driver installed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4. Repeat the step 2 to uninstall all items under "Universal Serial Bus controllers".<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you still face the same issue then you may check for the updated USB device drivers using windows update. Refer to the below link for assistance–</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue sill persists I would request you to check for chipset driver updates which you can get at the manufacturer website. The chipset drivers normally incorporate USB controller drivers as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            Does Xbox One support standard 3.5mm headset</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I am about to order an Xbox One but I have one question before I make this purchase.</p>
<p>I currently use my PS4 on a PC monitor not on a TV so in order to have sound I use a standard 3.5mm headset that I plug into the controller.</p>
<p>I would like to know if I can do the same for the Xbox One (on the controller or on the console itself) or will I need an adapter or a special cable ? If I do need one could you please let me know which one ?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>Hi GeoffBuck.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Currently, there's no official support for third party headsets and adapters for Xbox One. Some existing headsets will work but will have some features missing (typically surround sound and voice chat).</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>What headset do you have?</p>

<p>I use standard 3.5mm headset. It's the type of headset you use with phones with a 3.5mm jack. No microphone so no voice chat. It's just for the sound. The same jack as little earphones for cellphones. Is it possible to plug these in ?</p>

<p>Is there at least an adapter we can use ?</p>
<p>On the xbox 360 I was using the component cable and an adapter on them to plug in this headset.</p>
<p>Is the Xbox One using the same component cable as the Xbox 360 one ?</p>

<p>the xbox one does not use component cables only hdmi. As far as an adapter goes. I am not sure. There is an adapter coming out for third party headsets like turtle beach and astros. But I am not entirely sure about the headset you are using</p>

<p>Ok thanks for the response. So I guess that, if I want to use my current headset, I will have to use the Optical Output and use an optical to 3.5mm adapter or optical to RCA and then a RCA to 3.5mm adapter.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help PalZer0 and x24hrs2livex</p>

            1) yes
<div>2) no its not just one document. It seems to be just the root directory on C. I can not for example save a file to the root directory. As to my external hand drive it is all folders on that drive. Again, for example, if a change a file I can not save the
 changes. When I try to save in both cases I get the Error 0x80070522 message.</div>

<p><br />
Any clues in the Reliability Monitor or Event Viewer?&nbsp; My guess would be that it is another permissions problem symptom.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could try creating another account to see if it is just a question of your profile being corrupted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise running ProcMon would
 supplement whatever diagnostics are being generated.</p>

            My guess would also be that its a permissions problem. The question is how do I change the permissions so that things work?

    <title>Mail merge using Word, Excel and Windows Live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> claire1508  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail merge using Word, Excel and Windows Live</h2>
                    <p>I have looked through previous questions relating to this and have been unable to find a suitable answer.</p>
<p>I have a database in Excel, I have a document in word created through the mailings section.</p>
<p>However, when I try to send this email merge nothing happens.</p>
<p>From some of the discussions I have seen it appears Window Live does not support MAPI is something like that, so mail merging is not possible. Can someone please explain, if this is the case, why there is a email merge section in Window Live or at least
 why when you try to do the mail merge an error message doesn't appear. If Windows Live mail doesn't support mail merge, why on earth have that secion in there at all!!</p>
<p>Thank you to anyone who can shed some light on this and preferably advise what I can use as an alternative to Windows Live to achieve a mail merge.</p>
<p>Claire</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer this question to get more clarity on this issue:</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Which version of Windows Essentials is installed on the computer?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Mail merge from Word requires Outlook or any other MAPI compliant email programs. Windows Live Mail is not MAPI compliant, which is a feature
 that is necessary to execute a merge to email. You can use Microsoft office suite to check if that helps.</span></p>
