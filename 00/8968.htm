    <title>Disabling tablet mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crisgon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disabling tablet mode</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way disable tablet mode or switch back to desktop mode through console or registry keys? I have pressed Tablet mode while on a laptop without a tactil screen, I was just testing, but then the screen started flashing and nothing could be done,
 it's like the desktop is recreating itself a lot of times. I've restarted and the problem continues. I also restarted on safe mode, but I'm not able to get to that button nor through "Notifications" button nor through "Settings".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of you will say to just reinstall, but I had a lot of troubles installing the video drivers. So please, any help will be appreciated.</p>

            The Nokia 1112 has a polyphonic ringer - it does not support wave based ringtones like MP3 phones.<br />

You cannot do what you wanted to do.

            You can only have OTA ringtones stored there. There is no other way to download ringtones, they have to be sent to your phone in a smartmessage or you can compose some on the phone itself.

            How, in practical terms, do you get ringtones sent to the Nokia 1112 by smartmessage? Does anyone provide this service? Or can you do it yourself with the right software or whatever?

<h3> don awalt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 17758.1 seems slow&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I thought I would post here in case others are seeing the same thing, but since I had 17758.1 installed I think late last week, slow ring, I have noticed it seems very slow at times - big delays like even clicking the Start icon and it takes 10 seconds for
 the menu to appear. Some apps will take about 5 seconds or so to actually appear and other times it is instantaneous, like the Start icon usually is. There are no apps running when this happens. So it's more of an intermittent problem that regularly appears.
 As another example, the latest version of Quicken for Windows - sometimes it comes up in a second, other times it can take 10 seconds before anything appears. The lag happens about 30% - 50% of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running it this build on a MacBook Pro with Parallels latest (14.0.1), I have seen this with 8 GB memory allocated and 2 CPUs. It's a very fast Intel machine, and normally Windows 10 just screams on it. There have been no updates in Parallels for the
 last 2 weeks or more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked around at memory usage, CPU, and don't see anything obvious, so I don't know what causes it. But it's very intermittent.</p>

</p><p>Hi Adrianne, thanks for the reply. I checked the Task Manager app as you suggested, it was an idle running Windows....the same lag appeared, and I noticed the Disk utilization was pegged at 100% (this has a very high performance&nbsp;NVMe SSD). It went away in
 about 5 seconds, and then system responsiveness was back. I did then get a snapshot of disk performance in recent time, and you can see it is pegged at 100% a few times even though nothing appears to be going on! The first graph here shows the timeline, the
 second shows it pegged again at 100% even though not much throughput is going on. I'll wait to hear before I update the software.</p>

<p>Thank you for sharing your findings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell me the make and model of your NVMe SSD? Since we don't see any actual processes that utilize your drive, doing a clean boot might lead us to something. Clean boot starts Windows with limited set of drivers, services, and startup programs. That
 way, we can determine whether a background task or non-Windows services is causing this high utilization. Check this

<p>It is a factory SSD from Apple, I ran the system report and it just says "Apple".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am concerned in doing the clean boot, because I see the Parallels services will be ones that are disabled - and I am concerned this will brick my Windows installation since I won't be able to have it boot again in normal mode without boating clean successfully
 to change the settings, if I understand the process correctly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OK, based on your comments, here is what I did - I popped onto the Fast Ring and installed 17763. Almost right away, I noticed about a 5-7 second delay getting the start icon to come up. I tried some other apps and some times they came up after a delay.
 So I went into MSCONFIG and disabled all the non-MS services. There were not many:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple OS Switch Manager (1)</p>
<p>Google Update (2 services)</p>
<p>Dropbox-related (3)</p>
<p>Parallels (2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all non-MS services disabled and reboot, in a limited test the system seemed fine. So one by one I disabled each of the 4 groups of services, then did it a second time - and to me in a limited test, both times, it clearly seems to be Dropbox services
 that are at least the start of the problem. Now, there should not have been anything syncing - no heavy data coming down or anything, So I don't know if this is a Dropbox incompatibility, or something in the Windows system Dropbox is using that is broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll wait to hear if you have next steps, or is this sufficient to see if you can duplicate the behavior?</p>

            I installed Dropbox and I've seen no problems on build 17763.1, so far. Sorry I don't have much for you. Maybe someone else will step in. About all I can suggest is uninstall, see how the system behaves, then re-install.<br />

<p>Well, I uninstalled all of the dropbox services in msconfig, and exited the program, verified it was not running at all, and over the course of a couple of hours the problem is still there. I am not sure if the bursts of 100% disk usage is the cause or an
 effect, but it does match when the system is totally unresponsive - only in the Windows VM. I can see the processes that seem to be highlighted as running are system ones - again, usually no apps are running, and I am trying to start the first one! Sometimes
 it's anti malware service, sometimes its Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't know how to provide more info or determine the true cause, but this performs very poorly and I hope it can be fixed. Please let me know if you need more information.</p>

<p>Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner. This is above my pay grade, VMs, Parallels&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>All I have to offer is some generic advice:</p>
<p>- Report problem to Feedback Hub.</p>
<p>- Try Reset in Settings &gt;Update &amp; Security &gt;Recovery.</p>
<p>- Look to the Parallels forum for example<a href="https://forum.parallels.com/threads/performance-problems-in-windows-10-after-upgrade-to-v14.345305/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> this link
</a></p>
<p>- See the <a href="https://kb.parallels.com/112091" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Parallels advice.</a>- Try some tweaks in the Parallels configuration, <a href="https://forum.parallels.com/threads/parallels-13-macos-sierra-high-windows-10-slow-performance.342434/page-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
for example.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Build 17763.1 is virtually the public release so it shouldn't have too many bugs. You might want to wait until the Fall release ISO is available and do a clean install.</p>

<div>I tried to create an alias for one to the other but it said it was not possible due to the account already being used by another user (ie me)&nbsp;</div>
<div>I dont understand why I cant change the name on the original account so that it has all my mail and folders but with a new address that still links to the old addresses?&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please assist</div>

You must login to the old Hotmail account using a browser at least once every 365 days or you will lose the account.</p>

<h2>            How can I make Word 2013 open by default in Draft view&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Currently, Word opens in Print view. I prefer to work in Draft view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I asked this question in another forum and was told to go to advanced options and check "Allow opening a document in draft view,"&nbsp; and to then save the document.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I did this. However, it&nbsp;did not work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Documents still open in Print view. </p>
<p>Can I make it so that whenever I open a Word 2013 document, it opens in Draft view?&nbsp;

            <p>As Suzanne wrote, in Word 2013, you need auto macros to force a certain view.&nbsp;Placing the macros in the Normal template is sufficient for the code to apply to all documents that you create or open in Word. You can use the following code:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub AutoOpen()<br />
On Error GoTo errhandler<br />
ActiveWindow.View.Type = 1&nbsp; 'Draft view<br />
ActiveWindow.View.Zoom.Percentage = 100&nbsp; 'set the zoom you want<br />

Exit Sub</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub AutoNew()<br />
On Error GoTo errhandler<br />
ActiveWindow.View.Type = 1&nbsp; 'Draft view<br />

<h2>            Spellcheck&#47;Grammar problems on Word 2016&#58; the English default does not work</h2>
                    <p>When attempting to use the Spelling/Grammar check on my MacBook Pro, Word's Spelling/Grammar checker erroneously starts using the French, Danish, or Portuguese dictionary every few words I am trying to spellcheck. I have set the language and custom dictionary
 to English, but Spelling/Grammar check keeps straying to other languages. Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest Office 365 updates. I have Quit out of Word, shut down my computer, and tried the spell check again, but the problem persists. Every few words, the spell checker switches to French, or Danish, etc., instead of searching for my English words.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I doing wrong? I have a 367-page manuscript that I need to get to my copy editor in two weeks.</p>

<p>Well, that's up to you, but It seems that the most likely tack is to clear the
<em>Do Not Check...</em> check box but leave the <em>Detect... </em>box checked. Those are the default status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the typical reasons for using the Do Not Check... option is that the document contains uncommon verbiage that isn't used frequently enough to warrant adding it to a Custom Dictionary[e.g. technical terms for a single document or writing nonsense prose/poetry
 a la Dr. Seuss or Lewis Carroll :-) ].</p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 and Sharepoint Online</h2>
                    <p>I have seen a lot of complaints about Excel 2016 opening ALL SharePoint online documents in Read-Only mode. When will we be able to turn this feature off? Why cant it just open normally like Excel 2013?

            <p>Hello Scott,<br />
<br />
Excel 2016 opening SharePoint workbooks as read-only is a design change from Excel 2013. The reason for the change is to prevent users from being locked out in editing the file. This concern can be addressed by following the instructions that can be found on
 this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Documents-open-read-only-in-desktop-Office-programs-761C66D2-7BC3-490E-A536-B3F71F41636B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I do not have that option in SharePoint. I use the "newer" SharePoint Online layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I either need to open it in Excel or Excel Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I need to click on yellow banner in Excel to edit it or I need to click on Edit in Excel&nbsp;when&nbsp;opening in&nbsp;Excel online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I click on the Excel file name,&nbsp;it always opens in Excel online&nbsp;instead of my installed version. I have changed the settings in the document library/advanced area to tell it to always use client version, but that is not working in some of my libraries.</p>

    <title>Formula function stopped working in Word table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twomutts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Formula function stopped working in Word table</h2>
                    <p>I am using an invoice template and have been using this for several months.&nbsp; For some reason, the function =PRODUCT(LEFT) will no longer calculate and only shows $0.00 when I'm adding new lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The previous lines calculation is still working.</p>
<p>In a different invoice, I am getting an error message "!D19 Is Not In Table" and I can't figure out why.&nbsp; The table doesn't have 19 rows...</p>
<p>Alt+F9 shows the formula is the same and F9 resets to $0.00 and even those calculations that were previously working will not work after I press F9.</p>

<p>Please help.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That is to be expected if there's nothing if any of the cells reference by the formula is empty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the other error, that could occur is the table has ever been split then rejoined without the parts being exactly aligned. The same is true&nbsp;if some cells on row 19 have been merged or rows preceding row 19 have been merged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FWIW, if you select any cell in a table then run the following macro, the cell's address will appear on the status bar:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub CellAddress()<br />
'This macro displays the address of a table cell on Word's status bar<br />
If Selection.Information(wdWithInTable) = True Then<br />
&nbsp; If Selection.Cells(1).ColumnIndex &gt; 26 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; StatusBar = "Cell Address: " &amp; Chr(64 + Int(Selection.Cells(1).ColumnIndex / 26)) &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chr(64 + (Selection.Cells(1).ColumnIndex Mod 26)) &amp; Selection.Cells(1).RowIndex<br />
&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; StatusBar = "Cell Address: " &amp; Chr(64 + Selection.Cells(1).ColumnIndex) &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.Cells(1).RowIndex<br />

            <p>In the new lines there are numbers in the columns to the left of the formula, but it won't calculate them.&nbsp; The lines that were previously calculated I can still right click and update and it works.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I went back to the table that was showing the&nbsp; "!D19 Is Not In Table" error message.&nbsp; If I change the formula to =SUM(LEFT), it will show $0.00, (even though there are no numbers to the left) but after deleting two lines and moving the =SUM(ABOVE) formula,
 I'm now getting the same error message with "!D17"&nbsp; So somehow it seems to be looking to the line below where the formula is placed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The tables have not been modified or merged so I'm still at a loss.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any additional ideas for me?</p>

            <p>Regarding the =PRODUCT(LEFT) formula, it won't recalculate just by you adding numbers to the referenced cells - you need to force an update (e.g by selecting the formula and pressing F9).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the&nbsp; "!D19 Is Not In Table" error message, the macro I posted will return a cell reference. If you select the cell you think is D19 and run the macro, you'll get its true address.</p>

            I am having a similar problem. &nbsp;The table is set up in a template and works fine so long as the template isn't locked. Once it is, the formulas do not work and the F9 doesn't either.

            If you're using forms protection, you won't be able to insert anything into the table, except in formfields. In that case, make sure the formfields have their 'calculate on exit' property checked; the calculations will then update automatically.

<br />Yes, you have done incredibly well thus far! And because you have managed to attach screenshots, I am now able to see your problem more clearly.
<br />
<br />You have managed to selectively search for Microsoft/Outlook cookies. You are nearly there! The next step is to hover your cursor over to the row, then left-click on it and the "Remove Selected" button will be enabled for you. (Refer to the screenshot, you need to highlight the specific row to delete selected cookies)
<br />
<br />Next, ^^refer to instructions above.
<br />
<br />That's all!
<br />
<br />Yes, you may click "Remove All" which will single-handedly clear all your cookies like caches. However, it will causes you some inconvenience as you will need to log in to every website again that you have already logged in. My objective is to resolve this issue with you, swiftly and minimal disruption.
<br />
<br />Cookies that you may not recognise, you shall exercise your discretion to delete them as well. But it is pointless because those cookies will accumulate again as you browse random websites. They can be many things, from saved preferences to trackers.
<br />
<br />Cheers!

<h2>            Get options data from Yahoo finance intoexcel for MAC -2011</h2>
                    <p>I want to read option chains from Yahoo finance into Excel worksheet on Mac using a VBA macro, like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; With ActiveSheet.QueryTables.Add(Connection:="URL;http://finance.yahoo.com/q/os?s=AAPL", Destination:=Range("$A$10"))</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works for quotes (e.g.&nbsp;http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=AAPL&amp;f=l1) but not for options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same question as this one, but for options data:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_excel-mso_mac/get-some-data-from-web-yahoo-finance-and-update-a/0d5bd2d4-be04-42c5-ba78-1f4eddaa93e9</p>

<h2>            How can I get the cursor to go to the left margin when I hit a return&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am so frustrated, if I could find the moron who added the auto-indent into Word, I swear I would be inclined to punch him in the face for wasting so much of my time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the problem.&nbsp; I draft documents with numbered paragraphs.&nbsp; I tab once, type the number, then tab again, and start typing the paragraph.&nbsp; When the text wraps down to the next line, it will not start at the left margin.&nbsp; Instead, it automatically aligns
 with the typed number.&nbsp; I have wasted ALOT of time trying to stop this automatic feature, to the point that I curse Microsoft on a regular basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me how to turn off this moronic feature?&nbsp; I have searched through the auto formating **** options, turned off all that I could find, but to no avail.&nbsp; What as **** program Word has become.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Signed, a former fan of Microsoft Word, who now hates it with a vengance because the morons at Microsoft have ruined it.</p>

            <p>I am pretty sure this feature has been around since 2003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When word detects you are creating a list, it applies the List Paragraph Style to your paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A paragraph as defined in Word as&nbsp;text followed by a hard return (enter key.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The List Paragraph Style has a .5" indent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You can modify this style.&nbsp; (Generally Not Recommended)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You can click the contextual autocorrect options that appear when you create a&nbsp;list and turn off "Stop Automatically Creating Bulleted Lists"

as described in this article.</a>&nbsp;(Generally Not Recommended)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. You can create a list, for example: (Recommended)</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">1. Item 1</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2. Item 2</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">3. This sentence is not supposed to be in the list.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Let's say you don't want sentence 3 in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you are typing "This sentence...", just click the "Normal" Style in the&nbsp;Styles group&nbsp;in the Home Tab of the ribbon in the&nbsp;upper-right of&nbsp;Word 2013.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you let Word create automatic lists for you, then you get no control over the indentation. You can change the indentation after a list has been created, but that is all. As John suggested, you should turn off the automatic conversion.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, make use of a numbered paragraph <strong>style</strong> whenever you want&nbsp;a numbered list. You can use the built-in List Number style, but of course you should modify it so that it suits the needs of your document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To modify the style, do the following: Apply List Number to text and then click the actual number (so that Word selects it). Right-click and choose Adjust List Indents. In the dialog box, make the desired changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Adjust List Indents dialog box, "Number position" defines the position of the list number, "Text indent" defines the position of the second and subsequent text lines, and "Add tab stop at" defines the position for the text following the paragraph
 number (assuming that "Follow number with" is set to "Tab character"). Note that all measurements are from the left margin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, you want the "Text indent" value to be zero.</p>

            <p>You've run into AutoFormat As You Type. This has been around for a long time, at least since Word 97. Many users turn off most of the features when they first install. Then they forget about it until they install a new version and have to turn them off again.</p>

<p>1. If, in this forum, you type a numbered list it does much the same thing, wrapping to the Indent after the number.</p>
<p>2. When you hit the enter key to start a new paragraph, it assumes that you want a new list item and gives you another number.</p>

<p>6. Automatic numbered lists (not created using multilevel lists tied to styles) work the same way in Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first method uses what is called a "hanging" indent.</p>

    <title>Search Folders Do Not Refresh in Secondary PSTs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> judy griggs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search Folders Do Not Refresh in Secondary PSTs</h2>
                    <p>I use Outlook 2016 for my POP3 email account.&nbsp; I have set up some rules that move some of the incoming emails from my Inbox/PST associated with the email account to folders in a second PST.&nbsp; (This allows me to distinguish work emails from personal emails.)&nbsp;
 I then have two search folders that are where I work through the emails received recently.&nbsp; They are each set up for "received in the last 7 days" and there is one for each PST.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that when I first open the Last 7 Days search folder for the secondary PST, it is not current.&nbsp; I haven't figured out to refresh the folder except to open the "Customize This Search Folder" dialog, fiddle with a setting, and save the settings
 again.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there is a better way to handle refreshing the search folder for the second PST.&nbsp; F5 doesn't seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>I waited until this morning to test this since the problem generally occurs between one day and the next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure enough, today I moved two emails into my secondary PST.&nbsp; One had been sent to me yesterday, but I hadn't downloaded it into my primary PST until today.&nbsp; The other was my reply to yesterday's email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I then checked the contents of the secondary PST's Last 7 Days search folder, the email from yesterday was there but not today's response.&nbsp; Pressing F5 did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I refresh the search folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(FWTW, I closed Outlook yesterday evening and shut down the computer.&nbsp; This morning the computer was started again and then Outlook was opened.)</p>

            This is the result of a rarely used option setting. I can't guess how it might have gotten set, but here's how to fix it.<br />
<br />
Using the File &gt; Open command, go to the Templates folder (usually %appdata%\Microsoft\Templates) and open the Normal.dotm file.<br />
<br />
Click File &gt; Options and then click Save at the left side.<br />
<br />
At the bottom of the options page, clear the check box for "Embed fonts in the file" and click OK.<br />
<br />
In the body of the template, type a single character (such as a space) and backspace to remove it, to make Word realize that the template needs to be saved. Then save it and close it.<br />
<br />
You should now see Normal.dotm back to its "normal" size.<br />

            <p>RE:&nbsp; FileDialogFolder picker to include files?<br />

The FileDialog<em>File</em> picker version doesn't allow folder picking.<br />
So maybe the following code will work on Windows 7.<br />
It works on Windows XP, and differs in what it produces depending on the Windows version used.<br />
</p>
<p>Note:<br />
' The CreateObject last argument specifies the folder appearing at the top of the dialog.<br />
' &amp;H4000 displays folders and files, but does not allow file selection.<br />
' Use &amp;H1 to display folders only.<br />

                    The Equation in Object in Word 2010 suddenly turned off. Following an instruction to turn it back on. The instruction said select the File tab, but I can't find the File tab in any of the ribbons.<br />

            In Word 2010, the File tab is the blue rectangle at the far left, next to the Home tab, just above the ribbon.
