<p>Try an in-place update of the same build or newer by using an ISO image burned to a USB drive and booting from it. Instructions below to download the ISO apply to any build number (disregard the rest). Good luck!</p>

<p>Are you talking about your security software or the latest Insider build?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not uncommon to lose 3rd security software when using Beta W10.&nbsp; I am a long time Norton
</p>
<p>user and I lost Norton 2 or 3 builds back.&nbsp; This was not unexpected.&nbsp; Norton is even on record as not supporting Beta W10.&nbsp; Norton will catch up before official W10 release.&nbsp; I check Norton with each new Insider build and so far, no go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insider builds warn about problems with 3rd party software.</p>

                    I exported my Outlook for Mac 2011 email from my MacBook and tried to import it into Outlook for Mac 2011 on my iMac - the folder shows up in the navigation panel but it contains no email - how do I see email?

<div>I'm really surprised you couldn't find the e-mails though.</div>
<div>There is indeed an alternate option.</div>

<div>This will migrate the entire thing from one machine to the other (but </div>
<div>then, whatever was on the destination Mac is gone! It's really about </div>

<h2>            14251 install problems &#40;in a VM&#41;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Updating to this build has been a headache. Once more(!) I can blame the WU of the host more than the VM. There was an update to the host which I stupidly didn't prepare for by uninstalling Hyper-V and as a result it wiped out my vSwitch. I managed to recover
 from that (eventually). Now every time I try to update the VM with this build I get the message Inaccessible boot device, which sounds crazy unless it is referring to the vSwitch somehow.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the course of trying to diagnose this I have run into numerous usability issues, the principal one being that users are given almost no chance to know what is wrong. Even if they see the message it only lasts for about 2 seconds before Recovery starts.
 Recovery ignores a user's request not to reboot from crashes and this is surely just as significant because there are zero clear clues about what has happened, especially if they haven't had their eyes glued to the screen while the 3 hour update proceeds before
 that 2 second flash terminates it. So, I'm wondering if I should try using bcdedit to suppress recovery? I'm guessing that that would at least enable the message to be seen as long as necessary but don't know what the options would be after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it might be related to the VM's virtual DVD which turned out to be an .iso from July for 10162. When I tried to investigate this possibility (e.g. using the press any key method) I was not allowed to use it, seeing a message about modules being
 "expired". I replaced it with a Media creation tool .iso and tried to use that as a Repair. I have no idea if the repair worked. Evidently it didn't repair what I was hoping it would.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some suggestions for what diagnostics to be looking for would be appreciated. I do have a WindowsUpdate.log! Get-WindowsUpdateLog is working. Good news. But neither it nor ReportingEvents.log bear much resemblance to what I was observing for 3 hours. In
 particular there is no mention of the Inaccessible boot device in either log. As far as ReportingEvents.log is concerned there was a successful install. Otherwise slim pickings in the WU log. One example, I now see, is that there is a reference to my mother's
 printer which could easily be changed with a retry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw it is a good thing that I am on an unlimited Internet service because counting the Media creation tool and all the failed attempts (which cause full downloads each time) would probably end up costing some users a lot of unexpected expense or even more
 unpleasant consequences than what I am experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I change the type of this thread?&nbsp; Let's make it a Discussion instead of a Question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I unmarked the Answer but still have no idea how to make this into a "Discussion".&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Same problem with 14257.&nbsp; I have set&nbsp; RecoveryEnabled to No for the next attempt.&nbsp;&nbsp; sfc /scannow&nbsp; found nothing.&nbsp; chkdsk /r&nbsp; on both D: and C:&nbsp; found nothing but none of the reports could be kept.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a new symptom for 14257!&nbsp; 0x8007032&nbsp; (in WindowsUpdate.log)&nbsp; and&nbsp; 0x8024F005 (I guess, in WU GUI).&nbsp; I'm saying "I guess" because it is off to the races again and wiped that detail out.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm perplexed.&nbsp; I'm not seeing anything like that in either
 log...&nbsp; Ah.&nbsp; I was making a naive assumption that hex codes would have a 0x prefix (to make regular expression pattern matching easier)&nbsp; No such luck:&nbsp; some do and some don't.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To see if I am on the right track I can try just getting rid of the those or all (somehow).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, trying with Control Panel View Devices and Printers to delete one of those (redirected) ones results in yet another bogus message trying to hide the real cause:</p>
<p>This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer.&nbsp; Please contact your system administrator.
</p>
<p>Well, since this is a PC that would be me.&nbsp; Time for ProcMon.&nbsp; However, when looking at the DeviceContainers I had noticed Access denied for the Properties branch, so that is what I will guess I may see.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, since that symptom occurs for all of them it
 may be another red herring and its bogus message really implying that the key is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, I see that same symptom on my host which is at 10586.71 so I guess that will actually be normal.&nbsp; However, my host just allowed me to remove the Fax device without any problem.&nbsp; So, there will be a discrepancy of some kind there in the guest.&nbsp; But
 now I'm wondering if (redirected) may only be a normal thing that happens to printers under a VM?&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; (Sure would be nice to have some source or support documentation--or the help of someone who had access to&nbsp;those things... )</p>
<p>
</p><p>What about a troubleshooter?&nbsp; Which one?&nbsp; Hardware and Sound&nbsp; Printer&nbsp; It doesn't list all the ones that the others list!&nbsp; I was able to get rid of all the "real" ones.&nbsp; Only the (redirected) ones are left.&nbsp; I'm going to reboot and if that doesn't make these
 ghosts go away I will drop out of the Homegroup (since the troubleshooter seems to think that is significant for these.)&nbsp;&nbsp; But the troubleshooter is now somewhat lost because it is no longer giving me a list of printers...&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>

</p><p>So it was Fax (redirected 2).&nbsp; That would have been the first in the list of ghosts and also not designated the default.&nbsp; That happened to be the second one.&nbsp; Coincidence?&nbsp; I am setting the default to be the last one and rebooting again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oops.&nbsp; It seems
 to be stuck in a loop:&nbsp; Worm chasing its tail on a screen showing "Restarting".&nbsp;&nbsp; Now what?&nbsp; Does it have a sanity timer?&nbsp; If not what is the best way to stop it?&nbsp; Simulate Power failure?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I left it running all night like that so it looks like the answer to my first question is Not likely.&nbsp; For the second I decided to try Shutdown first (e.g. via VMConnect Action menu) because I was afraid that "Turn off" instead of just simulating a power
 failure might instead simulate a so-called hard reset which could have the effect of the firmware telling the OS "You're broken."&nbsp; Anyway, Shutdown worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found out a bit more about these "(redirected)" printers and it looks like they are all remote printers from my Hyper-V host called Remote Desktop Easy Print.&nbsp; I haven't found out how to disable that and nothing that I have done has given me any more control
 over them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have used Windows Features to disable as much related stuff as possible and when that still left a printing feature apparently enabled I used DISM</p>
<p>PS&gt;Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "Printing-Foundation-Features"</p>
<p>Reboot was not required but the three problem "printers" persisted and could not be removed by normal means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I do have considerable changes made which should at least change the symptom description by the number of failure events I am allowing update to go again.</p>

<p>So close.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
We'll be ready soon Don't turn off your PC.<span>&nbsp; </span>No change in many minutes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A consequence of changing the BCD?<span>&nbsp; </span>So was that worm + Restarting thing earlier also a consequence?<span>&nbsp;
</span>How do I know when to<span>&nbsp; </span>assume it is done?<span>&nbsp; </span>It is very slowly changing color -- dark blue -- light blue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I'm monitoring vmconnect.exe and vmms.exe with ResMon but there is very little Network activity (perhaps enough for the blur effect) and disk activity which is barely registering.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Vmwp.exe is nowhere to be seen.<span>&nbsp; </span>Oh. Somehow it got unchecked.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Must be a new task.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Still nothing registering…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OMG.<span>&nbsp; </span>It's done.<span>&nbsp;

</p><p>It has been so long since I set it up that my recollection is hazy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I based it on this</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, now I would prefer to use a VHD for a dual-boot scenario, e.g. following the tip of Scott Hanselman</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GuideToInstallingAndBootingWindows8DeveloperPreviewOffAVHDVirtualHardDisk.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GuideToInstallingAndBootingWindows8DeveloperPreviewOffAVHDVirtualHardDisk.aspx</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason is that I think I am missing out on a lot of features that my Surface Pro supports natively but not via Hyper-V, such as Speech (e.g for Cortana), Full-screen Touch (e.g. for Continuum),&nbsp;plus I imagine that performance when booting natively will
 shine more than it does as&nbsp;a VM.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I just realized that this rationale was what I had when W8.2 was the Hyper-V host.&nbsp; Now that W10 is the base OS why can't I test those things?&nbsp;&nbsp; Two reasons: it still doesn't like my microphone(s) and apparently I can't have two monitors and use Full-Screen
 mode.&nbsp; I guess what I really should do is undock my Surface more.</p>

            is it possible to create a vm for windows xp?&nbsp; my desktop is running windows 7 ultimate because I use the xp insert occasionally to work with my Nikon coolscan ls-4000 scanner to scan film or slides.&nbsp; don't do it very often.&nbsp; I downloaded the software
 on here and it says it doesn't run on this operating system.&nbsp; I thought if I could run win xp that would be a nice project for me.&nbsp; thanks, chas

<p>Hi Jennifer,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. My answers below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;If "the Microsoft Teams App" refers to the Teams mobile app, please make sure you are entering the correct username and password and switch to a different network connection to see if there is any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have entered the correct username, it does not bring me to the password page. For some reason it has remembered my account and as soon as I press the account the "Sign-in Error" pop up will come up.</p>

<p>3. Can you successfully sign in Teams app before? Have you made any changes before this issue happens?</p>
<p>Yes, I was always able to use the Teams app since I first started August 2018. Recently it started acting up and rejecting all messages I am sending there. So I deleted the app and tried to re-log in. Now it won't let me log back in.</p>

<p>Hi LucyLiuvan, &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the clarification. Form the screenshoot you attached, your cellphone is connecting to network through WiFi, to narrow down whether this issue is related to the network, it is suggested that you change the network environment to see if there is
 any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please kindly check if you can sign in Teams with a different account (such as your co-worker's account) or if you can sign in your account in a different cellphone, it will help us confirm whether this issue is related to the Teams app in your phone
 or your account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, if the issue persists, please share detailed version information with us about both your cellphone&nbsp;operating system and the Teams app. Thanks for your cooperation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>

    <title>How do I know if Security Essentials is working&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slider99  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I know if Security Essentials is working&#63;</h2>
                    TrendMicro (and other virus and spam filters) routinely identified and deleted viruses and spam. I reformatted my hard drive four months ago and switched to Security Essentials. Although it scans daily I have never&nbsp; had a single incident when it logged
 a suspected virus or spam. It logs that it does the daily scan but how do I know it's doing the same job the other programs did?

<p>MSE does not filter spam. MSE does not scan cookies because cookies are not a security threat. If MSE is green and if no detections appear in the history tab it means MSE is working properly and no malware has been detected on your computer. If a computer
 is used carefully you can go for years without being attacked by malware.</p>

    <title>UserForm Template to Create Multiple Documents - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dario_d_diaz  say:</h3>
<h2>            UserForm Template to Create Multiple Documents</h2>
                    I created a template that has several documents within the Template.&nbsp; The template has a Userform that has input fields to populate the documents.&nbsp; We were able to submit the document as a single document.&nbsp; Now there has been a change and each document
 must be submitted individually.Let me explain more clearly if I can:<br />
<br />
Template1 is a 12 page document template with a userform to populate the fields.<br />
Pages 1-4 of Template1 is Document1, pages 5-7 is Document2, pages 8-10 is Document3, and pages 11-12 is Document4.<br />
<br />
We used to be able to send Template1 and everything was OK, the receiving site would break down the documents individually.&nbsp; But now, the receiving site is requiring us to submit each document separately.&nbsp; So Document1, Document2, Document3, and Document4 must
 be sent individually.<br />
<br />
Each Document1-Document4 has similar information in them (i.e. Name, phone number, address, date of birth).&nbsp; It would be a real pain to have to create 4 different document templates and input the same sets of data 4 times.&nbsp; It is also a pain to cut/paste each
 document and then same separately.<br />
<br />
Here is my question...finally.&nbsp; Is there a way to create a template where we only have to input the data set one time in the UserForm and all 4 separate documents will be created from the information?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Two ways to go about it:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have&nbsp; macro in the UserForm that after populating the 12 pages with the required information, split the document into the four parts, which would probably be best done by having a section break between each of the parts and then using code such as that in
 the following macro</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Sub splitter()<br />
' splitter Macro<br />
' Macro created by Doug Robbins to save each letter created by a mailmerge<br />
' as a separate file, retaining the header and footer information.<br />
Dim i As Long, Source As Document, Target As Document, Letter As Range<br />
Set Source = ActiveDocument<br />
For i = 1 To Source.Sections.Count<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Letter = Source.Sections(i).Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Target = Documents.Add<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target.Range = Letter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target.Sections(2).PageSetup.SectionStart = wdSectionContinuous<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target.SaveAs FileName:="Letter" &amp; i<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target.Close<br />
Next i<br />
End Sub</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">The second way would be to save a template containing the user form in the Word Startup Folder so that it was treated
 as an add-in and create a separate template for each of the four documents and have code in the user form create new documents from each of the templates, populating each with the data that was inserted into the form and then saving each one in turn.</font></span></p>

            Doug,<br />
<br />
Thank you for the info.&nbsp; I still can't get it to work.&nbsp; Here is what I did:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; I opened Template1 and added section breaks to each document contained in Template1.&nbsp; There were a total of four (4) section breaks.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; I opened the Visual Basic window and selected the UserForm and then View Code.&nbsp; At the end of the code I added your VBA above.&nbsp; I then saved the code and Template1.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; I closed Word completely and then ran the Template I modified with the section breaks and the code.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it did nothing.&nbsp; I tried to add the code to the actual Template rather than the UserForm but that did not work either.<br />
<br />
This problem has given me fits.&nbsp; What did I do wrong?&nbsp; Or what else should I consider.&nbsp; I'd be glad to send you the template if that would help.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<p>The emails from inside the company were sent to a live.com emaiñ account, actually there is a legal case against that company and the live.com email can proof the right actions from the Company were taken care.</p>

            <p>When I installed Windows 10 on my ASUS T100TAM (64Gb), I actually used the most recent ISO build and did a clean install, completely wiping Windows 8.1 from the system. I did do a backup of the Windows 8.1 recovery files first though, so I should be able
 to go&nbsp; back if I ever need to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I've been running Windows 10 on it for a few months and it seems pretty stable to me. I'm using most of the drivers from the ASUS web site.</p>

</p><p>How did you delete Windows 8.1 then install Windows 10? Does it require a bios level boot from another external device like a usb drive?</p>

            <p>Well I have success. Perseverence and Pryer Pay Off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After fooling with the recovery partition size to make more disk space for the install my Windows 8.1 would not boot. So I booted and installed from my Windows 8.1 recovery USB drive, fixing/resoring the damaged partition. After booting into Windows 8.1
 I discovered I had more than 18gb of disk space unused. I booted up with my windows 10 version 10130 ISO image USB drive and installed Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation took more than an hour but to my pleasant surprise the installation actually updated and installed version 10162. Booted up in Windows 10 preview and now&nbsp;&nbsp;running fine. Battery life seems improved and program operation seems crisper and
 faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all your help and insight.</p>

<h2>            MacBook Pro hard drive died and took Office for Mac 2011 with it to the afterlife</h2>
                    Is there a way to retrieve Office for Mac from Microsoft by only using my MacBook serial number and data?
<br />
I don't have any of the supporting documentation that came with Office for Mac 2011. I looked through all of the discs that came with my laptop but I think it was downloaded (Office for Mac 2011) rather than using a disc. I simply can not remember. I was getting
 updates from Microsoft so apparently Microsoft knew my laptop. Thoughts or suggestions?<br />

            <p>check to see if this link is still alive:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/office-2011-digital-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Digital Download</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If still active download from there and <strong>"IF"</strong> you have your 25 Character License Key. You can install then update to version 14.4.8 &nbsp;and have your Office Applications. It won't magically reinstate you Data Files nor any templates or VBA Scripts
 or Macros you designed you will have to re-write them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you used Time machine to do &nbsp;a Back up, if you did, you might have a chance to Restore by hooking up that Drive, Then Switch to Recovery Mode and do restore drive using Time Machine backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps, assuming you have a new drive that has been formatted &nbsp;and partitioned to allow for system recovery and that hopefully you have a Good Time machine backup.:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plug in you Time machine Drive<br />
</li><li>Turn on computer and Hold down ⌘ Key then click and Hold on the R key<br />
(This activates Recovery Mode)<br />
</li><li>Sign in by using username and password for administrator.when asked.<br />
</li><li>Next from options Look for Restore Computer from Time machine backup.<br />
</li><li>Now choose desired Time machine backup to use.<br />
(To be on safe side I would use second to last &nbsp;backup)<br />
</li><li>Depending upon type drive you had USB2, USB3,&nbsp;FireWire or<br />
Thunderbolt Drive, Sit back and wait until complete. <br />
(Could take 20 minutes or could take 5 or 6 hours)<br />
</li><li>When complete. Restart computer and should function. you may have to repair permissions &nbsp;and resolve any font conflicts.</li></ol>
<p>If you can't get a pre-formatted Drive you may have to take to an Apple store and have them to get you up and running.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>First of all Phillip, thanks for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backup my hard drive? Why would I do a silly thing like that!!??&nbsp; :-)<br />
Yes, that is what got me into this problem. <br />
The link you provided did not work and I have no idea where the 25 digit key is anyway. It was likely lost with all of the other information.<br />
<br />
I did replace the hard drive and I am back up and running, just without Word, PP and Excel.<br />
<br />
Yes, I can replace a hard drive but am to stupid to back my machine up. I guess it was an expensive lesson!&nbsp; :-(&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a local service that will recover the data for $90. I might as well pay the $$ and get my MS Office along with all of my other goodies.<br />

            <p>That may not be such a bad investment. And although you wouldn't be able to get your data back You could sign up for Office 365 Single user version $69.00 a Year.&nbsp;deluxe version allows you install on up to 5 devices any Mix of PC and Mac (Phone Tablet, or
 computer) plus OneDrive cloud space and a Skype subscription. As major Upgrades come out say from 2011 (hopefully) to 2015/16 would be freely upgraded.

    <title>Outlook 2011 does not properly display inline image attachments in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adrockcal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2011 does not properly display inline image attachments in emails.</h2>
                    Basically the user finds that some email attachments that are images placed inline in the message do not display, rather replace the image with a blue question mark box.<br />
<br />
I have found also that if you open the email, close it, and then open again, it often displays the image properly.&nbsp; I've tried rebuilding, reinstalling, clearing all preferences, and caches and with no luck.&nbsp; Also, if you forward the image it appears properly
 immediately.<br />
<br />
Also, if I right click on the box and go Open, it displays the image properly in Preview.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It appears to be a cache access or temporary folder issue since that's where the file should download to and display when the email is open, but it does not display properly on the first opening.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br />
<br />

            it's not a problem of only downloading the first few kb. This happens randomly, and often it works when opening the mail for the 3rd or 4th time.<br />

            <p>No that is not the case.&nbsp; I've verified it's set to download the full message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some images that display fine, and when I set Outlook not to download the images, they display differently (no blue question mark box, and I receive the "allow Outlook to download these images" link at the top.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very confusing.&nbsp; It appears the Blue Box images are different types of images (inline, png, or other differences), than the ones blocked by the "Automatically Download Pictures from Internet" setting.</p>

            <p>These question marks are displayed when there is something wrong with the image.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, we are all updated, to 14.2.5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't seem to matter which version we're using.</p>
<p><br />
Most of these failures seem to come from the same client, using Office 2007 on a Windows machine, so it just may be a problem translating the email from one platform to another.</p>
<p><br />
Is troublesome because they're both Microsoft applications, so they should be able to talk to each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a workaround for the users that involves forwarding the email (or beginning a forward), in which the image displays properly on the new message which is then discarded.</p>

<h2>            Email Buffer&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a buffer in the WM6 email application and/or is there more overhead with email than any other standard office application?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Treo 750.&nbsp; When I type fast in email, I notice a delay before characters are displayed on the screen and often times, not all characters show up.&nbsp; I cannot (at least not yet) out-type other applications such as Word or text messaging.&nbsp;
 The net result is, when typing at fast speeds (for a Treo), depressing the keys in a similar manner, I lose characters when working in email, but not in Word or text messaging.&nbsp; The latter experiences are significant because they indicate that the issue is
 not one with bad keys or fat fingers.&nbsp; The issue is too consistent with email only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else seen this?&nbsp; Is it unique to the Treo?&nbsp; Are there tweeks that can be done for email?</p>

<p>Greetings mbrossar!&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I do not have any experience with the Treo 750, but your description of the problem would lead me to the same conclusion: the trouble is specific to the e-mail program.&nbsp; So my advice would be to change your e-mail program. This
 can be a short-term test, but if you like the results, you can make it permanent of course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would highly recommend <a href="http://www.pocketinformant.com/products_info.php?p_id=mail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
FlexMail</a> 2007, from WebIS.&nbsp; It's a fantastic program, and it has a lot more features than the standard e-mail application that comes bundled with WM6.&nbsp; This is, I believe, a 14 or&nbsp;21 day trial, so you should have sufficient time to test it out to see if
 the same problem is apparent.</p>

    <title>Fullscreen Outlook 2016 on OS X 10.11.2 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Fullscreen Outlook 2016 on OS X 10.11.2</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all, I have not been able to get Outlook 2016 to work in full screen mode on my 15" MBPR laptop, running El Capitan. &nbsp;I like to swipe between full screen apps on my computer. &nbsp;Is there something I am missing?</p>
<p>However, I have found a decent workaround for anybody who is interested. &nbsp;Instead of assigning Outlook to a new fullscreen space, I have assigned it to a new desktop entirely. &nbsp;So I click the green button to maximize the window, then drop to the top of the
 screen, then all the way to the right to the plus sign. &nbsp;This will put a maximized Outlook window into a new desktop (Desktop 2) that I can "four-finger" swipe to. &nbsp;It is a workable solution, however I do not understand why full screen is not permitted.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Hi KyleEggemeyer,</p>
<p>Currently, Outlook 2016 for Mac cannot use full screen just like other Office 2016 for Mac applications.</p>
<p>I understand it would be nice if we have can use the feature in Outlook 2016 as well. Therefore, we recommend you submit feedback by clicking the smile icon on the right upper corner of the Outlook client. Many features have been designed or upgraded based
 on our customers’ constructive comments.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Aaron</p>

    <title>Windows 10 - IE 11 freezes often - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wvlucas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - IE 11 freezes often</h2>
                    <p>When I load the IE browser, I don't have any issues, but when I add additional tabs, the more tabs, the harder is it for the IE browser to keep from freezing. It seems as if there is a memory leak when more than 3 tabs are loading in the same browser session.
 Example: Lets say that I load one website page and from that page, there is a link that I want to load as an addition tab, then let's load another link by adding it to the tab string. So far, we have one browser loaded with 3 webpages running at the same time.
 All is well so far, but then if we add additional pages and line those pages by adding additional tabs, then this is where the problem begins to occur.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the tabs remain open, the longer the session for each tab to remain open, the likelihood of IE freezing when attempting to close the first too tabs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prerequisites:</p>
<p>Configure IE as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet Options</p>
<p>&gt;Tabbed Browsing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Always switch to new tabs when they are created</strong></li><li><strong>Show previews for individual tabs in the taskbar*</strong></li><li><strong>Enable Tab Group*</strong></li><li><strong>Open only the first home page when Internet Explorer starts</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>When a new tab is opened, open: </strong>"Your first home page"</p>
<p><strong>When a pop-up is encountered: </strong>"Let Internet Explorer decide how pop-ups should open"</p>
<p><strong>Open link from other programs in:</strong> "A new tab in the current window"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then <strong>reboot</strong> the system for the changes to take effect</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Steps to reproduce:</span></p>
<p>1) <strong>Launch</strong> IE</p>
<p>2) <strong>Navigate</strong> to any webpage that has hyperlinks to other websites</p>
<p>3) While allowing the first page to remain opened, <strong>click</strong> a link and then
<strong>allow</strong> the page to load (this will add another tab into the browser)</p>
<p>4) <strong>Repeat</strong> step 3 several times to load additional tabs in the same window</p>
<p>5) <strong>Allow</strong> the pages to remain open for a bit (I have experienced this even after 3 minutes), then one by one,
<strong>close</strong> the last opened tab (<em>usually&nbsp;the tab on the right is the latest</em>)&nbsp;and
<strong>repeat</strong> until IE freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Results: </span></p>
<p>When closing the tabs, it seems to be okay, but when it comes to the last two tabs to close, IE freezes with no error messages or alerts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">One step further: </span></p>
<p>Usually, when IE crashes, the next time&nbsp;IE is loaded, there is an pop-up option to select to recover the crashed sessions. In this case, that option pop-up did not occur. I was able to load IE again and repeat the same problem. Make note: If repeating the
 same steps as above, the same problem will occur on any IE browser session.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Probably cause: </span></p>
<p>It is my best guess there is a memory link that occurs while loading the additional pages adding tabs to the browser window.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else seeing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know MS wants to drive a wedge between Edge and IE and eventually MS will finally drop IE, but I would like to see IE work stable as it did in previous versions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p />

</p><blockquote>I have the exact same issues and they just started early November 2016.&nbsp; I have reset the internet settings several times.&nbsp; No help.&nbsp; I have Edge on another computer and it sucks.&nbsp; Maybe time to go to Chrome?
</blockquote>
<p>When I experience the IE freezing it is when I have Google Toolbar enabled. Once the toolbar is disabled, the problem no longer occurs. When I reported this issue to Microsoft and Google, neither were very interested in getting it fixed. If you know what
 the "Cold War" was about, then this is the same thing with Microsoft and Google. Both are competing and neither one is willing to give in to fix the issue. Google Toolbar has the most useful features that I have come to enjoy over the years. It is hard to
 give those features as a lost cause. It has been a few weeks since I have disabled Google Toolbar and have started to get use to not having those features at the tips of my fingers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish Microsoft and Google would pay attention to customer's needs. When&nbsp;companies become this big, they could care less, leaving you and I out of the limb.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to disable the Google Toolbar to see if IE crashes. If not, then you do have the same issue as I. If IE continues to crash, then there is another problem that would not be the same as mine.

            <p>I agree and this is the first real answer to this widespread and well known issue of IE11 freezing/crashing.&nbsp; I know this is not a computer specific issue with one of my computers as I have a laptop that I use frequently and a desktop that is used less frequently.&nbsp;
 The problem manifested itself on both computers around the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop, because of performance issues with Windows 10, was subjected to a complete and clean reload of W10 which resolved most issues except those associated with IE11 crashing/freezing upon closure of tabs or too many tabs open</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Up to the point of reading wvlucas's theory I was inclined to think that it was a W10/IE11 compatibility issue and that Microsoft was more than happy, if not driving people towards, issuing Edge by making them hate the IE11 experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too have the Google toolbar installed on both computers and love the search engine (never cared for Bing) and all the tools that the Google toolbar offers such as translation, maps, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Google and Microsoft, resolve this issue.</p>

<h2>            Email Line Spacing</h2>
                    It seems to be impossible to have anything other than single line spacing - I cannot find an option to change this. I notice other people's emails often have 1½ or double line spacing which looks so much better. Any ideas?

<h2>            WM6.5 Bluetooth Safety Issue</h2>
                    I need a registry setting to be able to make calls from a toyota bluetooth system using my HTC Touch Pro 2 (AT&amp;T Tilt).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>AT&amp;T suggested I contact HTC</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>HTC says its a limitation of WM6.5</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can receive calls via Hands Free when the phone is locked, I just can not make calls.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have the device using ActiveSync with the company Exchange server which pushes security to enforce the phone locked after x mins.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My old phone (AT&amp;T Tilt with WM6.1) did not have this problem with the same configuration.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone else have this issue or know a solution?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cheers</div>

<p>Well I finally resolved my problem by flashing my AT&amp;T Tilt 2 with a custom ROM (Energy.RHODIUM.21895.Sense2.5.Mar.17). &nbsp;My Prius &amp; Camry Hybrid can now make calls while my phone is locked.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            Viewing messages in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;All of a sudden, I can't read any messages in any folders of outlook/hotmail. The messages appear on the left of my screen, but the reading pane on the right is blank white space except for an ad in the upper right corner. When I click on an individual
 message, nothing happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am having this problem in both Chrome and Firefox using Windows 7. However, when I view mail on my Ipad, it works fine. Any ideas??</p>
<p>- Joe</p>

            There appears to be a problem with the web service. Was your account moved to the new design? If so, see if using this link helps.

<h2>            ScreEn Frozen Black &#63; Finally an Answer . Nokia Lumia 925</h2>
                    <p>I have found a solution to the screen freezing black, at first it it happened to my own Nokia Lumia 925 smartphone, I checked every web and looked through all the answers and couldn't find anything. Was finally thinking about shutting it off and getting
 my money back until I gave it one more try. If your phone is frozen black but still on, where you can see it still blinking on and off at times then follow these steps. Please check both steps.
<strong>Second Set of Steps is way faster and a lot more easier but could not work so check Second set of steps before checking first, it could save you a lot of time.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>First Set of Steps</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Make sure not to charge your phone, please try to turn up your volume if you can and remember to act like your phone is still on, turn up your volume then take a snapshot, the snapshot button for my phone is by holding the power and volume up button up
 at the same time, if you can hear a sound of a picture being taken then continue, if not then I'm unsure, you can keep trying I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Basically wait till your phone dies since its still on and remember not to charge it, it could take a while, it took 2 days when my phone was at 70% to die so be patient, you can try to use it to waste battery I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) When your phone has died and you will know when you can't hear anything and there's no lights turning on, no vibrating or anything, plug in your charger, it should then turn on as if it just started again and you will be able to use your phone again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Second Set of Steps </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1) After having the same issue again I decided to try something new, this time check to hear the screenshot button, then if you can, try to turn off your phone, by doing this hold the power button, for about 5 seconds, then slide your finger from the top
 of your phone down just like you would to power it off</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Then just like in the first set of steps plug in your charger after about a minute of letting your phone officially power down then plug in your charger and enjoy your phone.</p>

<p>That's an incredible discovery, here I am thinking I have several bricks and the darn things are actually working with no display output. When it took the screen snapshot and reconnected the phone it found 3 new pictures to sync!
</p>
<p>They&nbsp;were the default lock screen&nbsp; with the current time and date! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not resolved by step 2 but I'm going to try step 1.</p>
