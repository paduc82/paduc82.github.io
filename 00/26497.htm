<h2>            MyPhone.microsoft.com &#62; The Microsoft&#174; My Phone service is temporarily unavailable due to system maintenance.</h2>
                    
<p>I think the subject pretty much covers it.&nbsp; Whenever I try to go to the Myphone.microsoft.com using IE, I immediately get the error:&nbsp; "The Microsoft&lt;sup&gt;<span>®</span>&lt;/sup&gt; My Phone service is temporarily unavailable due to system
 maintenance."&nbsp; It's been several days and I've tried from a couple different computers.&nbsp; Interestingly enough I can get in using Firefox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running Win 7 Enterprise (x32 and x64) and IE8.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Not sure wht that is happening kcm49.&nbsp; I just tried going to the MyPhone site using IE on a Windows 7 machine and no issues at all.</p>
<p>See what happens if you delete the temporary files and cookies by going to Tools/Internet Options on IE</p>

<p>Thanks Jack.&nbsp; Clearing the cache and cookies, closing and opening IE again didn't remove the message (on both macheines and in IE 64 and 32 on the 64 bit machine).&nbsp; Hwever, what I didn't notice before was a "login" option in the top right corner.&nbsp; Logged
 in and sure enough I'm good.&nbsp; Then after a logout the home page comes up properly...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notebook View was a simplified version that had only features needed to record notes in a class or conference. It's missing all kinds of Word features, including Tables of Contents and Styles, which are necessary to makes TOCs work..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would create a new document in Print Layout view. Then copy everything in your old document except the very last carriage return on the last page. Paste it into the new document, then see if you can create a TOC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most Table of Contents depend on you using Styles to format your document. It sounds like this is a new concept to you. Here's a PDF on how to use styles in Word 2011:&nbsp;<a href="https://staff.brighton.ac.uk/is/Published%20Documents/Word%20Long%20Documents%20(Mac%202011).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Structuring

    <title>Students cannot edit OneNote within Teams - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jfallenccs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Students cannot edit OneNote within Teams</h2>
                    <p>As a teacher, I can access the toolbar to edit within the Class Notebook within Teams; however, the students cannot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an image of the teacher's Class Notebook in Teams. You can clearly see the toolbar with Home, Insert, Draw, and View. The teacher can edit the class notebook right within Teams.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/21ccf968-14d2-4054-84ed-10bb2e868d81?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/21ccf968-14d2-4054-84ed-10bb2e868d81?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look at the student's, they have none of those options. There is no toolbar. And yes the student was in a section they can edit because they were able to within the OneNote Windows 10 app and the online version - just not the one within Teams.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi jfallenCCS,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your screenshot I noticed that this student didn’t have tool bar in OneNote online, however, from the previous posts, issue only occurs in Class NoteBook in Teams, whether this issue (can’t edit in OneNote
 online) presents itself suddenly? As student can edit in OneNote desktop client, it should not be an account issue, use a different browser to give a try, like IE 11.0 inPrivate mode. Meanwhile clear browser cookies and caches, update Operation system and
 all device drivers. You may also let him reset browser settings (please note that reset browser settings will reset all settings to default, if you have any favorites, bookmarks…try to back up them first).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<h3> general1km  say:</h3>
<h2>            Granting access with OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>With OneDrive we can restrict access to a selected group of users, or a single user. After setting organization-wide sharing settings for SharePoint and OneDrive, we can further restrict the external sharing for a specific OneDrive user. This can be done
 via a OneDrive Settings interface or by using Microsoft PowerShell and running a cmdlet called Set-SPOSite with a sharing parameter called SharingCapability. A cmdlet is a .NET class that acts on specific objects within PowerShell, which uses a command-line
 interface (CLI). Does the PowerShell cmdlet allow restriction only at the end user level, or does it also permit restrictions at the&nbsp; sysadmin etc. level?</p>

                    <p>Hi, i hope somebody can help me. I have a MicrLumia640LT. I took some pictures and all should be stored on SD card and onedrive. Normally they do without problems, but the pictures I took on holiday in Barcelona is only in onedrive as WP_date and I cannot
 open them. After my trip all pictures work normally. If I go into my camera-roll on phone I have only grey squares and no pictures.</p>

 Did you use a specific camera app aside from the default one to take those photos? Some camera apps have their own storage where the pictures taken are saved. Also, do you remember if the phone's date and time are correctly set when you took those pictures?
 The photos in the Camera roll are organized per date and time; if a photo was taken while the phone's date is incorrect, that picture may not show up on the actual date you captured it in the camera roll folder. The changes in date and time might happen after
 rebooting the phone, changing the SIM / network, or going to a place in a different&nbsp;timezone. Best to try checking those photos using a PC. It may be a tedious job but worth trying. :)</span></span></span></p>

<p>Hello, Simon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a possibility that your SD card is corrupted. This may also be the reason why the images failed to be uploaded to
<strong>OneDrive</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Corrupted SD cards may cause photos or files not to be save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try to perform a Scan Disk maintenance on your SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps on how to perform the maintenance are listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn off your phone and remove the SD card. Use a SD card reader and plug it in to your computer.</li><li>Open Computer by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Computer.</li><li>Right-click the SD card drive that you want to check, and then click "Properties".</li><li>Click the "Tools" tab, and then, under Error-checking, click Check Now.</li><li>Put a check mark on the "Automatically fix the file system errors" and "Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors".
</li><li>Click Start.</li></ol>
<p>Performing the scan may take time depending on the number of damaged/corrupted sectors on the SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted.</p>

            <p>I was making a movie on my dad. I could convert the Music files using a converter and add to my movie. The problem is resolved. Thanks for your helping response. The musing is being played on the laptop itself.

<h2>            Countdown timer in Excel 2013</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to help a friend by creating a countdown timer to his wedding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have built something [screen shot attached], but it the "Now" function in cell B1 has to be manually refreshed. I'm trying to have it run continuously.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8da4419a-e213-4853-b0ef-e045e3c3e308" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer that it run even while the workbook is closed, but I'm fine with starting it anytime the workbook is opened and running for as long as the workbook remains open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a 1[novice] - 10[expert] scale regarding Excel and writing formulas/code, I'm probably about a 3 or maybe a 4 on a good day - LOL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any assistance you can provide.</p>

            <p>You need to probably write 2 macros - both of them will be self executing macros</p>
<p>One will be self executing when the workbook opens (to capture current date-time)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>the second self executing macro can be&nbsp; made to execute every x interval of time to fetch the current date-time.</p>

 questions about the problem cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I would like to undo the update to 2016. &nbsp;With the link you posted, because I have an Office 365 Account, I don't have a hardcopy of the previous version (Mac 2011?) to reinstall once 2016 is gone. &nbsp;I've been looking for directions on how to undo the
 update and go back to what I had before.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Have you tried to open another website using the phone browser? Also, what kind of connection are you using? If you are using data connection, try to use WiFi and do it vice versa. This is to validate if the issue is with the
 Ovi application, with the browser or with the internet connection.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem is with the Ovi application, try the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <strong>Restart the device</strong>. It's not necessary but it's recommended to also remove the back cover and the battery when restarting.</p>
<p>2. Once the phone is ready, try to <strong>open the Ovi application</strong>. If it's still not working,
<strong>open the browser and go to store.ovi.mobi</strong> to access the Ovi mobile site. If there is an update, try to install it.</p>
<p>3. If its still not working, <strong>try updating the phone's software using the Nokia Suite</strong>. To do this, connect your phone to the computer via USB cable &gt; Open the Nokia Suite &gt; go to Software (SW) Updates icon &gt; Install all updates available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it fails, try to do the soft reset the phone by going to <strong>Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Restore Factory Settings &gt; Settings only</strong>. This will reset the default settings of the phone but no personal files will be deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.&nbsp;:smileyhappy:</p>

            <p>The best way to to this on your phone is to use one of the free apps available in Marketplace like
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/apps/f395fc79-bf75-44f1-bd9c-d14ffcb0ec6a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Free Ringtones</a> or <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/apps/932f6079-15a5-4e57-afb2-bf7b517bcaaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Ringtone Maker</a>, which can search various sources for premade ringtones to download and use on your Windows phone.</p>
<p>Of course you can make your own from your MP3 collection but they need to meet certain criteria.</p>
<p>If you want to manually do it here are directions to do so:</p>
<p>Add or create ringtones</p>
<div>
<p>You can use your own ringtones so you can match your jingle to your mood, or match just the right tune to your contacts. Just make sure the audio file is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>&nbsp;In MP3 or WMA format.</div>
</li><li>
<div>&nbsp;Less than 40 seconds.</div>
</li><li>
<div>&nbsp;Less than 1 MB.</div>
</li><li>
<div>&nbsp;Not protected with digital rights management (DRM).</div>
</li></ul>
<p>To make any file that fits these criteria into a ringtone, all you have to do is assign it the genre of<span><span style="font-style: italic">ringtone</span></span>. If you have a PC, you'll use the Zune software. If you don't have the Zune software on your
 computer, see<span> </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp7/start/install-the-zune-software.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Install the Zune software</span></a>. On a Mac, use iTunes to assign the genre, and then sync the file using
 the Windows Phone Connector for Mac. To learn more, see<span> </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp7/music/sync-and-get-updates-with-my-mac.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Sync and get updates with my Mac</span></a>.</p>

<h2>            Vector graphics inserted in Word 2011 are rasterized if converted to PDF in Word 2010</h2>
                    <div>I hope this is the right place to ask this question as it touches upon the Mac version of Word, but also on the Windows version as well as Mac and Windows versions of Acrobat X.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I inserted vector .ai (Adobe Illustrator) and vector .pdf images in a .docx on my Mac (Word 2011) without any problems. But now I need to convert the document to a .pdf file with working links (long hyperlinks, table of contents, table of figures, cross-referencing
 inside the document), which is only possible with the Windows-version of Acrobat X (right?). So I'm doing that (Word 2010, all links work fine), but the vector images are rasterized in the final PDF. This is funny behaviour, as the images remain vector-based
 within Word 2010 - only converting them to PDF rasterizes them.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any idea how I can keep the images vector based in the resulting PDF?</div>
                </div>

            Thanks for the suggestions. Next time I'll try .EPS. And the RGB tip is probably more important than I would have thought (after reading through a few forums).
<div><br />
<div>Funny enough, some graphics did make it through to PDF as vectors, some didn't. I must have created them differently somehow (all stem from Illustrator though). But even the ones that made it through seem to have been "revectored", if that makes sense.
 They have slightly different outlines.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I ended up getting a trial of Pitstop Pro and replaced the vector based images in the final PDF. Works like a charm. I didn't know such powerful plugins for Acrobat existed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So for now I have the problem solved. But I would still be curious about how to further optimize the vector workflow from MacWord to WinWord.</div>

            <p>That's not a bug, it's a feature :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The line indicates a recent change or addition from "outside" (e.g. a different user or device, your iPhone in this case), the "j" stands for the author who did the change. I assume as your nick here is Chippy_j you would have the "j" somewhere in your MS
 account name too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>iOS versions do not have that display yet but mac and windows versions do. you can hide the line and "j" in the "View" menu of the mac version. I guess the button is labeled something like "Hide Authors" (I am using german version of OneNote).</p>

            I think my problem might have something to do with Microsoft outlook taking over hotmail because I've spoke to a few other hotmail email users who have had the problems come out of the blue when they haven't changed the password, it is a real pain and
 inconvenience they really need to get this sorted.

            Hi Yashwant
<br />
<br />Do you mean Office came pre-installed on your PC when you purchased that, if so, did you pay for Office as part of the initial purchase?
<br />
<br />Office when pre-installed on PC's, if not paid for as part of that deal are generally trial versions of Office - how long has Office 2016 been working on your PC?
<br />
<br />If you did in fact purchase Office 2016, was that linked to your Email or Microsoft Account?
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in
<br />
<br />On that page, under Your Info, in the licences section, do you see your Office 2016 Licence listed there?

            Hi Yashwant
<br />
<br />New laptops will come preinstalled with a 30 day Office 365 trial. These trials usually do not require a product key, but purchase of a 1 month or 1 year subscription after it expires.
<br />
<br />If you have a valid license for Microsoft Office that you already bought, remove the trial then install your personal copy. 
<br />
<br />Use the fix it tool to completely uninstall Office:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 1 - Sign in to download Office
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign in with the account you associated with this version of Office. This account can be a Microsoft account, or work or school account.
<br />
<br />Forgot your account details? See I forgot the account I use with Office.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forgot-the-account-i-use-with-office-eba0b4a2-c0ae-472c-99f6-bc63ee2425a8?wt.mc_id=scl_installoffice_home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forg...</a>
<br />
<br />On the Office home page, do the following depending on your version of Office.
<br />
<br />If you signed in with a Microsoft account, from the Office home page select Install Office &gt; Install. (Office 365 subscribers should select Install again).
<br />
<br />This begins the download of Office. Follow the prompts on your screen to complete the install.

            As far as a I know there is no single cross reference for both. You have to insert 2 cross reference links. One to the number the other to the text.  
<br />
<br />Yes, it is counter intuitive.

            Hi Roguesunsetz,
Did you tried to install Office 64bit? If so the issue still?

Try to uninstall Office and remove all the regisrty using the fix it from here https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US 

Then install office 64 bit

Also run this command in CMD sfc /scannow

Good luck

            Office 64 bit will give problem if you work with macros 3rd part app, but if you dont will be ok, if you still have installed Office 32 bit, try do repair online from Control Panel --&gt;select Office then click on change then repair once the wizard for repair prompt select repair online

            1. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Outlook in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Outlook normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Outlook again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.

To start Outlook in Safe Mode -

Hold CTRL key and click on Outlook icon, keep holding it till Outlook starts

2. Disable Anti virus and update your Office

https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5

3. This may be due to corrupt Outlook profile. In this case, create a new profile

            <p>Not if you buy an installed version of Office. I suspect you are thinking of one of the "Cloud" versions of office such as "Office 365".&nbsp; You do not atually "buy" cloud versions, you just rent it.&nbsp; You have the option of "renting" it by the month or by the
 year. </p>
<p>Here is some general information about buying Office:</p>

    <title>Scroll Bar in worksheet background colour - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jane hollin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scroll Bar in worksheet background colour</h2>
                    I have added a scroll bar to a worksheet.<br />
<br />
I can't find the option to colour the background/borders/etc.<br />
<br />
It must be possible ???<br />
<br />
Can anyone point me in the right direction.<br />
<br />
Let's say I wanted the background colour to be Red<br />
and the border to be Blue<br />
How would I do this (I don't mind VBA if that what's needed)<br />
<br />
Thank you

<h2>            Outlook 2016 mac - accessing online archive slow</h2>
                    
<p>In Outlook 2016 for Mac (now on v15.15) it takes a long time to open the online archive folder (+- 3 minutes) on the first time</p>
<p>navigating in the folder tree is also slow</p>

<p>anyone an idea ?</p>

<p>Hi PPT001,</p>
<p>It is an expected behavior that &nbsp;accessing &nbsp;the archive folder takes &nbsp;some time. Because Archive mailbox cannot be cached in the Outlook client, all the data in Archive mailbox is stored in the Office 365 online server.
</p>
<p>If you see any other symptoms or error messages when accessing Archive mailbox, please let us know so that we can check if any issue &nbsp;occurs.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

            Yes you do need a Mic. to talk to Cortana. Without any details how can we tell if your desktop has a microphone. Some info such as make/model of the desktop also the monitor would help as many monitors do have Mic's.

<h2>            Permissions inheritance for PWA and Project Sites</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In our on-premises installation (Project Server 2010) we&nbsp;were able&nbsp;to sync the resources in a project plan with the related project site.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm setting up&nbsp;a new configuration in Project Online. For now I've decided to use the SharePoint security mode because it is much easier to maintain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like in SharePoint security mode it is not possible anymore to synchronize the resources from a project plan with the connected SharePoint project site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this be confirmed?</p>
<p>Is there a best-practice available how to maintain the site permissions when using SharePoint security mode?</p>
<p>Needs this be done manually by the PM for example?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your support</p>
<p>Ron</p>

<p>There has no functionality like Synchronize in in Project Online, the permissions can only manually assign to the project site.
