<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Screen flickering</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, adding to the pile of post about Screen Flickering in Surface pro 4 devices... this is yet another one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine started just 2 days ago, while i left a CPU intensive app and i forgot i had the device on. So it ran for about 2 hours. Power plugged in. THta night, the issue first happened. I had a game running the in the background, the fans were fully kicking
 in, i was alt tabbed out to Edge. Screen goes blurry, i move mouse and it fixes. Happen during the whole session. Game was new so i unsintalled the game thinking the problem would go away. It also happend when in the game fullscreen, although that game has
 no active/moving elements on its menu screen. Next day, with the Surface *cold* the problem appears again. I shut down, then Boot to uefi. Screen flickering once more. Restart again, issue is gone ALL day until i log of the machine for some hours. Boot it
 back up, problem is there again. Barely but it is. Shut down, and today i turn it ON and exact same thing. It even did the screen flicker while on the surface logo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it is nailed down to either a firmware or a hardware issue. The low amount of people affected (sounds like a lot of people here in the forums, but in production terms we might be a few only) makes it more likely to be hardware related.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Talked off on the phone with a rep, he told me the equipment needed replacement. I dont live in the US, so yeah.... bummer. If you can pick up my Xbox you should be able to pick this thing in Mexico too, but well, this just wont work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Problem has just started, and it is as i described. Tried everything BUT restoring the device. I have too much work in here to lose it all like that. I am already backing up the data as i may have a chance to use a friends US address to perform the repair
 order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>creators update?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happening in UEFI/SURFACE black screen?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried repair tool?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes. Still there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another user acct. tried?</p>
<p>Yes. Problem persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Problem, for now, goes away if I:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Move mouse</p>
<p>Use touchpad</p>
<p>Type</p>
<p>Playing back a video even if it is not the active window/tab</p>
<p>touch the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing brightness/resolution/screen settings problem persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressure here needs to be applied for replacements to be available even internationally!!!</p>
<p>How come you can pick up a bloody Xbox and not a surface? Sony pick up their stuff, ALL their products, internationally.</p>
<p>Equipment was flawless for 6 months... and it is not cheap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>TL,DR</strong></p>
<p><strong>Screen flickers as other posts referred. happens on UEFI and on cold boots. goes away after some use. Rep on phone said to replace it, but it needs to be sent to the US&nbsp; for pick up. i do hope it is a bloody firmware issue, but this seems hardware
 related.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Can someone please help out customer not in the US?</span> Please? The flicikering just got so bad it will not stop unless a video is playing, or gaming. Moving the mouse wont stop the flicker now. This is
 my working computer! (sadface)&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You wont believe this. So its is pretty hot in here. About 35-40 degrees on average this season of the year. During the day, at home, i rarely turn on the AC, and my room is well insulated so inside i get 25-30 degrees. I just turned my AC on, and well,
 i have it on 17C so i can sleep, and i **** you not, 10 minutes after turning on my AC this thing started flickering INMEDIATLY. Same behaivior as alway. Does the computer do something below ceertain temp treshold? my fans had been off quite a while, though
 i have not been monitoring temperatures on this thing. Can this be indeed temp related? And why with cold of all things? Maybe it got too hot at some point and now cold makes it loose?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as this is happening, i just noticed i thought it was the complete screen. I just noticed, that the top of it, the top 1/8 or 1/6 of it is fine. The rest of the screen flickers madly though.&nbsp;</p>

            Well, this a bit of a strange thing. The only thing i hadn't tried on my surface to remove the flicker was either to create a new user, or to reset the device clean. I was about to send my device back for a replacement, with very bad flickering, So i backep
 up my stuff and rest the thing. I rebooted it and made a new account. Not&nbsp; a single screen flicker so far. It even has the old drivers for the video adapter instead of the new ones i installed. Any feedback MS?&nbsp;

            Scratch that, this morning it is flickering madly. MS is giving no guarantee that the new device will NOT have the same failure, which is absolutely maddening. Do yourself a favor and never buy MS again. Great OS, not so great hardware. And I am still
 waiting for a comment on this MS. TBH my original device had the infamous lightbleed. I did not care as i dont read on black PDF´s but really, noticeable and mean.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Amulfo!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On this regard, I sent my equipment to be replaced by you in the US, costing me almost 200$ US dollars. So yeah, not FIxed! ALSO, in a sister thread on this very forum, people have reported the issue persists even after the update has been rolled out.</p>

<p>I have the same problem but im not sure it started with an update. It does start and stops randomly and no software solution provided by MS support or the Software repair tool solved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your screen flickers doing boot ( surface logo ) it does not make sense for it to be a software issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read hundreds of threads of people having the same issue and not one that have solved it via software, and still MS is no where to be found. Most people are having this issue after warranty has expired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would be my 3rd Surface and im must say im disappointed!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Apple MacBook Pro Retina from 2013 and 2 months ago Apple changed my screen for free since it had a defect on antiglare coating, how about that!!! Almost 4 years after purchase.</p>

<p>Hi Arnulfo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using Feedback hub but I couldn't use Start Capture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something went wrong<br />
We couldn't start the capture. Please select Start capture to try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, after around 3 hours of use, the display of my Surface Pro 4 begins to shake, but when I move the mouse, it stops shaking. If I stop moving the mouse, it shakes again. Leaving a text cursor blinking also stops the screen from shaking. But after a
 few more hours of use, the mouse moving and text cursor blinking trick will not work anymore. I will need to turn off the display for an hour to be able to use it again without the screen shaking immediately. This disrupts my work. I have no choice but to
 take a break because of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have my Surface Pro 2, I never had this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plan to buy the latest Surface if this issue gets resolved soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

    <title>Volume Control Missing and Greyed out in Taskbar Properties - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Volume Control Missing and Greyed out in Taskbar Properties</h2>
                    Up until recently (past two months) this was never an issue.&nbsp; When I purchased this computer almost two years ago I set up my taskbar which included my volume control.&nbsp; It's been there ever since.&nbsp; I have Vista, Service Pack 2.<br />
<br />
I haven't changed hardware.&nbsp; But during the last two months my volume control dissappers from the taskbar every once in awhile and when I go into taskbar properties the volume control is greyed out.&nbsp; This is VERY frustrating since I can't find any other way
 to bring up the volume control.&nbsp; Luckily I do have a volume control key on my keyboard and use it when necessary.<br />
<br />
I've done a search regarding this problem and see that many, many people are having the same issue.&nbsp; WHY??&nbsp; If this is occurring due to Windows updates why hasn't this problem been taken care of.&nbsp; Some of the complaints that I saw in my search were two years
 old.<br />
<br />
Frustrated.&nbsp; Please make it stop.<br />
<br />

<p>
You did NOT answer the question.&nbsp; The question is: Where in windows7 can we find the friendly and useful functionality that was available in the WindowsXP program "Microsoft Scanner and Camera Wizard"?&nbsp; That WindowsXP program was a friendly program for selectively
 importing groups of pictures and scans.&nbsp; Instead of answering the question you referred us to a device driver installation wizard and that answer is irrelevant, incompetent, unfriendly, and wrong!<br /></p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have seen this works differently in Windows 7. You need to set this up using the
<strong>AutoPlay </strong>component.</p>
<p>

            Hello. I'm Rey, a Community Expert willing to help the users.
<br />
<br />Do you have a Skype number? Because to make Skype calls all you need is Skype credit but to receive calls from cellphones or landlines you will need a Skype number.
<br />
<br />Best Regards

<h2>            Update has bricked my console</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've had my XB1 since day one and Its been fine, When the warranty ran out I didn't like the way it looked (the top was scratched to hell) so i customised it (see pic below) *its been working perfectly for a year so my problem has absolutely nothing to do
 with the custom work ive done on this.</p>
<p>[View:http://tinypic.com/r/348hd95.jpg:550:0]</p>
<p>http://tinypic.com/r/348hd95/9</p>
<p>Now, I'm part of the preview program on my xbox and i received a standard small update yesterday morning and its completely
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> my xbox. (E100 0000070D 8B050001) To replace it they want £80 or so plus they want me to send me the broken Xbox back (they will not accept it due to the custom job) I cannot afford to buy a brand new Xbox so I must try and fix
 it myself somehow.</p>
<p>I've tried the Offline diagnostic tool, it gets to 5% when updating and the console restarts. What else can i do?</p>
<p><strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> how one small update like that can destroy the whole thing.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>If you believe the preview update has 'bricked' your console then the preview programs TOC state that they'll replace / repair the console if the program seemed to break it.</p>
<p>It still follows under the preview program so i recommend you still post there.
</p>
<p>What you can do is hard reset the console follow my steps. Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds until power off unplug the console from receiving power for 5 minutes and wait once done plug the console in and boot it up.</p>

            I am also having the problem with no attachments received on the Win10 email app. This happens across multiple email accounts, such as&nbsp;outlook.com, gmail.com, Comcast.net. Attachments are received on those accounts using Windows Live Mail so the issue
 seems ot be related to the Win10 email app.&nbsp;Why are there no email attachments?

            <p>I was unable to attach a document in gmail after downloading Windows10. When I clicked Attach, only items on the Desktop were available. Per advice from another site, I did the following:</p>
<p>1. Open Control Panel</p>
<p>2. Go to File Explorer Options</p>
<p>3. Go to Change search options for files &amp; folders. </p>
<p>4. Under View, Click on Reset Folders. </p>
<p>5. Under that, check Show Hidden Files, Folders &amp; Drives (default was to hide them)</p>
<p>Now when I click on the Attach icon, I still get Desktop, but I also have access to This PC, and under that, all the files, including Documents, that previously were immediately available in Windows 7. Why the default would be to hide files and folders is
 hard to imagine.</p>

<h2>            NETFLIX&#58; Maturity Level Exceeded - Our apologies - Your account owner has specified that you can&#39;t view movies with an MPAA rating higher than All Movies</h2>
                    
<p>In Windows 7 Media Center, when trying to watch a Netflix streaming show with a rating of TV-14, I receive the follow message no matter what Maturity Level my account is set at.</p>
Maturity level exceededOur apologies - Your account owner has specified that you can't view movieswith an MPAA rating higher than All Movies
<p>I have two issues with this message:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Maturity Level of "All Movies" should allow me to watch anything.</li><li>Even if I change my Maturity Level on Netflix that message doesn't change and I still can't watch TV-14 rated shows.</li></ul>
<p>Watching Netflix in a browser works fine. Watching Netflix on my Wii works fine. It's only in Windows 7 Media Center that I have this issue.</p>
<p>Please Help!</p>

            There is only one version of the Upgrade Advisor.<br />
<br />
The Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor requires you to have XP SP2 or newer, if you don't have XP SP2 or SP3 it won't run,<br />
<br />
If you can't get it to run you could call Acer and ask if they have support your your computer with Windows 7.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Can My Computer Run Windows 7?</strong>
</span><br />
The basic system requirements are listed below.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/system-requirements.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Some features have additional requirements.</a> <br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Custom Clean Install Steps</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Times to use:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span style="font-weight: bold">Moving from XP to 7,
</span>or unsupported in place upgrade paths (ex: Vista Home to 7 Pro) </span></p>
<p>
<span>Moving from a 32 bit Windows system to a 64 bit system, or changing languages

<span>Don't want to do an in place upgrade, or you want a fresh/clean install
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>You can use an Upgrade or Full Windows 7 disk to do a custom clean install. This will remove all your programs, but you can save your files and settings to external storage before doing so.
 You will have to reinstall all your programs after installing Windows 7. Here are the steps:
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you can install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.
</span></p>
<p>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</span></a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>2. Backup all your files and settings to avoid losing docs, photos, and other information. Windows Easy Transfer is a free tool to copy files (not programs) from your PC, and then transfer
 them back after you install Windows 7. If you don't want to use Windows Easy Transfer, you can copy your files to a USB drive, or CD/DVD. Note: Easy Transfer will not work when changing languages, or when going from 64 bit to 32 bit (it will work going from
 32 bit to 64 bit).</span></p>
<p>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer</span></a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>3. Locate the installation disks and any associated product/license keys for all your programs because you'll need to manually reinstall all programs. If you downloaded some programs from the Internet you can redownload them.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>4. Put the Windows 7 disk into your DVD drive. A window should pop up starting the install process, when asked the type of installation do you want click Custom (advanced). Note: 32 to 64 bit requires you to restart and boot from
 the DVD. </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>5. After Windows 7 is installed you can use Windows Easy Transfer (or another backup method you used) to restore your files &amp; settings, and use your installation disks to reinstall all your programs. Then you're done - enjoy Windows
 7. </span></p>

<h2>            Search index won&#39;t turn on even after pc reset</h2>
                    <p>I reset my pc to fix a problem with c drive permissions but when I got my windows 10 all nice and fresh, the top of the windows search said that the search index was turned off. Okay weird, I'll just turn it back on. When I went to turn it back on, I got
 an error 15: the system cannot find the drive specified. When I tried to start it from Windows services properties of Windows search I get the error: the windows search service on local computer started and then stopped. Some services stop automatically if
 they are not in use by other services or programs. I couldn't find any solutions online and it seemed to be targeting the C drive so the error made no sense, though I'm not sure so if someone could tell me how to check which drive the indexer is targeting,
 please let me know. Well, a system reset should fix everything, so I did that. But it didn't fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I do?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            with upgrade to 8.1 mousepad has ceased to two finger scroll</h2>
                    I'm using an Asus S400CA laptop, when i first purchased it, it was running Windows 8 and the mousepad was running fine, I could use two fingers to scroll (up down left right) and I could zoom in and out. I was prompted by Microsoft to upgrade to 8.1 and
 now my mousepad does not respond to any two finger scrolling attempts. I have read other answers that suggest searching 'trackpad' and then using the settings prompt to adjust for this problem, however when I search 'trackpad' I am given the results 'mouse
 and touchpad' instead and when I enter the setting it is allowing me to control 'rolling the mouse wheel to scroll'. Fairly annoying since there is no mouse and therefore no mouse wheel. This is a brand new laptop and I was eager to try out the new Windows
 software - now I'm concerned I should have stuck with the 8 rather than the recommended upgrade as not having a two finger scroll option is really **** me off. (Also the Asus support website is completely useless for helping to solve

            If you go to the Asus website and search "Smart Gesture," there is an updated driver that works with Windows 8.1. Just search, click, select your operating system, then download. Uninstall the previous version in your control panel and search "smartgesture"
 once your computer restarts. Then run the setup if needed and then the installer. No firewall stuff if you're using a K55VD notebook. Once you restart your PC again, it will work!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Control Panel&nbsp;- Mouse - look for TouchPad Settings.<br />
<br />
Some TouchPads have HotKeys and other methods to disable them so you need to check with System Maker, their<br />
forums if any, and on-line documentation.<br />
<br />
Check Notification Area / Systray - lower right of screen near clock to see if there are any TouchPad control programs<br />
running.<br />
<br />
You can also try this :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Mice and Pointing Devices - Double Click on Touch Pad - Driver's Tab -<br />
Click Update Driver (this is may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers), now RIGHT CLICK<br />
on TouchPad and UNINSTALL.<br />
<br />
Then go to USB Controllers and UNINSTALL EVERYTHING except the category itself (all in it). REBOOT<br />
<br />
This will refresh the TouchPad Driver and the USB Stack.<br />
<br />
Here is the similar procedure in XP, Vista's is the same except we need to clear the specific device if present.<br />
Windows 7 works the same.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575</span></a><br />
<br />
Then go to System maker's site&nbsp;and get the latest touchpad drivers for your Windows version.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

Rob - Bicycle - Mark Twain said it right.

    <title>Canon MP280 Inkjet will not print, but will scan. Possibly caused by - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roversrob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canon MP280 Inkjet will not print, but will scan. Possibly caused by Avast</h2>
                    A few days ago I changed the ink in my Canon printer. When I went to print out a document, all of a sudden my Avast Anti Virus started sounding "threat detected - dont worry, we have fixed it". I saw in the Avast popup box that it was related to my printer,
 but before I had time to think about clicking on it to see what the problem was, it had disappeared again.<br />
<br />
Immediately after this, trying to print just resulted in almost nothing happening. The print dialogue box that usually pops up (to show ink levels and documents in print que etc) does pop up, but for literally a mili second and then its gone again. Nothing
 appears in my print que. I cannot print web pages, documents, pictures - anything.<br />
<br />
I guessed it was to do with avast, but I could not find anything at all in avast related to my printer. I tried disabling Avast and all firewalls, but still nothing. I un-installed Avast, still nothing. I reinstalled my printer, still nothing. Tried all the
 usual printer troubleshooting and diagnostic/repairs, but no problems are ever found. Scanning still works fine.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what I can do? I hope so, its driving me crazy! :(

            <p>Hello Rovers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<ol>
<li>What were the troubleshooting steps that you tried, when you&nbsp;mention "usual printer troubleshooting and diagnostic/repairs"?</li><li>Do you get any error message? If yes, what is the complete and exact error message that you get?</li></ol>
<p>The issue may occur if the printer driver has got corrupted or unstable after&nbsp;the security scan. So, I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Refer to the following link to diagnose and fix printer problems:</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/printing_problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Diagnose and Printer and printing problems</a></span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>Also, I would suggest you to try running the inbuilt Printer troubleshooter.</p>
<p><span><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open the Printer troubleshooter</a></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, proceed to Method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try to re-install the printer drivers from the following link.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/printers_multifunction/pixma_mp_series/pixma_mp280#DriversAndSoftware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PIXMA MP280: Drivers &amp; Software</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Select the correct operating <span>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>system architecture</span></a></span> and install the full feature software package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try communicating with the printer after installing the driver.</p>
<p>Also check: <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-and-install-printer-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Find and install printer drivers in Windows&nbsp;7</a></strong></p>

            Hi  Aniket, this is happening much too often at the moment, you are logged into a temporary account . . . 
<br />
<br />Restart your PC 3 or 4 times, this will fix this issue a lot of the time . .. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise: 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see two user folders that look like yours?
<br />Open those folders and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />If you still have not found your files, look for a Windows.old folder on your C Drive, expand that to open the users folder contained inside - check there for your files, icons . . .etc. 
<br />
<br />If you do find your files . . . etc. there, copy them out as soon as possible as Windows will remove the Windows.old folder in time
<br />
<br />NOTE VERY IMPORTANT: Do Not copy your files into the Temporary profile you are currently in, when the situation is corrected, your files will be deleted with the Temporary Profile and will not be recoverable !!

            Sounds like you have logged into a temporary profile. Try restarting your computer a few times. Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />At the sign in screen, click the power button, then click Restart. Do this a few times then try signing again. If the desktop still does not show up, then you will need to  create a new local user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Shift + Esc
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Enter a user name
<br />Password, confirm it, create a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Finish
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files 
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account.

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You mean reinstall the OS completely? If you have the Windows 7 DVD's you can do this however<br />
be sure to totally backup your data off the drive and you will need to reinstall your programs. If you<br />
do not have Windows 7 Disks you can buy them from your system maker cheap. If you do not care<br />
about existing programs&nbsp;then you can do a complete fresh install - just select the format options<br />
which wipes the entire disk (this erases all data as well).</p>
<p>Some System makers use Recovery Partitions as well as other methods to allow you to revert<br />
back to a completely fresh installation. So check with your System maker to see what options<br />
you have to do that - and it certainly can be done - just a matter of knowing the processes the<br />
System maker put in place for you.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Open the Manage Wireless Connection.</p>
<p>If there is entries there that are not really needed delete them,</p>
<p>If an Entry for your network is there and it is not at the top move it to the top.</p>
<p>If there is No entry for your Wireless Connection add one and put it on the top.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>OK let try next step.</p>
<p>Log to the Computer's Support site and download the latest Win 7 drivers for your Wireless card.</p>
<p>Read the instructions, and be ready with the Drivers.</p>
<p>Log to the computer's Device Manager Uninstall the Wirelles card entry. Reboot and install the new drivers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wireless Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility the utility is Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility.</p>
<p>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</p>
<p>If everything above is OK and it is not connecting to the Wireless router. Log from any computer that is, or can be connected to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, and try to connect with No Wireless security.</p>
<p>When working turn On the Wireless security.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help, but I just figured out I had mis-stated the problem.&nbsp; I DO have access to my local network, it is specifically INTERNET ACCESS that I do not have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click on the wireless&nbsp;'Internet Access' icon in the status area of my monitor (bottom rt of monitor), I see two available INTERNET CONNECTIONS for me to select from (my working connection 'CELL-WLL' and the phantom 'other network' that I cannot find
 anywhere else in the Network And Sharing Center).&nbsp; Each time my PC wakes up or is turned on, I just have to click on this 'Internet Access' icon to start it working again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I get this 'other network' to show up ubder the Network and Sharing Center so I can tell Windows 7 that it is not the primary connection?</p>

<h2>            Zoo Tycoon 2 not working&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    When I put my Zoo Tycoon 2 disk in, it comes up as "CD-ROM" and not as "Zoo Tycoon 2", and I'm not able to play the game. I also don't have an optical drive on my main computer that I want to play it on, is there a way to play it without the disk?

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your requirement in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Did you check the disk on some other PC?</span></p>
<p><span>Is it working fine before?</span></p>
<p><span>Is your disk drive able to run other Compact disks?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you say yes for the last question, then there might be some problem with the Zoo Tycoon 2 disc. Suggest you to&nbsp;check the disk on some other PC to ensure that there is no problem with the
 disc. If it's working fine on another PC, then you can transfer games files to your PC using external Storage device (I.e. USB flash drive) and use them to play.</span></p>

            No it doesn't work with other PCs. The problem with using the USB is it says I need the disk to play, and the disc doesn't work. I either have to re-buy the game for a new disc, but like I said my main computer doesn't even have an optical drive so that's
 a bit of a waste as well. Any way around it? Could you link me to the game support team?

<h2>            File Explorer hangs for 2  minutes or longer only on certain files</h2>
                    I have several files I access daily stored under "documents" tab, all of them work fine but one. It hangs for about 2 minutes every time I tried to search from the search box Same subfolder/file every time. I have deleted this subfolder/file, and re-created
 it, and reloaded some 2,000+ pdf files, it still hangs on the newly created file. It is not by any stretch the largest or most used of the subfolder/files, one has close to 20,000 pdf files, and is used daily, and never hangs

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to follow these Methods: 
<br />
<br />Method 1: Run the SFC.
<br />
<br />Follow the below steps:
<br />
<br />	1. Open Command Prompt.
<br />	2. Select “Run as Administrator”.
<br />	3. Type “sfc /scannow” without quotes and hit Enter.
<br />Now check for the issue.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Run the DISM Tool.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, I would have you run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.
<br />
<br />	1. Click on 'Start'.
<br />	2. Enter 'Command prompt' in the Search box.  
<br />	3. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command prompt, and then tap or click 'Run as administrator'. 
<br />	4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.
<br />
<br />Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it.
<br />
<br />Method 3:
<br />
<br />Type the following in a Windows PowerShell as Administrator:
<br />
<br />1.Launch PowerShell 
<br />2.Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3.Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />
<br />Restart your device.
<br />
<br />Hope the information provided is useful. If the issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you.
<br />
<br />Angel.

            Hello Bob,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try resetting File Explorer (explorer.exe) process:
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows Key + R and type SYSDM.CPL in Run. Click OK or press Enter key.
<br />
<br />2. In System Properties window, switch to Advanced tab, click Settings under Performance.
<br />
<br />3. Next, in Performance Options, under Processor scheduling, make sure that Adjust for best performance of: is set to Programs.
<br />
<br />4. Then in the same window, under Virtual memory, click Settings button.
<br />
<br />5. On Virtual Memory page, make sure Automatically manage paging file sizes for all drives option is checked. Click OK, then Apply, OK on rest of windows.
<br />
<br />6. Reboot the machine and see if issue is resolved now.
<br />

            Hi BobMyers1, 
<br />
<br />This issue might occur due to some corrupted system files or damaged operating system files. We suggest that you try performing a repair upgrade by following Andre Da Costa's instructions in his article to resolve the issue.

            actually i was not correct, making the changes and running the scans advised here did do something. Now all my thumbnail pictures/icons are gone in ALL of my explorer files.

                    HI <br />
Also ich hab folgendes Problem : <br />
Ich hab grade versucht mein Handy per USB an meinen Rechner anzuschließen aber der Pc sagt mir, dass das ein "unknown Device" ist.
<br />
Es ist aber so, dass das Anschließen vorher problemlos geklappt hat und plötzlich nicht mehr funktionierte.
<br />
<br />
Mein Rechner hat mir geraten ,dass ich, wenn das anschließen nicht mehr geht , soll ich das Gerät ersetzen ,aber an meinem Handy (HTC one x) kann es eigentlich nicht liegen weil das erst drei Monate alt ist oder so .
<br />
<br />
Bitte helft mir :)<br />
<br />
Ganz liebe grüße und danke im Vorraus :)<br />
