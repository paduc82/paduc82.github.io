    <title>Issues Installing Microsoft Casual Games from Windows Store - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issues Installing Microsoft Casual Games from Windows Store</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a new HP laptop and have been encountering problems trying to install some Microsoft Casual Games, such as Microsoft Mahjong.&nbsp; When I click to install, an error message appears while the installation is trying to acquire the license.&nbsp;
 The message appears below.&nbsp; I contacted Microsoft Support via Twitter and tried a few tasks that did not fix the problem.&nbsp; I performed an App Troubleshooter that did not find any problems, reset Windows Store and performed some commands without success.&nbsp; I
 even performed a Windows Reset that did not fix the problem.&nbsp; Other apps are installing without any problems. The error message number is Code: 0x803F8001.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; I would hate to have to perform a full HP Recovery for this problem
 since it appears it is on either XBOX or Microsoft platforms.&nbsp; In XBox, the games appear, but the play option is not present.&nbsp; Thanks, Pat</p>

<p>Hi Jennifer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for responding to me.&nbsp; I tried implementing the commands you provided without success.&nbsp; Ironically, I also received today another laptop that was repaired today This laptop had the Micrsoft Casual Games installed.&nbsp; Though, when I tried to
 open an app, it closed immediately.&nbsp; I tried a few similar Micrsoft Casual Games apps and the same problem occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lastly, before responding to a Microsoft Contact via form, I opened an older laptop (with a broken case).&nbsp; The games opened fine without any difficulty.&nbsp; The only difference is this laptop does not have the latest Windows Update 11/18.&nbsp; Hopefully,
 Microsoft will look into the latest update and send out a repair update download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Fonts pre installed in Windows for commercial purpose</h2>
                    <p>Hi!&nbsp;<br />
Is there any Microsoft agent or moderator that can answer to my question?</p>
<p>Are we allowed to write, print and SELL online a printed paperback book using the fonts pre installed in windows 10, without having office or word license? Are we allowed to use them in commercial purpose in book paperback printed sales?</p>
<p>There is not EULA inside fonts folder to find out our rights and obbligations</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>thanks for the answer. by the way the link that you provided me, it is the same that I have been reading during days.&nbsp;<br />
Inside Microsoft say to check the fonts Eula for more details regarding our rights and obbligations, saddenly that Eula DOES NOT exist in our fonts folder, so as end users we are not able to know how to behave legally.</p>

<h2>            Slow connection over wi-fi</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hey, I hope someone will be able to help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">My wi-fi connection started being extremely slow. I have a 20Mbit/s connection, although speed test says my download is only 5-6Mbit/s over wi-fi.
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I tried checking the download speed with cable and it was around 19Mbit/s, which is okay. I have also tried checking the wi-fi speed with other devices and it was around 18Mbit/s. So it has a to be a problem with my network adapter.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">&nbsp;<br />
I have tried:<br />
running diagnostics<br />
netsh reseting (ipv 4 and 6)<br />
uninstalling network adapter<br />
running sfc /scannow<br />
updating my router firmware<br />
changing settings in&nbsp;<span>inetcpl.cpl</span><br />
checking if there are any processes that would slow down my network, but found nothing&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">and none of these steps worked. However, checking the events for my network adapater, I've found that there was an 441 error - device could not be migrated. Also, I have noticed that there were 8 new devices (all of them Wan Miniport),
 so I uninstalled them and restarted, also no luck. What is it and why did it suddenly appear in device manager? Could that be the problem? This started happening only a few days ago, no other changes that would possibly cause that.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I'm kinda desperate because I seriously don't know what caused that, it's been working fine for years and I have no idea what to do next.
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I'm using a Broadcom 801.11n network adapter.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">What else should I try?<br />
Are there any background processes that might be causing this?<br />
Is there anything that is worth trying?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">

<p>Hi Veronika,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a lot of factors that would affect wireless connection. Based on your description of the issue though, it seems that the wireless network adapter is the culprit here. You did mention uninstalling it but have you also done an update to its driver?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, was there also a Windows update received or done on the computer? If there was, then all the more reason to do an update to the network adapter's driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hey, thank you for your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have tried updating the adapter's driver, but it's up to date. I have updated my laptop today with 1709 Fall Creators Update - the Wan miniports finally disappeared from device manager, but the problem with slow wifi connection
 still persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Wan miniports are back again and after searching a bit on the web, I guess that they might be causing this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>WAN miniports are essentially just drivers for various types of network connection. They usually get installed when you install 3rd party software like those needed for VPN connection. If the slow connection persisted even when you noticed the WAN miniports
 disappearing from the Device Manager, then, they must not be the culprit at all. But if you would really want to check, you can uninstall everything under<strong> Network adapter
</strong>and try to install driver manually by clicking update driver for each component that has become yellowed under it. You don't need to include updating the Wan miniports to be able to check if having them disabled would make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above doesn't help, it would also be best to check the wireless settings of your own router. Try to adjust the channel settings and see how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We will be here for your updates.</p>

<h2>            Cyber Ghost</h2>
                    Cyber Ghost came as a free trial with some other software I bought. I didn't really understand what it was but I installed it anyway. A tech who was helping me with a problem saw it and said to uninstall it immediately! He said it could ruin my computer.
 What is it? Is it really bad? They are always sending me offers as low as $14 for a year.

            <p><span>Do you understand what these files contain?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The files requested are technical reports about how your system works and do not relate to personal data, which you naturally wish to protect. You only need to leave a file in your OneDrive for the
 limited time necessary for the other party to retrieve the file. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Having requested thousands of reports in these forums over the last 3 years, I can only say that I have never encountered a complaint that an exchange of files has contributed to a breach of the users
 security and a loss of personal data. I am not an expert in computer security but breaches of security occur when a user allows direct access to their computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Access can be granted by the user knowingly allowing direct access or access being achieved by deception or trick though a camouflaged link in an incoming email or other communication.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you look at other threads you will find many other users sharing files, notably by those seeking help with diagnosing the causes of blue of death crashes. Exchanging copies of files is an extremely
 practical way to aid and expedite the finding of a solution to the problem the user has. You no doubt are aware that these are moderated public forums. Abuse of whatever kind in these forums is rigorously dealt with and those seeking to abuse others are excluded
 from using the forum. However, I have never seen the type of abuse you fear reported.

            <p>If you were watching a movie and your got a BSOD I would suspect your video drivers - and that would reveal itself in the crash dump file in more details.&nbsp; Sometimes to be sure about the cause of a crash one needs to look at multiple crash dump files to
 look for a repeatable pattern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In BlueScreenView the Caused By fields indicate a file that is part of your video subsytem so that is a good clue but dxgmms1.sys is a Windows file and one would hope they would be pretty stable by now so it is probably not the real problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When BSV implicates a Windows file, that is probably not going to be the real problem which is why crash dumps are sometimes requested - to be sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember that BlueScreenView and programs like it are just "pretty good" about telling you the cause of the crash but it is not perfect and if you read their documentation regarding the Caused By Driver field they say:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver that probably caused this crash. BlueScreenView tries to locate the right driver or module that caused the blue screen by looking inside the crash stack.&nbsp; However, be aware that the driver detection mechanism is not 100% accurate, and you should
 also look in the lower pane, that display all drivers/modules found in the stack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not comfortable about uploading crash dumps, you can show us your current video driver situation and we might be able to make suggestions and help you see if what you have now is out of date, what the correct video driver is, where to get it and
 how to check again if you update it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to pursue that approach so we can see what you have now, do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />

            <p>^_^ no need, it's not my driver or graphic card's fault, the fault is with the media player classic.</p>
<p>this is what I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the codec pack mega from this site&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://www.codecguide.com/download_k-lite_codec_pack_mega.htm</p>
<p>I had the april version and it seems it gives the nightly version of the media player classic along with the huge amount of codecs.&nbsp;<br />
I didn't have any issue before but recently I got this new movie and played it</p>
<p>at first I got BSOD ,I restarted the system and played it again and in the second time</p>
<p>the Media player classic crashed automatically and event viewer showed this message</p>
<p>"<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(106, 106, 106, 1)">Display driver</span><span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">&nbsp;stopped responding and has recovered etc.."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>so I went to media player classic and opened its about and checked its version and found</p>
<p>it's a nightly build and media player classic says in their site</p>
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(169, 68, 66, 1)">Warning </div>
<div style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<p>Nightly builds are considered as unstable builds. They may contain untested extra functionality.&nbsp;<span>Use at your own risk</span>.</p>
<p>so I manually downloaded the media player classic from their original site,instead of downloading it with codec pack and installed it, today I played the same movie in the background while I was working on my works and found no issue at all, the movie played
 smoothly without any lagging, crashed or anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>so my suggestion is don't use nightly builds, they are full of bugs and may crash the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyway thanks for everyone who wants to help me. :)</p>

                    I have been trying &amp; trying to print out an email in my outlook account with windows 10.&nbsp; Making me so angry.&nbsp; I am use to selecting print from the little 3 dots &amp; no problem.&nbsp; Now when I select print I get a big black box with questions ( and no way to
 even see the bottom of the black page to see if there is a way to "reply" "continue" or whatever!).&nbsp; I can't get the box to disappear &amp; I can't get my email printed.&nbsp; There is apparently no way around this.&nbsp; This is just stupid - all I want to do is print
 the email.&nbsp; I can hit control P and print the whole page with all the extra stuff on it.....I just want the email printed.

            The quote from ZigZag had nothing that worked for me, I think they were discussing Win 8 (which I refused to use).&nbsp; I think the issue must just be with Edge...I switched to my Chrome brower, opened Outlook &amp; Printed just as I usually did.&nbsp; No problems.&nbsp;
 Until Edge figures out how to get rid of that stupid black box with options that pops up when I hit "print" on Outlook....I'll stick with Chrome for emails.&nbsp; The black pop-up box can't be maximized, so I have no idea if there is a way to get rid of it at the
 bottom of the page.&nbsp; Why is it like that?&nbsp; I can enlarge it only so big - but never big enough to actually see the bottom.&nbsp; Massive FAIL.

            Same thing happened to me.&nbsp; MS answer was not helpful, I couldn't figure out what it said.&nbsp; So MS just fix it so we don't have to set anything up.&nbsp; Put a button in the black box that says "Print"! Is that so difficult?

            Easiest solution - download chrome &amp; put icon in lower bar.&nbsp; whenever you need to print out an email, just bring up your chrome browser &amp; open outlook.&nbsp; Doesn't affect Win10 at all, just opens in a new tab.&nbsp; Presto - works just like it USE to in Win7.&nbsp;
 It takes MS forever to admit they made a mistake.&nbsp; Makes you wonder if the "beta-testers" never had an occasion to print out an email during the test period.&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Never, not even once?

            sfc is system file checker.&nbsp; It seems everyone on the forum assumes everyone in the world knows any and all of the abbreviations that is common in the tech community.&nbsp; If we were all techies---we wouldn't need forums would we?&nbsp; If you are "helping" neophites,
 like me....use full sentences &amp; explain all steps.&nbsp; Avoid using abbreviations &amp; tech talk.&nbsp; You may think you sound smarter, but you aren't being helpful.&nbsp; And that is the reason for the forums, after all.

<p>Well you will have to set your region as UK if you want English voice commands (or US if you are American) but you will anyway connect to the nearest active LIVE servers (possibly Portugal, or France/Spain). I know, I did the same to Switzerland from Germany
 but I connect to Swiss, German, and English servers with my locale set as UK.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
- Are you referring to Windows 7 sidebar gadget or a third party gadget?<br />
- Have you made any changes to your computer prior to the issue?<br />
- Do you have the downloaded folder in which the gadget files are stored?<br />
<br />
Follow these steps and check if they help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Follow steps from this article and check if that helps.<br />

<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>This will open up the Sidebar gadgets folder, where you should see a file named Settings.ini.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right click on it and select Rename.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Rename it to <b>settings.old</b>. Restart the computer and check for the issue.</span></p>

            Hi utopiacsp 
<br />
<br />That Desktop has Intel Graphics Media Accelerator HD (DirectX 10.1), you will not be able to find a device driver for that integrated graphics for Windows 10
<br />
<br />An older version of Windows 10 - 1703 or earlier should run on that PC, but newer versions will not. 
<br />
<br />Your IDT 92HD73E Audio and chipset will also be a problem if you install Windows 10, again device drivers will be next to impossible to locate . . .

            Hi  utopiacsp 
<br />
<br />If its not compatible, then I would not force the install, since this can have adverse effects. 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703****.1 Pro

<p>We appreciate your response. There is a possibility that performing a Clean Installation using the Media Creation Tool can resolve your concern if it is a software issue. However, it is best to contact the Original Equipment Manufacturer if it turns out
 that it is a hardware issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be reminded that you have to back up all your files before performing a clean install to avoid data loss. Here‚Äôs an
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> that would walk you through the steps on how to create
<strong>Windows 10 installation media</strong> using the <strong>Media Creation Tool</strong>.</p>

<p>Let us know if you need additional information.</p>

                    The main reason I upgraded to Windows 10 was because I was looking for an easy way to get rid of all of the garbage that has accumulated in my hard drive over the years and start fresh.&nbsp; Naturally I selected "Keep Nothing" when asked which files I wished
 to keep.&nbsp; However when Windows 10 was done installing all of my files are still present in the C drive.&nbsp; Why is this?&nbsp; How can I redo the installation so that I actually do "Keep Nothing"?

            Hi Phillip.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can run the Printer Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot. 
<br />
<br /> Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Install the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall any printer software.    
<br />
<br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click printer to delete  Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />5) Go to the printer model‚Äôs Support Downloads webpage here: <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-envy-4520-all-in-one-printer-series/5447920/model/5447921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservic...</a>  to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />6) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
<br />If you receive a popup asking if this solved your problem please ignore it, as it may remove my ability to help you and others may also not help.  Please wait until after the issue is resolved to answer the popup or mark your question answered to help others.

            Hi, IPV6 only works on the Xbox One if your internet provider supports it. You need to contact them to see if they support it, and provide the correct hardware for it.

<p>Hi Nicola,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is normally caused by a sync error to the server. If you are positive that your network connection is strong enough, sign in to iCloud using the web version and check if your photos are showing. If so, try to reinstall the app. All your files should
 be safe since it was saved on your account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists after re-installation, you may have to contact Apple support to check any server issue.

            Hi Sherian,
<br />
<br />Can I ask if have you tried that SD on another device?
<br />Also, have you another SD to try if your SD card reader is working?

<br />Is the switch on the side of the SD card turned off?
<br />Is auto play for the SD card active?
<br />Can you open it by double-clicking on the card under devices?
