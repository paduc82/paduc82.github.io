<h2>            SSD defragmentation&#63;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I upgraded to Windows Vista recently and I was seriously disappointed with the defragmentation tool. &nbsp; I can't figure out from the tool interface what the expected behavior is if I schedule defragmentation on my second, magnetic drive. &nbsp;Unfortunately
 the simplest interpretation of the interface is that it would also schedule defragmentation for my primary SSD drive, which would be a Bad Thing (tm). &nbsp;It is also possible that the defragmenter could possible issue trim instructions rather than defragmentation
 move instructions, but how could I possibly trust that without knowing what is going on? &nbsp;I am also frustrated by the fact that the fact that there is no feedback whatsoever on how fragmented a drive was in the first place and whether it did anything that
 helped. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is the recommended approach here to turn this off and look for a third party tool?</strong></p>

<p>Windows Vista does not differentiate between SSD and conventional disks. It doesn't use the Trim command. For better SSD support, you need Windows 7.&nbsp;You can find a description of the changes in Windows 7 here:<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/e7/archive/2009/05/05/support-and-q-a-for-solid-state-drives-and.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/e7/archive/2009/05/05/support-and-q-a-for-solid-state-drives-and.aspx</a></p>
<p>The only&nbsp;thing you can do with Vista is to use the Select Volumes button on the Disk Defragmenter GUI to deselect all volumes and then re-enable only the volumes you want. That will avoid unnecessary wear to the SSD. You will also need to run manually any
 Trim utility that the SSD manufacturer provides.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi jeff687,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Defragmentation can't be scheduled for solid-state drives (SSD), as well as some types of virtual hard disks (VHD).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Solid state drives are based on flash memory, which age very differently than standard spinning platter-based hard drives.
 Each sector has a limited number of write cycles, so the drives include wear-leveling features that allow the drive to last longer by essentially fragmenting the drive on purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The read times are not greatly improved by defragmenting as they are in standard drives, so there is no real gain in defragmentation,
 but by doing so, you are increasing the number of write to the drive, thereby decreasing the drive life.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Windows Vista, there are many improvements in the defrag engine and in the manageability of fragmentation. By default,
 Windows Vista uses Task Scheduler to automatically keep the hard disk defragmented. The task that runs the defrag engine runs as a low-priority task.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can now use Task Scheduler to schedule defragmentation. Therefore, you do not have to manually start defragmentation.
 By default, a task is created and is set to run at 1 A.M. on every Wednesday. If the computer is turned off or if the task does not run at the scheduled time, the task will run the next time that the computer is idle.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Blank Login Screen &#40;Windows 7 Home Premium&#41; following system crash - can&#39;t log in</h2>
                    <span>Hi everyone, hope you can help. <br />
                    <span>Hi everyone, hope you can help. <br />
<br />
Our laptop started to play up unexpectedly a few days ago - a black screen with blue error box (not BSOD) would appear intermittently, following which the laptop would restart. Nothing was coming up on the scans, everything else was otherwise working okay.
 When I logged into my husband's profile, as it was happening more often to him, I noticed a vshare 'search engine' homescreen on IE, which he said had just started to appear one day. I went in to Control Panel / Uninstall Programs, and uninstalled a Hotbar
 which I knew nothing about, followed by the vShare item. After the uninstall, the system froze, so I had to restart.<br />
<br />
On the restart, it seemed to boot okay. The 'system has shut down unexpectedly' page appeared as expected due to the aforesaid system crash, but I selected the start-up normally option as opposed to safe modes. Then when the light blue login screen background
 appeared, some symbols popped up on the screen (looked like a webdings type font), and the user login icons didn't appear. The system then seemed to keep trying and went into a little loop of login screen appearing, symbols popping up, then a quick flash and
 the login screen, symbols etc pops up, and on it goes. It does this all the time and I can't login to try and do anything about it!<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what has caused this and if it can be fixed? I've considered trying a system repair using the OS installation disc, but would like some advice first. I'd rather see what I can do to repair the problem first, as there's some files I want off
 the hard drive <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.windowsforum.org%2fpublic%2fstyle_emoticons%2fStandard%2fsad.gif" /><br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone<br />
<br />

<p><span>Hi newcastlelou,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you see any error message on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check if you can boot into safe mode.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer to get back to the normal mode</span></p>
<p><span>If you can boot into safe mode then check if any third party program installed on the computer is causing the issue by performing clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers
 and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the below link to know more about clean boot procedure.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></p>
<p><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or
 click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you are unable to boot into safe mode then I would suggest that you perform system restore on the computer using the Windows 7 installation disk.</span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Sidewinder X8 Scroll Wheel Issue</h2>
                    My Microsoft SideWinder X8's scroll wheel no longer clicks, it just scrolls completely smoothly without any stoppage or clicking like it once had.&nbsp; This is an issue for me because I am a big FPS gamer and the clicks help me easily change weapons.&nbsp; This
 just started yesterday after about 3 months of ownership.&nbsp; Is there anyway to fix this?&nbsp; I assume the spring inside that made it click must of broken or something.&nbsp;Thanks for the help.

            Thanks for the timely reply I did exactly as you said as far as scanning with Malwarebytes &amp; it caught &amp; quarantined it too. But, I still don't know how to go ahead &amp; delete it, it's just quarantined right now. If you have any other ideas please let me
 know &amp; thanks again. Cheers

    <title>sending TTL triggers to the parallel port using matlab on a windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            sending TTL triggers to the parallel port using matlab on a windows 7 64bit machine</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
<br />
I am having difficulty with my new windows 7 laptop and would appreciate any help.<br />
<br />
I am using it for electrophysiology recordings, and need to send TTL triggers to temporally align the recording to the stimulation, and our hardware receives TTL triggers via parallel port, because we need very high temporal accuracy.<br />
<br />
I used an old ThinkPad 61 until now, but it is 7 years old and got too slow for any reliable stimulus presentation.
<br />
The solution that worked on that ( working with the sendTTL.m function that relies on the IOlib package) does not work on this machine, because it relies on CrackNT.sys, which is not available in win 7.
<br />
I tried the lptwrite.m (relying on porttalk), not working. <br />
I tried emulating XP environment with the virtual machine, and it still does not work.
<br />
<br />
The LPT port is in a dock-station, but recognized, with up-to-date drivers. <br />
<br />
Any ideas what I can still try?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Oana<br />
<br />

<h2>            DVD drive won&#39;t open in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I've been having trouble with my DVD drive since upgrading to Win10. It will open and close ok while the bios is loading and when the PC is sitting at the Windows login screen but as soon as I login to Windows it won't open. Windows will recognise
 a disc in the drive, it will appear in Explorer and I can run something from the disc but it won't open the drive. If I sign out and go back to the login screen it will open again. I've been using this as a work around but now I want to install something from
 multiple discs and I can't sign out in the middle of the install. I bought a new drive but still have the same problem. I've done everything on

<p>Any ideas please?</p>

<h2>            What happens behind the scenes when the &#34;Reset this PC&#34; feature is used in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Microsoft Surface Pro 4. If I reinstall Windows 10 on my device resorting to the new method of "Reset this PC" instead of the old-fashioned one of doing a format and a clean fresh installation using a USB flash drive, what&nbsp;does Windows do behind
 the scenes when I use this feature? I know how the end result looks like. I'm interested in what Windows does that I cannot see.</p>
<p>There are two options available: "Keep my files" and "Remove everything". If I choose the first option, my personal files are moved to a new folder named "Windows.old" and Windows is reinstalled. If, however, I choose the second option, my files, as advertised,
 are not kept and Windows is reinstalled, but what's interesting is that I still see the folder "Windows.old" created with very few files in it that "Disk Cleanup" cannot seem to successfully remove.</p>
<p>My inquiry is concerned with what steps Windows takes and the order in which it takes them to reinstall Windows in both cases whether it is keeping my personal files or not.</p>
<p>Does it format the "C" partition or does it just move/delete the files on it?</p>
<p>Where&nbsp;are the Windows source files/installation media stored?</p>
<p>I have &nbsp;noticed that I have a 1.89GB recovery partition on my device. I have also noticed a 2.34GB folder named "Recovery" in the root folder of my "C" partition and this folder persists after both "Reset this PC - Keep my files" and "Reset this PC - Remove
 everything". How is it surviving after these processes? Is it being regenerated by the recovery partition? Does the "C" partition never get formatted during the processes? Does Windows move the folder away and then move it back in after formatting the "C"
 partition? Is 2.34GB or 1.89GB of space enough to hold a backup of the installation source files for Windows 10 along with the drivers needed for my device?</p>
<p>If Windows uses the 2.34GB "Recovery" folder on my "C" partition to reinstalls Windows, how is the "C" partition then formatted? Does it get formatted?</p>
<p>I know that I asked a lot of questions and that answering all of these questions can take a lot of time, but I'm frankly very confused and I would highly appreciate it if someone can help me with the technical details of what happens behind the scenes as
 I've searched and couldn't find this information anywhere.</p>

            No, the information on the link was not helpful in any way I'm afraid. I specifically stated that I understand what the options are, what they are for and how the end results look like. My inquiry is about what happens behind the scenes when I choose to
 use any of these options.

                    Just bought a brand new all in one touch screen computer with windows 8 and Ive been having this issue with the app store.<br />
Apps very often wont download or update. It just sits there as pending, or downloading without actually making progress. Sometimes it downloads 30 or 60% of the file then stops dead and nothing else happens. Sometimes it eventually says failed to download or
 update but basically Im having a terrible experience with the windows store and thinking of returning my computer to get something thats cheaper and doesnt come with windows 8 and these ridiculous problems right out of the box.

            I figured it out! Go to the App Store and right click at the top. Click on my apps and then from the drop down menu select all apps. Then select the ones that were not downloading or updating correctly and click install. That worked for me. Not sure why
 the problem occurred in the first place though.

I stumbled on another solution that worked for me.&nbsp; I had a whole bunch of apps that were trying to update and wouldn't.&nbsp; When I canceled the installation of a few of them the others started updating.&nbsp; When those were finished updating I was able to update
 the rest in smaller batches.&nbsp;

<h2>            Issue with restarting my computer that has interfered with my installation of Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very peculiar issue I have with my laptop. This starts from when it was still Windows 7. The problem was that upon restart, the computer would just fail to boot. It would go past the initial 'ASUS' splash screen and then just go black screen and would not
 do anything else. If I pressed the power button, the laptop would instantly turn off again, but go straight back to the same screen. In order to boot the system up again I would need to hurriedly hold down the power button just as I turned the computer in
 order for it to hard power off, then it boots as normal. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, one day I had enough and decided to try installing Windows 8 (got it cheap on a student deal), and that was a pain due to the fact I needed the computer to restart properly in order to install it. I got lucky, however and it decided to play nice for
 once. Fast forward to today, after installing over 400 updates, I could try and install 8.1. But, you guessed it, the fact I can't restart my computer is playing with the installation, and it's driving me mad. I scanned my hard drive for errors, but was told
 there was nothing. It can't be the OS cause I replaced the damn thing and wiped all data on here so I'm out of ideas. Anyone come across this problem before??</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the drivers or the hardware components on the laptop are not compatible for Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to boot the computer normally?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, I would suggest you to use hard reset method to turn off the computer and turn it back ON. Check if the operating system is restored back to Windows 8. If not, use Windows 8 installation media to reinstall Windows 8 and then proceed further. If you
 do not have a Windows 8 DVD, use a different working computer and refer to the link to know how to create a Windows 8 installation media:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You will require the product key for Windows 8 operating system to create a media.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to boot the computer normally, then run the Windows Update assistant and check if any of the drivers or the applications shows incompatible with Windows 8.1. Refer to the link to download and run the assistant:</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<strong>Will my devices and apps be compatible with Windows 8.1?”</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further troubleshooting, I would suggest you to run <strong>Windows Driver verifier
</strong>to find out if there are any issues with the drivers for the devices installed on the computer. Refer to the link to do so:</p>

    <title>Use Windows 7 OEM &#40;no service pack&#41; to install Windows 7 SP1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frawglips  say:</h3>
<h2>            Use Windows 7 OEM &#40;no service pack&#41; to install Windows 7 SP1</h2>
                    Is it OK (as in legal) to download Windows 7 SP1 and then activate it with a Windows 7 (without the SP) oem license ?<br />
This oem license I have, I purchased at the same time I purchased all the components to build a new system.&nbsp; I want to re install but would prefer to have SP1 installed with it.&nbsp; Saves a lot of time later.<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Yes, its perfectly legal, as long as you are using the product key with the corresponding edition.</p>
<p>You can download the corresponding edition you have a license for with SP1 integrated from the following link:</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Backup Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr. dirk diggler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Backup Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; I had set up Windows Backup to image my drive nightly.&nbsp; It was working fine for some time, but I recently noticed that my (external) backup drive wasn't filling up, so I opened up the backup application to see whether
 the schedule was working.&nbsp; It is not.&nbsp; Now, when I go to open "Backup and Restore", a window opens with the heading "Back up or restore your files", but nothing below that.&nbsp; I opened the services list, and the Windows Backup service had mysteriously disappeared.&nbsp;
 I was able to get the service to reappear in the list of Windows Services by doing a registry merge, but now the service will not start.&nbsp; When I attempt to start the service I get Error 1053: The service did not respond to the start or control request in a
 timely fashion."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to reinstall the windows backup service?</p>

            Hi Mr. Dirk Diggler,<br />
<br />
<p>
<span>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community to post your question.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Based on the above description, it appears that backup fails and if you try to start the backup service you get a message that "</span>1053: The service did not respond to the start or control
 request in a timely fashion". <span>
I will be happy to assist you. <br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<b>Here are some troubleshooting steps&nbsp;that you can try to resolve this problem.</b>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Perform clean boot and check if you can start the service.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Clean boot will help us identify if any third party applications or start up items are causing the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>NOTE:
</span></b><span>After checking the functionality in clean boot, follow the suggestions under
</span><span>“How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot”.
</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Let's restart the Volume Shadow Copy service and SPP services.</span></b></p>
<p><span><span><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</span></span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>Open Administrative Tools by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button, clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></span><span><span>, clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>System and Maintenance</strong></span></span><span><span>, and then clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Administrative Tools</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Double-click <span><strong>Services</strong></span>.<span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If the <span><strong>SPP</strong></span> service is disabled, double-click it to open the service properties.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If <strong>Volume Shadow Copy</strong> service is double-click it to open the service properties
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click the <span><strong>Startup type</strong></span> list, click
<span><strong>Automatic (Delayed Start)</strong></span>, and then click <span><strong>Apply</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f.<span> &nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Under <span><strong>Service status</strong></span>, click
<span><strong>Start</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3</span></b><b><span>: Run System File Checker
 tool and check if the backup starts.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>To do this, refer this link:
</span></b></p>

<br />
Hello, and thanks for the assistance.&nbsp; I still have not been able to get the problem fixed.<br />
<br />
Method 1:&nbsp; I did a clean boot, however, even after a clean boot I still get the "1053" error.<br />
<br />
Method 2:&nbsp; I restarted both VSS and SPP services, however even after doing so I still get the "1053" error.<br />
<br />
Method 3:&nbsp; I ran the File Checker tool.&nbsp; It gave me a response as follows: "Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of the them."&nbsp; Following this, I am still getting the "1053" error when I try to start Windows Backup service.&nbsp;
 I followed "Step 1" under "More troubleshoot steps for advanced users" in the File Checker link you provided, and have an extraction file including all strings that include the text "[SR]", however, not of the files listed as "missing" appear to be clearly
 related to Windows Backup service.<br />
<br />
I will attempt to post the results of my sfcdetails.txt file in another post.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for you assistance.&nbsp; I hope you can help me get this figured out.<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 7 will not show icons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonfool  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 will not show icons</h2>
                    I have recently had an issue with my HP tower computer. When I boot the computer it will boot up normally but take a while and when it finally does boot it will appear with no icons and no system tray. I then have to do a hard shut down just to move from
 this point. The system will operate just fine using safe mode.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I have done so far:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I first used a copy of Bit Defender (Linux Version) to clean and scan the system. There was some type of virus on the system.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Second, I downloaded and ran Malware Bytes and scanned the system and it also found something on the system.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Last, In safe mode downloaded C Cleaner from the correct site and ran that software.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After doing so, my computer came back and all the icons were back as I remember them.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Two days later or yesterday October 23,2013, I started up the computer after a Microsoft update of 22 and after the start up install I am back to where I started when I began with this.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>looking for something to fix this for good so I can confidently use my computer with out this mess. Thank you</div>
                </div>

            <p>Thank you for your response:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I must confess I am not that good with computers and the jargon.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Method 1: I did not understand what the Microsoft document said</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Method 2: I could not find the file you were trying to identify. The document links were not user friendly to me.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have not turned on the computer since my post. Yesterday I turned it on to see if I could figure out what's going on with it.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since it needed several updates it took several minutes to boot and then restart the computer. One of the updates did not take. I found an error message which started with #8000 but I did not have a pen and paper handy to pick up the rest.

            <p>Hi Jason, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry for the late response. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following are the explanations to the methods provided in the previous post:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Explanation to Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>How to clean boot the system. By booting in clean mode, we meaning booting up the system with only necessary Microsoft services and a minimal set of drivers to wipe out any possibility of a third party software conflict. To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Logon to your administrator user account</li><li>Click <strong>Start</strong> button, type <strong>msconfig.exe</strong> in the
<strong>Start Search </strong>box and press ENTER.</li><li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab, click the <strong>Selective startup</strong> option, and then click to clear the
<strong>Load startup items</strong> check box.</li><li>On the <strong>Services</strong> tab, click to select the<strong> Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>Disable all</strong>.<br />
<strong>Note</strong> This step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not
 do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>, and then click <strong>
Restart</strong>.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
<p>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start normally.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <span>
msconfig.exe</span> in the<strong> Start Search</strong> box, and then press Enter.</li><li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab, click the <strong>
Normal Startup</strong> option, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <strong>
Restart</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above explanation will help you troubleshoot your system in clean boot mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Explanation to Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> button and click <strong>Computer</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Organize </strong>in the Computer window and then click <strong>
Folder and search options</strong>.</li><li>Go to the <strong>View</strong> tab and select the option <strong>Show hidden files, folders and drives</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Click and open the <strong>C: drive </strong>(If your Windows is installed in a different drive, open that drive letter).</li><li>Open <strong>Users</strong> folder &gt; (Your User account name) &gt; <strong>AppData
</strong>&gt;<strong> Local</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Local</strong> folder, right click on <strong>IconCache.db</strong> and click on
<strong>Delete</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Yes </strong>to confirm the deletion. </li></ol>
<p>If&nbsp;the steps do not explain the process properly, refer to the steps under the sections
<strong>Method 1: Delete the Cache file</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Method 2: Restore file associations</strong> in the following link:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Ronald,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for the post. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears that Windows Search service is using lot of CPU usage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need the following information from you to assist you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Where did you check for the CPU usage by the service Windows Search?<br />
2) What is the complete/exact service name?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The service Windows Search provides content indexing, property caching, and search results for files, e-mail, and other content. The status of this service has to be has to be kept as Automatic. Follow the troubleshooting methods given here and check for
 the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>SearchFilterHost.exe is the process for Windows Search. It is involved in indexing, caching, etc.<br />
<br />
Let us try the following methods and see if thet helps: <br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: I would suggest you to run “Search and Indexing” troubleshooter to diagnose the exact issue.</strong><br />
<br />
Follow these steps:<br />
<br />
a. Press “<strong>windows key </strong>+<strong> W</strong>” on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
b. Type “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>” without quotes in the search box and hit enter.<br />
<br />
c. Select “<strong>View all</strong>” from the left panel.<br />
<br />
d. Select “<strong>Search and Indexing</strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: I would suggest you to try disabling the .XML file extension from being indexed in the Indexing Options and check if the issue is fixed.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
Refer the folowing steps:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
a) Press “<strong>windows</strong> <strong>key</strong> + <strong>c</strong>” on the keyboard.<br />
<br />
b) Select <strong>Settings</strong><br />
<br />
c) Type <strong>Indexing </strong>Options, and select <strong>indexing options </strong>
from the search </div>
<div>d) Click <strong>Modify.</strong><br />
<br />
e) To add or remove a location, select or clear its check box in the <strong>Change selected
</strong>locations list, and then click <strong>OK.</strong><br />
<br />
f) If you don't see all locations on your computer in the list, click <strong>Show all locations</strong>. (If all locations are listed, Show all locations won't be available.) If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password
 or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
g) If you want to include a folder but not all of its subfolders, click the folder, and then clear the check box next to any subfolder that you don't want to index. These folders will appear in the Exclude column of the Summary of selected locations list.<br />
<div><br />
<strong>Method 3: Additionally you may also perform a full system scan using the Microsoft Safety Scanner to eliminate any issues related to virus/malware.</strong><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />
<br />
<strong>Important</strong>: While scanning the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, the scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on that might be lost.<br />
<div>I hope this resolves your issue, please feel free to write to us if you have any other Windows related issues.<br />

            Tried the above and Windows Search Filter Host is still just running wild. Is this a bug with no solution? It has rendered this computer USELESS! I ended up disabling as many areas and file extensions as seemed reasonably possible, deleting half of my
 installed programs, running CCleaner to remove junk and attempt to solve the always numerous registry problems, deleted and recreated the index (all of 325 items indexed now) and still the program just cranks away.

            I am having this same problem with Windows 8. This has been an ongoing issue since XP. Are you ever going to fix this? Am I better off switching to Redhat? I have tried the procedures above and it has made no difference. Search Filter Host is constantly
 using 33% of my CPU and 37-40% of my memory. I too have turned off all the bloatware and all non essential and some essential software to try and resolve this, to no avail. Any other bright ideas?

            Hey, I have exactly the same issue. I recently bought a brand new laptop with Windows 8 and ever since I've been using it I notice my fan starts to make heavy noise at times, then when I check task manager it is MS Windows search filter that uses 35% of
 my CPU. After a while it would go down again but it happens a few times a day. Is this expected behaviour of this Windows feature (because I understand it needs to index in general) or is it unusual?

<h2>            Windows 7 updates installation stuck</h2>
                    I had installed HUD Evolution theme on my PC a day ago and my PC notified me of new updates available. At shutdown button of "star menu", there was a kind of symbol giving message "Installs updates and then shut down your computer". I was not aware about
 it. So, I hit it to shut down my computer but It started installing updates which was downloaded before when I was using my PC with message "Please do not power off or unplug your machine. Installing update x of x...". The problem is that it stuck at 'Installing
 update 109 of 205...". I left it to complete installation but after 7 hours of time also there was no change. It stuck at 109 of 205 for 7 hours. I am wandering what should I do now? Whenever I shut down computer it starts installing and whenever i power on
 my computer to use, it says, "Configuring windows updates. x% complete. Do not turn off your computer." My computer opens but it takes time which is unusual. Help me to disable installation of updates to make it as earlier wi

<p>i do not see why not but did the ebay listing say it was banned or did you not know till you tried to connect to live? &nbsp;if it did not list that it was banned I would suggest getting your $$$ back and buy a new one, this is why you should not buy a used 360
 unless you know the person who bought it and know that he did not do anything to warrant a ban on it.</p>

<p>Yes, the listing did say it. I got it super cheap. I never planed on playing online. You guys can be ruthless. I was just afraid that the download would configure itself to my brother's Xbox, therefore wasting my points.</p>

<p>Actually that wouldn't work. When you download content it is tied to the console it was downloaded on as well as the gamertag it is downloaded with. In order to play it on another console, you have to play it with the gamertag it was purchased with, but
 you have to be signed into Live in order to play it. Since you can't sign into Live with the banned console, you won't be able to play the game.</p>
<p>Also, if you do decide to use the banned console and then switch to a new console later, you may have issues moving your game saves to a new console. Anything saved on a banned console usually shows as being corrupt when you move it to a new console. The
 best thing to do would be to try getting your money back from ebay and buy a new console.</p>

<p>That's what I thought. Thanks. I guess I'll just buy my avatar clothes then. Btw I save my game saves directly onto an external hard drive and they play just fine on my brother's Xbox.</p>

<h2>            wake on access from another computer in the workgroup&#63;</h2>
                    Hi everybody,<br />
How should I setup my BIOS, network board, energy and sleep modes on my windows 7 PC&nbsp;so that<br />
1) The PC goes into a real sleep mode with almost zero energy consumption after a given time of inactivity.<br />
2) It wakes up when another computer in the workgroup scans the workgroup to know all the shared ressources<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
