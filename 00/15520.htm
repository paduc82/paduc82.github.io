<h2>            Can I still use my OneDrive Education account after graduation&#63; Why all my OneDrive documents are deleted&#63;</h2>
                    I am a previous Plymouth university student and I use Onedrive Plymouth education account to store all my academic stuff. But today when I tried to log in again I found that all my documents are deleted.&nbsp;Can I still use my OneDrive Education account after
 graduation? Why all my OneDrive documents are deleted? Why my outlook student email account inbox was emptied as well? A bunch of thanks to anyone who answers my queries.&nbsp;

<h2>            Problems with E-Mail</h2>
                    Suddenly, recently our (my wife's and mine) live.co.uk accounts are not working properly on our laptop. We can log in and see E-Mails in the inbox but can't open them or open any other folders such as sent, deleted, etc. We can access the accounts on my
 wife's Kindle Fire and my mobile phone and they work as expected.

<h2>            Excel workbooks completely locked out</h2>
                    I have updated an excel file that was auto recovered. &nbsp;However, when I try to save it with a new name it says "...it is locked in the finder" "to save your changes, locate the file in finder, click get info, then clear the locked check box". &nbsp;when I locate
 the file it is not locked. &nbsp;I tried to lock it and unlock it but now all the options are greyed out on all open workbooks and I can't do anything. &nbsp;Can someone tell me how I can access the files to save them? &nbsp;I really do not want to lose the work I have been
 working on all day.

<p>Hi Stilts</p>
<p>
</p><p>Joshua should have asked you to check the version number you're using. Go to the Excel menu and choose About Excel. You should have version 16.11.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please install updates following the instructions below if you need to update. If you are already up to date, I suggest simply restarting your Mac, and then in Finder, right click on the problem file and choose Get Info. That's the dialog where you can unlock
 the file. After you unlock the file, you should be able to open it in Excel. Even if you can't unlock the file, you should still be able to open it, then use File &gt; Save As and give it a new name and save it normally.</p>
<p>

    <title>Adjusting time entry back to nearest tenth of an hour - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danwhxu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adjusting time entry back to nearest tenth of an hour</h2>
                    I trying to use an expression to reduce the actual time entered i.e. 15:35 to reduce it back to the nearest 10th of an hour of 15:30.<br />
<br />
I figure out the total minutes from a start time to the entered time and have an expression as follows in a query:<br />
<br />
TimeCardEnd: IIf([Minutes] Mod 6=0,[Actual End],[Actual End]-Minute(Format([Minutes] Mod 6,"n")))<br />
<br />
I've tried various different combinations of the above expression in an effort to subtract from the [Actual End] time the value of the remainder of the total minutes to go back to the nearest tenth.<br />
<br />
Can this expression be made to work or do I need to try another method?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Dan<br />

            I found the answer myself by creating a NewMinutes field in the query with the expression of NewMinutes: IIf([Minutes] Mod 6=0,[Minutes],[Minutes]-([Minutes] Mod 6))<br />
<br />
I then use the expression Pay Length: [NewMinutes]\60 &amp; Format([NewMinutes] Mod 60,"\:00") to put it into the proper format.<br />

            <p>The Format function always returns a text string so it is not particularly useful in a numeric calculation.&nbsp; Use the DatePart or TimePart function instead.&nbsp; In your case I think you could use:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;TimeCardEnd:&nbsp;[Actual End]-TimePart("n", [Minutes]) Mod 6</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; TimeCardEnd:&nbsp;TimeSerial(Hour(T), (Minute(T) \ 6) * 6, 0)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>OTOH, if you really want the NEAREST&nbsp;6 minute interval, use:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; TimeCardEnd:&nbsp;TimeSerial(Hour(T), ((Minute(T) + 3) \ 6) * 6, 0)<br />

            Or, if the values are always less than 24 fours, you can simply subtract the start time from the end time, round it down to the nearest 6 minute interval using the following function, and format the result:<br />
<br />
Public Function RoundToZero(dblVal As Double, dblTo As Double) As Double<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim intUpDown As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim lngTestValue As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim dblTestValue As Double<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim dblDenominator As Double<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If dblVal &lt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intUpDown = -1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intUpDown = 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dblDenominator = intUpDown * dblTo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dblTestValue = dblVal / dblDenominator<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lngTestValue = Int(dblTestValue)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RoundToZero = intUpDown * lngTestValue * dblTo<br />
<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
You can see how it works in the debug window, firstly by simple subtraction without rounding down:<br />
<br />
? Format(#2013-12-27 18:30# - #2013-12-27 14:15#,"hh:nn")<br />
04:15<br />
<br />
and with rounding down to #00:06#:<br />
<br />
? Format(RoundToZero(#2013-12-27 18:30# - #2013-12-27 14:15#, #00:06#),"hh:nn")<br />
04:12<br />
<br />
For&nbsp; time periods of 24 hours or longer there are other functions which can be brought into play, which you'll find illustrated in my little demo file Timesheet.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
When doing date/time arithmetic like this it's important to only format the final presented values.&nbsp; If you are summing a set of short durations over a long period, say, always sum the result of a simple subtraction of the values and then format the end result
 as required.&nbsp; If each short duration is formatted as in the above examples and then an attempt to sum these values is made it won't work as the formatted values are string expressions not numeric values.

                    <p>KB3081424 cannot install. The answer to this can't install is to go to Settings, windows update, and click on CHECK FOR UPDATES. This will download an additional update that will fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody down there should know that if I have updates (KB3081424) waiting to be installed, the CHECK FOR UPDATES does not appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot remove or delete KB3081424 to get the Check For Updates.</p>

<h2>            Outlook syncs cause device to be three hours off</h2>
                    
<p>Just recently when I plug in my device (HP IPAQ) my 2003 Outlook changes the time and all appointments on my device to be three hours earlier.&nbsp; I tried the new Active Sync software and that did nothing.&nbsp; Even if I
 erase the appointment on my device and manually change the time to be correct, when it syncs with Outloook on my computer, it sets everthing back three hours.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

            All Windows Phones come with xbox music and video built in, with this app you can play music and videos for free (excluding xbox music pass) which supports all the multimedia formats that are compatible with WP.

<p>A you mention a Lumia 730, that's a WP8.1 original phone and&nbsp; supported for upgrading to windows 10 mobile.</p>
<p>The thing with Facebook messenger is that Facebook (the app developer) has dropped support for Windows phone 8.1 and older for the Facebook messenger app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means that Facebook messenger will no longer work on any WP8.1 running phone.</p>
<p>So upgrade your 730 to windows 10 mobile and you can use the app again</p>

<p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be complicated for some users to get the exact location of the actual person who sent the email. For example, if someone in a foreign country sends you an email using Hotmail, the last IP address in the header section will
 might be the public IP address assigned to that user from the ISP, which will give you the location of the user ranging from within a mile all the way to the city or region level. The possible way to check the location of the sender is by using the ip address
 from the email sender.<br />
<br />
If you're using Outlook for Windows, you can view the email headers by following the steps provided on the article below.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-internet-message-headers-cd039382-dc6e-4264-ac74-c048563d212c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">View internet message headers</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to analyze your email header to find out IP address of sender then you can easily track the physical location of the sender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further information, don't hesitate to contact us.<br />

<h2>            Powerpoint Trimmimg Question</h2>
                    <p>Would anyone happen to know if it's possible to delete an unused portion of a video after trimming in a slide. I have a file that is over an hour long that I am pulling 13 different portions from. Each clip has its own slide which means that the 1 hour video
 is in each slide..that's over 13 hours of video for that file. I believe this is causing my powerpoint to act very sluggish. Any ideas? Can I copy and paste the trimmed portions only so that I can delete unwanted video from the presentation? &nbsp;</p>

    <title>SIP settings on nokia X6 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gm_w  say:</h3>
<h2>            SIP settings on nokia X6</h2>
                    
<p>I just got an X6. I don't have experience with any other nokia smart phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what is the function of SIP settings under Settings-&gt;connectivity-&gt;admin settings? Is it supposed to allow you to make VOIP calls? I read in the forums that a lot other phones can be made doing so. If this is the case, how do I setup my profile? I keep
 on getting "registration fail"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To be able to make voip calls on your phone you will also need to install a voip settings application. I do not know if this is supported on the X6, it is not listed here:</p>

<p>In general there is something wrong with X6, at least with the 16 GB version because you can configure SIP and it registers perfect but there is no option in contacts to make the internet call. There is only Voice Call and Video Call. I even called nokia
 but they could not help me and they should call me back after further investigation or something.</p>
<p>For now I can always use Fring.</p>

<p>I just got my Nokia X6 and went through the rigmarole of setting up my VOIP provider (InPhonex - highly recommended by the way) and found no way to make calls using this. Strangely though, there is even a "SIP" field for contacts so quite odd that no way
 to use native SIP client. Was very useful with my N95 so will be very disappointing if they axed this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will update too if find/figure anything out.</p>

<p>Well lots of updates latter and no support for native sip phone settings ,my guess would be nokia is not interested in giving away the option for cheap calls via 3g. I have tried fring and other but would eat up the battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sip setting are just for sharing videos according to the manual, i really hope Nokia would make an update to fix this. Its a shame that such a nice handset has been crippled. Humm maybe a firmware hack jajajaja</p>

<p>I e-mailed them about it. The X6 doesn't support VoIP. As tacuazin mentions, te SIP settings are only for video sharing. It is a shame, my old N81 seems to be a more capable handset...</p>

            You must have pressed Ctrl+Shift+J, which turns on what Word calls "Distributed" alignment. Select all the affected text and press Ctrl+J, which is "Justified" alignment. The difference between the two is that behavior of right-aligning the last (or only)

    <title>Nokia Lumia 925 Windows phone keeps shutting down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> al_lindsey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Lumia 925 Windows phone keeps shutting down</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had a problem for the past 2 months, my Nokia Lumia 925 with Win 8.1 keeps shutting down spontaneously. (I did not have this problem before 8.1)&nbsp; This is my third phone in the last 2 months (warranty program keeps sending me replacements) and
 it shut down for the first time this morning. All 3 have developed the same problem, the phone will shut down spontaneously and the only way to start it up again is a soft reset (Volume down + Power for 15 seconds). I have had a total of 10-15 shutdowns between
 the 3 phones and this is a conservative estimate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am thinking that this has to be a setting or an app that I use (and few others do) that is causing the shutdown since I have only seen a few other similar issues in the forums. Here are some of the basic facts about my situation and some of the actions
 I have taken:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I have wiped the phones repeatedly (3 phones wiped a total of 3 or 4 times not including the initial setup of the replacement phones, which is getting really old--really fast).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I have tried turning off NFC, but that obviously &nbsp;wasn't the issue because NFC was off this morning when it shut off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I have tried trimming the screen protector/screen guard I installed as suggested in one of the other forums even though that seemed ridiculous (I think that was a different model phone too, but I gave it a shot)</p>
<p>I have not noticed any common occurrence such as</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --when a certain app is running</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --when it is on/off charger,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- When the battery is full or low (it was 24% this morning).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -I have 2 chargers, 3 if you include the car charger that I have never had to use due to great battery life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I have called tech support several times, all AT&amp;T can tell me is that this is not a known issue and I should wipe it again. Nokia says the same and that I should send it back to them for repairs. That seems fruitless to me because I have
 had 3 different phones, what are they going to repair that a new phone won't fix?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It takes me 3 hours to reinstall and set up my apps, I am getting very frustrated. I really love the way this phone functions, the software is good, the screen is brilliant and very sensitive, the camera is great (although a bit slow), and the size
 and feel are perfect for me...I hope that someone here on the forums can help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help in advance...</p>

<p>Hello, mariaadamsky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate you reaching out to our community regarding your concern. You are using a Lumia 925 as well, correct?&nbsp;Did something happen to your phone that possibly caused such behavior?&nbsp;Did you try doing fixes on it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Latest software released for Lumia phones is the Lumia Cyan.&nbsp;To confirm that you have it installed on your phone, go to Settings&gt; extras+info. You can also try going to Settings&gt; phone update&gt; check for updates to check if there's an available update. Are
 your system apps also updated? While connected to WiFi, go to Store&gt; ...&gt; downloads to check for pending updates. Let's hope that the phone will not shut down while doing this process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, we can try other fixes that&nbsp;could help us identify the real cause of the issue. In case you wish to have it repaired in a Nokia Care Point, warranty claim may vary per region and Nokia does not have an international warranty. Also, creating a
 backup is a must to avoid data loss. Where did you buy the phone and where are you located right now? To know about the manufacturer's limited warranty, go here:&nbsp;<a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/guides/Nokia_Manufacturers_Limited_Warranty_with_WP_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/guides/Nokia_Manufacturers_Limited_Warranty_with_WP_EN.pdf</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to your reply.</p>

<p>Ever since I bought my phone, 8 mo ago, it has randomly shut down. Id say on average of 3 times per month. Every time it would come back alive maybe 15minutes to 1 hour later. Last night it went out and didn't come back on till I did a "hard reset". I went
 all day without my phone, waitting for it to come back. It never did so I went online to find solution to no avail.</p>

<p>&nbsp;and .

 Lumia 925 - My phone does not work or respond as expected</a>&nbsp;and try the provided fixes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Whenever it randomly shut down, are you doing a task on the phone like browsing, charging, or playing an app? If the "hard reset" you are referring to is the fix number 3 listed in the above link, I suggest you also try using the NSRT and let us know if
 the same behavior will still occur.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am hoping for a positive outcome. By the way, welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions. ;-)</p>

            Same issue, really frustrating, I daren't touch the screen lock button as it will start shutting on and off repeatedly, I'm guessing it's a hardware issue, poor design has allowed gunk to get under the button causing it to stick.

            I have found the problem, why the phone keeps turning on an off. The Sleep Button is stuck. So your phone thinks you are turning it on and off. I have solved my problem by putting my phone on landscape mode and wait. It has worked for me.

            <p>recieved a phone call and the phone got stuck with the call, could not answer the call nor change the display. had to soft reboot the 928 nokia. the phone has not worked the same since the reboot. the worse part, when trying to turn on the phone with the
 on/off button right away the phone gives the option to shutdown by sliding down. shutdown phone about 10 times already since yesterday. yesterday, after the mistake shutdown all the TXT messages had to be resync'd over and over again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>any thoughts? worried that even a reinstall wont work for this issue...</p>

<h3> torbj&#246;rnnordqvist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nvidia graphic driver freezes the system.</h2>
                    <p>I run two PC's trying out Win10 preview. One is running ok. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The second also, as long as I run the Microsoft basic graphical driver. </p>
<p>But when windows update updates the driver with Nvidia 7500LE driver, the system freezes after a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it is when i change the resolution to 1280x1024.</p>
<p>I have installed W10 twice with the same result</p>
<p>Any hints?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw: is there a safe mode start, so I can remove the driver instead of reinstall again?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in using Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are facing issues with the system after updating the graphics card driver.</p>
<p><br />
1. What is the make and model of the PC?</p>
<p>2. Are you able to boot into the desktop after Windows updates the graphics card driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to boot to the desktop, download the graphics card driver from manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>Disconnect the PC from internet and uninstall the graphics card driver from Device Manager.</p>
<p>Restart the PC and now, install the latest graphics card driver in compatibility mode.<br />
<br />
Follow these steps:<br />
L<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ocate the <strong>executable</strong> file (.exe file) for the driver installation program.</span>
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. Right-click the file, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c. In the <strong>Package Name</strong> <strong>Properties</strong> dialog box, click the
<strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d. Click to select the <strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong> check box, click
<strong>Windows 8 </strong>with which it is compatible with in the Run this program in compatibility mode for list, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">e. Double-click the executable file to start the installation program.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you are unable to boot, then, to boot into safe mode with networking, follow these steps:</p>
<span>a) When you boot your PC, try hitting the F8 key. This may take you to the Startup Settings that include Safe Mode.</span>
<p><span>b)&nbsp;If hitting F8 doesn’t work, you can boot from installation media by following the instructions
<em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/boot-install-partition-media-usb-dvd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">here</span></a></em>. Further instructions about Safe Mode can be found

<p><span>c)&nbsp;If that doesn’t work, then use the power button to restart your computer during the boot process three times (do not let it get to the end of the boot process). This should bring up the Windows Recovery Environment.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From the recovery environment, try booting the computer in Safe Mode with Networking or Low Resolution Mode and then try to
</span>uninstall the driver.</p>

            <p>Hi and thank you for your answer snd interest,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed you suggestion to uninstall the driver and download the latest driver from Nvidia (in compability mode for Win8).</p>
<p>The version installed by Microsoft was: 9.18.8.768</p>
<p>The latest version now installed from Nvidia: 9.18.8.783</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the problem of freezing still occurs after a while, like runnning IE with changing pages.</p>
<p>I then uninstalled all Nividia drivers with the option of deleting all files, so the Microsofr Basic driver once again turned up. Then everything works OK in any resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem now is that when the system is restarted it just installs the Nvidia driver again, if internet access is turned on. So the problem of course turns up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC make is HP Media Center with AMD Athlon 64 X2 ual Core 2,00 Ghz. </p>
<p>It's got 2 Mb memory, and I run 32bit Win10.</p>
<p>The grapic card is:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Nvidia 7500LE</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I will now instead proceed with an even older PC with Nvidia 6800 and only 1Mb. Ths one runs perfectly even with Nvidia driver, but of course rather slow...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,<br />
</p>
<p>Torbjörn</p>

<p>
</p><p>This should stop Windows from automatically installing the Nvidia drivers on restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this doesn't sort out the issue of the drivers working properly in Windows 10, but at least you can wait for the next build of Windows or an updated driver from Nvidia.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Go here and download this "NVIDIA GeForce Experience" Software. It works perfectly with Win 10 TP. Let NVIDIA scan your computer. Since TP 9860 is new NVIDIA will need to catch up. I did Not have to use

            <p>There appears to be a bug concerning some Nvidia operations, and changing a resolution is one of those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my multi-monitor, after I set a custom resolution the system will freeze.&nbsp; I reboot and it goes through the Recovery process.&nbsp; During that process, you are given options for Advanced Recovery, and in that direction you should find a Startup Settings option.&nbsp;
 Let it restart from there and select F4 (I believe) and it will boot into Safe Mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can use Device Manager to uninstall the drivers for the Display adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing drivers has not helped my system...</p>

<p>And I tried your suggestion which resulted in the same version as I already tried (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">9.18.8.783).</span></p>
<p>So the problem with freezing is still there.</p>

<h3> c_5354  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel formula referencing cells from another tab on the same worksheet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a spreadsheet with two tabs: Daily tab and Weekly tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Daily tab, I keep track of numbers for each day, one row per day.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every 7th row, there are additional cells to the right to summarize the numbers of the last 7 rows. &nbsp;In other words, these are the weekly summary numbers.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For example, here's a simplified view:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
</td><td>A</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>
</td><td>
<p class="contentHeader2">Daily</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="contentHeader2">Weekly</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>7/27, Mon</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>7/28, Tue</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>7/29, Wed</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>

<td>10</td>
<td>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>8/02, Sun</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>70</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>On the Weekly tab, I simply want to pull all the summary lines in the Daily tab so I have a weekly table view, one week per row. &nbsp;When I reference the summary cells from the Daily tab, the formula looks something like =Daily!C8</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is fine except I seem to have to do this manually every week because if I simply copy the cell down, I don't know a way to tell Excel to reference cell number by going down 7 rows on the Daily tab at a time. &nbsp;In other words, when I copy the formula
 down on the Weekly tab, I want it to be =Daily!C8,&nbsp;=Daily!C<strong>15</strong>,&nbsp;=Daily!C<strong>22</strong>, ... and so on in order to pick up all the summary lines from the Daily tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

            <p>Sure, this is a pretty common request. You want to copy every <em>nth</em> row. You can use a formula like -</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">=OFFSET(Daily!$C$1,<span>(</span>ROW<span>(</span><span>A1</span><span>)</span>-1<span>)</span>*7,0)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The "*7" is what indicates the <em>nth&nbsp;</em>cell. You need to reference a cell in row 1 if your data begins in row 1, otherwise, the formula will need to be modified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to exclude your title cell, put in A2 instead of A1. If you need the data to start at a different point, you need to edit the second part of the formula -</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=OFFSET(Daily!$C$1,(ROW(A1)-1)*7)+2,0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will start at the 3rd cell in the column, rather than the first.</p>

    <title>distributed text - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            distributed text</h2>
                    I am working on a Mac10.7.5 using Word 14.3.9.
<div><br />
<div>I am looking for a way to distribute text so that some aligns left and some aligns right. For instance, a quotation may be centred followed by the author's name hard against the right-hand margin on the same line; or a numbered equation may be placed left,
 with its number hard right.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried control + shift + J to no effect. Apparently there is a symbol of two arrows pointing in opposite directions over a few lines, but I can't find it. Any ideas, please?</div>
</div>

            You can align a single line this way without using tabs or tables, by using the Justified alignment for a paragraph and ending the line with a hard line feed (shift-enter) at the end. But you have to ensure that there is only one space in the line (if
 you want left-right "distribution") and work a little harder if you want center-right "distribution.<br />
<br />
Let's suppose you want to put "distributed text" at the left and "Word 14.3.9" at the right. Then
<div>&nbsp;a. start a new paragraph and format it as justified</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. type "distributed text" but insert a non-breaking space (cmd-shift-space) instead of the space between "distributed" and "text".</div>
<div>&nbsp;c. type a space</div>
<div>&nbsp;d. type "Word 14.3.9", but with a non-breaking space between "Word" and "14"</div>
<div>&nbsp;e. press shift-enter to insert a hard line feed.<br />
<br />
If instead you want the "distributed text" centred and "Word 14.3.9" at the right, do the above, but then to the left of "distributed"</div>
<div>&nbsp;e. insert an n-space (e.g. using Insert-&gt;Insert Symbol-&gt;Advanced Symbol...-&gt;Special characters) followed by an ordinary space.</div>

                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having an incredibly weird issue.</p>
<p>Recently, I updated a machine to Windows 10 from Windows 7. Upon doing so, Outlook is now giving me a weird error message that is presented in French.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the installed languages and French is no where in the system. All other popup boxes are in English.</p>
<p>Outlook does not have any additional language packs installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what this error is about?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87a89778-00ad-44e8-ab11-d2e34b2089e4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87a89778-00ad-44e8-ab11-d2e34b2089e4" /></a></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a possibility that there are broken app components that's causing Outlook to behave improperly. Let's isolate the issue by following these troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Install Office updates</strong></a> - Installing optimal updates can help resolve issues by replacing
 outdated files. </li><li><strong>Boot Excel in safe mode</strong> - Here's how: Press the Windows key + R key, type excel /safe, then click OK. It lets you safely use Excel without encountering certain startup programs. If the issue does not occur in safe mode, disable the application
 add-ins and COM add-ins one at a time to check which add-in causes the issue.</li><li><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Repair your Office application</strong></a> - Repairing your Office application can resolve issues

            Try connecting the phone in mass storage mode then defragment your memory card and mass memory. This doesn't always work but it does often enough. Reboot the phone after doing this.

            <p>The suggestion stopping/starting AU above has been proposed many times on the net like copy an paste like it's a default standard answer, but does not work.&nbsp; also renaming SoftwareDistribution folder fails, even with admin rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally found the suggestion below seems to work . It start to re-download now from zero. There are more reports with this problem today on this site. Keep you posted.</p>

            About resetting the win updating service &nbsp;I didn't post it, and yes &nbsp;it is all over the place and the reason why is because so many come on this site and do no research/searching to find answers but just post, as part of being an Insiders is to do some
 research. and that fix has help in early builds as I see you are a new insider if you check some of the older builds that was a fix, it seems that removing Xbox controllers and turning of updates from others are the "new" cures.&nbsp;

<p>Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/415a425a-3120-4b7e-a8a3-0353de68d238" title="Judit T">

<p>
</p><p>On behalf of my colleague, Techfreak, the answer to your question is, "Yes!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>One point I would really not want overlooked: while you will be able to call Hungary land lines, the people you call may no longer have a number to use to call you back after you cancel and disconnect your landline telephone number and service, if that matters
 or is important to you.&nbsp; If you have a mobile or cellular number, no worries! </p>
<p>
</p><p>A <em><strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA256/how-do-i-get-a-skype-number?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Skype Number">Skype Number</a></strong></em> can also serve as a number for people to reach you, if they do not use Skype
 or have Skype accounts of their own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Elaine</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Having a landline or not having a landline has no effect on Skype.&nbsp; All you need to utilize Skype is an Internet connection and a Skype-capable device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If terminating your landline service will terminate your Internet, then that would affect Skype. In the past this was an issue if you had DSL. Nowadays if you have DSL service it can be configured by your provider as a dry loop without the need of an active
 landline.<br />
