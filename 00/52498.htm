            Hi!<br />
<br />
On Windows XP,&nbsp; you can uninstall Outlook Express By going into <br />
<br />
Go into Control Panel &gt; Add/Remove Program<br />
On the left pane, click Add/Remove Windows Components <br />
Remove the checkmark to OutLook Express,<br />
Click Next and Follow the instruction.,<br />
<br />
<br />
Doing so will remove Outlook Express from your computer.&nbsp; If you use your web browser to access your emails then it won't affect your ability to email.<br />

            So after getting a hold of a tech and letting them take remote control of my pc to go through everything and try to fix the problem, everything is working like it should! &nbsp;I am very pleased with the support i got my microsoft to fix this for me. &nbsp;They
 tried many different things but nothing would work so as a last resort the tech decided we should just reinstall windows 10. &nbsp;The steps to do this were much easier for someone with not a lot of computer smarts to do than trying to edit my registry. &nbsp;Anyways
 reinstalled windows by saving the iso to my desktop and openening it from there, let the installer run it's course and now everything is working great!!! &nbsp;I am thinking something got corrupt while downloading the upate the first time, i have been having problems
 lately with either my modem or isp, it's been freezing up every now and then on any of my devices online, not often but has been at least a few times a day the last week. &nbsp;Hope this helps for any of you guy

            <span>If you have forgotten your password, if you have another user account with administrative privileges you can log into that account and change your original user account's password from the User Accounts applet in Control Panel.
 If you don't have another account like this set up or don't have the password to it, you'll need to log into the built-in Administrator account. In XP Home, boot the computer into Safe Mode. Do this by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting
 up. This will get you to the right menu. Navigate using your Up arrow key; the mouse will not work here. Once in Safe Mode, you will see the normally hidden Administrator account. The default password is a blank.<br />
<br />
In XP Pro, you do not need to go into Safe Mode. At the Welcome Screen, do Ctrl-Alt-Del twice to get the classic Windows logon box. Type in "Administrator" and whatever password you assigned when you set up Windows.<br />
<br />
If you reset the built-in Administrator account's password in Home or have Pro and don't remember the password, use NTpasswd to change the built-in Administrator account's password to a blank. Download the bootable CD .iso, burn with third-party burning software
 such as Roxio, Nero, or the free <a href="http://www.imgburn.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ImgBurn</a> . Burn&nbsp;as an image, not as data. Boot with the media you created. You may need to change the boot order in the BIOS or get a temporary boot order menu with a special keypress. NTpasswd
 will run. Follow the instructions carefully.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://home.eunet.no/pnordahl/ntpasswd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.eunet.no/pnordahl/ntpasswd/<br />
</a><br />
Then go to the User Accounts applet in Control Panel and set passwords that you will remember and make other desired changes. WRITE THE PASSWORDS DOWN AND PUT THEM SOMEWHERE YOU WON'T LOSE THEM.<br />

<h2>            Setting up Linksys WPSM54G on new laptop with Win7</h2>
                    
<p>Using a Linksys WPSM54G. Working on my old WinXP, purchased a new notebook with Win7. Tried setting up as a TCPIP still will not connect. Have seen many posts on this issue, but can't seem to get it set on my pc.</p>

<p>After reading endless forums on this topic, and trying LPR printing as many suggested (without success), I finally found a simple solution to get the WPSM54G&nbsp;print server working on Windows 7 (64 bit version in my case).&nbsp;Just download the lastest driver
 the the Lnksys site.&nbsp; After you've unzipped the download, right-click on Wizard.exe, select Properties, click on the Compatibity tab, then check the compatibilty mode checkbox and select Windows Vista (Serice Pack 2).&nbsp; When you then run the setup wizard and
 click on Set up computer, instead of getting the annoying&nbsp;"OS Not Supported" message, the driver installation completes normally and you can start printing.</p>

    <title>Windows Update keeps on bugging me&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcrane566  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update keeps on bugging me&#33;</h2>
                    When checking to see what updates are available, and deciding to install some, the updater automatically closes.&nbsp; A program should never, ever, close a window without the users consenting!&nbsp; This has been happening for ages, and it is one of the things
 with Windows that has always annoyed me!<br />
<br />
When I reopen the updater (after it automatically closes) to monitor the progress of the update(s), I use a full screen window, but when the update(s) are done and a restart is needed, the window automatically changes to a smaller windowed view.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; I was
 in a full screen view for a reason, and changing that for no apparent reason is a good way to annoy a customer, but not much else!
<br />
<br />
When I decide that I do not want to reset my computer at this time, why am I only offered the options of a 10 minute delay, a 1 hour delay or a 4 hour delay?&nbsp; If a delay is offered at all (and it should be, I agree with that!), there is no point in continually
 harassing the user periodically, when they can just delay it yet again.&nbsp; If it can be delayed at all (whether it is a good idea or not is another debate) a suggested period of delay is pointless!<br />
<br />
These things need to be addressed.&nbsp; I am sure there are registry hacks...er, modifications...that can fix these issues, but the point is that these modifications should not be necessary in the first place!<br />

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you try to update, the update window automatically closes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This may happen if there are third party programs or malicious content.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
To verify if the issue is because of third party programs or malicious content, I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b></p>
<p><span>Scan the computer to remove any possible malicious content</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the site:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data
 loss.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Clean boot</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>When the computer is started in clean boot, non Microsoft programs will not be started and any interruption
 from them would be avoided.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the site mentioned:</span></p>
<span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>:
</span><strong><span>Once you are done with clean boot, follow step 3 in the article to set your computer back to normal startup</span></strong><b><span>.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><strong><span>If in case you are connected through a wireless connection then when you start the System Configuration Utility to perform clean
 boot, click Startup &amp; Services tab one at time and ensure wireless related entry is Checked (Enabled).</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: System restore</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Refer the site:</span></p>
<p><b><span>System Restore</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/products/features/system-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/products/features/system-restore</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Note:
</b>When you perform a system restore to a previous state, the programs and updates installed thereafter will be removed.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If the issue persists or if you face any Windows issues in future, let us know and we would be glad to assist you.</span></p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows.
 You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform
 a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps. </span></p>

    <title>Win7 Task Manager showing wrong memory values in process bar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rasmus larsen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win7 Task Manager showing wrong memory values in process bar</h2>
                    I've been running Windows 7 64bit Home Premium for a good while now (2 years or so) and I haven't encountered any serious problems. But recently my taskmanager has begun showing some weird values for all processes in the list. It states that explorer.exe
 is using a maximum of 65kb, which is the highest value compared to the others except for firefox which peaks at 130kb. I've been searching all kinds of forums and haven't been able to find any answers. It's not a serious problem, but it does make it very difficult
 to know when a game or a program uses to much memory.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure exactly what specs to put up in here. But here are some of the more important ones, showing it's hopefully not my hardware.<br />
<br />
OS: Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium (6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601)<br />
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600k CPU @ 3.40GHz<br />
RAM: 8GB DDR3 (I don't recall the exact manufactorer)<br />
<br />
I hope someone can help me<br />

            <p>As Direct X 11.2 is usually included by in Windows 8.1, you are advised to confirm the version you are having before attempting to upgrade. To check Direct X version, follow the steps below:<br />
1.&nbsp;Click "Windows key" + "R" keys to open "Run" window.<br />
2.&nbsp;In the Run window, type dxdiag and hit "Enter" key.<br />
3.&nbsp;In the window that comes up, click "System" tab and check the Direct X version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the version you are having is lower than 11.2, you can upgrade the same by following the instructions mentioned on the link below:<br />

            As per the details mentioned on Microsoft website, there is no standalone update package for DirectX 11.2. You can only install this DirectX version through Windows Update in Windows 8.1. To check this and to know how to install it through Windows Update,
 you can refer to the link mentioned in the previous post.<br />
<br />
Hope this will help you.<br />

            When you upgraded to build 14915 from build 14905 it probably carried over settings from the older build. You might want to consider making an ISO from build 14915 and do a clean install to fix these issues. You do have the option by doing a clean install
 from build 14393 then upgrade to build 14915. In theory this should fix your issue. Not ideal but might be the best solution.

<p>Hi Arun210,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand the account could not sign-in Skype for Business and get the prompt "network unavailable" and the account get login after re-connect to Network for several times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please follow these steps to clean the cache for Skype for Business and verify the result:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the gear in top right-hand corner. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose File – Sign Out to log out of Skype for Business.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Sign In window, choose the link to Delete my sign-in info.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the pop-up window to forget sign in info, click Yes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the gear, choose File&gt; Exit to exit and close Skype.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the location: </p>
<p>&nbsp;C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate the sip_YourProfileName folder and delete it.
</p>
<p>Open the Tracing folder and delete all files in in it. Do not delete the Tracing folder itself.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open a command prompt (in Windows, click the Start button, type cmd and select the command prompt from the menu. Type ipconfig /flushdns and press the enter key on your keyboard to clear the DNS cache.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please provide the following information to troubleshoot:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Does this issue occur every time when sign-in the account? Please try to sign-in with your colleague's account to give it a shot. (We need to narrow down whether it is a client issue.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. A screenshot of the error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. drag down Skype for Business setting list&gt; click Help&gt; About Skype for Business&gt; provide the detailed Skype for Business version.</p>

<p>Hi Arun210,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue always occurs once in fortnightly, the DNS records should be setting properly in server. The issue would be related to the specific settings on the PC. Please check the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Turn off firewall if you have any firewall set up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Close anti-virus software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Change the network.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 System reset stuck</h2>
                    <p>Since I got windows 10 last year I have had a lot of problems with blue screens. Lately It was starting to happen on a daily basis, so I tried a system reset. In about an hour it got to&nbsp; hundred percent then went to this screen:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3fe311c5-f43a-4824-bde1-7f4185506453" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3fe311c5-f43a-4824-bde1-7f4185506453" /></a></p>
<p>It's been stuck like this overnight. The only clue&nbsp;I have is that a system scan performed recently revealed some corrupt files, that couldn't be fixed. Once I can get this to load, I'm might be going back to windows 7, windows&nbsp;10 does this practically monthly.</p>

<h2>            Blu-Ray App</h2>
                    
<p>I can't get a blu ray to play on my xbox one.</p>

<p>It shows the loading screen then goes blank, and stays that way.</p>
<p>My controller then becomes unresponsive, but I can use smart glass to move to another app.</p>
<p>I have already tried a different Blu Ray movie, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, hard reset the xbox, as well as taking BD Live off and clearing storage.</p>

<p>Any other ideas?</p>
