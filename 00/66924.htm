<h2>            How do I change the drive letter of the boot drive of an installation&#63;</h2>
                    <b>From:</b> <strong>Unique Display Name<br />
<br />
</strong>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Given an internal drive with multiple Windows Vista installations how do I change the drive letter of the boot drive of an installation?</p>
<p>Best explained with an example. Given:</p>
<p>Partition 1: Windows Vista 1</p>
<p>Partition 2: Windows Vista 2</p>
<p>Partition 3: Windows Vista 3</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I boot into Windows Vista 1 I get:</p>
<p>Partition 1 (running) = C:</p>
<p>Partition 2 = D:</p>
<p>Paritition 3 = E:</p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>The problem arises when I boot into Windows Vista 2 (or 3, or...). In that case the drive letters are "mangled" like so:</p>
<p>Partition 1 = D:</p>
<p>Partition 2 (running) = C:</p>
<p>Partition 3 = E:</p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, Windows Vista seems to insist on the currently running system living on C: (like in the olden days). I thought since W2K Windows can be installed on any drive e.g. my old system has W98 on
 C: (no choice there) but W2K boots from and stays on D:.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, in the above example, what I really want when I boot into 'Windows Vista 2" is this:</p>
<p>Partition 1 = C:</p>
<p>Partition 2 (running) = D:</p>
<p>Partition 3 = E:</p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can this be done?</p>
<p>If yes, how?</p>
<p>Thanks muchly in advance.</p>

I don't believe that you can just change the drive letter of the system drive.&nbsp; There could be way too many registry changes needed.&nbsp; Why do you feel you need to make this change?&nbsp; Each of your OSs will function fine the way they are set up.&nbsp; In a multiboot
 configuration I name the partitions according to the OS so that I have no trouble knowing which partition is which OS.&nbsp; When I am testing on my test box, Windows Explorer will show that C: is named "VUx64 (C:)", D: might be "VHPx86 (D:)" and so on.<br />

<br />
<br />
<p>When you install Windows Vista by booting with the dvd Setup will enumerate drives based on the BIOS ordering.&nbsp; When you start Setup from within existing Windows Setup will use the lettering already in place
 on the existing Windows.</p>
<p>When I set a purely Windows Vista multiboot box I start with the x64 version by booting with the dvd.&nbsp; Then I start the x86 Setup from the x64 desktop so that the second Windows Vista will use the same drive
 letters as seen from the x64 edition.&nbsp; The reason I start with x64, of course, is that while x86 Setup will run in an x64 desktop, x64 Setup cannot run in the x86 desktop.&nbsp; So I start with x64.<br />

    <title>How do you RESET THE ZOOM level to its normal default value. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do you RESET THE ZOOM level to its normal default value.</h2>
                    <p>Yes, I am still using WLM 2012 for reasons I won't bother getting in to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is that occasionally I get an email that when I use the mouse wheel to vertically scroll down the email. I end up zooming the email image in the WLM Reading Pane. Wouldn't be so bad except apparently the Zoom level is also affected in my other
 emails and I often don't remember what/where it was when I started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, I have found out that if I hold down the CTRL-key and rotate the mouse wheel, the image in the Reading Pane can be zoomed in or out - but this is happening without me holding down the CTRL-key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I can find now way to reset the Zoom level back to a normal default level, back to the way it was before I messed the zoom level up -- how do I do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Is there even a normal or default Zoom level (like the Normal, 100% value on IE11) on WLM or do I just have to keep adjusting it all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driving me crazy.</p>

<p>TO EVERYONE, ANYONE -- I AM SO VERY, VERY, SORRY, SORRY, SORRY - for maybe taking up everyone's time with this post (problem, I thought).</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, here are the new details of where (I think) I went wrong (if anyone is interested in reading them) -- I am doing this for my benefit as for maybe yours/others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, I have an old email address that I have used for probably 20+ years. &nbsp;I got a "gmail" address, at my son's insistence (also insisted I use Chrome at the same time). &nbsp;Anyway, I did this, got familiar with it (Chrome &amp; gmail) and switched all of my important
 email over to the gmail address, and left all of my old email, mostly junk now, on my old email address. &nbsp;This turned out to be a very good strategy and I would highly recommend this approach (doesn't "have to" be gmail) because I almost never get any junk
 mail at my new gmail address -- whereas all of the email I don't really care about (advertisements from target, staples, office max, newegg, nytimes, home depot, nero, universal ink, pizza hut, etc., etc., etc. plus the pure junk stuff comes into my old email
 address -- remember, this is a 20+ year-old email address).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use WLM with the old email address -- and WLM puts a lot of the pure junk mail in my junk folder, but for some reason, WLM doesn't allow you to delete the mail in the junk folder (not pertinent) -- so I just move it to my Inbox and then go through it.
 &nbsp;I used to click on every email, view it in the reader pane (until it got marked "read", as opposed to unread) and then I delete it (looking for the occasional email that is not junk).</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, I got tired after months, actually years of doing that -- so I don't view the individual emails any more, I just hold the CTRL key down and down-arrow through the list, looking only at the subject line (YES, NOW YOU CAN SEE MY ERROR). &nbsp;I would occasionally
 see a subject line that was somewhat interesting and use my mouse wheel to scroll down the email -- and yes, that is when/where I encountered the unintended zoom I was complaining about, because I had my finger on the CTRL key. &nbsp;AFTER VERY MUCH THOUGHT, I
 am now convinced that this is what I was doing -- because it only happened when I was spacing down my list of junk mail -- and it has only been happening recently (last few months) because it was only in the last few months that I was spacing down through
 my junk list in order to do a batch-like delete on the whole list of junk mail (between 10-15 junk-mails daily). &nbsp;And I couldn't reproduce it because when it happened, I removed my finger from the CTRL key, again not realizing that I was doing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So anyway, I apologize again for my ignorance, swearing up-and-down that it was a "funny" email, which now I have convinced myself that I was causing the problem myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not as an excuse, but I still think my original question is still somewhat valid -- which was, "is there any way to reset the WLM zoom level to a normal or default value".</p>
<p>
</p><p>iFiredog, thanks for your detailed attention to my post. &nbsp;When you gave me the detailed description of "maybe a fix", I got to thinking that this is not really worth it (since I had convinced myself I could recognize the "funny" email) and the more I thought
 about it, the more I convinced myself that this could not really be happening (the problem as I described) -- which enabled me to see what was truly happening. &nbsp;They say confession is good for the soul, and I am sorry my confession is so long, so verbose (I
 like that word) -- but I feel better for getting this off of my chest. &nbsp;But I do feel better for not blaming WLM for the problem, just for the lack of a fix for people like me that occasionally have one of those senior moments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, THANKS TO ALL -- lets close this out.</p>

<p>The situation I am complaining about ONLY HAPPENDS ON THIS ONE PARTICULAR EMAIL, nowhere else.</p>

<p>Then it's fairly clear that the source of the fault is to be found in the construction of the email. Is this by any chance a fancy newsletter, probably designed by a wiz-kid web dev who uses all sorts of new features just because he can? Windows Live Mail
 uses Internet Explorer to render HTML, and not all of the latest bells and whistles of HTML are implemented. Even fewer are available to Windows Live Mail, which normally operates in IE7 mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may find that a little registry addition will help with this problem, in case the HTML includes features only available in versions of IE greater than 7:<br />

<h2>            Vista Snipping Tool SUPER SLOW opening</h2>
                    
<p>I have Vista Home Premium OS.&nbsp;&nbsp; The snipping tool is SUPER SLOW to open.&nbsp; This is my 2nd computer with the tool... the other one was faster and opened quickly. This one Takes 60-65 seconds to Open no matter which program I am trying to snip from.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time it happened, I clicked the icon again thinking, I missed-clicked.&nbsp; After it still did not open, I went to click again and realized I could not see my cursor.&nbsp; I thought I had moved it out of view.&nbsp; Does not seem to be the case because as soon
 as the tool opens, the cursor is visible.</p>
<p>Also, when it opens, it is not the dialog box that comes up, it is the grayed selection screen with the X cursor ready to snip.&nbsp; It opens without me having to select new, and rectangle, etc.&nbsp; Since it is functional, I can live with the slowness, but it is
 very annoying.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

Suggestion :<br />
<br />
Logon to your admin account &gt; create another account with the same account type as the one you are having problem with Snipping Tool.<br />
Logon to the new account. Does Snipping Tool still very slow opening up ?

Run a system file check. See if it can find any corrupted files and be able to repair them.<br />
<br />
<div>Start button &gt; search box type <strong>cmd</strong> &gt; look up, RIGHT click on<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>cmd.exe</strong></span> &gt; click<strong>Run As Administrator</strong> &gt; in that black and white cmd window, type at the flashing
 prompt<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> &gt; press <strong>ENTER</strong> key.<br />
Note : there is a <strong>Space</strong> between "sfc" and "/".<br />
Sit back and wait. It will take some time.<br />
When done, exit cmd window.<br />
Reboot ( re-start your computer )</div>

            There's no option for this.&nbsp; The only available recourse right now is to use something else (for example, use whatever email program you used before you got Windows 10.... or you could use your email from their website like gmail.com for example).

                    Windows Update no longer has the Microsoft Office update option on Windows 7 Update settings page. How can I get this back which was there before July 12 round of Updates.

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your question regarding the update, you don't have to worry because if ever there is a latest update. Everything is actually included. We don't exactly have any idea what updates are you pertaining. But you can check this link:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3173835/july-12--2016--update-for-office" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
July 12, 2016 update for Office</a>. It contains a lot of Office update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll look forward to your response.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<div>
<p>If you mean you are missing these check boxes in Windows Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6f8c226b-d09a-4b21-9d42-e83af145d31c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6f8c226b-d09a-4b21-9d42-e83af145d31c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think once you uncheck those boxes on purpose or accidentally it is a trick to get them back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is one suggestion that is the easiest that works for some folks... </p>
<p>
</p><p>In Internet Explorer click Tools, Compatibility View settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/08ea4699-c04c-4e1c-bdc9-42e9b8c6568f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/08ea4699-c04c-4e1c-bdc9-42e9b8c6568f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose to add microsoft.com to the list:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/142c4322-fae2-4e8c-878d-8b1c0a9e8772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/142c4322-fae2-4e8c-878d-8b1c0a9e8772" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click the Close button to save the settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e16f8ed5-2789-47a4-9ecb-71eb65a0ff22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e16f8ed5-2789-47a4-9ecb-71eb65a0ff22" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your system then go back into Internet Explorer, Compatibility View settings to be sure the changes "stick" and then check your Check Windows Update now and see how things look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work here is another way that should work:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Office 2007 but these instructions should be about the same for your version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First make a manual System Restore point because you need to make a registry adjustment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If adjusting the registry makes you nervous I'll post up a registry import that will do the work for you (a bit later).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then close all Office applications - Word, Excel, Outlook, etc. &nbsp;Close them all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb to open the Registry editor like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4a65d4f5-8eb9-4534-9ac1-4b8793ac9d21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4a65d4f5-8eb9-4534-9ac1-4b8793ac9d21" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>With the registry editor open navigate to this location:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Common\General</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55f1b6e3-73f2-443f-a21f-60049d0a2e87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55f1b6e3-73f2-443f-a21f-60049d0a2e87" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Double click to open the ShowOptIn value and change it from a 1 to a zero, click OK to save the changes and close the registry editor.&nbsp; That adjustment will fool Windows Update into thinking Office has just been installed for the first time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That means that the next time you open an Office application (like Word) you will be asked if you want to get Office Updates through Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open Word I now see a screen like this and I'm going to click the Next button:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc0e333f-6c36-429d-aa0a-23be905cbd2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc0e333f-6c36-429d-aa0a-23be905cbd2f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>On the next screen I will choose to download updates from Microsoft Update and click Finish.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6e3c937-e09b-494d-8035-57ab5180fc25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6e3c937-e09b-494d-8035-57ab5180fc25" /></a></p>
<p>Now check your Windows Update Settings.</p>

            Hi Paul,<br />
<br />
<br />
You can manually install the update you're missing for <strong>Microsoft Offic</strong>e by checking what's missing from
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4033107/july-2017-updates-for-microsoft-office" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>here</strong></a>.<br />
<br />
You can also make sure that your <strong>Microsoft Office</strong> is up-to-date by checking the latest updates
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Oh, by the way, may we know what <strong>Office</strong> version are you using?<br />
<br />
Update us on the result.<br />

there are two Firefox instances running:<br />
one has two windows and the other has seven windows.<br />
the instance with two windows was started first, and it is on top.<br />
the second instance with seven windows is below.<br />
the window "makecontext getcontext ..." was the 1st window started in the 1st instance, on top, the window "Grand Rapids ..." was the 2nd window started in that instance, below it.<br />
the window "RACE AND REASON ..." was the 1st window started in the 2nd instance, shown highest,<br />
the window "Hacker News ..." was the 2nd window started of that instance, below it.<br />

<h2>            Computer shuts all the way down in &#34;sleep&#34; mode</h2>
                    I have been experiencing an issue were my computer turns all the way off when I turn it into the sleep mode, tap the power button, or close the lid. All my power settings are set properly on sleep and I have sorted through all the advanced settings to
 check that everything is correct and it seems to be. I have also run the trouble shooter with no luck. &nbsp;I have seen some other people experiencing this problem but it seems like the solution is not very clear and for some, it has miraculously disappeared.
 However, I am yet to be able to fix the problem.

            I have tried both of these solutions and the problem is still concurring. I believe it is a problem in the computers definition of "Sleep Mode". So if there is a way I can see what the computer is deciding to do for the sleep mode that would be great.
 I have also tried to find if there are any applications that are interfering and so far I have been drawing blanks.

            I also have a similar problem. When I sigh into the main user account, the screen turns black but then it lets me sign into the other (not main) user account. What do I do. I feel like by downloading Windows 10 I broke my computer considering this happened
 right after downloading Windows 10

            I a new account and tried closing the lid and the problem still occurred. I also made sure that there wasn't any interference from any programs. If it helps I have an Asus ROG laptop if that helps.

 this, it has done this thing where it shuts down instead of sleeping. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
I just now did a clean install of windows 10, but the problem remains. I am thinking that something is wrong deep in the bios settings. Of course Microsoft hasn't been very helpful except to say run the power troubleshooter and Asus wants me to send the laptop
 in so they can just replace the hardware. This sucks eggs.</p>

<p>This roughly happens maybe recently. Last time when I click sleep from Start Menu, the laptop sleeps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect cumulative updates are the culprit, but I couldn't pin point which one because they failed to uninstall and revert to the state before I install the cumulative updates. Furthermore, I don't even know what is inside the update since it is cumulative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power settings does not do much. All my settings seems to be in order and the way I set it (like do nothing when the laptop lid is close).</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From the description of this issue, it seems that you are having issues when you try to access the Photo, Skydrive, and Calendar app as it returns to the Start screen when you
<div>click on these apps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to gather some information on this issue:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) What is the exact error message that you get when you try to access these apps from the start
<div>screen?<br />
2) Have you enabled any proxy Internet connection on the computer?<br />
3) Is there any security software installed on the computer?<br />
4) Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since, this is an issue with Windows 8 apps, letâ€™s try running the app troubleshooter and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can try the methods:</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can follow up with the steps in response to this issue:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Run the App Troubleshooter</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note: </strong>The troubleshooter automatically fixes some issues that might prevent your apps from running, including suboptimal screen resolution and incorrect security or account settings.<br />
<br />
<div><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>Please follow the link below check further if the troubleshooter does not work:</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>â€œ<strong>What to do if you have problems with an app</strong>:â€<br />
<br />
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to disable any proxy connection if enabled on the computer.</div>
<div>You may follow the steps to do so:</div>
<div>a) Open <strong>Internet Explorer </strong>on the desktop.<br />
b) Click on <strong>Tools </strong>icon option on the top right corner.<br />
c) Select <strong>Internet Option </strong>from the list.<br />
d) Click on <strong>Connection</strong> tab.<br />
e) Click on <strong>LAN Settings</strong>.<br />
f) Uncheck the box which says â€œ<strong>Use a Proxy Server for your LAN"</strong>.<br />
g) Click on<strong> OK</strong>.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to temporarily disable security software and check it helps to resolve this issue.</div>
<div><strong>Important Note: </strong>Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div><strong>Method 4:</strong></div>
<div>If the issue still occurs, then I would suggest you to perform clean boot on the computer and check if the any other application running on the computer leads to this issue.</div>
<div>Refer to the link to place the computer in clean boot and check for the issue:</div>

<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
<div><strong>Note: </strong>Perform <strong>Step 3 </strong>to boot the computer into normal mode after troubleshooting.</div>
<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In case of the issue where you get memory.dmp error message, I would suggest you to send us the dump files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can refer to the link to send us the files:</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a>

<h2>            Windows &#43; D Acting Weird on Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I press windows + d on my new PC it triggers some wierd "macro mode" where the keys lose their typing function and instead pressing keys triggers random windows stuff around the computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, pressing F will open up the feedback menu instead of actually typing the key F.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that fixes it is slamming down on my keyboard and its getting annoying to do it everyday lol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Let's see if we can fix this by resetting your keyboard.
<br />It's basically toggling between two keyboard languages to reset your English one.
<br />
<br />Click start and go to Settings - Time and Language - Region and Language
<br />Click to add a language, doesn't matter which one.
<br />
<br />Once that has installed then set the other language as your default.
<br />Then click your main language English i am assuming and set it as default.
<br />
<br />See if that works.

            Hi  Gorilla, it sounds like your Windows Key is getting stuck when you press it . . .
<br />
<br />Try pressing the Windows key repeatedly on its own after a restart, does it open and close the Start menu repeatedly, if not it is getting jammed . . .

    <title>Why does my computer want to Save images by Default as th.jpg&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my computer want to Save images by Default as th.jpg&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 all currently updated along with IE-11. Whenever I go to a page of images on IE and then right click on any of them and pick SAVE PICTURE AS, it quite often wants to name it by Default as th.jpg. But sometimes it names it whatever they'd
 apparently named it on their end. JPG is the format that I prefer, although I'm sure that is just determined by whatever format their image was stored as somewhere. But why the file name 'th'?</p>
<p>Is this set somewhere that I've never heard of? This happens to me on a regular basis from a wide variety of sites that I want to grab an image off of to post on Facebook or to play with by editing in my old Paint Shop Pro v6.01. Help please?</p>

            <p>Why th.jpg? Because you're trying to save thumbnails from Bing which names them all th.jpg, simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you hover over any thumbnail Bing shows you a tooltip that says you can click to View source image. So view the actual source image from the originating site and then save it and your browser's Save dialog will duly display whatever the original file
 name is.</p>

<span>Hi <span>RickL123,</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What is the exact error message you receive?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Disconnect all the

    <title>Windows 10 Turn Off Password Protected Sharing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wayne jones &#40;wjones&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Turn Off Password Protected Sharing</h2>
                    <p>We are looking for a way to turn off password protected sharing either programmatically or through some type of scripting (cmd, powershell, etc.) for Windows 10 1607.&nbsp; It is the option in Advanced Sharing Settings (All Networks) in Network and Sharing Center.&nbsp;
 We can obviously change the option using the radio button but we have not been able to determine what setting(s) are being changed under the hood. Is it possible to set Turn off password protected sharing without using the user interface? Does Microsoft lock
 out this from being changed except through the UI?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found suggestions for the following and I have tried all and nothing seems to turn off password protected sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA\everyoneIncludesAnonymous set to 1</p>
<p>HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters\restrictnullsessaccess set to 0</p>
<p>Set Guest account to active.</p>
<p>Set blank password for Guest account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Wayne</p>

            I agree the best solution is to hook the PC directly up to the TV but if that's not possible you can look into this new technology.

    <title>Windows 7 NEEDS High Contrast aero Theme. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 NEEDS High Contrast aero Theme.</h2>
                    Hi, Windows 7 has a very good screen magnifier.<br />
<br />
But it only works when Aero is enabled and there is no high contrast themes in aero.<br />
<br />
This is BADLY needed. A high contrast black AND a high contrast white theme would make windows 7 complete for visually impaired people who need to use a screen magnifier.<br />
<br />
Please create this much needed feature. <br />

            I agree, the Aero themes in Win 7 all seem blury at best to me (especially the taskar appearance) . I dont have this problem with Vista on the same machine.

            I agree as well.&nbsp; I find myself using high contrast quite often, it just makes things on screen much easier to read.&nbsp; I would like to have an Aero theme with dark window backgrounds and the like on the title bar. almost like an "Aero Black" with dark colored
 File menu and the like. I did a concept screenshot over at DevianArt. just for a proof of concept.

            ISTM that Aero and high-contrast are mutually exclusive.&nbsp; If you need high contrast, then dump aero.&nbsp; That will save you a lot of cpu cycles as well.

            If you want to have a better color contrast using Aero theme, you can try this:<br />
<br />
Right click on the desktop &gt; <strong>Personalize</strong> &gt; <strong>Window Color</strong> :<br />
<ul>
<li>You may want to disable <strong>transparency</strong> , </li><li>Choose some other <strong>color of borders</strong> and make them more <strong>
intensity</strong> , </li><li>Open Advanced appearance settings... and change color for concrete things </li></ul>
You can also disable some effects, like shadow: Right click on computer &gt; <strong>
Properties</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced system settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong> tab &gt;
<strong>settings...</strong> for <strong>Performance</strong> section &gt; disable what you want to make content more accessible.<br />
<br />
Almost everything (without few advanced settings) above keeps Aero theme enable so you can still use a screen magnifier.<br />
<br />
But.. if you want to disable Aero Theme and use High Contrast Theme, you may try different thing to make content more accessible:<br />
<br />
Right click on the desktop &gt; Screen resolution &gt; Make text and other items larger or smaller &gt; ...<br />

            I've played with it a lot.&nbsp; For me it's not that anything is blurry, it's the fact that staring at a white background with black text; even with the brightness and contrast adjusted, is much harder on the eyes than say a black background with a solid bright
 text.&nbsp; If i disable Aero, i will lose all of my Aero Desktop Effects which i find astonishingly helpful.&nbsp; Those features alone were why i bought this operating system to begin with if i didnt want the Aero Desktop effects i would still be using windows 2000.&nbsp;
 There are some VisualStyles out on DeviantArt that are spot on with what i would like to see be an option for a DARK AERO theme.<br />
<br />
If only there was a way to install the theme without having to patch explorer.exe and a few other small DLL's.<br />

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I do not know if you found a good aero theme. But I had partially the same problem, so I looked to fix it. I created myself for my own use an Aero theme. I published it online, along with a change log and comparative screenshots with the default Aero theme.
 If you want it, you can give it a try. You can find it on my blog:</p>
<p>Accesible Aero theme for Windows 7</p>
<p>If you have suggestions or questions, do not hesitate to ask</p>

<p>Windows 7 <span>introduced a fantastic magnifier glass, but it working only with Aero theme! If you set Windows theme with the standard Hight Contrast themes the magnifier glass is the old version that is used on Windows Xp! For this reason is necessary
 to develop an Aero theme in Hight Contrast with a black background and white text!!!!</span></p>

            <p>About the Windows 7 Magnifier.&nbsp; IMHO it sucks.&nbsp; I use the SimpleMagnifier by Fossoft (I have Beta 3) and it does magic that I have not seen on other magnifiers.
</p>
<p>As many people have today I have dual monitors. I can run Excel or Word on one monitor and the second monitor gives me a 2X (or whatever) view of the 1st monitor.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The dual monitor action means I can use the enlarged version on monitor #2 as if it is the real thing !

<h2>            Unable to open any programs or take ownership of any files after upgrading to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 8.1 upgrade caused me to lose ownership </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded to Windows 8.1 for some stupid reason, and now I can't run any programs or make any changes to my computer. I'm still listed as an administrator, but can't do anything an administrator is supposed to do (I can't even run a cmd prompt
 as an administrator). I see I am not the owner of any of my files and folders anymore, but when I try to change the owner, I get 'Can't open access control editor. Access is denied'. I even tried resetting, but I get an 'Error while resetting'. I do not have
 any OS media, as Windows 8 came pre-installed on my machine. I am so frustrated I can't stand it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried safe mode, and while I can run some programs while there and get into the administrator level cmd prompt, I still can't make any changes.</p>

            I will try the steps I can, but I have run SFC and it says it found problems but was unable to fix them, and when I click on New Account to try and make a new user account nothing happens (either in regular or safe mode). Same as when I try to open my
 own user account, or do anything in control panel.<br />

            I'm about ready to throw out this expensive paperweight and get a Mac. I still can't run anything in normal mode, SFC finds errors but can't fix them, I cannot make a new user account (when I click add account nothing opens), I can only change ownership of folders through the elevated command prompt from safe mode one at a time using the takeown command (and it doesn't seem to help anything anyway). Why the **** would Microsoft put out an update that was just going to ruin my machine? I've been a month without my computer, and I just want to cry with frustration, and no one can help me.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated on the status of the issue. I apologizes for the late response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like the current user admin profile is corrupted. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 1:</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>Let's try creating a new administrator account within the Built-in admin account and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to run the command from an elevated command prompt. Follow the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press the <strong>Windows key</strong> to get into the modern interface if you are not already there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. Enter <strong>cmd</strong> and right-click on the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> result that should appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. This opens a list of options at the bottom. Select <strong>Run as administrator</strong> there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>d. <strong>Accept</strong> the UAC prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>e. Enter the following command to enable the hidden administrator account:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>net user administrator /active:yes</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Disable the account by running the following command after troubleshooting the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>net user administrator /active:no</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>f. Once you have enabled the Built-in admin account, please restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>g. After restarting the computer, please try to login to the Built-in admin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you do not find the Built-in admin account in the login screen, you may reply back with the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to successfully login to Built-in admin, try to create another new Administrator user account and check if it helps.</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for keeping us updated on the status of the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer these questions for a better understanding of the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Do you have a Windows 8 installation or recovery disk with you? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to boot the computer to its Start screen, then you will have to use the Windows 8 installation or recovery disc to perform an
<strong><em>Automatic Repair</em></strong> or a <strong><em>System Restore</em></strong> by booting the computer from the disc. If you do not have one, then you can create it and then boot the computer from it to perform an
<strong><em>Automatic Repair</em></strong> of Windows 8. To create a Windows 8 installation media, you may refer to the article given below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em>Create installation media for Windows 8.1</em></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After creating the disc, boot the computer from the disc and then try the following method to perform an Automatic Repair of Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Perform an Automatic Repair of Windows 8 using the installation media.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Contact the computer manufacturer to know on how to change the boot order of the computer. You will have to change the boot device to CD/DVD drive and then boot from the Windows 8 installation disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) In the â€œ<strong><em>Windows Setup</em></strong>â€ dialog box that appears, set the Time and currency format, Keyboard or input method and the language to install and then click â€œ<strong><em>Next</em></strong>â€.</p>
<p>
</p><p>c) Click on â€œ<strong><em>Repair your computer</em></strong>â€ from the lower left corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>d) From the â€œ<strong><em>Choose an option screen</em></strong>â€, click on â€œ<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>â€.</p>
<p>
</p><p>e) Click â€œ<strong><em>Advanced Options</em></strong>â€ in the â€œ<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>â€ screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>f) In the â€œ<strong><em>Advanced Options</em></strong>â€ screen, click â€œ<strong><em>Automatic Repair</em></strong>â€.</p>
<p>
</p><p>g) Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the <strong><em>Automatic Repair</em></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, try booting the computer. If the <strong><em>Automatic Repair </em></strong>does not help, then try performing a System Restore from the â€œ<strong><em>Advanced Options</em></strong>â€ and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Perform a System restore and check.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To perform a System Restore, follow these instructions and check:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Contact the computer manufacturer to know on how to change the boot order of the computer. You will have to change the boot device to CD/DVD drive and then boot from the Windows 8 installation disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) In the â€œ<strong><em>Windows Setup</em></strong>â€ dialog box that appears, set the Time and currency format, Keyboard or input method and the language to install and then click â€œ<strong><em>Next</em></strong>â€.</p>

<p>
</p><p>d) From the â€œ<strong><em>Choose an option screen</em></strong>â€, click on â€œ<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>â€.</p>
<p>
</p><p>e) Click â€œ<strong><em>Advanced Options</em></strong>â€ in the â€œ<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>â€ screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>f) In the â€œ<strong><em>Advanced Options</em></strong>â€ screen, select â€œ<strong><em>System Restore</em></strong>â€.</p>
<p>
</p><p>g) Follow the on screen instructions to restore the computer to an earlier state when the computer was working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance with Windows related issues, weâ€™ll be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you may need to do is purchase the disks needed to restore your machine to Factory...</p>
<p>Does Dell provide a key at boot to do this from the hard drive ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you did the upgrade to 8.1, did you switch from a Local Account to a Microsoft Account ?</p>
<p>If so, this may be what is preventing your ability to change ownership...</p>
<p>It is my understanding that this is restricted with a Microsoft Account...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had taken ownership of the entire C:\ drive on my machine. After Upgrading to Win 8.1 most of that got changed, and I had to do it over again... I am using a Local Account though, and no issues.</p>

                    <span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have bought a Time Capsule (AppleÂ´s integrated wifi router and hard drive). My Vista laptop can connect to the network, but it can not get internet access or access to the network hard drive. I have a mix of different devices connecting to the router without
 problems, only the Vista PC gives me a hard time. The laptop is 18 month old HP with Vista and SP1.</p>
<p>If I leave the network open (no encryption) the Vista PC connects fine - both to internet and hard drive. I have tried to setup the network with the different encryption, WPA2,WPA,WEP, etc. The one thing that works is no encryption, which obviously not is
 a solution. If I wire the network connection, the Vista PC also works fine, but that neither a solution for me.</p>
<p>In various Apple forum this issue is known and discussed, but without anyone could come up with a solution, so hopefully a post here can help me, so I can get my last computer up on my network.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Many Apple routers and Vista/Win7 have this issue. Two things you can try is upgrade the firmware of<br />
the router and update your Network (NIC and WiFi) drivers on the computer.<br />
<br />
Good luck.

<h2>            Glitch in party chat where it won&#39;t let me talk</h2>
                    <p>Hey,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was talking to my friends on Xbox party chat randomly it wouldn't let me talk for some reason. Here are some things I did to try to fix this but did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I tried hard resetting the Xbox: Failure</p>
<p>- I tried using a different mic: Failure</p>
<p>- I tried using a different controller: Failure</p>
<p>- I changed my controller batteries: Failure</p>
<p>- I went to the audio setting and tried to unmute myself, plus I checked if I was muted from my icon in the party chat: Failure</p>
<p>- I waited 3 days to see if something will fix itself: Failure</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone, please help. From the results it is not my mic or controllers fault, it is something wrong with the Xbox&nbsp;party chat itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OneDrive is not a "2nd place".&nbsp; The reason the two files were named the same is because they truly are exactly the one same single file.&nbsp; If you delete it, you are deleting the only copy that exists, not some extra copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would get the files out of your Recycle Bin.&nbsp; You can also go to OneDrive.com and look at the Recycle Bin there too.</p>

<h3> pinkeye4life  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One cache issue</h2>
                    
<p>Will Microsoft be fixing the cache issue (having to unplug/plug system to get game to start) with an update in the near future? Or am I stuck with this issue? This seems to be very common. It's very annoying having to turn off your system, unplug/plug, turn
 back on, in order to play a game, and it happens quite often.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When end will this issue be fixed with an update? Is it even possible to fix this specific console/hardware/cache issue with an update?</p>

<p>by doing a reset helps ironing out issues what where in an update for example when I had my 360 if there was issues with the dashboard or the avatar characters had missing items by doing a simple task to re download the update to reinstall it to that console
 to iron this issue out but the XB1 has not got this facility so reset is the only option it is my opinion it work alright for me.

<p>Unless you really want to redownload all of your items, I would not suggest doing a factory reset, as there is no proof that is actually helps anything.</p>
<p>The rumor is that there is a cache issue, but that hasn't been confirmed at all. No one really knows what exactly is causing the problems.</p>
<p>A quicker fix to your problem than doing a hard reset (pressing the power button for 5-10 seconds, waiting until you hear a click, and then waiting for the power brick turns amber before turning it back on), is to highlight the app/game that is causing you
 trouble, press the start button, then select quit. This works 99% of the time for me.</p>

<p>Yeah I'm not doing the factory reset because pretty much everything I've read indicates it doesn't fix the issue.</p>
<p>Assuming it is a "cache issue" (whether that entails a memory leak or RAM overload or what), can that be fixed with an update?
</p>
<p>Or would it require new physical hardware? </p>
<p>Just wanna know if I have a faulty console or if it can be fixed with an update?</p>
<p>Reading some articles and it seems like the Window 8 OS is prone to memory leaks.</p>
<p>Basically I just want to know if I need a new system or if this can/will be fixed with an eventual system update?</p>

<p>The OS is Win 8.</p>
<p>Why would the software be faulty on some people's xbox ones but not others? Or the issues are of varying degrees?</p>
<p>Wouldn't the software be standard and uniform, the code the same on all consoles?</p>

<p>The OS is a modified version of Windows 8. Heavily modified.</p>
<p>The code/software is the same across all the consoles.</p>
<p>The Xbox, and most large software systems, are extremely complex. The software isn't "faulty," but there could be certain operations that cause problems. The issues are of varying degrees, definitely, and that is why there isn't just a clean fix. For a completely
 theoretical example, there might be a resource not being freed up when going into the friends app, or a process that keeps running when you open up the store, so people using those apps/services will have problems, while other people won't.</p>

    <title>I GET AN ERROR AFTER EVERY UPDATE&#47;MAINTENANCE OF the GAME, CABAL - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I GET AN ERROR AFTER EVERY UPDATE&#47;MAINTENANCE OF the GAME, CABAL ONLINE. ERROR MSG&#58; 16 BIT SUBSYSTEM ERROR&#58; THE NTVDM CPU has encountered an illegal instruction. Close to terminate the program. </h2>
                    I GET AN ERROR AFTER EVERY UPDATE/MAINTENANCE OF the GAME, CABAL ONLINE. ERROR MSG: 16 BIT SUBSYSTEM ERROR: "THE NTVDM CPU has encountered an illegal instruction. Close to terminate the program." The file that maybe corrupted is either the update.exe of
 the game or the command.com in windows under system32. This happened before and the only thing that i did to get the game back is to do a system recovery (which im not gona do again). I want to know how to prevent the "update.exe" or the command.com from being
 corrupted every update of the game. I tried contacting the game manufacturer but they dont seem to reply immidiately. and their forums are not as helpful as i thought it would be. PLEASE HELP ME!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The message you are getting means that there are some corrupt system files that were not able to be fixed.&nbsp; If you look in the
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">CBS.log file</a> it should tell you which files.&nbsp; At that point you can attempt to replace the corrupted files.&nbsp; However since this seems to happen whenever you update this one game then you will need to contact
 their support for assistance as this may be a known issue for them.&nbsp;
