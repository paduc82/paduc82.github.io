<h2>            Restoring thousands of messages takes time.</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Great service, I will however just be using it for messages. Everything else is handled by exchange and other stuff (Syncing sms's with exchange would be super awesome :D). I do write a lot of messages, and I've found these faults:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Restoring does not bring messages in the right order. </li><li>Restoring takes time. A lot of time. <br />
Through activesync (Ie. using a broadband connection), it takes around 2-3 seconds per message. With the 2200 I have in archives, that's 4400-6600 seconds, or 2-3 hours. However, syncing the messages to the cloud takes only a matter of minutes.
</li></ul>
Bulk restoring could be great :).<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Mike

            Hi Michael Bisbjerg,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft My Phone!<br />
<br />
One new feature of Exchange 14 is that you can sync your txt messages with your inbox account.&nbsp; However, there currently are not a lot of deployed E14 servers running in the wild.&nbsp; Fortunately that's where My Phone comes to play&nbsp; :)<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to hear that restoring messages takes a long time.&nbsp; I've noticed this too while working on the product in the past.&nbsp; Normally synchronizing many txt msgs OTA (over the air) seems to take forever and a day.&nbsp; I've noticed if I have wifi enabled and
 turned on, this task goes by much quicker.&nbsp; Can you verify that you're trying to synchronize your txt msgs while your phone is physically tethered (connected via a USB cable) to your computer?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Richie Weldon

    <title>Windows Defender Offline - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> codegetter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender Offline</h2>
                    <p>After navigating to the Windows Defender Offline option and depressing the button Scan Offline nothing happens. No visual response, no count down and thus no reboot. Lastly no significant entries observed using Event Viewer within the Microsoft:Windows:Widows
 Defender category.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Defender details are as follows: Anti-malware client version 4.10.14393.0, Engine Version 1.1.12902.0, Anti-virus and Anti-spyware 1.225.3897.0, Network inspection system engine version 2.1.12706.0 and Network inspection system definition version 116.22.0.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>W10 Professional Version : 10.0.14393</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question</strong><strong>:</strong> Is there a undocumented method to force Defender to perform an Offline scan that could bypass this type of issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be grateful to receive advice on how this execution&nbsp;issue can be resolved.</p>
<p>

            <p>Having read the response from Cyber_Defend_Team, my opinion is that the suggestion is a reach solution. An update would only be applicable if it included a fix for a reported issue of unable to invoke a Defender Offline scan or code that was previously&nbsp;preventing
 the feature from being executed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition Windows 10 installs released updates automatically with the only requirement to&nbsp;initiate a restart&nbsp;at a convenient time by the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The work around I have used since was to download Defender Offline as a bootable cd and execute it to receive confirmation that no know rootkits have been installed. The outcome was reassuring and excluding zero day rootkits and other malware, Defender is
 effective in protecting W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately activation of the Scan Offline button still does not initiate a restart.</p>

    <title>Outlook Password window disappears - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amyhyde  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Password window disappears</h2>
                    <p>We have several users who are experiencing the disappearing password/credentials window.&nbsp; The system needs the password to be entered.&nbsp; Click on the "Need Password" option (ribbon or task bar) and Outlook very briefly launches a pop-up window which would
 normally allow the credentials input, but it disappears.&nbsp; Can't alt+tab to it.&nbsp; It's not there.&nbsp;&nbsp; We're current Office365 Outlook 2016 users, updates current, dual authentication active for the company.&nbsp; I would think this would be a credentials manager issue.&nbsp;
 System restart seems to fix it.&nbsp; But because it's happening across the company, I'm wondering if there's a known issue out there.
</p>
<p>

<p>Amy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try setting the registry key mentioned in this post and see if it mitigates it,&nbsp;<a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/264636-general/suggestions/32694751-outlook-is-not-syncing-and-giving-a-need-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/264636-general/suggestions/32694751-outlook-is-not-syncing-and-giving-a-need-password</a>.&nbsp;
 We were seeing some internal Microsoft people running into a related issue and the workaround is the registry key.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the registry key to disable ADAL on WAM forces Office to use its built in implementation of Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) instead of using ADAL on WAM.&nbsp; I would use the reg key to test and confirm if this is the issue or not.&nbsp; Longer
 term after the fix comes out you should remove the registry key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I am tracking for this is a Windows 10 bug and is scheduled to be fixed in the Windows 10 updates the 4th Tuesday of January 2018. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Registry key:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Identity] "DisableADALatopWAMOverride"=dword:00000001"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This KB is also somewhat related,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4025962/you-can-t-sign-in-after-you-update-to-office-2016-build-16-0-7967-or-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4025962/you-can-t-sign-in-after-you-update-to-office-2016-build-16-0-7967-or-a</a>.

            <p>Same for me. I tried moving the notebook to a different folder on same Onedrive account. Also tried Onenote 2013 and the Windows 10 version of Onenote. I imported about 12 different notebooks and all the others were successful.
<br />
</p>
<p>Also, going to Onenote and finding the notebook then "Open in Onenote" give same result. Opening from synced Onedrive folder doesn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been going on for me since just after the import tool was made available, so for a few months.</p>

            <p>With help from Office365 support, I was able to get this resolved.</p>
<p>The short cause was there was a bad page on the import.&nbsp; Once that page was removed things flowed much smoother.&nbsp; However actually getting access to manage and modify the OneNote files is a process I'll leave to you and Office365 support.&nbsp; What a mess.</p>

            I will try Method 1, pursuant to your suggestion. The problem seems to be isolated to just
<u>Yahoo mail</u>. I contacted Yahoo when I first began having the problem and they also suggested what you did in Method 2. Unfortunately that did not resolve the issue. Yahoo suggested I download and use Google Chrome and then contact Microsoft to let them
 know about the issues I'm having with Internet Explorer.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I eventually ended up turning Internet Explorer off because It was causing other problems with other password pop ups.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your reply.</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What exactly are you referring to "problems with other password pop ups"?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Meanwhile you may also try the steps given in the following link to see if it works:</div>

<p>Greetings. As Palcouk mentioned, the product key is created when you purchase the Office product, and it cannot be viewed in Office for security reasons, if you need download Office with product key,
 you can select to download with your Microsoft account.</p>

            <p>You&nbsp;should be able to&nbsp;install it as a secondary OS if you create a partition especially for it. Then while you install it you will have to choose that partition as the install partition and let windows install it on there. Otherwise you can just install
 it on an external hard drive by having the hard drive plugged in while installing w10 and choosing that hard drive as the install place.

            Hi McMahon505
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Most likely, you have got a custom format applied on those problematic cells.
<br />Can you right click on one of the problem cells &gt; Format &gt; Format Cells and see what is the format applied? If you have any, you need to clear the format. 
<br />
<br />You can also post the screenshot of this format cells here.

    <title>MP3 player supporting pause&#47;resume - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sillybgoat  say:</h3>
<h2>            MP3 player supporting pause&#47;resume</h2>
                    I listen to Audio Books, and with tracks 60mins long I need to be able to pause the song, and resume listening hours or days later. I have the N73 and with the nokia music player if I pause the audio and exit (with exit button or the red hang-up button)
 when I go back into the player I have to fast forward back to the place I was.<br />
<br />
I can leave the player running in the background while the audio is going, but if you pause and get out the same way it actually closes the app.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions of software that may support this?

            I believe there are third party apps that allow you to bookmark.<br />
<br />
Try researching LGJukebox or CorePlayer to see if they have these features.<br />
<br />
Go to Handago.com or other symbian or S60 software retailers and see what other players are available.

            Hello! I found a workaround here:<br />
/discussions/board/message?board.id=smartphones&amp;message.id=88560&amp;query.id=253182#M88560<br />
<br />
Find the track/album you want, click options, then song details, then set Library to podcast.<br />
<br />
Confirmed working on an N78.<br />
<br />
It's baffling that the music player doesn't have this option as a default for all songs. The cheapest, crappiest mp3-players all support it so why shouldn't the nseries have it? Truly strange.

    <title>Microsoft Excel has stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Excel has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>I purchased Microsoft Office when I bought this laptop about 10 mths ago. Up to and including 6/5/17, I was able to use Excel. &nbsp;But when trying to access EXCEL yesterday morning (6/6/17), an error message stating: Microsoft (Outlook, Excel, Word) has stopped
 working. &nbsp; However, Microsoft Word is working again. &nbsp;But EXCEL is NOT. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to open Excel, in the last dialog box states 'A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. &nbsp;Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available'. &nbsp;'Close program.' &nbsp;But nothing happens or no notification as to
 why it shuts down. I currently have TREND MICRO antivirus installed onto this computer and had no problems with this software. &nbsp;My Microsoft Office subscription is still current so don't understand why EXCEL stopped working. &nbsp;I can't be without this program
 as I use it during the course of my business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

            the short answer is it should not use so much battery try a soft reset turn your phone on then press and hold the volume down and power buttons until it vibrates then release them and it will restart dont touch the screen until it restarts let us know
 how you go or if you need more help rgds Roy

<p>Hello shelleykj,</p>
<p>Below is a link where someone is providing a guide for MSVC (Microsoft Voice Command) and although it is not specially for your phone, this guide is written so good that it nearly covers all HTC phones. Only difference is that your phone has more of everything
 hardware related (except for hardware buttons maybe) ;)</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=434977&amp;highlight=Definitive+Guide+Microsoft+Voice+Command+(MSVC)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=434977&amp;highlight=Definitive+Guide+Microsoft+Voice+Command+(MSVC)</a></p>
<p>Within this forum you can search for your phone specifically. I suggest you do that. BTW this site needs free registration if you want to download games / utilities / applications or if you want to post a question..&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have fun,</p>

</p><p>We are currently using Skype for Business 2016 (16.0.4288.1000 32-bit) and are facing the same issue, but since it is no Office 2013, the KB is not applicable and I did not find any comparable KB for Office 2016.</p>

            <p>The account itself is fine - it's not doing it with every single mailing - just selected ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I send tests from another account (gmail for example) they show straight away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However emails I send test emails to the account from an email marketing tool we use at my work, they are delayed by nearly 24 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not happen with other ESPs so I'd like to know why outlook.com is delaying them.</p>

            Try examining the headers to see where the delay is occurring.&nbsp; Each Received header contains a time stamp and you should be able to see where the delay occurs by looking at the stamps.&nbsp; In Outlook.com, select the message, then click the ellipsis at the
 right end of the menu bar and choose View message source.&nbsp; Look for the lines shat start with "Received:".&nbsp; The headers are presented with the oldest on the bottom.

<p>However it did not show in the inbox until 2 days later (also shown in the header).

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the delay in response. Im am glad to be able to assist you with your concern with your emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that there seems to be a delay when you send an email from your work email to your Outlook account. You have isolated that this doesn't happen with other Email Service providers. The delay seems to be on the outgoing server of your domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please contact your domain administrator regarding this as there might be something wrong with their outgoing servers that is causing this delays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Audrey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same emails that we're sending are arriving in Gmail and Yahoo inboxes instantly so I can't see that it would be our outgoing servers. Unfortunately it does seem to appear to me that the issue is at the Hotmail side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The headers do showreceived times that match our send times (or rather a couple of minutes after the send time) - but then arrival times are much later - in some cases over 48 hours. Doesn't this suggest a delay in them being processed through the servers
 at your side?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>If you say so.&nbsp; I can certainly consider mass mailing spam even if you don't.&nbsp; What made me suspicious is the abbreviation "mkt" (marketing?) and the use of a number in the domain.&nbsp; The use of a number in the domain, instead of a&nbsp;something that more resembles
 a meaningful name,&nbsp;appears, whether true or not, to be an attempt to hide detail, but since there are multiple domains in the form "mktXXXX.com" hosted by your ISP Silverpop, perhaps that's just how they assign names and I am jumping to unwarranted conclusions.</p>

                    <p>Hello there, I have a problem with the feedback app.&nbsp; It seems that the feedback app does not work as it should in windows 10 build 10240.&nbsp; I have tested it on two computers which has windows 10 home edition and windows 10 insider preview build 10240.&nbsp; On
 both of them the feedback app does not list the feedbacks.&nbsp; I only see blank white screen.&nbsp; My question is if I can do something to fix this problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi gbjorn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the whole app screen white?&nbsp; Or is it just the section where feedback search results are displayed?&nbsp; A screenshot of what you're seeing would be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing to check is whether you have any Filters or categories selected.&nbsp; That can cause you to simply not be getting any matches.&nbsp; I'm guessing that's not your case here though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Network connection could be another issue, but since you're posting on the forum, I assume that's not your problem either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you tell us what country you're in, we'll double check that the servers in your region are working properly.&nbsp; Also, what input and display languages are you using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Erik</p>

            <p>Thanks for the details.&nbsp; I am able to reproduce your problem by setting input language to Icelandic.&nbsp; The Feedback app is configured to return search results based on your current input language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the problem and are working on a fix now.&nbsp; It is a service side change so once we deploy you should start seeing feedback in Icelandic.&nbsp; For now, you can just change your input language to something else and see lots of existing feedback.&nbsp;
 Seems you have a good grasp on English so maybe give that a try :)</p>

    <title>Delete from server only Outlook deleted emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rosaliewilberger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delete from server only Outlook deleted emails</h2>
                    Each message in Outlook on my Mac has on the left, " a copy of this message is on the server". On the right it says, "delete from the server". &nbsp;When I select to delete from the server, it says that it will the next time that I connect. It does not delete
 the message from the server. &nbsp;When I change my settings to delete mail from the server, it deleted all of the mail on the server not just the ones that I deleted. So why does it have that option on each email in Outlook, if it does not work?

<u>on the server</u>&nbsp;and <u>delete from the server. </u>When I select to delete from server it says next time I connect, it will be deleted. &nbsp;It does not. When I went to advanced mail options and said to delete deleted mail from server, it deleted all the mail
 in my online comcast account. I went back and deselected the option.&nbsp;

                    i am hoping to obtain some assistance w.removing the 'common files' spyware on my C drive.&nbsp; I am unaware of how I obtained it but I think it came with spyware titled spyclear which I was able to remove.&nbsp; but unfort. I am unable to remove the common file
 spyware.&nbsp; when I right click on it and ask for it to be deleted, a pop up window shows that it looks like its deleted thousands of the files at the are in the common file folder but then stops and another pop up window says I do not have authority to delete.&nbsp;
 I have ran my Microsoft security as well as malware bytes but neither seems to be catching this file and I've removed all I can from my pc already. ty for anyone's assistance with this.

            I am using version 8.13.0.2. I'm on my work wifi, not sure what it falls under of the options you listed. Everything else using internet on my computer is working fine. This happens with every number I try calling. My account says it has plenty of Skype
 credit/subscriptions. I have tried restarting Skype again and restarting my computer and it is still happening.

    <title>Nokia 220 Not enough space for contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dobedo12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 220 Not enough space for contacts</h2>
                    
<p>My mother bought this phone the other day and I've been putting her contacts on it for her, but I've run out of space with a lot left still to be added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would a micro sd card expand the memory for contacts in a way that is usable on the phone? (as in not just for storage or removable purposes)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd really appreciate help on this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think you must be saving your contacts to SIM card.</p>
<p>SIM card has limited contacts storage capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to Menu&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Contacts&gt;&gt;Settings and set memory in use &nbsp;to "phone and SIM" .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This allows you to save the contacts to phone memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Nokia 220 and other Series 30+ phones have a maximum capacity of 500 contacts -&nbsp;have you reached this number?</p>
<p>It is not possible to extend the contacts capacity.&nbsp;A memory card is used for recording and sharing media files only.</p>

<p>That's that so. I've easily reached that number then.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If that really is the capacity, then I'm really annoyed over this. She had a 6230 before this which was able to store far more.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Every time I start Outlook, it asks for the Product Key</h2>
                    <p>Hello. Every time I start Outlook, it asks for the Product Key. I enter it, it turns green, it goes through the automatic activation process, it opens, then Outlook *immediately* asks for the Product key again. I type it in, it turns green, it goes through
 the automatic activation process, then it says "activated, close Office and restart."
</p>
<p>I close outlook. I open it again, and the whole thing starts over. </p>
<p>I bought the product key on a card from Bestbuy. It activated all other Office products. I paid extra for the version with all the **** on it, even though I don't use all the ****, (because Outlook used to be free and all my contacts for my old WinMo phone
 are on it.) </p>
<p>I use Excel and Word daily. Why is Outlook being difficult? And by the way, Microsoft Answers is one huge headache to use.
</p>
<p>You guys realize you're asking ME, your CUSTOMER, to bother OTHER CUSTOMERS for help with YOUR product? Imagine that at any other business...! Imagine asking another customer to refill your coffee... How messed up is that?! Sheesh, get your stuff together...
 I can't believe the ineptitude of a company that makes billions of dollars a year... Anyway, blah Thanks for your help in advance, whoever it is who will help me. I hope MS pays you for it. You sure deserve it more than they do. Brian

<p>Your issue could also happen when there is still another version/trial of Office installed on your computer. In that case, uninstall all other Office applications via the Uninstall a Program applet in Control Panel and then install Office again. If you don't

<p>Note that no Outlook settings or data is lost during a reinstall of Outlook/Office but it of course never hurts to start with a good backup. For instructions see;<br />

            <p>Depends which KeyCard&nbsp;licence you purchased, which you dont say,not all versions of Office include Outlook (except as a trial) eg Home &amp; Student.</p>
<p>Outlook has never been free, Outlook Express is a completely different program.</p>
<p>BTW You do realise that the KeyCard licence lives &amp; dies with the first PC its installed on?</p>
