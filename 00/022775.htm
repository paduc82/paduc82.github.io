<h2>            Disconnecting work and personal onedrive&#47;onenote accounts when signing in to desktop one note apps at each location.</h2>
                    I have 2 onedrive/onenote accounts: 1 linked to my personal email address and 1 to my work email address.&nbsp; Yet, when I sign in using my work email on the onenote desktop app on my work PC, my personal folders are also showing and vice versa at home.&nbsp; I'd
 like to be able to sign in to onenote desk top app, using work email address on work PC and only have work folders show and vice versa with personal email address at home PC.&nbsp;

<p><span><span>Hi Sarah,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks for your updates.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you see the notebooks in the Recent list(File&gt;Open)? Some showed files may just be the left cache in OneNote 2016 if you have removed the
 account. If yes, you can right-click on the notebook&gt;Remove from list to show the notebooks you want and then restart OneNote 2016 to see the result.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6599b72d-911f-41a1-8a70-4e4ec34f3d4e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6599b72d-911f-41a1-8a70-4e4ec34f3d4e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span><span>Meanwhile, go to Account and check if there are the personal OneDrive service and the business OneDrive service. If yes, remove the personal
 OneDrive service and then you can click on Switch account if you log into OneNote 2016 with the personal account in advance. If you go to the personal OneDrive online, you should only see the notebooks in the personal OneDrive online in OneNote 2016. If you
 want to show notebooks in the business OneDrive directly after you open the notebooks from the business OneDrive online next time, you may need to click on Switch account in advance before you close OneNote 2016 the previous time. If you don’t do that, OneNote
 2016 will remember the personal account you logged in and show personal OneDrive’s notebooks in the Recent list. In this situation, you may need to click on Switch account again to show the business OneDrive’s notebooks in OneNote 2016.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25771783-bc05-4efd-b252-fc57b935bf51?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25771783-bc05-4efd-b252-fc57b935bf51?upload=true" /></a></p>

                    <p>Outlook .exe corrupted.&nbsp; I managed to get it started and used the 'detect and repair' function. &nbsp;I Unfortunately I asked it to restore factory defaults instead of keeping my existing folders.&nbsp; I lost my address book, calendar and all the emails I need to

            <p><span>Hi AllenLyne,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>No need to worry, I will help you in recovering the lost Outlook data.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The emails, contacts and calendar information will be stored in the Outlook PST file. You may check if the PST file is still present on the computer.
 If yes, you can open the PST file in Outlook to view all this information. 
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re unable to locate the PST file, you may refer the section ‘How to find a .pst file’ in the article mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/287070" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/287070</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once the PST file is located, refer the link on how to open it in Outlook.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/open-a-data-file-HP005243221.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/open-a-data-file-HP005243221.aspx</a></span></p>

<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know if you need anything else. We’ll be happy to help.

            <div>Thanks for the help, Anook.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can find the .pst file okay, but it&nbsp;is the current file and not the lost data.&nbsp; I don't understand the info on the link:

<li>On the <b>File</b> menu, point to <b>Open</b>, and then click
<b>Outlook Data File</b>.</li><li>Click the .pst file you want to open, and then click <b>OK</b>. </li></ol>
<p>I do this, but something different to what is&nbsp;below happens and I don't get the plus sign, the&nbsp;folder list or anything else I can use.</p>
<p>The name of the folder associated with the data file appears in the 
Folder List<span><span> (Folder List: Displays
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>the folders available in your mailbox. To view subfolders, click the plus sign (+) next to the folder.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;If

<h2>            error code 30145-13 occured after Office &#34;updated&#34;</h2>
                    <p>On Sunday, when I tried to open WORD 2013 in the afternoon (after successfully using it all morning) I was told that the program didn't exist. I finally found a website that told me how to repair this (though, for some reason it wanted my activation code
 after I repaired it?). Thankfully, I didn't need to find the code, because I bought the computer with the program pre-installed.</p>
<p>10 minutes ago, Office said it had to update. Then it told me there was an error while updating. Now I cannot open Office (again!) All I get is the above error code. Oh, and for some reason, it seems to think I'm currently offline, and thus cannot use the
 online repair (which explains how I'm using the SAME computer to email you).</p>
<p>Help please, I need this computer for school work!</p>

            <p>Here's the situation . . . I can't give you the exact wording on either message. I can tell you that when I tried the offline repair, it always told me that I had no internet connection, and to re-try when I was connected, and that if I felt there was an
 error, it gave me the option to"click here;" however, nothing ever happened.</p>
<p>I tried the offline and online repairs half-a-dozen times each, and clicked on the WORD icon several times (which only told me that an error had occurred while trying to access the program, and to look for help online). This option eventually lead me to
 the help forum where I posted the problem.</p>
<p>Anyway, after going through all of this, Office is *temporarily* operating again. I say *temporarily* because if you look at my post above, you will see that it had stopped and started working again all of the sudden. Stay posted for the news.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>This wiki has a couple of possible fixes for the other error message:</p>
<div>
<strong>************** Optional Reading *************</strong><br />
<strong>Office 365/2013 Code 0-# and Code 300##-##</strong>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/wiki/office_365hp-office_install/office-3652013-code-0-and-code-300/f5e9749f-6806-46cf-9eda-e25ec4890bcb?tm=1395588672506">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/wiki/office_365hp-office_install/office-3652013-code-0-and-code-300/f5e9749f-6806-46cf-9eda-e25ec4890bcb?tm=1395588672506</a>
</p>
<p><span>Part of the design of the “new and improved” &lt;heavy sarcasm&gt; Office 365/2013 is that to be more “user friendly”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It does make sense since most users are not technically inclined (no surprise) so they don’t want to deal with technical issues.<span>&nbsp;
</span>MS took a few approaches to this “user friendliness”:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>1 - the “Click-to-Run” (CTR) “virtual computer” installation</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>2 - new Code 0-# and Code 300##-## error messages</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>3 - almost completely eliminating access to the local install version Office 2013</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>#1 CTR takes much of the control of the Office installation out of the user’s hands. You no longer have to worry about Windows Updates, MS does them for you.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But it also means that when something goes wrong there is very little you can do in the way of trouble shooting. You are almost entirely limited to uninstall / re-install. But some of the errors are happening outside of Office, in Windows itself.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>#2 The new error messages were made “less technical” to be less intimidating to users.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So the first thing they did was become “polite” saying “Something went wrong” and / or “Sorry there was a problem”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Polite is “nice”, but worse than useless when trying to trouble shoot. Especially when that is all the user reports. They (“you”) usually forget report the “rest” of the text message. The unique, IMPORTANT, part.</span></p>
<p><span>As well, when Office 365/2013 was first released the error messages did NOT display the error codes (for the first year or so).<span>&nbsp;
</span>It has only been recently that MS turned on displaying of those codes. This is great for trouble shooters since we can now distinguish between the various “Something went wrong” messages which may have different causes and fixes.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, MS did not bother to make available documentation for these new error codes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So, for now at least, all we can do is collect answers from the forum identifying things that have worked for others. Some of the fixes are just “voodoo”, they are not really a fix, but coincidentally trigger the real fix in the background.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I recently talked to a MS Development Manager. He is trying to find “official” publicly accessible documentation of the new error codes, ie KB articles. We can only hope for documentation.
</span></p>

<h2>            Strange arrow instead of a paragraph mark</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently stumbled upon a strange thing in Word. After one of the updates - can't recall which one - my paragraph marks suddenly appear as left-pointing arrows, not unlike those indicating a soft return. However, as you can see, these are not completely
 the same. Anyone else encountered this? Or more important, does anyone know how to change it back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on my MacBook Air. My iMac at home which had the exact same updates, is still showing the paragraph marks correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This shows the current situation on my MacBook:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/32a5f775-106f-4215-a0dc-cb38a0275db9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/32a5f775-106f-4215-a0dc-cb38a0275db9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see there are two different arrows. The smaller ones are soft returns (shift-enter), The larger ones have replaced my paragraph marks (plain enter).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference, here is a picture of a paragraph mark in Word. This is from a Windows version, the ones on the Mac are blue, just as the arrows above.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/723c02fa-d8fa-4823-a572-a1aece720bc3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/723c02fa-d8fa-4823-a572-a1aece720bc3" /></a></p>

            <p>This&nbsp; a known issue that is the result of having selected one of several Languages/Keyboard Input Methods in System Preferences. To restore the standard ¶ you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quit Word
<ol>
<li>Go to System Preferences - Language &amp; Region
<ul>
<li>Remove any East Asian languages from the list</li></ul>
</li><li>Go to System Preferences - Keyboard - Input Sources
<ul>
<li>Remove any East Asian languages from the list</li></ul>
</li></ol>
</li><li>The ¶ should be restored when you next launch Word</li></ul>
<p>It has been brought to the attention of Microsoft. As yet, though, there has not been any fix issued. You can add to the demand by using the ☺︎ at the right end of the Word Ribbon to submit your feedback.</p>

                    <p>I get notifications from a forum. I have added the forum admin email to my "Not Junk" list so many times, selecting various options "All emails from this domain" and "all emails from this sender" - or whatever the options are. I cannot remember right now.
 Either way&lt; I have tried everything to set this same email address to not be classed as junk email, and yet every time I get an email from this same address it ends up in the junk folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what I need to do? </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that yet again, a perfectly functioning piece of basic functionality has been broken by the teams working on the latest versions of MS products. Bring back the old stuff, it worked!&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Daniel,<br />
thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>Both the domain and the specific email address is saved in the safe senders list.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an avast anti virus add in for Outlook. This was disablied for a long time due to it being a known hindrance when starting Outlook. It was enabled again at some point, but to test this, I have now disabled the add-in once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are the safe mode start up options really needed for this? The safe sender email list is a simple list that Outlook should just check and make a simple email filtering decision based on that list.
<br />
It seems rather over the top, extremely long winded to enable each add-n in outlook one at a time, and then wait for an email from the forum admin - I have 15 add-ins, although most are not enabled. Presumably you mean that I only need to do this for the Active
 add-ins that I routinely have enabled, and not the disabled ones, right ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am happy to do the clean boot, but perhaps you can clarify how you think a third party s/w or service could interfere with MS Outlook's mail filtering process- surely this entire process needs to be isolated and secured so that it is not open to interference
 from external software? If that is the case, then it sounds like there is a rather large hole in Outlook's security and code execution. Is this really a valid approach?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll see how I get on with the virus add in turned off to begin with. Please do let me know the answer to my questoins though: To summarise:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1: Presumably you mean that I only need to do this for the Active add-ins that I routinely have enabled, and not the disabled ones, right ?</p>
<p>2: clean boot: mail filtering process- surely this entire process needs to be isolated and secured so that it is not open to interference from external software? Is this really a valid approach?</p>
<p><br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
Thank you for replying.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
1) Yes, safe mode is to verify if the issue due to Active add-ins. <br />
<br />
2) Some 3rd party programs&nbsp;or its components might still be running in the background even they are disabled. Hence, Clean boot is to ensure that the issue is not due to its conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you
 install a program or an update or when you run a program.<br />
<br />
If issue still occurs,&nbsp;create&nbsp;a new profile following instructions mentioned in the article below, setup the email account, add the specific sender's email address/domain to Safe Senders list and verify if the emails are still received/moved to Junk mail folder.

            <p>Update. Ok, I am clean boot mode presently, with outlook running in safe mode and still the emails from this particular address are going into my junk mail.</p>
<p>I recreated my profile in February and the problem with the junk mail filtering was present before recreating my profile and remained after recreating my profile. There appears to be something more fundamental with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the previous issue - </p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-outlook/outlook-2013-not-responding-and-taking-an/023130c5-2383-4722-87a4-278b2e700f34</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, I recreated my profile during that issue, back&nbsp;in February. Are you saying I should do it again? Even though the incorrect junk mail problem was present before and after that point? personally I think that is a not the best course of action.
 To be honest, as a time served IT professional I did not believe that the safe mode or clean boot would help either, but being as you asked me to do it, I thought I would.</p>
<p><br />
Perhaps now we can proceed to more advanced troubleshooting?</p>
<p>

            <p>Two weeks and told to go elsewhere? You seem to understand exactly how to infuriate your customers in the most effective way possible.
</p>
<p>There is nothing about this approach that is considered "best practice" or good support. I have ran a number of support departments at software vendors and if any of my staff were taking this approach they would be "re-trained" the first time, and disciplined
 if it continued. This is a perfect example of how not to do support in the 21st century.

</p><p>Why don't you do something pro-active instead of wasting more of my time, and get someone who knows the answer to comment in this thread? That would be helpful do you think? Or maybe ask your colleages and then even you could try writing up the answer? No?
 Too much effort? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, if I treated my customers in this manner I would not be able to look at myself in the mirror and respect myself in any professional capacity.

    <title>Outlook 2010 Contacts Organization and Importing from Thunderbird - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 Contacts Organization and Importing from Thunderbird</h2>
                    <p>Edited &nbsp;on&nbsp; 12-12-12</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am porting from Win XP Pro SP3 and Thunderbird, to Win 7 Ult 64-bit Office 2010 Pro 32-bit on a new computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 3 weeks of beating my head against a brick wall and three blood transfusions, I could not find anywhere a decent overall explanation about how Outlook deals with contacts. Now that I have mostly figured it out, I have taken great care and many revisions
 in writing the following to help other users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Outlook 2010 Navigation Pane Configure Buttons I added FolderList.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Outlook 2010,&nbsp;I set up 3 separate pst data files, each&nbsp;with separate email accounts, one for me personally, and the other two for two separate businesses.&nbsp; They are in My Documents\Archives\Outlook Files. All three show up in Outlook, all three show suggested
 contacts in FolderList view.&nbsp; I now see that Contacts is stored in the default pst file, which is the personal file,&nbsp;and no contacts are stored in the two business files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All email is working properly in and out and the separate suggested contacts in each&nbsp;collect email addresses sent and received&nbsp;from/in each that are not in contacts.&nbsp; I tested all that before I added any contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the XP T-Bird, I had set up five Address Books in the T-Bird Address Book.&nbsp; Three Align with the 3 Outlook PST data files, and a fourth one is the T-Bird default Collected Address that functions globally to pick up addresses that are not assigned to any
 other T-Bird&nbsp;Address Book, similar to the Outlook Suggested Contacts, only globally. The fifth in T-Bird I call Holding, which is explained in the next paragraph.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In T-Bird there is a security feature that stops loading material from a site into the email. A link is provided in the popup that allows you to add the email&nbsp;address to any one of the address books, which then allows the web site material to load, or not
 depending on your selection.&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: an online order confirmation&nbsp;I don't want polluting my contacts nor the Collected Address, which I go through periodically and distribute accordingly, then I save it in Holding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In FolderLinks view, I was able to create new folders under Suggested Contacts for the Contacts I want to save for the two companies. I created a Personal folder under Contacts, not Suggested Contacts, for the Personal Contacts I want to save. I created
 a Holding folder under Contacts for the Holding Contacts I described above. I created a temporary "Need to Sort" folder under Contacts to import the T-Bird Collected Addresses to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I exported from&nbsp;the T-Bird Address Book&nbsp;each of the five&nbsp;individual T-Bird Address Books separately to csv files. In Excel, I&nbsp;cleaned them up and reworded the headings to match Outlook.&nbsp;(Mapping function&nbsp;in Outlook isn't very good) &nbsp;To get the Outlook headings
 I made one new contact in Outlook and exported it to a csv file. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then one at a time, I imported each T-Bird csv file directly into their associated&nbsp;Outlook Contacts folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For my use, and curiousity, I moved the folder My Documents\Archives\Outlook Files so Outlook could not see it, and copied one of the two company pst files into My Documents\Outlook Files, which is the default location for Outlook Files. I opened Outlook
 and negotiated through all of the Outllook has lost its mind popups to open the single company file.&nbsp; In it there is now a Contacts folder, which is not there originally when the personal pst was the default.&nbsp; I moved the Contacts Folder I had created under
 Suggested Contacts to under the now showing up main Contacts folder for that company.&nbsp; I closed Outlook, and moved that company folder into the relocated Outlook Files folder replacing that company pst file, adn that move emptied the default My Documents\Outlook
 Files folder.&nbsp; I did the same routine&nbsp;for the other company.&nbsp; Then I Moved the relocated Outlook Files folder back under Archives and opened outlook, which again lost its mind until it found them all under Archives\Outlook Files, and now there is a main Contacts
 folder under all three in FolderList with their respective sub folders that actually hold the contacts.&nbsp; Now when I click on Contacts in the Nav List I get all&nbsp; contact folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason to try this is I wanted to know if it would work, because a company may have to "spin off" to another computer with another user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that I have a Contacts folder in each pst file I may not have to have the contacts in the respective sub folders.&nbsp; Not sure how it all works yet, so will leave themas is for now and update this later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have corrections or suggestions to add to the description above, I will edit this to help others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whew!</p>

            <p>Not entirely certain on what the ultimate objective is&nbsp;on first read of your post so at this point, this response is primarily to clarify a few things</p>
<p>#1 - There is absolutely no requirement to have field names in your CSV file to match those of the Outlook standard field names. In fact, relying on Outlook's "auto-mapping" is a first step in creating unnecessary problems - too easy to make a mistake and
 Outlook field name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#2 - &lt;Suggested Contacts&gt; will contain the email addresses of emails that have been sent whether in the Outlook AddressBook or entered manually by typing in a value in the TO/Cc/Bcc boxes. The purpose of &lt;Suggested Contacts&gt; is for "auto-completion" of email
 addresses manually typed in the To/Cc/Bcc fields. The purpose of items contained in the SG folder is NOT to act as a contact folder</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#3 - New contacts are saved in a given based on the following rules: </p>
<p>a) if done via the "Add to contacts" to save a contact item from an email, the new contact will be saved to the default contact folder for the Outlook profile which will be located in the PST file designated as the "default" for the profile. For simplicity,
 the default contains the &lt;Inbox&gt; where your emails get saved.</p>
<p>b) if a new contact is created without a contact folder first being selected, the new item will be saved in the default contact folder as described above. If a specific contact folder is selected first, the new contact will be saved in that folder</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#4 - As mentioned already, would personally never use "Suggested Contacts" for the purposes of storing your&nbsp;primary contacts. Whether one folder should be used for all contacts or contacts should be stored in different folders depends on a number of factors
 which is outside this response. However, if you opt to combine all contacts in a single folder would strongly suggest that you add a category value to each contact so that contacts can be properly "grouped" should the need arise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#5 - Regarding the "security feature" - if you're asking is there an option not to download graphics/images etc - then the answer is yes. On the flip side, there is no function in Outlook that automatically adds new contacts
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the above - not sure the questions about "contact redistribution" are applicable since there is nothing in Outlook that automatically saves contact items as mentioned above. How you structure your Outlook data should be based on the following:</p>
<p>- keep your data in the simplest structure possible that enables you to retrieve your information quickly and easily. Too much structure can end up being as bad as having no structure at all. There is no universal rule on what that balance is when it comes
 to "structure" since what works for one person doesn't for another.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I was referring to here is the Map Custom Fields Function in Outlook 2010 is lame compared to ACT.&nbsp; I found it easier to export the headers to a csv So I could know what they ewere, and then correct the headers in the csv I imported - I didn't have
 that many fields to import.&nbsp; I will edit my post to make it clearer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another answer I found on this site said the Suggested Contacts was where outlook collected email addresses.&nbsp; Before I loaded anything into Outlook I sent test emails and the incoming email addresses&nbsp;were collected in Suggested Contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>AHH - Category value - that helps</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes - I tested it and it adds to the safe senders list in Junk Mail.</p>

<p><br />
Thanks Karl for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I copied my contacts into the Suggested Folder and if I start to type a name in the TO text box in a new email, nothing happens, but then if I click on TO the name shows up as a link.&nbsp; I click on Okay and it is now in the To text box in the new email,
 but it doesn't display like it should - it is still the underlined name, not the Email Display Name followed by the email address.&nbsp; I have contacts with the same display name but multiple email addresses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is all way too clunky.&nbsp; What am&nbsp;I missing?</p>

            I've never manually populated the Suggested Contacts folder nor do I use auto-complete as a general rule so will have to leave this latest question for someone else who is more familiar with the inner-workings of how Outlook deals with Suggested Contacts.

            <p>Well I have now spent enough time with Outlook and have not been able to import my emails via Outlook Express from .eml files I created from Thunderbird, not have I been able to set up auto completion despite all the instructions to use NK2View.&nbsp; Further,
 I just found out that Outlook does not automatically save contacts information from new senders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though Outlook has many good features, these killl it for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going back to Thunderbird.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like the double click in Windows Exporer folder tree to expand the sub folders and the jumpy tree as you navigate, I gave up and purchased xplorer2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least I now know quite a lot about Outlook 2010 so I can answer questions asked of me.</p>

<h2>            Font changes to New Courier when I copy&#47;paste in Word</h2>
                    <p>I have Microsoft Office 2016 and am working on a long document&nbsp;with the dotm&nbsp;file extension.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Times New Roman throughout the document and have set it as the default in:</p>
<p><em>Font -&gt; Set as default -&gt; All documents based on the Normal.dotm template -&gt; OK</em>.</p>
<p>Under <em>Options -&gt; Advanced</em>, "Pasting within the same document" is set as: "Keep source formatting"<br />
Yet, lately, when I copy/paste within the same document, the pasted text comes out in New Courier (which I never use).<br />
This is becoming increasingly annoying, as I do a lot of copy/pasting.&nbsp;Why does my font change? Is there anything I can do to stop this happening?&nbsp;I know I can right click and select "Keep text only", but I'm used to pasting with "Ctrl V", which is much quicker.<br />
</p>

<p>Hi Lucie, <br />
<br />
Word is very consistent in its paste behavior. However, what you get with this depends very much on how the text is formatted.
<br />
<br />
Try clicking in the source text and pressing Shift+F1 to reveal the formatting. Check the box at the bottom to show Style source.
<br />
<br />
Compare that to the text at the destination. My guess is that there is direct formatting in the destination.

<p>I understand your trouble on receiving your emails. However, I'm confused on what you mean on "only receive the inbox mail and not my other email address". Can you please clarify if you have different accounts on your mobile and the issue only occurs on
 your particular email?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with the language in project online and PWA. I have changed the language settings to English, but in many places, it remains Chinese.

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per my test, the only way to replace the original PWA site is to delete the original site and create with a new PWA site with the same URL. I will show you how to do this, please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1.Go to SharePoint Admin Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.Click on the URL of the original PWA and Remove it as the following image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d76261b8-b179-40f7-ab90-bf69890725a3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d76261b8-b179-40f7-ab90-bf69890725a3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>3.<strong>Delete</strong> this site after the<span style="font-weight: bold"> Remove</span> is completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.From now, we are going to use SharePoint PowerShell to permanently delete this PWA site, otherwise we won't be able to create a new PWA site with the same URL.</p>
<p>Please refer to the following URL(Step by step):</p>

<p>
</p><p>5.After the PWA site is deleted, we can create a new PWA site in the SharePoint Admin Center.
</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note:</span> Please follow the image to fill in the
site address</span> information. And set the default language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.Add PWA to this new site. Wait for about 15 mins, and the PWA site will be settled.</p>

<p>Oh. Great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP didn't provide ANY installation disks and the only key I have is for Windows 7 Premium at the original set up of my machine (from a sticker on the underside of the laptop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, Windows 10 wouldn't update to my laptop so I was told to try a 'clean install' and seem to have lost a lot of the bundled software.&nbsp; Additionally, I've gone from a 'Premium' version of Windows to a 'Home' version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish I'd been warned about all of this 'loss'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not a happy customer thus far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for explaining though.</p>

<p>I don't suppose anyone knows what this screenshot means? &nbsp;I used the only product key I had for my entire laptop from HP and the site stated that the key is "confirmed", that Office can't be set-up "at the moment" but to "Hang on" to the key. &nbsp;I've tried
 a few times today and it won't set-up. The message seems to imply that the key is valid but just not working for some reason?&nbsp;</p>

<p>No, unfortunately, I wasn't able to get it back. &nbsp;It's very annoying as I remember opting for this laptop BECAUSE Office 2010 was included. &nbsp;My laptop came with Windows 7 Home PREMIUM and Office 2010 Starter pre-installed. &nbsp;I've lost whatever 'Premium' was
 AND my Office products. &nbsp;'Upgrading' to Windows 10 may be free but it appears to have 'cost' a lot of people an awful lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Office 2003 Basic on CD, so I've had to revert to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's so frustrating as I'd obviously paid for the Office 2010 Starter as part of my previous Windows install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently been made redundant and can't afford any of these silly monthly payment deals you now have to fork out for in order to have office. &nbsp;I want to pay for a product and own it until I decide to, or can afford to, upgrade. &nbsp;Forcing people to pay
 monthly, potentially for ever, is just so wrong. &nbsp;Because I've been made redundant I need Office more than ever for job applications, CV updating, covering letters, etc. &nbsp;I can't tell you how annoyed I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My trusty Office 2003 Basic on CD is mine for ever and I bought it in 2006. &nbsp;It may be old but it still works, as I'm sure my Office 2010 Starter would had I been supplied with a disk OR if I was warned NOT to install Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's all been a bit of a farce. &nbsp;Ho-hum. &nbsp;Living and learning.</p>

<p>Thank you for all the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on our investigation, your laptop originally came with Windows 7 Home. After the release, you upgraded your computer to Windows 10. However, you were having problems in doing an update and you were told to do a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When performing clean install, there will always be a possibility of losing some programs. To prevent this from happening, we suggest to always do a back up in another storage device. If you have already lost the programs without doing a back up, the only
 way to retrieve it is to reinstall them or use a product key to activate the software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>Your investigations are WRONG. As I stated previously and TRUTHFULLY, &nbsp;my laptop came with Windows 7 Home PREMIUM. I should know, its MY laptop, I PAID for it and all the accompanying​ software which your update has stolen from me. The specs are here:&nbsp;https://h10057.www1.hp.com/ecomcat/hpcatalog/specs/provisioner/05/XE100EA.htm</p>

<p>You did not pay for Office Starter, it was provided free, preinstalled, by some PC makers with their win systems.</p>
<p>Office Starter was never a product that was sold to a consumer.</p>
<p>To restore/recover Office Starter would require that you revert your PC to original factory settings, using your HP recovery disks or partition</p>

<p>I picked this laptop BECAUSE of the software that came with it, therefore I DID pay for Office 2010 Starter. &nbsp;I could've picked a cheaper model which didn't have said Windows 7 Home PREMIUM or Office 2010 Starter installed. &nbsp;I paid for this machine and this
 machine had that software on it. &nbsp;Now... it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want what I paid for and nobody replying in this thread has been remotely helpful. &nbsp; If you can't help, desist making unhelpful and untrue statements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've stated over and over again. &nbsp;I wasn't supplied with a disk or a key for Office 2010 Starter. &nbsp;Only Windows 7 Home PREMIUM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was advised to do a clean install as Windows 10 wasn't working. &nbsp;I did so and have lost everything I had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can keep unhelpfully repeating what you PRESUME I did or did not pay for or what you KNOW I can't do to get back what I had, over and over again, but I'll keep telling you I HAD Windows 7 Home PREMIUM and Office 2010 Starter. &nbsp;I PAID for that set up.
 &nbsp;It's all been deleted and I can't get it back due to Windows 10 install problems. &nbsp;That's that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't supplied with disks. &nbsp;My HDD was formatted for the clean install of Windows 10 (as advised). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I keep getting back in this thread is people telling me what I did or didn't have and what I did or didn't pay for. &nbsp;How useful!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing Windows 10 has LOST me software I PAID for. &nbsp;It's as simple as that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know, in other industries, as long as you have proof you bought something, they'll replace it if it breaks. &nbsp;Not so with Microsoft. &nbsp;You're screwed. &nbsp;It's bullshit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, yeah, I should've made a back up but, d'you know what, whenever Windows updated in the past I didn't lose everything. &nbsp;I foolishly thought an official product wouldn't harm or delete stuff I'd got with my previous version. &nbsp;I've learned my lesson...
 buy a Chromebook or a Mac next.</p>

            Hi Caroline
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To diagnose it further, can you login to Web Skype (only Edge/Chrome browsers) and let me know the results?

            You should chat with a live agent from Skype Support to see what is the issue with your account. (This is not a bot support but staffed by human agents)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Not all options will allow you to chat with a live agent. Select following one from the categories dropdown to get the option for chat.
<br />
<br />Payments &amp; purchases
<br />Account, profile &amp; sign-in
<br />Privacy &amp; security
<br />
<br />On the next screen, you get the Chat link which you can click.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            &nbsp;I have been using Skype for many years and have found it to be a good app until now. Your latest version for the iPhone is truly abysmal. &nbsp;My question is how do I sync Skype with my contacts without sending my contacts to Microsoft? I can't possibly see
 any reason why I would want to send my contacts to Microsoft. Skype used to work just fine why did you do this?

<h2>            Office 2016 offline installer for HUP users</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mother in law purchased Office 2016 Pro Plus in a workplace program that is identical or similar to HUP.</p>
<p>She got a key. We wanted to use the offline installer for several reasons due to her specific computer. We tried to download the installer using&nbsp;http://office.com/setup , but we get an ERR_MISSING_PARTNUMBER error every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tried the click-to-run installer and the key works, so it is not a key problem per se.<br />
</p>
<p>The error above was returned both before we used the key on the click-to-run and afterwards.</p>

            <p>Pro Plus is a volume licensed version and as such is not available on the url given or the MS Office backup site, in any case both sites use the on-line installer</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure that an offline installer has actually been released for that version</p>

<h2>            Onedrive for Business - Disk at 100&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I have come across a handful of customer (including myself at one point) who experience extreme computer lagging issues with the disk running at 100%, this is directly related the onedrive for business program in my experience. The current customer with
 this issue can resolve it by closing down onedrive for business completely, this fixes is immediately. However this customer also needs to use onedrive to access multiple synced libraries so having it closed down is not an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this issue before and any ideas for a resolution?</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p><span>So I think the better way to work around the issue is that you may <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
consider moving the OfficeFileCache folder where the syncing cache is saved (C:\users\&lt;username&gt;\appdata\local\Microsoft\office\15.0(16.0)\OfficeFileCache)to a new larger drive by

            look in the smart phones N73 N95 thread<br />
/discussions/board?board.id=smartphones<br />
and check it has the latest firmware Use Nokia software uodater ALTHOUGH I HAVE A FEELING Virgin product codes are way behind in updates<br />
try a reload same software version<br />
if none of this works then contact Virgin<br />
Just if you can solve it from here you wont be with out the phone while they have a go at it<br />
You can back up the N73 to PC suite or to Mini SD card<br />
menu / memory/ back up to card

<h2>            Bizarre diagonal lines &#39;joining up&#39; data points.</h2>
                    When creating a bar chart in Excel 2007 and adding my own custom error bars, there appears to be a diagonal link between two data points. This doesn't happen to them all just the occasional one. How can I delete these pesky lines?
<div><br />

<div>I'm using a Log 10 scale, as this is the only way to display the data bars correctly. When I switch to a normal scale, these diagonal lines&nbsp;disappear.</div>

<h2>            Screen goes blank when making or receiving calls</h2>
                    <p>I've just upgraded to the Nokia Lumia 920.&nbsp; It's only day 3 and I'm having problems making/receiving calls....&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time I call someone, or they call me, the screen goes blank, which means I can't use the touch screen (e.g. to select numbered options if I'm calling a call centre, or even to hang up when the call is finished).&nbsp; I've tried using the power on/off button
 to turn the screen back on, but it doesnt work.&nbsp; I then have to wait for the other person to hang up (not ideal if I've called my voicemail) and after about 10 seconds the screen goes live again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help please?!</p>

            <p>If you refer to a file manager; No, that will not be included in GDR2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And a file manager is not a basic function in a smartphone since probably less than 1% would use it. Many more important features have been prioritized up until this point. We'll see what happens in future updates..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure you vote for this feature over at the official user voice forum though:</p>

    <title>Outlook contacts not syncing to Outlook 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3>   say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook contacts not syncing to Outlook 365</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I have a problem with Microsoft Office Outlook 365 not syncing contacts to people.live.com. If i create new contact in people.live.com or windows metro contacts it doesn't appear in outlook 365, when I create contact in outlook 365 it doesn't appear on people.live.com
 or windows metro contacts. The problem is even deeper since office outlook 365 doesn't sync it's contacts between computers (usual PC and Surface Pro). There is topic about it on Russian boards with 3 pages: http://answers.microsoft.com/ru-ru/office/forum/office_2013_release-outlook/не/d36c3bbd-f7fd-4ce0-99c5-581e835f5f0c?page=1&amp;tm=1373476203993
 but no one from Microsoft has answered it. So is there any way to fix syncing problems? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Settings:</p>
<p>people.live.com is connected to skype</p>
<p>windows metro contacts is connected to Microsoft account (@hotmail.com) and skype</p>
<p>office outlook 365 is connected to the same mail account (@hotmail.com), same microsoft account (@hotmail.com) and same skydrive account (@hotmail.com)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Calendar and mail are syncing without problems.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Content Search Export</h2>
                    <p>Hi-</p>
<p>I just exported a SharePoint Team Site using the Security &amp; Compliance Center, and I noticed that there are no .MHT files-</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I previously did exports using the SharePoint eDiscovery Center, I would get .MHT files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These files are important as they capture the actual web pages themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known issue or limitation in Content Search/Security &amp; Compliance Center?</p>

    <title>Notification of Changes to Unshared Notes Sent to Contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jlusk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Notification of Changes to Unshared Notes Sent to Contacts</h2>
                    Several of my hotmail contacts have told me that they are receiving alerts via email that I've modified OneNote notes, even though I haven't shared these notes. &nbsp;When I click on the note and then on share, it doesn't indicate that there are any active
 "shares," and severla of the notes were personal and I wouldn't have shared them at any time. &nbsp;But because there's no active "shares" listed, I am at a loss as to how to turn off the notifications on these notes. &nbsp;If I can't resolve this, I'll have to stop
 using OneNote and migrate to one of the other, less feature rich note apps. &nbsp;Any ideas on how I can resolve the issue?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To assist you better regarding your concern with <strong>OneNote</strong> notification, we would like to know if you have shared files before and edit it recently? If yes, you may want to ask your contacts to check their
<strong>OneNote</strong> notification settings using this <strong><a href="https://www.onenote.com/?fromAR=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. The page looks like this,<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4700e976-ddef-4366-bbc3-e16e1b5e8e4d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4700e976-ddef-4366-bbc3-e16e1b5e8e4d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, ask them as well to check their <strong>OneDrive</strong> settings. Check this
<strong><a href="https://www.onenote.com/?fromAR=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to learn how to change
<strong>OneDrive</strong> notification settings.</p>

            I have shared only one notebook, but haven't edited it in about six months. &nbsp;The notebooks affected are all private and have never been shared. &nbsp;I'll ask the contacts to check their settings, but none of them are regular OneNote users, so they might not
 want to bother. &nbsp;Is there a way I can turn off these unwanted notifications?
