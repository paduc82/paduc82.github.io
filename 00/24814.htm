 find a way to do that on the WEB mail (Outlook Mail) EAS site and have also tried setting Outlook 2016&nbsp;in Archive to delete messages after 1 day in the JUNK folder but it is not working. I also tried a Registry entry to ignore the Modified date to use received
 date but that does not work. I get stuff from people not in my contacts list so that is not an option either</span>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate your earnest effort to reach out with Microsoft Community. We understand that you want to get your emails or messages in the Junk folder be automatically deleted. There are several ways to achieve what you wish to do with your Outlook email
 account settings, e.g., moving older items you want to keep in an archive. We strongly suggest that you use the AutoArchive to keep your Outlook inbox and its folders under control. You can change how often AutoArchive runs, where it stores archived items,
 and how long Outlook keeps items before archiving them by simply following the steps provided in this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Archive-older-items-automatically-25f44f07-9b80-4107-841c-41dc38296667?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;ocmsassetID=25f44f07-9b80-4107-841c-41dc38296667" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. You

            Thank you Vanessa for your response. As noted in my initial post I tried those recommendations before posting. Setting my Junk folder in Outlook to AutoArchive to one day and permanently delete does not work. That is why I asked.

<p>We understand that you already tried the <span>
recommended solution</span>. <span>
AutoArchive</span> helps manage the space in your mailbox or on the <span>
email</span> server that you are using by automatically moving items to an archive location. Though setting the Junk folder in Outlook to AutoArchive to
<strong>Permanently delete items</strong> option to one day, the option only deletes any expired items. Which means that moving your junk emails to Auto-archive will only help you place the emails to a certain aging period for it to be deleted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way to reduce the email on the server is to set your email account using POP on one device, this will work if you have a different device to use aside from the PC that you are using. POP works by contacting your email service and downloading all
 of your new messages from it. Once they are downloaded onto your PC or Mac, they are deleted from the email service. This means that after the email is downloaded, it can only be accessed using the same computer. If you try to access your email from a different
 device, the messages that have been previously downloaded won't be available to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also recommend that you create a rule. A rule is an action that Outlook 2016 or Outlook 2013 for Windows runs automatically on incoming or outgoing messages. You choose what triggers the rule as well as the actions the rule takes. By using rules, you
 can reduce manual and repetitive actions needed to manage your email messages. When you turn on
<span>the rules</span>, they run continuously and automatically. You may refer to the article below for further information.</p>

<p><span>Thanks again but as noted in my original post, I tried all that stuff already. I wrote a rule to move all incoming email with the word [SPAM] in the subject to the Archive folder. That did not work.
 I then changed it to move them to the Delete folder but that did not work so I directed them back to Archive and in Archive, I set it to permanently delete messages after one day and&nbsp;I wrote a Registry key to ignore modified date but that did not work. Creating
 a POP account defeats the purpose of reading mail and seeing folders on all my devices. I did read an obscure note someplace that Archiving and Rule Writing will not work with an&nbsp;Exchange Server and my Outlook Mail account is on&nbsp;their Exchange Active Sync
 server so maybe Archiving and rule writing is not supported? Was hoping someone in community had a working fix for dumping SPAM.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>… guess not</span></p>

<p>If all available workaround were exhausted. Each email folder has their own aging period, as explained in the earlier post, setting the Junk folder in Outlook to AutoArchive to
<strong>Permanently delete items</strong> option to one day, however, the option only deletes any expired items. Which means that moving your junk emails to Auto-archive will only help you place the emails to a certain aging period for it to be deleted, which
 is default by design. What we recommend is that you post your suggestion to <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            It makes no perceptible difference one way or the other.<br />
<br />
The battery stops charging when it is full, not after a set amount of time. Given that the amount of current being fed into the battery while it is charging is an order of magnitude greater than what the phone actually uses when it's switched on, by switching
 the phone off to charge it you're simply allowing the battery to charge maybe a minute or two faster.

<h2>            Unable to play&#47;activate preloaded songs in Nokia 5130.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Experts,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased nokia 5130 phone yesterday which comes with 60 preloaded songs. While trying to run the songs under folder 'Music' it asks to activate the ".dcx" file which dosent happens even if I try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I asked the Nokia priority shop owner he pointed that there is no SIM so that could be a reason. Even after putting the SIM I am having the same issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way I could ACTIVATE these songs, these songs seems to be locked somehow...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is highly apprecaited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Undeletable Folder in Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have this folder that I have deleted about 100 times... and every time I login it is still there. It just won't go away!
</p>
<p>How do I get rid of it for good, I'm partially amused by the fact that it's not deleting (it was a folder for a friends emails and it's become a bit of a joke, that she just won't leave) but it is also a little annoying that it won't just go away (that isn't
 saying anything about my friend, I don't want her to go away!). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas... or answers for what is happening or how to get rid of it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks muchly! </p>

    <title>Windows Mobile Device Center 6.1 won&#39;t install on Windows 7 64 Bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> foxtrot83  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Mobile Device Center 6.1 won&#39;t install on Windows 7 64 Bit SP1</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
we have some Windows CE devices (these are not mobile phones) which need Windows Mobile Device Center to synchronze some data between Windows 7 and these devices. Therefore I've downloaded the current Windows Mobile Device Center version 6.1.6965 for Windows
 Vista/7 64 Bit.<br />
<br />
Now the problems starts: The software can't be installed without connecting the Windows CE device to the computer. After the Windows CE device has been connected, it seems that the software is installed, there are shortcuts within the Start Menu, but when I
 want to open the Windows Mobile Device Center, the computer does ... nothing.<br />
<br />
Even the synchronization software of the Windows CE device tells me that the Windows Mobile Device Center is still not installed on the system. And the Windows CE device still can't be detected.<br />
<br />
I saw that lots of other people have this problem, but I didn't find any real solution for this. Are there any news for this issue?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance<br />

            Hello. What exactly are the CE devices and what version are they running? When you plugged the devices in USB, were any drivers loaded? Go to device manager on the PC, plug in the device, and look for any devices to load. Look for any issues, e.g. ! (yellow).
 Disable the firewall. On the CE devices, go to Start&gt;settings&gt;connection tab&gt;USB to PC and let me know if you have any options there and what is checked.

    <title>Nokia Standard Applications Not Running Full Screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia Standard Applications Not Running Full Screen</h2>
                    
<p>Applications launched by NOKIA on HK website, touchpiano, touchguitar and some others were working well with FW v10 and v11 but after update v20 there appears a keypad (arrow keys and some others) in almost half of the screen and the applications are not
 fully seen, its not actually possible to use the application properly. This issue was raised earlier also, but surprisingly the problem is still there with v21.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same happend if we try to play swf files / games. the application is not played full screen, killing all the fun. For some applications there is an option - 'suit settings' wherein one can switch off these controls but not with all. there's no setting
 generally in the phone to turn this feature off??</p>

                </div>

            For Flash Lite applications, the Flash Lite developer would have to change the Flash Lite source code to do:<br />
<br />
<pre>FScommand2( "DisableKeypadCompatibilityMode" );</pre>
<br />
And then rebuild the .swf file.<br />
<br />
For Java applications, the Java developer (or someone) would have to change the .jad file to have this attribute:<br />
<br />
<pre>Nokia-MIDlet-On-Screen-Keypad: no</pre>
<br />

            It sounds like those were set properly, because he didn't have the keypad before the firmware update. More likely the update borked the flash player and now it's disregarding those settings. Unless Nokia coincidentally rewrote their own flash games to
 not work properly at the same time as this guy updated his firmware.

            Indeed, it seems that on the new firmware the 5800 is set to display the keypad by default regardless of the application's stated preference. You can disable the keypad in the Application Manager settings for each application.

            This is with Outlook.com on the web, correct? 
<br />Are you still on the classic outlook.com or was your account on the new  interface? 
<br />Which browser are you using? I'm not able to reproduce the issue here - it could be specific to the browser.

<p>You're using the wrong Print. You're using the web browser's Print command. Instead, click the ellipsis (three horizontal dots) at the right end of the menu mar and choose the Print option from there.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happened on three separate emails?&nbsp;&nbsp; I used the "print" function within Outlook and not the web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using the current Outlook (I believe its the new interface) and IE browser&nbsp;&nbsp;(default).&nbsp;&nbsp;My operating system is&nbsp;Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>

            You're using the print command in the screenshot Brian posted and still get the buttons included in the printout?  
<br />
<br />Do the print and cancel buttons show in print preview? Can you post a screenshot - either from print preview or print to pdf and take a screenshot.

<h2>            Is it possible to attach one or more pdf documents to an outlook bulk mail merge</h2>
                    <p>Hi There</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to create a bulk outlook mail merge email that also includes two attached documents. I can create the document without trouble, but I can find no way to then attach a copy of the document to each merge file before sending.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found a help item that says "Run (double-click) Outlook Mail Merge Attachment.vbs" to attach documents to the mail sitting in the outbox, but I cannot find the file -- the help item appears to be for Outlook 2003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

<p>I ended up answering my own question, as I was able to find the file mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look on the University of Western Sydney site (https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/tld/home/how_to/how-to_resources/microsoft_word/email_-_mail_merge_-_with_attachment) for both the file download and instructions on how to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works well, though it is slow :-)</p>

                    <p><strong>NOT RENDERING</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an oddity when looking at my ISP's usage using IE11; if I choose the daily usage page that renders fine, as does yearly,</p>
<p>but just one for MONTHLY the image areas are blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Edge &amp; Avant browsers, the troublesome page displays just fine; I've reported anomaly to the ISP</p>
<p>but they can't replicate issue.</p>

<p>We appreciate the information you provided. Since the site isn't rendering properly, it's possible that it wasn't designed to be fully compatible with IE 11. We suggest using the Compatibility View in Internet Explorer 11 by following the steps

here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the charts are displayed properly after adding the website to the Compatibility View.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We recommend optimizing Internet&nbsp;Explorer by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click the <strong>Gear</strong> icon to open the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Click <strong>Delete Browsing History</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Check the boxes for these options: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preserve Favorites website data</strong></li><li><strong>Temporary Internet files and website files</strong></li><li><strong>Cookies and website data, and History</strong></li></ul>
<p>4. Click <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Close and relaunch Internet&nbsp;Explorer then check if the charts are displayed correctly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, we'd also like to know if the charts are displayed when using InPrivate Browsing. You can access InPrivate Browsing by pressing
<strong>Ctrl + Shift + P</strong> at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the webpage&nbsp;is displayed properly after following these steps.</p>

<p>To find out if this is caused by some browser settings that have been changed, we suggest resetting Internet Explorer. This will disable add-ons and toolbars and restore default web browser settings, privacy settings, security settings,
 advanced options, tabbed browsing settings, and pop-up settings. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Close <strong>Internet Explorer.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<strong>inetcpl.cpl</strong> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li><li>Under the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, click <strong>Reset</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Reset</strong> one more time.&nbsp;</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Close</strong>.</li><li>Restart your computer.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the webpage stays the same and still doesn't display the charts, we recommend contacting the webpage developer so that they can optimize the page to be fully compatible with IE 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't hesitate to let us know if you have any other concerns regarding Internet Explorer 11.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After resetting Internet Explorer,&nbsp;it'll behave as if you've just installed it, so it is working as expected. We will have to wait until the website developer releases a patch for better compatibility with this specific page. In the meantime, since you're
 able to see the charts in Edge, we suggest using Edge instead.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Powerpoint 2010 - table styles &#34;missing&#34;.</h2>
                    Hi.<br />
I used to have all the different "table style" colours - red, yellow, etc - in PowerPoint 2010, but recently the only colours I get are blue and greys (in various shades and strengths e.g. light, dark, best for document, etc).<br />
<br />
I tried the&nbsp; "clear table2 option under&nbsp; "table tools...design...table styles" in case I'd somehow set a table default of some form of blue, but this simply cleared all the colour from the table. The reds, greens, etc&nbsp; are still missing.
<br />
<br />
Any thoughts as to why I can't see the full range of colours? Thanks.<br />

            The table style colours depend on the theme colours in use. Maybe you have a theme where all of the colours are shades of blue / grey?<br />

    <title>Outlook.com spell check red line under every word after misspell is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nealmed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com spell check red line under every word after misspell is corrected</h2>
                    <p>For some reason the spell check while in outlook.com on Edge or IE isn't working correctly. If I misspell something and go back to correct it, and then continue typing it continues that same squiggly red line the whole length of the rest of my email with
 no misspelling. It's not he green line for context it's the red misspell line. </p>
<p>For example&nbsp;It's doing it right now, i'd love to send a screen shot. if I misspell i'm with out a capital I, or it's with out the capital I, and I backspace to fix it. as soon as I fix it and then continue on with my sentence the red squiggly line is under
 the entire sentence. So in my example here. The red line right now starts at the word IT'S right after example at the top of this paragraph and is still going to right now.&nbsp; Even after that period you just saw. if I right click on the red line anywhere I get
 three options, Select All, Paste, and Inspect Element. This is getting so obnoxious now, i'm ready to dump using outlook all together. Does anyone know how to fix this annoyance?

    <title>German language pack - Office 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tarfon  say:</h3>
<h2>            German language pack - Office 2007</h2>
                    <p>I'm a member of a seniors' German laguage class, most of whom have older computers running Office 2007 and either XP or Win7. They all need a Office 2007 German Language Pack but it seems that:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;It's no longer available for purchase, and</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;the Office 2010 Language Pack is not backward compatible&nbsp;.</p>
<p>If the&nbsp;Pack is no longer commercially available from Microsoft, would I be allowed to distribute my copy to my class memebers without incurring wrath?</p>
<p>Or is there another solution? </p>
<p>many thanks</p>
<p>Tarfon</p>

            If you have the off 2007 language pack, then I think it’s ok to lend them for a class session. Or else, the only option you have is to upgrade those machines to office 2010.

<h3> davehale145  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help is transferring previous Skype account to the new format, and change my email address since I sold the business, etc.</h2>
                    <p>Is there some one there who can help me??</p>
<p>I need help is re establishing my previous Skype account to get back my contact list and money in the account.&nbsp; The problem is the I sold my business, and thus had to change my email address.&nbsp; Also since I retired I did not use skype much and now see that
 things have changed and I can no longer access my account.&nbsp; So I need to talk with someone who can help.&nbsp; We have to find the account first.&nbsp; I no longer have my old note books with passwords, etc.&nbsp; so I cannot remember my skype password.&nbsp; I do remember several
 of the contact names however.&nbsp; So how do we establish a new SKYPE account&nbsp; and update it with the contact list and money in the account?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I realize could be a complicated task, that is why I need to talk with a live person who can make this happen.&nbsp; I was
 able to use it a few times but now I can't even find the sign in page, so I assume we have to open a new account but bring over the existing contact list and money.&nbsp; Since I cannot remember the old password and since the email listed in the old account no
 longer works, things get complicated I can understand.&nbsp; I can give you names of some of the contacts like Rob Gray,&nbsp; Darren Pearson,&nbsp; and others to help you verify the account, etc.&nbsp; After a brief retirement I am now getting active again and need to use skype
 to help with my existing contacts and friends.&nbsp; I am still using windows 7 and since I am 82 years old would rather not have to learn too many new things.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Please help me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be great to be able to talk with you on the phone instead of typing all this stuff,&nbsp; can we do that? Or do we have to talk with our fingers?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you</p>

            <p>Sorry, but the attached is not helpful at all. &nbsp;I have an HP Officejet 6500A Plus. &nbsp;For those who know this printer, they will respond correctly without providing me the basic steps as what was in the above link. &nbsp;This printer has a two sided feature. &nbsp;The
 problem I am facing is that when I click the print command, there is no place for me to chose double sided printing. &nbsp;I don't know why this happened only with certain files, but not all files. &nbsp;For some document, when I click on print, the screen on the computer
 will show the options I can click on, for example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>___ &nbsp;black and white (or pull down menu to choose color)</p>
<p>___ &nbsp;single sided (0r pull down menu to choose double sided)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is this last feature that was missing, so I cannot choose double sided. &nbsp;It did not give me any option at all. &nbsp;So I did not even know that I am printing on single sided until the entire document is printed. &nbsp;This is bad especially on long documents.
 &nbsp;What I need help is not with adjusting the paper manually, but how to navigate the print option to find out where these options are embedded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone familiar with the HP Officejet 6500A Plus can help with the navigation to find the print options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can of course do a tedious manual option like the one indicated in the above link, but this defeats the purpose as I know the printer is capable of two-sided printing. &nbsp;It is the proper set up that I need help.</p>

            I have not found anyway with the Apple drivers. Works fine with Windows, so I do my double sided printing with a win machine. I keep hoping that HP will fix the drivers, but I fear they are not the company they once were.

<p>For now, it is not feasible to change the skin color of the people. I suggest you create a new vote in

</p><p>There is a move by many companies (both tech and otherwise) to recognize and correct cultural bias.&nbsp; This seems like a question of organizational philosophy, not a "feature request."</p>
<p>
</p><p>To illustrate this concept, consider whether Microsoft would ever have all of the "flesh" colored emojis have dark black skin.&nbsp; If you can't see that happening, then question "why not?"</p>

            Well Rick, apparently it IS feasible for WhatsApp, which offers a full range of human skin colors in their emoticons. If WhatsApp can do it, why can't Microsoft?

            I don't see why this is such an issue. Emojis were never created to replicate human skin colour, hence why they are yellow. Surely by adding skin colour you complicating the issue of race and skin colour, rather than supporting the fact that everyone is
 equal - and therefore can all use the same emoji to express themselves.

1. Try to repair the Works suite from <strong>Control Panel, Programs and Features
</strong>and verify the result. </p>
<p>If you're unable to repair the Works suite, installation files might be corrupted.<br />
Do you have the&nbsp;Works suite disc? If yes, try repairing\re-installing the Works suite through disc and verify the result.<br />
If you don't have the disc,get in touch with your computer manufacturer for further assistance as the Works suite was pre-installed on yor computer.</p></span>​<br />

<h2>            recent files</h2>
                    <p>A very easy and quick question -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometime in the last two months. the recent excel files either used or saved have changed from simple numbers&nbsp; (as in 1, 2, 3, etc) to be preceded by the letter Y - as in Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I change back to plain numbers, or is this another so-called enhancement that I cannot undo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, please let me&nbsp; know where in the options (or other command) where I can change this back to just plain numbers, with no Y preceding the number of recently viewed or saved files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance to anyone who knows the answer to this question.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>John Brozowski,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you posted in programming, are you doing something like this:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub abc()<br />
Dim f As RecentFile<br />
For Each f In Application.RecentFiles<br />
&nbsp; Debug.Print f.Name<br />
Next<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what you mean by simple numbers.&nbsp; Can you give an example? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The above list just gives me the fully qualified path/name of the files in the recent files list.</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I press Alt F R&nbsp; &nbsp;(Alternate, File, recent), the recent files I have looked at show up on the screen.&nbsp; I then click on the file&nbsp; (I hate the mouse) or press the code/number for the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to about 2 months ago, all files had a code/ number.&nbsp; (1,2,3, through about 40 or 50, etc).&nbsp; So, all I had to hit was the number 1, and the file numbered one would populate on my screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the files are coded as Y1, Y2, Y3, through Y9, then the coding is YA, YB, etc.&nbsp; So, I have to press two keys to get the file populated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems minor, but I am into quick keystrokes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just curious if I can go back to just numbers instead of a letter followed by a number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I made the question clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I appreciate your response. There is a possibility that the emails got automatically deleted. Because of this, is suggest restoring the

 be able to restore the messages from your mailing list. It will also be best to remove then re-add the senders under your mailing list.</p>

Darleen Pen,</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>I appreciate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I verified the point you mentionned, but the junk mail folder is still always empty (and restoring deleted mail folder has not changed the issue for me)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand the behaviour of junk mail folder :&nbsp; i expected that junk mail should go to the junk folder by default as long as authorized list or expeditor are not provide. Shouldn't that be the case&nbsp; ? Seems it is not)</p>
<p>
<br />
</p><p>Another problem i'm facing was due to the mail server of OVH my ISP provider,&nbsp; blacklisted by Microsoft rules.</p>
<p>Now i can receive mail from the mailing list after ovh intervention as expected (and that doesn't bode well because it might happen again when operator block each-other )</p>
<p>
Thank you again for the time you spent to respond.

<p>Yes, you are correct. If the server detected that the email is a spam mail, it should go to the junk folder. Since you can now receive emails from your mailing list, try to observe if your junk folder's behavior will stay the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            View &#34;to&#34; field in Sent Box - Outlook 2007</h2>
                    <p>I am using Outlook 2007 and have tried several times to reset my "view" of the sent box to include the recipient rather than the sender (me!) and it keeps reverting back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is new, and I used to be able to see the recipient, so I don't know what has changed. How can I reset it so it won't revert?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Office and thanks for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand you would like to see the
<b>‘Recipient name’</b> in the ‘Sent Items’ folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would require few clarifications on the issue so that I can assist you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Are you referring to ‘Sent Items’ mails list view or change the ‘to’ field in the reading pane?</p>
<p>2. Is reading pane enabled in Outlook? If so is it set to ‘Right’ or ‘Bottom’?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- If you’re referring to reading pane, then it’s by design sorted as first ‘Sender’ name then ‘Sent:’ and ‘To:’ fields.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>-</b> If you’re referring to have the display in the mails list and you’re unable to sort it. Then this applies to the ‘Sent Items’ folder
 of default data file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>You may <b>reset the view</b>, by going to ‘Sent Items’ folder click on ‘View’ tab &gt; Click on ‘Current view’ and choose ’Define views’ &gt; Click
 on ‘Reset’ on the right side &gt; Apply view and click OK. Once done, sort the setting accordingly under ‘current view’ &gt; Customized current view &gt; Sort.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If the issue still persists then
<b>rename the .dat files</b> to Old.&lt;Filename&gt; from the given location below and verify the status:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
a. <b>Outcmd.dat:</b> C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user_name&gt;\ Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook</p>
<p>
<b>b. Frmcache.dat</b>:<span>&nbsp;
</span>C:\Documents and Settings\ &lt;user_name&gt;\ Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\FORMS</p>
<p>
<b>c. Extend.dat</b>: C:\Documents and Settings\ &lt;user_name&gt;\ Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook</p>
<p>
d. <b>Views.dat</b>:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>Word is putting a period when I delete text - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word is putting a period when I delete text</h2>
                    <p>Word 2010 has started putting a period in, whenever I am deleting text. &nbsp;So now I have to go back and delete the period, which I can do only with the backspace (since using "delete" places another period)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get it to stop putting that period in there? &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

            Depending on the context, what Word is inserting may not be a period, but a space - which would only appear as a period if you have the formatting display 'on'. Pressing the ¶ symbol on the Ribbon's Home tab toggles that display on/off. If the 'period'
 disappears with the formatting display toggled off, it's a space, not a period.

            I don't have the formatting display on.&nbsp; It's putting a period in, not a space.&nbsp; In fact, it is also doing that in this text box, and in my emails.
