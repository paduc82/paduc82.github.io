<h2>            Calculated text box on form</h2>
                    <p>I have a form with text boxes for a start time [dtmStartTime] and end time [dtmEndTime].&nbsp; I've created a third text box to calculate and then store the time difference between the start and end times in the field [numDuration].&nbsp; I know one wouldn't typically
 store a value which they can calculate using other stored values, but I have a database that is in a state of 'transition' as I like to call it and for a short time I need the ability to store all 3 values.&nbsp; I've tried using both the After Update and On Exit
 events of dtmEndTime, but nothing&nbsp;happens.&nbsp; The calculated text box currently has the expression:
</p>
<p>=DateDiff("n",[dtmStartTime], [dtmEndTime]/60)</p>

            I still don't see why you need to store the calculated value. But your problem is the control needs to be bound to field, not set to an expression.

            You should be asked by the installation wizard, but you don't need to uninstall prior versions.&nbsp; You can either allow the new version to uninstall the older version or install the newer version along side the older version.&nbsp; The only exception is Outlook.&nbsp;
 Only one version of Outlook can be installed and if you have one installed already, the newer version won't install.&nbsp; Of course, Office Home and Student 2010 does not have Outlook, so the older version will remain.&nbsp; However, if you do choose Home and Student
 2010, be sure to read every installation wizard screen so it does not install the Office Professional trial as well, which probably will overwrite the old version of Outlook.

            The solution that later solve this problem is when I perform a Hard Reset. Although it's very painful that I lost most of my application but now my phone is back to best and downloading successfully.

<h2>            Problem installing the Microsoft Office plus 2013 Home Use Program &#47; &#40;HUD&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm so upset with the Microsofts Office's 2013 Home Use program, thought I was getting a good deal, by upgrading to the new Microsoft Office Plus 2013 from the older Microsoft Office 2010 Home use program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when i was going through the setup i found information that stated i needed to uninstall the older version of Microsoft Office 2010 before i could install the new version so i followed the directions but i was worried that if i uninstalled the older version
 i would lose any way to recover from the uninstall and that is what happend now i dont have the older version and cannot install the new purchase version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>everytime i try and install the new purchased Microsoft Office 2013 program i get and error message
</p>
<p>"We found a pre-release or beta version of an office product on your computer and can't install because of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please Uninstall andy pre-release Office software using the Programs and Features item in your Control Panel and try installing again."
</p>
<p>There is no other version of office on this machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>after you close the message window take you fix it page to use to remove any office verion, used the microsoft fix-it tool to double check this, for Windows 7, Office 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>try and install again seem to want to install then i get another pop up window stating!</p>
<p>we're sorry, we had a problem installing your office Program(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is your internet connection working? Do you have enough free space on your computer main hard drive?</p>
<p>i know the internet connection is operational and have hundreds of GB of space on the hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone got any ideas? On how to fix this problem</p>

            First I want to thank all of you at the Microsoft Community for all the info and help in trying to get my purchased Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013, Visio Professional 2013, and Project Professional 2013, downloaded from the Microsoft Home Use
 Web Site.<br />
<br />
I tried all the fixes that were with-in my capabilities to try and get the downloads but with no luck, so i was&nbsp; forced to make contact with the Microsoft Support technicians to see if they fix the problem but they were unable to to help me with my download
 problem unless i paid them another $150 dollars they said my computer was the problem and it was why i was having problems download from the programs from the site and wanted remote access to my computer and could fix, so i under duress let them have remote
 access to my computer for two hours then finely said my computer had to many problems to fix and it would cost me another $150 dollars if i want to get the fix so i could downloads Microsoft office programs that i have already purchased, i stated that i thought
 that was very strange because i had just downloaded programs from the Adobe web sit with no problems even after i had already tried to download the programs from there site and had no problems at all no error messages like no internet connection and not enough
 drive space on a hundred plus GB hard drive how could my computer be able to do that even after tried downloading programs here at Microsoft web site if it was in such bad condition i wondered how could the error messages be true, so it must be just about
 the money, i could have my programs if i paid the money and that the only problem my computer had and then i could have my already paid for Microsoft Office program installed, so i said how do i pay the money so i can have my programs installed even so i feel
 like I'm getting ripped off!!! then the tech logged off of remote access and more or less hung up on me even when i was going to pay more money to get what i already paid for<br />
<br />
so i still don't have my programs and I'm still working on trying to get my programs from Microsoft Office home use
<br />
<br />
if they wanted more money for the programs why don't they just say it are put it in the price for the programs
<br />
<br />
so i guess i have to find out where to pay now is my problem so far <br />
<br />

            Hi Palcouk <br />
<br />
The contacts name was Rose a Tech for the "Microsoft Live Support" [scammers!] and the link was right here in the Microsoft Community in this post, if none of the fix-it worked said try visit [scam link removed by moderator] - &nbsp;the tech seem to know all about
 the issue or problems error message's said they could fix just needed remote access to my computer, ask a few question about browsers used then run some kind of test that showed some 33,000 error's then ask more questions about how my computer was running,
 i said my computer runs great load fast runs programs like Cads with no problems&nbsp; never stops or crash with 900 GB hard drive with a lot of space for downloads.<br />
<br />
i think it's the Microsoft Home Use web site that has the problem for the downloads link it's where they store the link so you can download the purchases programs they have stop support on my link to download for programs i have purchase before only one or
 two years so i cannot even reload my older Microsoft Office 2010 back on to my computer the one i had to uninstall to try and load the new one, seems when you make contact with the Microsoft support tech's two total they know all about the issues with the
 error messages then want to remote access your computer to fix the problem then say they cannot fix the problem unless you pay them another $150 dollars
<br />
<br />
I have no other problems download purchase programs or software from other web based company websites before or even after just this site and it's support personnel seem to be the problem.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; [Edited for clarity by moderator -- these scammers are NOT genuine Microsoft support staff]<br />

<p>That is <strong>NOT</strong> Microsoft's Tech Support.&nbsp; It is a website using that name and making
<strong>false claims</strong> to get access to your machine AND money to fix errors that you don't have (33,000 errors... really!&nbsp; Your machine would not be running).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have been actively <strong>SPAMMING</strong> the Forum to get Users to their site.&nbsp; (And, I might add,&nbsp;as a&nbsp;Moderator, I&nbsp;have spent more time removing those posts then helping folks!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you did in fact allow them access to your machine then I'm going to suggest you download and scan with...</p>

<p>..clean up anything it finds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you do that, please look in <strong>Programs &amp; Features</strong> and see how many and the names of any Office programs listed and post them here.</p>

<p>You have received good advice. However, Microsoft Security Essentials is a program that actively protects your computer, so only download it if you want to switch programs, or especially if you don't have any antivirus. For scanning your computer, use the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Security Scanner</a> instead. However, I do recommend that you scan your computer either way.</p>
<p><br />

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, if you are the member/ owner of an Office 365 Group, it will automatically map to Outlook client. Meanwhile, If all the mentioned Groups can be viewed on
<a href="http://outlook.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App (OWA)</a>, but you can't see them in Outlook client, which means it may be a sync issue. Please confirm if you run the Outlook in

Online Mode</a> (Turn Off the Cache Mode), if the mentioned group appears?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you are an end user, please involve your admin to run the following PowerShell cmdlets:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>To check the problematic created Office 365 Group's detailed information, please run:
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Get-UnifiedGroup -Identity "&lt;Group Name&gt;" | Format-List
</span></li><li><span>To confirm if you are the member of the problematic Office 365 Group, run:

<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
</p><p>For further help, we'd like to collect the result to check it on our side. For privacy concern, I have sent you a private message to collect the cmdlets result. Meanwhile, please tell us the detailed reproduce steps for better understand

    <title>Word 2019 won&#39;t launch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve-mack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2019 won&#39;t launch</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I would be grateful of any advise on newly purchased Office 2019 (bought downloaded yesterday). All applications bar Word appear to launch OK.&nbsp; Once or twice I have managed to launch Word in Safe mode but upon closing and re-opening it won't load again
 (either in safe mode or normal mode).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the repair process - local and on-line to no avail. I have unloaded and reloaded post full download again and it's the same. I get a Window prompting me to chooses 'safe mode' as Word 'did not start last time' which I select and then nothing.
 Not sure what to do next - I have activated product key using Outlook which launches OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve</p>

 the Microsoft Uninstall Tool to completely remove Office from your computer before reinstalling from your Office Account. Use

<p>Hi Gents,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately things have gone down hill since uninstalling using option 2 and the unistall tool ''o15-ctrremove'' . I purchased Office 2019 via online portal (softwaregeeks.co.uk) whom I have used previous. Upon payment you can immediately download application
 (3.24gb zip file) and you get 'key'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not been able to re-install via my microsoft account so have re-installed via extracted zip file (note the 'setup' file didn't activate but install was completed via 'start' file). Applications are -re-installed and initially 'Word' opened OK but
 when closed and re-launched it again failed - so did Outlook' Excell appears to be constant and opens fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone back to supplier and queried - as I have now unintsllaed and re-installed several times with differing results. Thanks for your replies and if I do make any headway I will post resolution.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Thank you for joining us again.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using a 64-bit operating system, I would suggest you to check if the problem persists on Internet Explorer (64-bit) or not. You may try opening Internet Explorer (64-bit) by following the steps below:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click on <strong>Start</strong>. In the
<strong>Start search</strong> box type <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>. </span>
</li><li><span>Click on <strong>Internet Explorer (64-bit)</strong>.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now check if the problem persists in the 64-bit browser or not.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you. </span></p>

    <title>Cannot uninstall ActiveSync 4.5 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> norcalxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot uninstall ActiveSync 4.5</h2>
                    I no longer have need of ActiveSync as I don't have a Windows CE handheld anymore. I'd like<br />
to uninstall it, but every time I try, I get a "fatal error during install" dialog.&nbsp; I've tried to use the<br />
setup.msi to do an uninstall rather than install, but I get a message that an error occurred during<br />
install and the installation terminates.&nbsp; It seems there is no automatic way to get rid of this thing.<br />
Is there a way to uninstall it manually???<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

            OK, I tried the steps outlined above, but I still have a very odd problem and I guess the uninstall has not<br />
completed or something.&nbsp; Whenever I plug a media device into the USB port (such as an MP3 player) or<br />
whenever I start Windows Media Player, ActiveSync4.5 wakes up from somewhere and tries to install<br />
itself.&nbsp; It gets half way through the "Gathering System info" and then aborts, only to start over and over<br />
again.&nbsp; If I hit the cancel button enough times, it finally gives up, but will return again the next time I try<br />
to run MP or hook up my MP3 player.<br />
<br />
There must be more crud left laying around on my system somewhere.&nbsp; Any other ideas other than the<br />
above?&nbsp; I really need help with this.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

 tab I get an error message saying 'An error occurred when writing the property URL to the file ..". I have tried replacing the bookmark and it works for a while but then some days later it fails again. Everything else within Internet Explorer seems to be fine
 but it is quite frustrating. Once the favourite is corrupted then there is no way back (running IE without Add ons doesn't correct the faulty favourite - so&nbsp;it seems permanently corrupted). The fix is to&nbsp;delete it and recreate it but&nbsp;I don't think this is
 a permanent fix and the problem may return at a later date, or another favourite will be affected.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Roy,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known
 as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To set the computer in clean boot, follow the steps from the link:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to perform a clean boot</span></strong></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span>
</span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
section<strong> “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong>
</span>to reset the computer to start as usual.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.</span></p>

<h2>            Paste special &#8211; dialog focus changed in PowerPoint 2013&#47;2016</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><span>Hi</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Not sure how to go about requesting something in PowerPoint 2013/16 be changed back to its behaviour in all versions 2010 and prior?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue is when using Paste Special dialog in PowerPoint 2013 and 2016 the default dialog focus has changed from the “As:” panel to the “Paste/Paste link” control as per the screenshot below. For
 some reason this was changed in PowerPoint 2013, but thankfully did not change in Word!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In a production environment it’s common when bringing in text content to use keyboard shortcuts to paste it as unformatted text. This is to avoid unwanted formatting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So when the focus was on the “As:” panel it was possible to invoke Paste Special ‘CTRL+ALT+V’, press the first letter of the required type to jump to it, e.g., ‘u’ for unformatted text and then ‘Enter’.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now the focus has changed to the “Paste/Paste link” control this sequence is no longer possible.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So how do I go about requesting the focus be changed back to how it is in Word and how it was in PowerPoint 2010?</span></p>
<p>

            <p>As a workaround, you can add the <strong>Paste And Keep Text Only</strong> command (found under All Commands) to the Quick Access Toolbar in both Word and PowerPoint, in which case it automatically gets a keyboard shortcut like
<strong>Alt + 4</strong> (the number varies depending on the position of the icon on the QAT):</p>
<ol>
<li>In Word and PowerPoint, choose <strong>FILE&gt;Options</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Quick Access Toolbar</strong> panel.</li><li>Change <em>Choose command from:</em> to <strong>All Commands</strong>.</li><li>Find <strong>Paste and Keep Text Only</strong> and select it. Click on the <strong>
Add</strong> button to add it to the right-hand column. If necessary, adjust the vertical position so that the command is in the same place in both PowerPoint and Word.
<strong>OK</strong> out.</li></ol>

<h2>            confused with what accounts exist</h2>
                    Hi, I have a number of emails and I had a skype account before and then I couldn't open it and created a new one. I used this new one for a long time and then it asked me to sign in again and I didn't remember the password. When I reset the password, it
 went back to the first account and I don't even know the user name (how others will find me anymore). I can't find my&nbsp;latest account anywhere. The name displays my old name. Absolutely confused. I need my&nbsp;latest account and I can't find it. When I sign in
 using two alternate emails it still brings me to this old account. Any ideas?&nbsp;

            Hi Ekaterina
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Most likely you are using a different ID to login. You need to use your Skype ID not mail ID to login to Skype. Microsoft has been moving all to a single Microsoft Account based services including Skype. Hence, a new Skype ID seems to have been given to you on the basis of your Microsoft Account. Your old Skype ID is also preserved. So you can use either old Skype ID to login (to get into your old account) or Microsoft Account to login.
<br />
<br />If you want - You can transfer Skype Credits and Contacts to your new account

    <title>Query Parameters using a listbox or comobox... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Query Parameters using a listbox or comobox...</h2>
                    <p>I have read all of the related questions on the board and maybe I'm just brain dead but this is what I want to do...</p>
<p>1. I'm using Access 2003</p>
<p>2. My database that I'm building is for a searchable music discogrophy.</p>
<p>3. I have gotton all of my table in line and have created my first queries but would like to on certain ones to have the user select from a list in order to set the query off. What I mean by this is for example if the user wishes to search the database for
 all recording sessions that took place in a certain city&nbsp;I want the parameter for the location query to select the cities that are currently in the locations table and show that list and allow them to click on the city they desire and then the query would
 produce the results.</p>
<p>4. I have followed seveal of the examples set forth here and just can not seem to follow them or get them to work. When I open the query and type "Chicago" as the parameter and run the query I get the perfect result but am not able to figure out how to get
 the list to choose from and then get the same results.</p>
<p>5. I have no VBA or SQL abilities for the record</p>
<p>Any help here would be very grateful. Thanks.</p>

            There's nothing you can do to control the prompt dialog box for a query. &nbsp;But you can point a query parameter to a form, and that form can have a combo box or list box in which the user selects the parameter value.
<div><br />
<div>Let's say you build a form called frmMusicSearch. &nbsp;On the form, include a Combo Box that lists all the available cities. &nbsp;Let's call the Combo Box cmbCitySelect. &nbsp;Also include a Command Button on the form. &nbsp;In the query you want to open (it's actually
 better if you use the query in a form or report), add a Criteria under the City field:</div>
<div><br />
<div>[Forms]![frmMusicSearch]![cmbCitySelect]</div>
<div><br />
<div>Looks kinda funky, but that tells the query to go find the form called frmMusicSearch (the form has to be open) and then use the value found in cmbCitySelect to filter the result.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now in the Click event of your Command button, open the query or the form or report bound to your query using OpenQuery, OpenForm, or OpenReport. &nbsp;Switch to Form view, pick a city, then click the button. &nbsp;Magic.</div>

            <p>Thanks for the help John... but I have tried this and I'm unable to get this to work. I named everything just as you have but when I run the query I get a nothing in the results. I did it first with my own naming setup and nothing I then renamed everything
 as you have and still nothing any thoughts on what I'm doing wrong? Thanks for your continued help.</p>

            What is the Row Source of your combo box, and what is the Bound Column? &nbsp;And what is the SQL of the query that has the form parameter? &nbsp;(Open the query in Design View, then switch to SQL view and copy and paste your answer.)

            Well, first of all, the query does not need to be a Totals query. &nbsp;It should look like:
<div><br />
<div><span>SELECT tbl01RecDatesList.[Recording Dates], tbl03SongMasterNbr.[Song Title Master Nbr], tbl02SongList.[Song Title], [Q1 Recording Dates and Location Match].[Recording Locations]</span><br />
<span>FROM (tbl03SongMasterNbr INNER JOIN (tbl02SongList INNER JOIN [tbl02aSong-MasterNbrList] ON tbl02SongList.[Song Title Prime Key] = [tbl02aSong-MasterNbrList].[Song Title PK]) ON tbl03SongMasterNbr.[Song Title
 Master Nbr Primary Nbr] = [tbl02aSong-MasterNbrList].[Song Master Nbr PK]) INNER JOIN ((tbl01RecDatesList INNER JOIN [Q1 Recording Dates and Location Match] ON tbl01RecDatesList.[Recording Dates] = [Q1 Recording Dates and Location Match].[Recording Dates])
 INNER JOIN [tbl03a Song Master Nbr - Recording Dates List] ON tbl01RecDatesList.[Reording Dates Primary Key] = [tbl03a Song Master Nbr - Recording Dates List].[Recording Dates PK]) ON tbl03SongMasterNbr.[Song Title Master Nbr Primary Nbr] = [tbl03a Song Master
 Nbr - Recording Dates List].[Song Master Nbr PK]</span><br />
<span>WHERE ((([Q1 Recording Dates and Location Match].[Recording Locations])=[Forms]![frmLocationSearch]![lstCitySearch]))</span><br />
<span>ORDER BY tbl01RecDatesList.[Recording Dates], tbl03SongMasterNbr.[Song Title Master Nbr];</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>What's in the Recording Locations field? &nbsp;If it is text containing the city name, then the Row Source of your combo box should be:</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>SELECT [tbl04 Recording Locations List].[Recording Locations] FROM [tbl04 Recording Locations List] ORDER BY [Recording Locations];</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>You should also change the Column Count to 1, and fix the Column Widths property.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>

    <title>Cannot verify Microsoft Account -- Windows 10, Build 10240 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rwalden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot verify Microsoft Account -- Windows 10, Build 10240</h2>
                    Windows 10, Build 10240<br />
<br />
My Account page says "You need to verify your identity." When I click the blue Verify button, I get a gray box that lingers for a few seconds, then disappears. If I click it again, the same thing happens. I can go to "Manage My Microsoft Account," and all seems
 to be in order. My devices are listed and my personal info are correct.<br />
<br />
Similar problem when I go to Insider Hub. A gray box appears, lingers for a while, then disappears. Then I get a page that says "Please sign in and connect." "Try again" yields the same result. If I click "Register," it takes me to a page that says "Welcome
 back Insider" with my correct identification.<br />
<br />
Have run sfc /scannow, and it reports no problems found.<br />
<br />
I cloned the drive and upgraded to 10525, but the problem remained. I set up a new Local Account (as Administrator). I used that account to Remove my Microsoft Account, then tried to set up a new Microsoft Account. It would not allow me to do that. When I tried,
 I got the gray box again. It lingered for a few seconds, then disappears. I could log in on my new Local Account, but could not create a new Microsoft Account.<br />
<br />
I reverted back to Build 10240, but the problem remains. Also, I cannot download anything from Microsoft Store. I can access the store and browse around. It recognizes me. But, when I attempt to download an app, I get the usual gray box that quickly disappears,
 then is replaced by a box that says, "Try again later. Something happened on our end." The only option I have to Close that box.<br />
<br />
This system has lost its insider status and cannot retrieve it. When I try, I get the "gray box" treatment again.<br />
<br />
This is my "main" system, so starting over is out of the question. I will just live with the annoyance until a solution arrives. Don't have this issue on any of&nbsp;my other six Win10 systems.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts or ideas will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Russ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I've not had your problem.</p>
<p>Usually my solution to problems after some effort is to just double click the install iso and let it reinstall the upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does an excellent job here of keeping programs &amp; files &amp; settings for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fixes things usually and takes maybe 30 minutes tops
 to download a couple updates, write the install folder and do it... all automatic until login if I recall correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Might want to uninstall 3rd party firewall and antivirus if they exist first.</p>

            <p>Thanks Joe &amp; Mike.</p>
<p>Added info:</p>
<p>*&nbsp; I have only ever had one email address for my Microsoft Account, and it is working fine on my other Win10 machines.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; I used the Media Creation Tool to do a complete reinstall of 10240.&nbsp; Everything worked fine, but my problems persisted.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Under Settings/Update/Advanced Options, I have a segment called Get Insider Builds.&nbsp; It says "Your Microsoft Account needs attention to get insider builds."&nbsp; Below that is a box labeled "Fix Me."&nbsp; When I click it, I get the gray box that lingers a few
 seconds and disappears.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; I have no third party firewall or antivirus on that machine.</p>
<p>

            <p>Well, this is embarrassing.&nbsp; The problem is solved, but I cannot explain how or why.&nbsp; The things I did seemed not to help, and should not have fixed the problem -- but something did.</p>
<p><br />
*&nbsp; I found some suggested Registry edits that might help the problem.&nbsp; Before I embarked on them, I created a Restore Point.&nbsp; They did not solve the problem, despite several attempted edits.</p>
<p><br />
*&nbsp; I decided again to create a Local Account.&nbsp; Did so and signed in to it.&nbsp; I was not able to log back in to my Microsoft Account.&nbsp; Tried several times.</p>
<p><br />
*&nbsp; Decided to fall back to the previously created Restore Point, so used System Restore to revert.</p>
<p><br />
*&nbsp; When the system rebooted after Restore, the problem had gone away.&nbsp; I am no longer asked to Verify my account, and I was able resume my Insider status.&nbsp; I don't know about the Store yet, but don't currently care about it.</p>
<p><br />
I will just add this to the already long list of things I don't understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, everybody.</p>

                    <p>I have been converted to the Microsoft Exchange server (I no longer have a pop or imap account type) and when I send an email message it always appears as my email address and not my name. When I go to change it in: accounts settings -&gt; change -&gt; server

<p>Hi MVREF,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your posting in our Microsoft Community Forum. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand your concerns and if you want to change your display name (which is appears in the address book and on the To: and From: lines when email is sent to and from this mailbox), here is an reference article for you to troubleshoot this issue:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-the-display-name-that-e-mail-recipients-see-2b53331a-ba2a-4803-88dc-ac9fe376c8a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Change the display name that e-mail recipients see</a> .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, based on the article above, if you are using a Microsoft Exchange account, only the Exchange administrator can change account display name. Make sure your account has admin permission to sign in
<a href="https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/homepage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office admin center</a>, if you don’t have admin permission, contact admin to help you with it. Then you can simply achieve this by following steps: Negative to Active users &gt; click your account
 &gt; under Mail Settings &gt; More settings &gt; edit Exchange properties &gt; general &gt; enter your First name, Last name and Display name &gt; Save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: when you send email to users in your organization, the recipient will only see your display name. But if you send email to external users, they will see your display name in Inbox folder and see both your display name and email address
 in the From: line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope above information helps. Let me know the result at your earliest convenience and provide us a screenshot of the issue after you trying above methods and issue persists. We will be glad to offer our assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>

            Hi Mauelgu,<br />
<br />
Please try the following steps and let us know the result:<br />
1. Make sure that the Windows and Office are using the latest version.<br />
<br />
2. Scan Excel for known issues:<br />

How to resolve crash and stability issues in Office programs by using the OffCAT tool</a><br />
<br />
3. To confirm if this issue is realted to COM add-ins, start Excel in safe mode. You can open Excel in safe mode by pressing and holding Ctrl while you start the program or by using the "/safe" (that is, excel.exe /safe) option when you start the program from
 the command line.<br />

<br />
4. Open <strong>Excel-&gt;FILE-&gt;Options-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Display</strong>, turn on the “<strong>Disable hardware graphics acceleration</strong>” check box, then re-boot Excel to check the outcome.<br />
<br />
5. Perform a clean boot to see if it helps:<br />

            Hi Mauelgu,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your update. <br />
<br />
Could you try opening a simple Excel file and run the Excel client as a admin role via right-clicking on the Excel icon &gt; Run as administrator to see if there is any improvement?
<br />
<br />
In addition, if it is convenient, could you share with us the problematic Excel file with in Workspace for our further investigation? To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the information. You could check and respond to it via
 clicking<strong> Message()</strong> at the up right corner. <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Shirley

            Hi,
<div>Welcome to Microsoft community forums and thank you for posting the question. It looks like Internet Explorer 10 does not remain logged in. Let’s analyze and identify the cause of the issue.
<div>It must be very difficult when things do not work as expected. Please answer few questions to narrow down the issue.
<div>1. Is this issue confined to any specific website or with all? 2. Are you aware of making any changes to the computer prior to the issue?
<br />
3. Does this issue occur in Desktop or modern version of Internet Explorer? <br />
4. How frequently do you get logged out? </div>
<div>(Some mail applications would have set the log out time). </div>
<div>If the website is not compatible with Internet Explorer 10, it could sign out automatically.
<div>Let's turn on <strong>Compatibility View </strong>and check with the issue. </div>
<div>a. Type the website address in the Address Bar<br />
<div>b. Click on the Compatibility View icon beside the Address Bar<br />
<div>c. Click Enter and check.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For <strong>Windows 7</strong>, I would suggest you to follow the steps provided.
<br />
<div><strong>Method 1: <br />
<br />
</strong>Run the Fixit and check with the issue. </div>

<div><strong>Note:</strong> The antivirus will try to repair bad sectors on the hard drive damaged by viruses. Any data present on these sectors might be lost in the process.<br />
<div><strong>Note: </strong>The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings.
 We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.</div>

            <p>OK I followed all the steps to have Access use the lookup wizard. uploaded to SharePoint--created lists, but no relationships were made/present? I then manually created the lookups on the SharePoint in the lists themselves but they would not back-update
 the linked access front end with the changes? I then opened a blank db and linked it to the SharePoint where it mirrored it correctly showing the linkages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short through much gnashing of teeth a I found a rather long work around but there must be something missing here?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not using Access Services. </p>
<p>

            <p><span><span>Well, if you modified the SharePoint lookups, then you have to “re-link” your Access database (and you much confirm that creating a blank database and linking did work). So you
 likely have to re-linked the database (that means deleting the current links).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As noted, the steps in that video work for Access web services but ALSO should work for a regular database.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would ensure you “delete” the existing relationships before you start that whole process.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once you delete all the relationships, and re-do everything using the lookup wizard - including creating the new columns as outlined in the video. After everything&nbsp;then launching
 the relationships window, you should see the relationships just like before.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I believe it is “possible” to create the relationships in the window, but there is 5+ settings you MUST just get right (for example, using the wizard forces a “left” join in the
 relationships window. If you create the relationship in the window, you get an inner join – which is not liked).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As noted, you do not need access web services. However you do need SharePoint 2010 or later.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Each and every table MUST have an automnuber id if part of a relationship. In fact all tables need a PK auto number. No compound keys allowed. So everything needs to be an auto
 number and child keys are thus long number.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As noted, in that video I point out that creating a new blank database and linking to the tables should populate the relationships window for you.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note sure what you are missing here, but it does make sense that “after” modifying the SharePoint lists you likely need to re-link Access.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also, in file-&gt;options-&gt;current database,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Make sure you set Access to user the “newer” format.</span></span></p>
