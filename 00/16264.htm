<h2>            &#40;Reinstalled&#41; Outlook 2010 Fails to Run.  Due to Old PST File Reference&#63;</h2>
                    When I try to run (re-installed) Outlook 2010, it keeps asking me for old PST files that I don't want to use, then quits when I don't supply the file locations. &nbsp;What file is lingering around and causing this reference? &nbsp;I suppose when I identify it, I
 just need to delete it?

            <p>If you made a completely new profile with a unique new name, there shouldn't be anything hanging around to confuse outlook.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would go to control panel, search for mail and delete the profiles. Go to %localappdata%\Microsoft\and %appdata%\Microsoft\and rename outlook to outlook-old then repair the install.&nbsp; (type or paste those lines in the address bar of windows explorer to
 jump to the folder) </p>

<h2>            Account Hacked</h2>
                    <p>My account has been hacked and I've tried completing the account recovery form form three times now, only to get an email back the first two times saying I haven't given enough correct info and the third time it let me complete the forms, then telling
 me that I've exceeded my tries, so cannot try again for 24 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also been on to chat support and they tell me that form is the last resort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's driving me nuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help me recover my account?&nbsp; I have a paid monthly subscription on there as I use it for my business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm certain most of that info I've given in the form is correct.&nbsp; I definitely know the previous password and credit card charge and last 4 digits of the card.&nbsp; Surely that's enough to at least help me?</p>

            Unfortunately, as volunteer participants here on the forum, there is no much we can do for you since most of what you have attempted: account recovery, contacting chat support is what we would have recommended you do. 
<br />
<br />I will re-route this back to the community since its an account access issue, so Microsoft Support can actually investigate the issue.

<h2>            How do I install Chinese and Vietnamese fonts in Office 2010&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I need to install Chinese (Taiwanese) and Vietnamese fonts on a PC. I have tried language packs but this is not what the person wanted. Language packs change the entire Windows system to a foreign language. I simply want to keep English but have the capability
 to install &nbsp;alternate language fonts. I would also rather not go to a web site other than Microsoft to avoid malware.</p>
<p>

            <p>I'm not the best source of information on Asian fonts, but the Internet has a wealth of knowledge. A quick search for "Vietnamese fonts" turned up these sites and more:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.viet.net/fonts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.viet.net/fonts/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_Vietnamese.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_Vietnamese.html</a></p>
<p><a href="http://fontchu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://fontchu.com/</a></p>
<p>The general advice is to use one of the Unicode fonts such as Arial Unicode MS (one of the core Windows fonts), which contains the characters you need to write in Vietnamese, and which is likely to be present on any computer to which you send a document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following fonts come with either Windows or Office (although not necessarily with all versions of either) and are designed for Han (Traditional) text:</p>
<p>DFKai-SB Regular</p>
<p>Microsoft JhengHei</p>
<p>MingLiU Regular</p>

<h2>            How do I tell if my Nokia n8 is unlocked&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>thanks!﻿</p>
<p><span>I won a Nokia N8 at a conference this weekend. The Nokia people said it would work on either AT&amp;T or T-mobile – does this mean the phone is "unlocked"?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If not, how do I check to see if it is? I see plenty of websites that let me unlock the phone, but I don't know how to just check to see if it already is unlocked.<br />

            Easiest way to tell is to insert various sim cards and see if they work. Perhaps you could try friends or families sims in it?<br />
<br />
The box may also give you a clue, if no carriers are mentioned on the white ID label then chances are it is unlocked.

<p>You could also check your phones product code against the Nokia servers which will reveal whether the phone is locked to a specific network or not. Type *'0000# into your phones dialler to reveal the product code.&nbsp;</p>

            If you want to use your phone on any different networks such as switching from AT&amp;T to T-Mobile, then you will need to unlock your Nokia N8 otherwise it's unlocked.

    <title>Ink moving and some quirks with the interface - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ink moving and some quirks with the interface</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I purchased Office 365 University some time last year and have been using it for the past couple of months.
<br />
<br />
I recently started inking instead with OneNote and have run into some problems:<br />
<br />
1) Using my digitiser to ink, I find that some text inexplicably moves - up, down or to either side... Or if I am inking in Arabic the harakaat (diacritics) take a trip and I need to hunt them down.<br />
2) When using a right to left language in full-screen mode, the notebook dropdown menu and the button to get out of full-screen mode are in the way so I need to start the title of the page towards the left<br />
3) For some reason, at least when inking in Arabic, the title span takes up an enormous amount of space... this means that the width of the page is very large<br />
4) There are no buttons in the little bar at the top of full-screen mode. Now it seems to me that it is a little silly to have this bar at the top without any buttons. If I do want to click certain buttons then I need to click on the bar at the top and then
 browse to the relevant buttons. But the bar remains taking up space...<br />
<br />
Up until migrating to MS Office 2013 I have used OneNote 2007 for all my notes and have never experienced "ink jumping". As you can imagine I was quite startled: ink should not have a mind of its own or act as though Intel imps have possessed OneNote and wreak
 havoc. To my surprise, I found that this has been an ongoing problem since OneNote 2010; a problem of which I was blissfully unaware until now.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to fix the ink jumping problem? If it is something that will happen regularly or even rarely I won't be able to tolerate it, especially once next semester starts. I'll have to go back to OneNote 2007 which is a shame since I'll have to try and
 buy the 2007 Multilanguage pack which is very hard to find.<br />
<br />
The other issues I have enumerated have to do with the interface and interface design. I'm not sure if these are customisable.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Imran<br />

            I installed the proper driver for my digitizer, which fixed the problem. Try downloading the driver from the manufacturer of your laptop, rather than using the Windows default or from Windows update.<br />

<p>I believe you're talking about "pinning" the favorites pane...&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, just expose the favorites pane as usual... with the hub icon (the 3 little lines), then click on the little "push pin" icon in the corner.&nbsp; That will keep the favorites list visible
 after you click on a favorite.</p>

                    HEllo,
<div>&nbsp;I am using Excel 2013 and I have a user that is experiencing a unique problem. &nbsp;When selecting a cell for copy or cut, there is no rotating dash line border. &nbsp;This makes it hard for him to use that cell as a reference for copying contests. &nbsp;In addition,
 when he tries to save and close the workbook, along with the dialog box asking if he wants to save, don't save or cancel) the rotating borders appear.</div>
<div>Very strange and new to me as an IT pro for 7 yrs. &nbsp;Does anyone know of this situation? &nbsp;Any Help?</div>
                </div>

 of the other Office applications seem to be working well and without incident. &nbsp;

            Try going into Control Panel, Ease of Access Center, Make the Computer Easier to See. Uncheck the box that says "Disable unnecessary animations". This worked for me in Windows 10.

<p>I couldn't find a download for the E72 version of Opera mini either, however I suggest you go for Opera mobile instead of opera mini which you can download here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.opera.com/mobile/download/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opera mobile is meant for more capable phones like the E72 so you get more functionality from it.</p>

<p>Opera Mini won't cause any conflict with Nokia default browser.&nbsp; As @dldldl suggested, UCWEB is a very good application if you happen like to download large size file from internet that Opera Mini can't handle.</p>

    <title>Pie chart size and position in PPT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alecim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pie chart size and position in PPT</h2>
                    I have a different pie chart displayed in each of five slides. &nbsp;I need to make these 5 existing pie charts the exact same size and place them in exactly the same position.
<div>I have not found a way to do this i &nbsp;PowerPoint 2007. Is it possible in 2010 or 2013?</div>

            If you select all five charts, copy and paste to a new slide and then adjust the data. Doesn't that work?<br />
If not - pretty sure Steve's PPTools can do this.<br />

            Thanks, but I need to leave the pies on their slides. Just need to make them the same size and place them in the same position. Other objects in PPT have dimensions and positions, are pie charts really excluded?

            Thank you for replying, John. &nbsp;The entire chart area (bounded by a thick border) has size and dimensions, but the individual pie inside it, which can be moved around and resized, does not, or at least I cannot find a place to change them. Can you?

            If you are talking about the plot area then I don't belive there is any UI element to size, align or position it. These things are done by hand.<br />
<br />
Maybe somebody has written an add-in that allow this?<br />

 puts parentheses around the number for unread or brackets around the number if you've elected to display a count of all the messages in a folder.</p>

<h2>            VBA for sum by color</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an excel spreadsheet which has a bunch of invoices on it. I have created a rule that says if the date the invoice was sent is greater than 45 days then the invoice is overdue and it will fill with a red color. I want to have a cell at the bottom of
 the grid to count all of the cells that are red so i know the total of how much are overdue. I use excel 2011 for MAC and looking for a proper way to do this. I can use a VBA but i will need a boolean because I am not so good at writing VBA yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, MW</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>can't you just use a Sumif formula that sums only the rows where the date is smaller than today minus 45? Or Countif to count the number of overdue invoices? Why do this with VBA? If you use conditional formatting to colour the cells, you can use the same
 logic to sum or count cells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>=Sumifs(ValueColumn,DateColumn,"&lt;"&amp;Today()-45)</p>
<p>
</p><p>=Countif(DateColumn,"&lt;"&amp;Today()-45)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what do you mean by "boolean"? This normally refers to a data type, like text is "this", integer is 345, boolean is TRUE or FALSE.</p>

    <title>Making Lumia ringtones - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roope70  say:</h3>
<h2>            Making Lumia ringtones</h2>
                    
<p>To start off, the 40 second / 1 MB limit is ridiculous. Whoever decided on it, should be fired. How can Lumia play songs that are longer than that but enforces the limitation on ringtones?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, how can I make ringtones. I've read everything, and it seems to boil down to</p>
<p><font>(1) learn to use a professional sound editor, edit your music, produce the song in MP3 or WAV format of the appropriate sound quality,&nbsp; and after all this...)</font></p>
<p>2) switch the Genre to "ringtone". Simple!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm having a bit of problems with step 1 here. Could somebody please provide a simple walkthrough here with an application?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the ridiculous ringtone length and filesize limitations, why does Nokia not provide a ringtone maker? You would simply choose the sound file and say "Save copy as a ringtone", at which point the file would be cut to 40 seconds maximum and saved in
 a compatible format of the maximum allowed size, and the Genre would be automatically set to "Ringtone". Would this make too much sense?<br />
<br />
Maybe Nokia just wants us all to revert back to Nokia Tune for our ringtones after all this personalised nonsense. Needless to say, given this one limitation - which I would never have thought of before buying this Lumia 900 - and the fact that music is a big
 part of my personality, the Lumia 900 is a useless piece of junk that will embarrass me every time it starts playing one of its standard ringtones.</p>

<p>Hi roope70,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I can see how you would ask why these limitations in general it seems safe to assume a ringtone will sound for less than 40 seconds before you pick up, so having longer ringtones would not have any practical use and the track(s) would only take up
 additional space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating a ringtone is very easy, you can use the free app '<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-GB/apps/f10e7f0f-e32e-4e3a-bf0e-7d47fecbec05" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Ringtone Factory</a>' to select and cut the section you want to use. Besides this app you will
 find many similar apps in Marketplace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>Kosh</p>

<p>The limitation doesn't make sense because you have to edit your music to it use as ringtones. This is a step back from Nokia's previous models. It has nothing to do whether I pick up in 1 second or 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
If (and presumably when) such a simple solution exists, why is it mentioned nowhere in the user guides, FAQ's or troubleshooting guides? Still, an app that does this should be native. I spent 2 hours of my life getting frustrated over this issue, as if I had
 nothing better to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: As I've now learned, the ringtone makers available as apps are not what I thought (see below).</p>

            All apps i've found only allow one to make ringtones out of music in their databases, not music on the phone. I'm still left without ringtones. Why am I not surprised? Nokia Tune FTW!

            Ringtone maker from Mobile 17 allows you to upload your music to their site, edit it to a ringtone and download it to the phone.<br />
<br />
Ringtones from Skydrive does the same.<br />
<br />
I used Mobile 17. I already had a folder of ringtones which I'd used on a Symbian phone created using a Symbian app. As Symbian can be recognised as a mass storage device I copied the file to my PC and then added them to Mobile 17 site which let me download
 them to the Lumia as ringtones.<br />
<br />
Ringtones from Skydrive works same way except the tones are uploaded to Skydrive and then downloaded to phone.<br />
<br />
It's a convoluted way of doing it compared to Symbian or Android but is do'able. I managed and I'm not techie at all.

<p>Thanks, Caitlin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already tried Mobile 17 yesterday but found it confusing and dodgy and quit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now downloaded Ringtones from Skydrive. It returns an error message upon logging in to Skydrive, and the button for finding MP3's on the server remains disabled. So, still no custom ringtones for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This expensive phone is turning out to be an expensive piece of junk.</p>

            I know what you mean by it looking a bit dodgy. I thought that as well but it's nowhere near as dodgy looking as some of the sites I used to make themes for my Symbian phone which were not on the ovi store whereas mobile 17 is on the marketplace so I assumed
 it would be ok.<br />
<br />
So far as the other 1I mentioned I hadn't used it. Just spent 20 minutes failing to create and save a ring tone.

            Hmm, all these while i thought the limitation imposed on the length is because of copyright issues because i heard that Apple charges an extra 99cents if you want to use a certain song to be used as a ringtone, despite the fact that you have already bought
 the full song from iTunes for 99cents earlier.<br />
<br />
Their rational is that when you bought the full length song, you bought the license to listen but you didn't bought the license to use it as a ringtone.<br />
<br />
I find this ridiculous.

            I get the filesize limitation even less than the length limitation, the lenght limitation might make sense from at least some points of view. I have plenty of songs on my phone that are shorter than 40 seconds but larger than 1 MB.

                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im starting a new database system for a new company and my idea was to use Access 2016 and Sharepoint 2016. Its definitely a challenge for me as i never worked with these 2 . Although i am familiar with mysql and Vb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So before i start on this project i was just wondering if its possible to connect my database
<strong>Forms </strong>(from access) and use it on Sharepoint in order to allow admins and users to access the database in any machine at any time. (if there is an easier way can someone enlighten me please).</p>
<p>I know i can connect my access db to sharepoint but ive only managed to connect tables and not the forms.</p>
<p>Is there a way to connect the forms ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time and help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<h2>            N900 EMMC loss and difficulty re-flashing</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am an embedded engineer so fairly ok with the tech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had my phone three days. It has lost the 32GB of memory and is relying upon a few MB to operate the OS but not enough for effective use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following posts on the 'net and Maemo forums, I have attempted to reflash the the phone using both:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://tablets-dev.nokia.com/nokia_N900.php?f=RX-51_2009SE_3.2010.02-8.203.1_PR_COMBINED_203_ARM.bin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">RX-51_2009SE_3.2010.02-8.203.1_PR_COMBINED_203_ARM.bin</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>followed by:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://tablets-dev.nokia.com/nokia_N900.php?f=RX-51_2009SE_1.2009.41-1.VANILLA_PR_EMMC_MR0_ARM.bin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">RX-51_2009SE_1.2009.41-1.VANILLA_PR_EMMC_MR0_ARM.bin</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can get the FIASCO to flash but not the EMMC; I am using flasher-3.5 on a vista PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get "error code 1" from the attempt to flash&nbsp; the EMMC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help and advice please...I am still not certain that the is not something electrically faulty here too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there some way of wiping the lot and starting again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advice please...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bill</p>

            Are you rebooting between flashing the combined image and attempting to flash the vanilla image?<br />
<br />
what other output do you see when you try to flash the emmc?<br />
<br />
Remove the -R option from the flasher command line to prevent it from rebooting after flashing<br />

dmesg |grep -i emmc<br />

You can find the | character by pressing the blue shift button then ctrl and finding it on the on screen symbol picker..<br />

If you emmc has vanished, this could indicate a hardware failure

            Ahh.. cross posting whoops..<br />
<br />
I've seen a few users (cooldoctor most recently) with devices with failed EMMC storage.. Cooldoctor's had partially failed, so when he returned it to Nokia then flashed the firmware and sent it back.. GREAT JOB THERE!!!<br />
<br />
However, yours is really wrecked, so I'd send it back to them and get it repaired.. It's covered by the 1 year warranty and I'd be damned to let it go to waste!!<br />

            The phone was dropped after 3 days of ownership.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing major but enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nokia have looked at it and just returned it "Beyond Economic Repair".<br />
<br />
<br />
So I need to find my own answer.<br />

<p>AFAIK (after reading the Nokia Limited Warranty) Accidental damage is not covered by Nokia. However, if you have it insured you could claim from that. Also (depending on where you live) check your household contents policy. If you've got extended cover,
 i.e office equipment etc. you may be able to submit a claim through them instead.</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The device is covered on the household insurance which is good except that after the insurance excess is deducted I have £200 and a bricked phone. Better than nothing, so thanks to the insurance company but not enough to buy a new N900.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So...still up to me to get something running...see other post.</p>

            wellll.. I noticed someone had cloned their Maemo installation onto an SD card..<br />
<br />
That might be useful.. I think you're going to be very hard pushed to use this normally in future, especially since I don't think you'll be able to install PR1.2.. but you might be able to get PR1.1.1 going..<br />
<br />
I'll do some more digging..<br />

<h2>            Get Insider Preview builds - Error 0x80072EF1</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>since Build 10565 i get an error message in Windows Update -&gt;advanced:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c538867c-ed22-4723-a703-9b6d21087c25" /></p>
<p>After this message I click on "Fix" or as seen in picture "Reparatur erforderlich". The system tried to fix the error but is not able and so I got following error:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/688da866-2c3d-4ae5-af94-6cb5e1d0a4bf" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>As today build 10586 released I'm not able to get it because of above error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What did I do to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Switched from my MS-Account to local account and otherwise -&gt; no change.</p>
<p>-checked my account on Windows homepage -&gt; no problem.</p>
<p>-tried to get a hint on google: result: 0x80072EF1 = &nbsp;ERROR_INTERNET_OPERATION_CANCELLED.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-after this I tried to read the WindowsUpdate.log in %WinDir% but I can't read anything out of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-I'm attaching 4 logs generated by Windows PowerShell here. RAR with 4 files. You can read it with Notepad++ or Editor.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Link:&nbsp;http://filehorst.de/d/bmqBJEki</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to do a clean install and hope for a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Your issue falls outside the scope of this forum (which addresses questions users have about their Microsoft developed windows phones). You'll need to seek help for your issue elsewhere....the website of the manufacturer of your new wireless router might
 be a good place to start your search for help.<br />
