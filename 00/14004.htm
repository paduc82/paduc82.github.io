<p>I have got some issue's with this update. Problem starts with the automatic keypad lock. Before this update I didn't have any keypad lock&nbsp;problems. Now I have this problem that it lock’s the keypad when I do nothing in&nbsp;all app's,&nbsp;menu's and message fields.&nbsp;I
 established&nbsp;the automatic keypad lock&nbsp;for&nbsp;8 sec.&nbsp;in the security&nbsp;menu. That's why it irritates me! Because of this problem I disabled this option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really would like&nbsp;to know if this is something new? It also could&nbsp;be&nbsp;a small&nbsp;bug in this new update? I contacted Nokia Centre, they got the same problem in their Nokia E72. They didn't have any solutions. They told me to wait for u new update
<i>😞</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there&nbsp;any one from Nokia&nbsp;who&nbsp;has answers for this problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Country: The Netherlands</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I expected Nokia would bring some changes in the new firmware version; as most of the Nokia customers requested before to add "mark sms as read" from standby menue as most of the E series users uses sms preview app. Secondly, sms scheduler app for Nokia E series
 phone is long time requested but Nokia hasn't showed up any marcy. This firmware version were also expected to change to look in the main menue &amp; home screen &amp; would provide some more themes so that customer doesn't get bored with the same interface. But Nokia
 upset their E series customers again. If our request are ignored like this from time to time I guess this is gonna be my last Nokia phone.<br />
<br />
Most upsetting is I haven't found a single difference from firware version 31 to version 51. And yet no change in Ovi. It still sucks with its low profiled apps, only few free apps &amp; bla bla.... We are damn tired on Nokia. Please listen us. Nokia still has
 the time to hold its position, otherwise we will have to switch to android or iphone as the price is not much higher than Nokia.

<p>Another problem is when someone of your contacts&nbsp;calls, you should see the name of the person on&nbsp;your screen. After this update I only see the mobile number of the person in my screen.</p>

<p>I'm also disappointed in Nokia, really I would like to sell this one for an Androide mobile. The apps are very disappointing. They have got&nbsp;to get rid of symbian en start putting Androide in their mobiles. Mayby we will not have&nbsp;any problems&nbsp;as in&nbsp;this case
 after a new update. Really sad <i>😞</i></p>

<p>Greetings Nokia Care,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently upgraded the software on my Nokia E72 from v031.023&nbsp;to v051.018 and though this upgrade has fixed 1 noticeable bug (7 &amp; 8 keys as main menu shortcuts) it has resulted in my phone performing worst than before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have reinstalled the firmware and also reset the phone, both hard and soft, but nothing works.</p>
<p>Will I be able to downgrade to v031.023?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia, it seems you are deliberately attempting to sabotage the image of your Brand in the minds of current and potential customers. This is for sure my last Nokia Product!</p>
<p>I humbly advice that you focus on standardizing only 1 or 2 Operating systems across all your devices. This will make quality control much more manageable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following is a detailed list of all the issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Noticeable improvements</u></p>
<ul>
<li>1. Using the 7 and 8 number keys as shortcuts in the main menu is now fixed though.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>The issues (Bugs)</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>When the Fn key is pressed the phone displays, (iFnkeyState = EFnKeyNone) at the top of the screen.</li><li>Adobe Reader down graded from version LE 2.5 to version LE 1.5</li><li>The Phone freezes frequently; Battery needs to be removed to resolve</li><li>The Time at the bottom right of the screen is in an annoyingly smaller font than before.</li><li>Calendar reminders are silent after the first auto snooze</li><li>The autolock feature works everywhere now. There is no way to set it to Standby only</li><li>Some of the software I installed are not compatibility after the upgrade.</li><li>QuickOffice is still v6.2.217&nbsp;after hard reset it went to v6.2.558</li><li>There are problems using Ctrl/C and Ctrl/V for copy and paste in QuickOffice on Excel files.</li><li>The standby clock on the desktop keeps disappearing</li><li>Can't zoom pictures opening from "Gallery", you must open it through file manager to zoom.</li><li>At times when typing, the phone swaps the first character imputed with the second one;

<p>At times when typing, the phone swaps the first character imputed with the second one; however, it works normal from the third character. For e.g. if you attempted to write ‘Yes” and type ‘Y e s’ the phone displays ‘eYe..</p>

<p>n ill appreciate more if i can downgrade it back to v031.023..</p>

<p>I completely agree with Tinman's issues!<br />
My phone just freezes several times a day. The only way to fix it, is to remove the battery.<br />
I thought they would have fixed the HTML in the mailbox. But you still have to press "view this mail in HTML"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is probably going to be my last Nokia after being a fan for years. They really messed up this phone after the E71.</p>

<p>Yup, does not seem to be the best firmware update...</p>
<p>I've got bad battery draining issues now, having gone from charging every third day to every day. Also SmartConnect now seems to totally ignore my access point options. I specifically set the cell data point to only connect after confirmation, but since
 the firmware update to .51 It now connects automatically whenever it feels like it, further killing the battery, and racking up some nice data charges I don't want!</p>
<p>Only option is to remove smart connect and manually change the access point each time again...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also having a lot of lock-ups, especially when accessing email accplications.</p>

</p><p>I just created a document in Word. For some reason, it says upload failed. What nonsense. Isn't it supposed to save it to my HDD?. I have done this before. So what is the reason for it to try and write it in the cloud or on my Onedrive?.

<p>Under File&gt;Options&gt;Save, make sure that you have the box checked for "Save to Computer by default" and that you have an appropriate local file location set for where the files are to be saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If however the location that you select happens to be a folder that you have set to be synchronized with One Drive, you might still get that message if the synchronization failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I do not have any folders synchronized with my OneDrive.&nbsp; Rather, if I want to store a copy of a particular file in a folder on my OneDrive, I use the Upload facility in OneDrive to upload it.</p>

<h2>            End to End Private IM issues</h2>
                    I am having problems with the end to end IM chat function. Initially, it worked flawlessly and would stay on for the duration of a conversation, but now it only works for a few minutes before booting both parties off. Both parties removed skype and reinstalled
 but nothing has changed. At most, it holds for 5 minutes, but more commonly 2-3 minutes then crashes and tells me I need to message the person I am talking to in order to restart.&nbsp;

            Did not work. I did find a fix though. Removing the latest update and going to 8.37 which was the last working version. And it worked flawlessly until a message certificate popped up wanting to install a newer version that does not work back onto the computer.
 I X-ed out and Skype suddenly quit working. I killed the screen and quit and then restarted skype and it was unwilling to start up. I restarted the computer Twice and each time skype was still unwilling to restart. I deleted all versions of skype&nbsp;aside from
 8.37 and uninstalled the current version then reinstalled 8.37. It immediately flashed up after 8.37 installed that it needed a Sarl cert change. I x-ed it out again and Skype would not boot. Then I uninstalled and reinstalled this time without the wifi card
 in place. 8.37 installed and immediately flashed up the Sarl cert saying it needed to alter my hard drive. This time I said yes. It installed 8.40 despite only 8.37 being left on the computer with no internet access. So now I

<h2>            Microsoft Band 2</h2>
                    <p>The silver sensors on the clasp have come loose and fall off when I take my watch off my wrist. I thought it was due to faulty workmanship but when I&nbsp;put the sensor back in place, it seems to have a magnetic property and stays for a while and then falls
 off again. I have never cleaned this part of the watch and am very careful handling the watch when wearing it or charging it. What could cause this problem and is it repairable? I got it for Fathers Day this year (2016) so do I even have a warranty? Anyone
 else having issues? Please advise, thanks.</p>

<p>I'm confused as of Feb 5th you posted "&nbsp;After upgrading to build 14257. " that Edge wasn't working right now you are saying that upgrade 14257 has not showed up? did you have 14527 installed and rolled it back, if so it puts&nbsp; a flag on your system not to
 upgrade to that build, when it is released to the slow ring it will show on your system again here is a link I found by searching on how to reset Win10 updates click&nbsp;

<h2>            Remove Word From Dictionary</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to remove words from the normal dictionary with specified spellings?</p>
<p>For example, in our organisation,&nbsp;the word "feedwater" is written one word; not two words; not hyphenated. And believe me, we have are many many more such words.</p>
<p>The problem now is, the spell checker does not highlight the other versions&nbsp;up as a "misspellt" word.</p>
<p>Alternatively, can the custom dictionary be employed to show up "misspellt" words?</p>

            Unfortunately, the contextual speller feature won't help with this task. Its job is to warn users when they've typed the wrong word from a set of homonyms: "Their it is" instead of "There it is", or "Put it hear" instead of "Put it here". The words are
 correctly spelled but incorrect for the context. Also, the list of words the feature recognizes is not customizable.<br />
<br />
The ordinary spelling feature, and its exclude dictionary, are limited to recognizing single words without spaces, hyphens, or other punctuation. That's why Suzanne said "feedwater" vs. "feed-water" might not be successful.<br />
<br />
An approach that is likely to be successful is a macro add-in provided by Greg Maxey at
<a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/VBA_Find_And_Replace.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/VBA_Find_And_Replace.htm</a>. With that add-in, you can create a document containing a two-column table, with the word or phrase to find in the left column and the word or
 phrase to use as the replacement in the right column. (There's an example on Greg's page as a sample Quick List, but the format for a "predefined Word list" is the same.) I've verified that you can use multiple-word phrases and hyphenated terms in either column.<br />

<h2>            Problems with a WM6 smartphone&#58; no screen rotation supported and GAPI reporting wrong resolution</h2>
                    Hi everyone :)<br />
<br />
I bought a Motorola Q 320x240 landscape smartphone and I'm happy with it at an extent. I found out however that it doesn't support screen rotation and the GAPI is emulated, reporting 176x220, cyPitch = 352.<br />
<br />
The end result is two fold: <br />
- Lack of rotation prevents portrait applications to fit the screen, i.e. the bottom is not visible, some are unusable. I also found out that one could theoreticaally use software created for PDA, with the help of a virtual cursor or&nbsp;mouse cursor emulator,
 even though it would be a non-worthwhile hassle<br />
- The GAPI issue prevents games or emulators to display correctly, believing they are filling a 176 pixels wide screen.
<br />
<br />
I've reported this problem on the Motorola support forum here: <a href="https://supportforums.motorola.com/thread/15118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://supportforums.motorola.com/thread/15118</a><br />
<br />
It was asked that I continued my discussion here:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.everythingwm.com/forum/moto-q-hacks/gapi-locked-at-176x220-no-screen-rotation-and-other-annoyances-36230.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.everythingwm.com/forum/moto-q-hacks/gapi-locked-at-176x220-no-screen-rotation-and-other-annoyances-36230.html</a><br />
<br />
I got the explanation from here: <a href="http://www.modaco.com/content/q-q-modaco-com/241988/gapi-on-the-motorola-q-what-developers-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

[quote]<em>Game developers using GAPI - The Game API - (directly or through other libraries) may have problems on the Motorola Q.<br />
</em><strong><em>If you call the GAPI routines on the Motorola Q, they will tell you that:<br />
</em></strong><em>1) the screen size is width=176 and height=220 (in fact the display on the Motorola Q is Landscape with width=320 and height=240).<br />
</em><em>2) GAPI is using a DRAM buffer, i.e. you cannot write directly in the raw frame buffer with GAPI, rather GAPI GXBeginDraw will return you the address of a 176x220 memory buffer, which will be copied in the real display frame buffer when you call GXEndDraw<br />
</em>...<br />
<strong><em>Why did they implement GAPI this way?</em></strong><em><br />
</em><em>Because they were affraid that by implementing GAPI correctly (i.e. providing the actual frame buffer access and indicating the actual frame buffer size of 320x240), they would break of a lot of existing code.<br />
</em><em>Theye were affraid that games not expecting a Smartphone with Landscape screen would not directly work on the Motorola Q, until they are ported / adapted to this new device.<br />
</em><em>....<br />
</em><em>It's very similar to what HP did with GAPI on the iPAQ 3800, and to what
<strong>Microsoft</strong> did with VGA-resolution Pocket PC's, and the result is the same: they made a mistake, and their bad decision is just making it harder on developers, not simpler, as they though.</em><em>[/quote]</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On the 2nd link above I show how a game was able to rotate the screen on the Smartphone emulator. And display rotation is in fact possible on smartphones<br />
<br />
My phone is crippled for both applications AND games. You may see from the threads that&nbsp;my frustration&nbsp;&nbsp;has increased during this time, and then one starts figuring out who's to blame. Either Motorola for the device, PowerVR for the display chip or Microsoft
 for the Operating System.&nbsp;Not so much now though.&nbsp;Understanding the problem and being a programmer I may be able to mitigate the issue myself, I just need guidance. Please tell me from where to start.
<br />
<br />
Thanks :)<br />

<h2>            Excel crashing when printing one specific worksheet</h2>
                    <p>i have an excel spreadsheet containing varying formulas that is being used to calculate construction type estimates...it was created a good 10+ yrs. ago and has worked well all this time ...until what i believe was the last excel upgrade...there are two
 main worksheets that are linked...one worksheet prints fine...it's a totals page so it just pulls information from what we call the "calculations" page...but when we now go to print the calculations on the "calculation" worksheet and click print, it's crashes
 excel...tried copying into another worksheet but it then looses the "totals page" links...the creator of the spreadsheet is no longer employed by the company so we're unsure of the sources as they don't show in the fields of the totals page...</p>

    <title>Stop Word 07 restores minimized when another is opened. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> expertbigwheelpilot2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stop Word 07 restores minimized when another is opened.</h2>
                    <p>This is MS Word 2007.<span>&nbsp; </span>The situation is I have 2 or 3 MS Word files I want to keep open but minimized.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then want to open and check the contents quickly of a number of MS Word files in a file window.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Each time I double click and open each MS Word file one of the minimized MS Word files comes up under the file I just opened.<span>&nbsp;
</span>After I close the file I just opened I have to minimize the MS Word file I want to keep minimized.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have to minimize the same MS Word file each time I go to open the next MS Word file I want to quickly check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I stop MS Word from bringing up a minimized MS Word file when I open a new MS Word file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your kind help.</p>

<p><span>In Safe mode I got the same behavior. I closed all MS Word files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then opened MS Word files one by one in safe mode.<span>&nbsp; </span>
After the first MS Word file opened in safe mode and minimized, every time I opened each consecutive MS Word file (in safe mode) one of the minimized came up under the latest opened MS Word file.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I checked to make sure that “safe mode” was at the top border of the MS Word file window.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Same behavior in safe mode as in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I checked the COM add ins per your instructions.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It was empty.<span>&nbsp; </span>It appears I do not have any COM add ins.<span>&nbsp;

            Thanks again for your kind suggestions.<br />
<br />
Following your instructions I found and opened the word startup folder.&nbsp; It was/is empty.<br />
<br />
I followed the instructions in 921541 and deleted both the word registry keys for data and options. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Word still behaves the same.&nbsp; Same problem.&nbsp; I went ahead and restored the registry keys for data and options since these are not the cause of the problem.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?<br />
Bob<br />

    <title>Why Outlook Advanced Find is not finding all emails matching - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krishna shastry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Outlook Advanced Find is not finding all emails matching criteria&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am using Vista + Outlook 2007. Earlier when I was using Office 2003, I never faced this issue, but now I am finding that 'Advanced Find' feature is extremely unreliable and less helpful.<br />
<br />
If I try to search some email in PSTs, the result is either partial or sometimes the search finishes very quickly and does not return any results. I have faced this issue with Outlook 2007 in different computers and with different PSTs, so I am pretty sure
 that issue is purely related to Outlook.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions how to overcome this?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Note:</span> I am well aware that sub folders are not selected by default in 'Advanced Find' in Outlook 2007.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Krishna.<br />

<p>If the above option is already checked then try to rebuild the indexing and check if it helps:</p>

    <title>OneDrive for Business spamming the sync message. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noah bm  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive for Business spamming the sync message.</h2>
                    <p>I have a big issue with OneDrive for business. It was already installed on my pc when I got it, and I absolutely ****ing hate it. Every time I boot up my pc, it comes up with a message saying
<strong>Are you ready to sync you OneDrive - ******* Schools-documents?&nbsp;</strong>And gives me the option to sync now or cancel. It's every time and I've done everything I can to stop it. I've given up on uninstalling it, but there must be a way to get it to
 stop. Or some files to delete so it leaves me alone. It's incredible that this even has to be an issue. I don't want to sync anything, it's as simple as that. There is no way to uninstall it, and it's a pain in the ****ing ass, and I'm going crazy soon. Incredible.</p>

<p>1. Like I said multiple times, it’s the OneDrive for Business sync client. So your first solution does not work.</p>
<p>2. There is no uninstalling it. It’s part of the Office 365 ProPlus packace.</p>
<p>3. I’m using Windows 10 and it’s OneDrive for Business that bothers me</p>

</p><p>You would do so by joining multiple instances of the table on whatever distinctly identifies the rows in the table which you wish to consolidate into a single row in the query's result table.&nbsp; I'm guessing from the fact that it is shown in boldface in your
 report that this is RunName.<br />
<br />
However, the fact that you have to do this points to an incorrect table design.&nbsp; Users should not be inserting different rows into the table for the same entity, but editing a single row following its insertion by whoever first initiates the entity, presumably
 the Run, within the database.&nbsp; If, when currently inserting multiple rows for the same entity, different users can enter different values into the same column, then the table would need to be decomposed into two or more related tables in which multiple rows
 would be entered in relation to the same run.&nbsp; Without a more detailed knowledge of the process being modelled I can't be more precise on that point, however.<br />
<br />
A word or two on terminology so as to avoid any confusion as to what is being referred to here:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; An entity is what each row in a table represents, and is an instance of the entity type modelled by the table.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; A row equates to a record.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; A column equates to a field.<br />

<p>Thank you, I was afraid of that.&nbsp; I have multiple users in our production facility and each contributes various pieces of information regarding a particular press run.&nbsp; For example.&nbsp; The plate room folks are entering data onto a form that updates the table
 (what time they received a file, and what time they output the last plate) for a press run.&nbsp; The press folks are entering data onto a form that updates the same table (press start time, press stop time, issues with the run).&nbsp; Two other departments are doing
 the same thing.&nbsp; Each individual department's entry is a separate record in the table, creating multiple records on the report.&nbsp; Obviously I want all information to end up in one record.&nbsp; How do I set up the tables so that happens?

            Firstly you need to prevent duplicate rows being inserted for each press run by indexing the RunName column uniquely (no duplicates) in the table design.&nbsp; You won't be able to do this with the current table, however, as it already contains duplicates so
 make an empty copy of the table and do so in that.&nbsp; You can then run an append query which inserts one user's set of values into the new table.&nbsp; You'll need to work out a way to identify the rows from the table for this, as what it amounts to is inserting
 the rows originally entered by one user.&nbsp; This should give you one row in the table per run.&nbsp; If when executing the append query you get a message saying it can't append some rows, then it means you haven't identified a distinct subset of rows from the original
 table, and you'll have to think again how to do so.<br />
<br />
You will then need to insert the other users' sets of values into the new table by executing a series of update queries in each of which another distinct subset of rows for one user is selected and used to update the relevant columns in the new table.&nbsp; The
 old and new tables should be joined on the RunName column in this query.&nbsp; Before you execute each update query open it as a datasheet and check that you have got a distinct set of runs returned.&nbsp; If it does return any run more than once you'll lose data when
 its executed.<br />
<br />
If all goes well you should end up with all runs represented by a single row each in the new table, with the data from the separate users consolidated into each row.&nbsp; You can then rename the original table, e.g. by giving it a _bak suffix, and then rename the
 new table to the original name.&nbsp; This will now be your operational table both for data entry, and as the basis for reports.<br />
<br />
For data entry, you must use a form, and not enter data directly into the table's datasheet.&nbsp; In the form add an unbound combo box, cboRunName say, in the form header with RowSource property like this:<br />
<br />
SELECT RunName, 1 AS SortColumn<br />
FROM [YourTableNameGoesHere]<br />
UNION<br />
SELECT "&lt;New Run&gt;", 0<br />
FROM [YourTableNameGoesHere]<br />
ORDER BY SortColumn, RunName;<br />
<br />
In its AfterUpdate event procedure put the following code:<br />
<br />
Dim ctrl As Control<br />
<br />
Set ctrl = Me.ActiveControl<br />
<br />
If Not IsNull(ctrl) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ctrl = "&lt;New Run&gt;" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.GotoRecord acForm, Me.Name, acNewRec<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Filter = "RunName = """ &amp; ctrl &amp; """"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.FilterOn = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.FilterOn = False<br />
End If<br />
<br />
If the row for a run has not yet been created it will not be listed so the user can select &lt;New Run&gt; and enter a new record.&nbsp; Otherwise they can select a run from the list and the form will be filtered to that run, in which case they can add data to the existing
 record.&nbsp; If they delete the current selection in the control the filter will be removed and all records displayed.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Project Export to Excel Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I can't seem to export some of my project files to excel. I tried one of them, then saved the map of that export, and everything was working. Then I tried another project, and went through the steps multiple times (with and without the saved map file) and
 it didn't work. It goes all the way through, then just doesn't generate the excel file. No errors or anything.</p>

            I have tried in Project 2016 and Project 2013. Excel is 2010. Some of them are consolidated, and some are single, but even some of the singles won't export.<br />
