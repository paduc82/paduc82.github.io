            Hi, Richard

<br />I would recommend you to check your SSD or Hard Disk HDD with chkdsk.

            SD Internal bus error probably means a hardware is not right.
<br />As it is brand new, we would suggest you to contact Asus as they are responsible for the full functioning of the device during the warranty.

<h3> adam_lw88  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I turn on the touchscreen in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I just updated my laptop (with touchscreen) from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 and now my touchscreen doesn't work anymore. I can't find anything in the control panel to enable it. I've tried switching to "tablet mode" but still my touchscreen does not respond.
 I had a fine, working touchscreen before I updated and now it doesn't work anymore. Can someone help me switch it back on again?

            I solved my own problem. By trial and error, I discovered that Windows 10 was not able to come ready-packed with drivers for the touchscreen. My laptop is from HP so I used the built in utility to check for drivers and sure enough, it detected a missing
 driver for my touchscreen, downloaded it from HP, installed it, restarted and now it works.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Weird. I imagine all HP computers (whether laptop/desktop/tablet) come pre-installed with "HP Support Assistant" and mine is found in the taskbar with a question mark in a circle.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5356c95-5660-4471-88ab-159dd8d180bd" /></p>
<p>Here, it's shown on the very left of the image. Use it to check driver updates etc.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a similar problem. Thankfully, I was able to find the solution. It is a specific driver. If you are having the same problems please follow these steps:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1) Go to Device Manager (Windows Key+X, select it)&nbsp;<br />
2) Under the "Mice and other pointing devices" list find "USB Touchscreen controller", or the driver that's not your mouse/touchpad.&nbsp;<br />
3) Right click to select "Properties", click the "Driver" tab, and click "Roll back".&nbsp;<br />
4) After confirming, this will remove the driver from that list but bring up a bunch of new ones under "Human Interface Devices", where the touchscreen stuff logically should live.&nbsp;<br />
5) Make sure that all the other drivers are updated EXCEPT "USB input device". This is the one that moves it all to the mouse drivers.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>After a restart the driver didn't automatically reinstall like they usually do. If it does, run the "Show or hide updates troubleshooter"&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">found here.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to think this is an issue from eGalax Touch, which is responsible for the driver, but if you do a search for "egalax touch acts like mouse" this is an issue dating back to Windows 7. Either a) Microsoft should stop doing business with
 them, b) Microsoft should provide a fix for how the driver interacts with the OS, or c) let the consumer know that there is an issue and how to fix it. Because it's the SAME ISSUE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>JDRC&nbsp;</p>

            It turns out, after being on hold for LONG times with HP, that the T in the model name does not mean it's a touch screen.&nbsp; Pretty pissed at HP. There are T models that are touch screen and there are T models which are not. Who the hell does something like
 that?

            <p>Hello&nbsp;Demon Haze II,</p><p><br /></p><p>From our FAQ:
  </p>
<p><b>When will my MyVIP Rewards Credits be deposited into my Microsoft account?</b>
  </p>
<p>The total Rewards earned will be calculated at the end of each month. Typically you'll receive your MyVIP earnings in your account by the 15th of the following month, though this is subject to the program's current deposit <a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/terms-and-conditions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">terms</a>. Be sure to keep an eye on MyStatement on the <a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MyRewards</a> page to track your progress and watch your Rewards Credits total grow!
  </p>
<p><br /></p><p>We have not yet calculated the month's MyVIP, so it is too early to see the Credits pending. Your purchase of Darksiders in December was included in that months' payback, which was placed as currency into your account as part of the January 11th deposit.</p><p><br /></p>

    <title>Windows &#34;SmartScreen cannot be reached&#34; after Windows 1803 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonathan.04  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows &#34;SmartScreen cannot be reached&#34; after Windows 1803 Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows showed I had the 1803 update so I went ahead and updated to it and noticed a few issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Downloaded a program on the Chrome browser and when I tried installing it said "SmartScreen can't be reached right now" I was able to run it anyways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Anytime I would open a program my background would disappear like I had no background.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I noticed these issues I went to revert back to my previous version where it was working fine. However then I was unable to refresh my PC so I had to use the Media Creation Tool via USB to refresh my PC so no lingering files from the update was around.
 This however installed the latest Windows version 1803 and I'm stuck with the SmartScreen issue. The background issue hasn't happened since the clean install though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is the steps I've taken to solve the issue including steps from the Technical Support:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Checked the internet connection for any issues&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Ran System File Checker (no issues)</p>
<p>-Disabled Antivirus for conflicting issues&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Cleared Temporary Files&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Checked in Windows Defender if the warnings were on</p>
<p>-Checked for any Windows Updates available&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately SmartScreen isn't working still like it was in the previous version of Windows I had. Until I can get the issue resolved I'll be turning off SmartScreen and manually scanning each program with my Antivirus for safety precautions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Direct Play install failure 0x80073701</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to enable direct play on my win 8.1 laptop to play some of my older games which require this legacy feature however it fails to install with the error code 0x80073701.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to enable this feature through both the prompt when running the game and through the windows features list with both getting the same failed result. trying to enable other features besides the legacy componant I am trying enable results in the
 same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had a look online but the only "fix" I've seen is to refresh windows with doing a system restore as as potential but untested solution. In regards to refreshing It states that if files are missing it will require install discs/media and that it will
 . My laptop came with windows 8 installed when I brought the laptop and came without any discs for the OS. My laptop also had a new copy of windows installed only a month ago as it was repaired under my premium warrenty which I purchased from the retail company
 I brought the laptop from in which the hard drive and motherboard were replaced amongst other componants. Restoring on the other hand I can't do as I have made no restore points in the month I've had it back as I still have one or two programs left to install
 after having a new hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help in getting these features to work would be appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note I am signed in as a admin when trying to make these changes to the features.<br />

            <p>Thanks for the response, I double checked to see if there were any window updates I hadn't installed (it turned out I had 2 internet explorer updates waiting, I doubt this is the problem but I updated them regardless).<br />
<br />
So all updates are installed, I had a look into NTVDM which was mentioned on the second link and I can't find a trace of it on my laptop although a comment I found on the internet implied it was only on 32-bit systems and not 64-bit.<br />
<br />
I then tried reseting the windows update componants. First Off I tried using the microsoft tool listed on the page to find a fix problems, While this did seem to find some problems as shown in the screenshot below it didn't actually fix the problem.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6ce2334f-3c3e-4975-903e-7c542a54f50c" /><br />
I decided to then try doing it Manually following the instructions on the microsoft site, however when reregistering the files I had this pop up for the following .dlls<br />

            <p>According to your thread in <a href="https://forums.adobe.com/thread/1898001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="VB6 Fusion Chart Not Loading in Flash Player 18">
Adobe Flash Player&nbsp;Community forums</a>, you were seeing this behavior on 13 July 2015 with Flash v18.0.0.203 installed (i.e., before v18.0.0.209 became available via Windows Update on 15 July).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I see from that thread that others are reporting the same issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has Fusion Charts Support confirmed that your installed version of Fusion Chart is supported in Windows 8.1 and with Flash Player v18.0.x installed? I note that the S.ystem Requirements page only lists VB6 runtimes and Flash Player v8.x (which dates from
 2006!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you'd be better off sticking with your thread in Adobe Forums - and possibly beginning your own, new thread in the appropriate Fusion Chart forum =&gt;
<a href="http://forum.fusioncharts.com/forum/62-using-fusioncharts-for-vb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.fusioncharts.com/forum/62-using-fusioncharts-for-vb/</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect&nbsp;you may find that the&nbsp;problem's on FusionChart's end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Some antivirus/security products could be&nbsp;causing this error. McAfee, Norton, Windows Live OneCare,<br />
Threatfire are a few. Which antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine now. And<br />
which have you EVER had on it even if you uninstalled them. (These leave remnants which cause<br />
strange issues.) So its a definite in your case.<br />
<br />
Check the default services and dependencies to make sure they are running.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Right it is 8.1 though the real information is still valid. The best information would come<br />
from TechNet though it is possible someone might stumble in here.<br />

                    <p>I have been having problems with the desktop dropdown menu for over a week now.&nbsp; Have tried multiple solutions.&nbsp; Have no idea</p>
<p>what to do about it.&nbsp; The specific problem I'm having doesn't seem to show up anywhere.&nbsp; When I log on, the dropdown menu just scatters various application icons all over the desktop.&nbsp; Help!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note:&nbsp; An expert did contact me via email.&nbsp; But what he said was just a little too "techie" for me.&nbsp; Would appreciate further help.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Save as&#34;  Dialog box stops responding</h2>
                    I am currently using Windows 7 RC1 and Office 2007 Enterprise. Whenever I try to use "Save as" dialog box and select an option, the window simply stops responding, and I have to close the dialog box prematurely.
<br />
<br />
I have upgraded ro Windows 7 from Window Vista recently and also have installed office service pack 2. But i am not sure which one is behind the problem as I have not used that feature for sometime.<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea to solve this problem?<br />

            Hi gtms,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting your response to the Getting Ready for Windows 7 community forum.<br />
<br />
From the information stated, do you know the size of the partition the documents are being saved to?&nbsp; Is it possible the files are being directed to save to the recovery partition and not the usual Windows partition.<br />
<br />
Are you in dual configuration with Windows 7 and Windows XP?<br />
<br />
It may be that the size of the partition is not large enough to save the file to.<br />
<br />
Please keep us advised for further suggestions.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

            <p>It remembers the last command you type in the run box. You can delete the " http://www.somenaughtyserver.com" and type something different like "iexplore" and hit enter to open Internet Explorer. Now, once you press the Windows symbol and R, you will see
 "iexplore". </p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: The Windows + R will show you the run box where you can type commands to either pull up a program or go online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are ways on how to delete the history of Run box. You can refer to the answer of Kiran Kishore on this -&gt;&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/clear-the-run-history-on-the-start-menu-on-windows/32179267-3e20-457f-87cc-8ce77d9e6900">link</a>.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App won&#39;t sync, &#34;save&#34; and &#34;done&#34; buttons missing from account settings</h2>
                    <p>I can't send emails or sync since I installed Windows 10. It worked at first, but I can't download old emails or send emails -- the sync loops forever... And if I try to change the account settings, there is no "save" or "done" or "cancel" button, so the
 settings just revert back to the default.</p>
<p>

<p>This is what I have discovered, from trying to follow&nbsp;the instructions from several posts countless times and several IT Tech's the past two weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;This FIX is&nbsp;actually three step process; Two steps&nbsp;in the Blue-SCREEN, the second of two parts&nbsp;are&nbsp;missing&nbsp;from
 the instructions in previous post Forum&nbsp;Fixes:</p>
<p><strong>STEP 1. Select "F2" at your Black SCREEN Error Message "Diskette drive 0 seek failure;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Missing 2nd Step&nbsp;process stating where&nbsp;"FLOPPY drive"must be-DISABLED... is actually in two places.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong>STEP 2.&nbsp; Arrow&nbsp;down and SELCET "CMOS..."&nbsp;near top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>(keyboard is not active) and&nbsp;on the next&nbsp;screen, arrow&nbsp;down and&nbsp;SELECT-</em>"Floppy Drive-1.44 is enabled" MUST&nbsp;be CHANGED&nbsp;TO:&nbsp;"DISABLED"</strong>&nbsp;(Floppy Drives-1.44 are obsolete)<strong>
 another menu screen will pop up, to make your selection, &nbsp;arrow down to select&nbsp;"DISABLED" and&nbsp;SAVE-F10.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>STEP 3.</strong>&nbsp; Sub-Menu&nbsp;will&nbsp;return&nbsp;to the previous MAIN-BLUE SCREEN Menu, You&nbsp;need arrow down and&nbsp;select BIOS;&nbsp;as stated in Previous POSTS and need to&nbsp;<strong>RESET BIOS&nbsp;order to:&nbsp;&nbsp;#1 HD; #2 CD/DVD; #3 Floppy-DISABLED; then select F10 to execute,
 returns to previous Blue-Screen Main Menu; "F10, again&nbsp;"Saves and Exits"</strong> you from the Blue SCREEN Main Menu" to<strong>COMPLETE FIX..</strong>&nbsp;
<strong><em>Windows </em>Start Up,&nbsp;immediately, results in the computer starting normally&nbsp;and returns to&nbsp;the<em>Windows Logo and
</em>Login&nbsp;state.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Review this fix, fixed&nbsp;error in BIOS Boot Order since&nbsp;"HD" was "DISABLED",&nbsp;Floppy drive was 2nd "Enabled",&nbsp;and CD/DVD was 1st "Enabled"&nbsp;drive;&nbsp;and CMOS had "Enabled" "Floppy drive-1.44"&nbsp;which was causing this BLACK SCREEN ERROR MESSAGE&nbsp;and&nbsp; interrupting
 the computer's n<em>ormal </em>Windows, Startup,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Login process.</li></ul>
<p>Hopefully,&nbsp;POST is&nbsp;<em>helpful,&nbsp;easier, and </em>clearer instructions to fix for the next person with this&nbsp;problem&nbsp;and will be faster find, and get back to business with a happy Computer!</p>

<p>I don't know exactly when it started.&nbsp; I always apply all the latest updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see I didn't mention that this was for the windows phone 950xl.&nbsp; On the PC nothing pops up with Cortana any more.&nbsp; The popup window just suggests things you can do rather than really show you any useful information. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Tracking Packages seems to be missing everywhere now in Cortana PC or phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the phone, one of things that I REALLY liked was being able to just press the Cortana key on the screen and having it show me useful stuff.&nbsp; Now apparently packages and sports tracking aren't done.&nbsp; Or else something is broken somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else observing these things with windows phones or PC?</p>
<p>

<p>I like to watch my sports teams whether it is a winning season or a losing one.&nbsp; The question is, did Microsoft take away this feature deliberately, or is it supposed to be working and now it isn't?&nbsp; (I'm guessing the former) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to see sports teams OR track packages on PC or phone anymore?</p>

            <p>Here is the solution that worked for me, found on another thread somewhere. Jump lists have been working for several days now.</p>
<br />
<p>1. Open Powershell with admin privileges</p>
<p>(Click the search bar and type powershell, then go up to the top of the menu and RIGHT click "Windows Powershell". Click "Run as administrator")</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Copy and paste this line at the PS prompt:<br />
<br />
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}<br />
<br />
You might have to wait a second for it to appear, when it does hit enter and wait until the prompt returns from PS</p>
