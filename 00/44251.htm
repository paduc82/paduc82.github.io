            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This issue might occur due to corrupt drive or bad sectors on the hard drive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you able to boot the computer normally after repair fails?</li><li>Do you a secondary hard drive or a different operating system installed apart from Windows operating system on the computer?</li></ol>
<p>I would suggest you to remove all unnecessary devices first (including USB ones as mentioned above) and check whether your system boots up normally and if so, start plugging them back in one-by-one to find the potential culprit.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please get back to us with the status of this issue.</p>

<h2>            &#34;The application cannot be started&#34; - simply want to view photos.</h2>
                    <p>I have just "upgraded" my fairly new laptop computer to Windows 10 (PC World did it for me for £20). Now I can't view photos because when I click on a thmbnail for each jpeg I just get a message saying, "The application cannot be started. Try reinstalling
 the application to fix the problem." This is irritating as I was told that all my programmes would be preserved when the upgrade was made. Another message suggests I visit the store but clicking on that wording does not take me anywhere. And why would I need
 to go to a store anyway? </p>
<p>I can copy and paste the jpeg files into a Word document but I'd rather view them first.
</p>
<p>Any useful suggestions? </p>

<h2>            I receive a blue screen error f4.</h2>
                    <p>Original title : Out of the blue (Ha) Stop 0xF4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since about Tuesday 12/08/2013 my system has been crashing, after running for around an hour each time, with a 0xF4 Blue Screen.<br />
<br />
I can't for the life of me see what could have caused this to begin. I've not tampered with my hardware in any way for quite some time and the only downloads I've made have been through the supposedly secure Steam program for games.<br />
<br />
Things I have tried in order to determine what the problem might be/fix the problem myself<br />
<br />
-Safe mode full scan with Malware Bites<br />
-Checking the cabling inside my machine and disconnecting and reconnecting hard drives, graphics cards and sound cards.<br />
-Monitoring my core temperatures with Core Temp - I haven't noticed any spikes that would indicate it was a heat issue<br />
<br />
I would adore anyone who can assist me with this problem as I am at an utter loss and, while I can circumvent the issue to an extent by restarting before the crash chimes in, it is becoming increasingly frustrating.<br />
<br />

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>Nice pun by the way. The BSOD is a nightmare. It looks like you've already hit on a couple of the suggested fixes. You may want to check the hard disk and memory for errors if you haven't already. You can find the steps here:&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors-in-Windows-7#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors-in-Windows-7#</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>It looks like someone else was able to resolve this matter. Here is a link to the content:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/windows-7-64bit-bsod-crtical-object-termination/e17eae92-2521-4843-90eb-bf426e92e044">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/windows-7-64bit-bsod-crtical-object-termination/e17eae92-2521-4843-90eb-bf426e92e044</a></div>

<p>&nbsp;Yes I have tried to use iTunes. My computer recognizes my phone fine on I Tunes too but, i have trouble getting the music to actually sync onto the phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ended up figuring out that the One Drive can sync &amp; play music too. I originally thought it was only for documents. I was able to get it working.</p>

    <title>Compacting Files on closing Outlook Express - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rpmarch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Compacting Files on closing Outlook Express</h2>
                    Outlook Express asks to compress files when closing the application... It runs through all of my folders, but when it gets to the end, at the 'Folders' file it stops with this error Message: "Folder is currently in use by Outlook Express or by another
 application"... and closes the operation without compressing any files.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any suggestions???

<p><strong>Compacting hangs on Folders.dbx after installing SP3 for XP</strong></p>
<p>This is a known issue and will never be fixed. Therefore, compact your folders manually. The counter will be reset to zero, and a manual compact won't hang.</p>
<p>Click on Outlook Express at the top of the folder tree so no folders are open. Then: File | Work Offline (or double click Working Online in the Status Bar). File | Folder | Compact all folders. Don't touch anything until the compacting is completed.</p>
<p>If you get it the habit of compacting before the 100th closing, (i.e. once a week, or so), you will never see the prompt again.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, it is not possible to change or edit your Skype Name as it is system-generated and permanent.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can however, change your display name:

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As for your missing contacts,
<strong>as long as you are signed in to the correct account</strong>, you should be able to view them in any device as they are tied to your account.

<p>I'm using microsoft money plus deluxe. I had microsoft money 2004. I both versions I haven't figured out how to trigger money to add a another catagory that will be trended in projected cash flow.&nbsp; Does anyone here know how to do this ?&nbsp; I think what happened
 is my editing in money 2004 ( Which was migrated to money plus deluxe)&nbsp;I removed a trended catagory of autombile gasoline.&nbsp; And ever since then I haven't figured out how to add it back in</p>
<p>Thanks for any input</p>

<p>Hi Louka,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to heart that happened. Would this happen to be a Microsoft Account Credit Gift Card?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, unfortunately there wouldn't be a way to cancel or transfer the gift card from one account to the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, there may be a way around the situation. You may attempt to buy the item you wanted as a gift with the gift card and send it to your main account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I had purchased and downloaded the TMNT 1989 Arcade game back when it was first available on the XBLM. &nbsp;However, now I have a new XBOX and I thought my son would really like to play the game. &nbsp;I go to re-download it and can't find it. &nbsp;Is there a way to
 get my copy again since I have already paid for it??</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

There no options to delete this driver because this is generic driver for group of devises I find him but can't delete him in system driver folder so I email to manufacturer but didn't received any answer and now my WiFi devise is useless - it is bad idea in
 Windows 7 to can't be used Installation Wizard&nbsp; like Windows XP - I try in my old computer with Windows XP to instal this WiFi and no was problems like this- driver of WiFi&nbsp; is installed by the program of manufacturer but it must be installed before Windows
 to instal the driver and in Windows 7 this is impossible - my be trouble is in manufacturer program for Windows 7 because she can't overwrite&nbsp; generic driver .So I my be sell&nbsp; this WiFi device because I don't use my old computer.<br />

            <p>You're absolutely correct and it's abysmal that the link doesn't take you directly to the manual download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update for July does however and perhaps this previous update might help (this is a direct link to the update):

            <p>You can get to the menu and start Startup Repair by using the Windows installation disc or a system repair disc that you created earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can revert to the previous build by going to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; Recovery</p>

<p>
</p><p>Only have the WIN8.1 installation disc. I upgraded for free and you didn't get a disc sent to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Didn't make a system repair disc. Is it too late? It's already messed up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to create a restore point when I first upgraded to WIN10 and that failed - no error message number. Just said failed and no restore point created.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I got the computer upgraded the computer store gave me 2 ssd drives raided together. Could that be causing the problem?</p>

<h2>            How do I fix the error &#58; Debug Assertion Failed re HP printer installation&#63;</h2>
                    During installation of my HP officejet 6500 all-in-one&nbsp;wireless E709n printer. An error message : "Debug Assertion Failed" appeared when the "Configuration process"&nbsp;was being loaded. I've tried&nbsp; just about all the provided troubleshooting fixes, driver
 updates, HP updates, etc... but still no resolution to the issue. The printer was operating fine up to last month, January, 2013.

<h3> psn x is x life  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rattling noise coming from my 1 TB Xbox One.</h2>
                    Wondering if anyone else is having this problem or if anyone has any idea on what could be wrong/broken inside the console. It's not shaking the Xbox, but it's a loud, rattling noise. When I first turn on the console, it is very quiet but as I start to
 play a game, it becomes loud and annoying. Xbox Support said I should take it back to GameStop and exchange it but I wanted to know if anyone has any idea what is making this annoying noise. Thanks

<h2>            Can&#39;t find Pc Tablet and Pen And Touch Settings in Control Panel</h2>
                    <p>Hi. </p>
<p>I have Asus X553M with Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I bought for him Wacoom Bamboo Tablet and when I tries calibrate pen, I wasn't able to do it. In Control Panel I can't find Pen and Touch setting and Pc Tablet settings **** well. In computer Properties I also can find
 information that 'No Pen or Touch Input is available for this Display'. I also can mention that Touchpad for this laptop is working fine. Funny is that tablet also is working but like a mouse - without pen pressure in any software for drawing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone anything?</p>
