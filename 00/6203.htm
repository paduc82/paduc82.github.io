<p>
</p><p>I too am having the similar problem re-installing IE 11. I uninstalled it because when I would open IE it would launch my home pages and then hang for several minutes before I was able to open another tab or navigate to another website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was left with IE 8 which must have been pre-loaded on my PC. &nbsp;I have since been able to upgrade to IE 10.</p>
<p>I get &nbsp;the following upon trying to upgrade to IE 11 and it wont finish the install.</p>
<p>"Setup could not launch http://go.microsoft.com/Fwlink/Linkid=299204</p>
<p>I looked up this 299204 error on the MS support site and followed those instructions but it didn't help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I followed the instructions below and still the same issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I did the uninstall yesterday 12/28/15</p>
<p>My original install of IE11&nbsp;was either done through Windows update or a Yahoo link sometime around May 2014. Don't remember.
</p>
<p>Additional info, when I discovered IE 8 was my default after the uninstall of IE11&nbsp;and I found the info on the error code 299204 on the MS support page I was able to install IE9 thru the download process. When I tried to go to IE10 I experienced the same
 issues as I am having now until I performed all the steps in my thread reply. Now I am on IE10 10.0.30-KB3078071. I am still experiencing the 4 to 5 minute lag time to open links when I first open IE that I was on IE11. &nbsp;I am using Norton AV but have tried
 the download and install both on and off. Even after restarts. </p>
<p>To Recap:</p>
<p>1) The initial problem was the lag time when launching IE so I uninstalled it (IE11) hoping to fix the problem.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;Trying to re-install IE11&nbsp;has lead me to this thread and this issue. I am looking forward to having IE11 up and running by 12 January 2016.
</p>
<p>There is a post in this thread about running netsh winsock reset. I am hesitant to do this unless advised by MS support without a guess. &nbsp;</p>

            What type of email account do you have configured in Outlook? POP, IMAP, Outlook.com, or Microsoft Exchange?  
<br />
<br />Outlook only syncs Outlook.com or Exchange mailboxes, plus IMAP email. If you use POP3 or have pst files, you need to copy the pst files to the new computer.

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Just for sake of accuracy, Outlook doesn't sync between computers, each installation of Outlook would connect (and sync where applicable) with email accounts. Each computer would need to be configured with the same email accounts.
<br />
<br />in answer to the rest of your questions/requirements
<br />
<br />#1 - How many and what type (POP, Imap, Exchange) email accounts are involved
<br />(to determine that, from Outlook menu, go to FIle --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; email accounts listed under email tab)
<br />
<br />For POP3 accounts - email is a one-way download of the &lt;Inbox&gt; . No other folders are sync'd. You would need to copy the PST file associated with the POP account to the other computers
<br />
<br />For IMAP accounts - all email folders are sync'd with the server. Contact/Calendar info is not sync'd with the server. What you need to copy depends on &lt;IF&gt; you have anything you want to keep in folders with the added words "This Computer Only". You would need to export those folders to a PST file
<br />
<br />For Outlook.com\Exchange accounts - everything is sync'd with the server - nothing to copy.

<p>Thank you Karl, is it possible to just change the settings on my old computer to exchange accounts and then set up the new computer with exchange?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It used to be easy to change settings, and I just started looking, I no longer see the 'easy way'....</p>

<br />is it possible to just change the settings on my old computer to exchange accounts and then set up the new computer with exchange?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />#1 - No such thing as simply changing an account from one protocol (i.e. POP3, Imap etc) to another. The account needs to be re-added to the profile. If the computer is using OL'2016, then you would need to delete the account first but exact steps you need to follow would depend on the account types already configured so that you potentially don't lose any data.
<br />
<br />#2 - In terms of configuring an account using "Exchange" - that's only possible with an Outlook.com or hosted Exchange account. 
<br />
<br />Best way to go forward is to describe what you have and what you want to end up with at which point, some definitive suggestions can be made.

            Just noticed your response to @Diane regarding account types (2 EX and 2 GMail Imap)
<br />
<br />&lt;IF&gt; the default data file for the profile is one of the ost files for an EX account then that would be where your default contact/calendar folders are stored.
<br />
<br />&lt;IF&gt; you don't have any folders in any of GMail folder trees labeled as "This Computer Only" then there your path going forward is really simple
<br />
<br />On the other computers, configure the Hotmail account first that has its data file set as the "default" data file on the base computer. The configure you other accounts. Everything will the work the same on all computers with nothing to copy from one computer to another unless you have manually added PST files.

<p>
</p><p>My default is an IMAP but I gave up on the calendar and contacts over a year or two, thus I do not use them.&nbsp; I can change my default to one of the hotmail accts, such as the one that owns the off 365...</p>

</p><p>Within our business, I have directed all our other office 365 uses to One Drive.&nbsp; I've been Office 365 since inception &amp; before that Office ____ whatever.&nbsp; I was also told at a young age to stay away from Exchange - I cannot remember why &amp; I'm old now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new computer &amp; what I want is a smooth way to move my (huge) Outlook folders (subfiles) from my old computer -- and-- if I can access up-to-date mail, folders etc on another computer in a different state, without taking my small laptop with me I

<br />
<br />RE: #1 - since I don't know the context under which you were advised to stay away from Exchange, wouldn't be fair for me to comment but suffice it to say that I don't subscribe to that sentiment these days so will leave it at that :-)
<br />
<br />Re: #2 - Not using calendar/contacts with an IMAP account............
<br />
<br />That I can fully understand. If you want to use contacts/calendar across all devices, just set the data file for one of your Hotmail (Outlook.com) accounts as the default for the profile and you'll be all set. Changing the default data file is completely different then setting the "default email account' - the two are mutually exclusive.
<br />
<br />Re: #3 - moving "huge" Outlook folders
<br />
<br />Question related to this is "where are these stored"? Specifically, (a) are these folders in an IMAP folder tree or (b) did you create a PST file and then created folders there?
<br />
<br />If (a) - no action required. If (b) need to copy the pst file(s) in which these files are stored. Go to Outlook menu --&gt; File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab and take note of the folder path/file name of the PST file(s) involved. Those are the ones you need to copy to whatever computer(s) you want but keep in mind that you can't sync any data in these files across all machines without continuously copying these files across or using some kind of 3rd party utility.
<br />
<br />So in summary - all you need to do is what I described in my previous reply
<br />
<br />=======================================================

Everything will the work the same on all computers with nothing to copy from one computer to another unless you have manually added PST files.

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To save your bookmarks or favorites on a flash drive, you need to save the page as
<strong>HTML file</strong> however, Internet Explorer has the ability to do that. Follow the steps below on how to import it to Internet Explorer before you export it as HTML:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click on the <strong>3 dots</strong> at the upper right side or known as <strong>
More</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea776f6c-e3e3-48a3-947d-72332e3f0db2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea776f6c-e3e3-48a3-947d-72332e3f0db2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Go to <strong>Open with Internet Explorer</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Once the Internet Explorer (IE) shows up, go to<strong> File</strong> menu under
<strong>Settings</strong> (beside the Star logo).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1f5f05d-4de2-42ab-95c9-195cf091893f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1f5f05d-4de2-42ab-95c9-195cf091893f" /></a></p>
<p>4. Choose <strong>Save As</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Make sure to select <strong>Webpage, HTML only (*.htm;* .html)</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7799999-2f8c-429c-8039-de5985ee1e5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7799999-2f8c-429c-8039-de5985ee1e5e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Save the file to your desired folder.</p>
<p>7. Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>8. You should see the HTM File of the favorite/bookmark page exported.</p>
<p>9. You can drag and drop it to your flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>Try this but be aware it works on the active window so if you're in VB editor testing your code and try it then it will tab in there and not; where I assume you want it, on the worksheet.</p>

<h2>            EXCEL 2007 template issues&#58; Household monthly budget</h2>
                    I downloaded the free
Household monthly budget
<p>Excel 2007 template. </p>
<p>1- I was playing with it, changing the amounts and I notice that the two (2) GRAPHS included were Not changing</p>
<p>along with the changes I made to the money amounts. Is there a REFRESH tap somewhere to make the graph</p>
<p>respond to my changes?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2- ALSO - we do not have children so I removed the CHILDREN section</p>
<p>and it caused havoc to the template. How do I personalize the template</p>
<p>to add or remove entire sections??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance - Adrian</p>

<p>Hello Alessandro Refatti,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the error message, it seems to be a part of Office 365 non-delivery report, may I confirm whether issue occurred when trying to send email from Outlook? You can firstly go to Security
 &amp; Compliance center to check if sending account is blocked: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/removing-user-from-restricted-users-portal-after-spam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/removing-user-from-restricted-users-portal-after-spam</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to look into it, I’d like to collect the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Full unmodified non-delivery report, to protect your privacy, you can save the entire bounced back report as .msg file, send the file to me via Private Message:
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Whether other user in same tenant has been affected? And whether you can’t send any emails to any recipients?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Tenant information in Private Messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Anna&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Alessandro Refatti,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the information you provided, your problematic account is a Microsoft Personal account, since Microsoft Personal account and Office 365 account (often have a default domain @<em>contoso.onmicrosoft.com
</em>when created) are totally difference account type which need different troubleshooting steps. To better help you, may I re-confirm is it this Microsoft Personal account that received non-delivery report?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is Microsoft Personal account (live account like: outlook.com, Hotmail…etc.), you are suggested to contact our dedicated support by posting thread in:

<h2>            NOKIA C3-00 gets Switched off automatically in 5 Minutes</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased a new Nokia C3-00 phone in India and it gets switched off automatically in 5 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nokia Experts - </strong>Please advise if this is a firmware issue or hardware issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had very bad experience with Nokia Care as they never fix the problem and keeps your phone for 1 week and return back as it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can this phone be replaced with new one, if yes, how?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>M</p>

<p>Hello <strong>Nokia</strong>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found the problem myself. If you can fix it, its well n good. Problem is Nokia C3 does not support all memory cards which is not good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Users:</u></strong> If anyone facing similar issue reported by me (Nokia C3 phone gets switched off automatically in 5 minutes), please remove memory card from your Nokia C3 phone if you have inserted any and restart it. It should work fine after
 that. I think Nokia C3-00 does not support all Memory cards. Not sure which memory cards are supported though. I think someone from Nokia can suggest this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers!!!</p>

<p>I'm also facing same issue of restarting on any incoming outgoing activity. I visited to Nokia care the person suggested formatting my phone; even i told them that i've already formatted my phone. the insisted that it's there process, after 2 days they given
 my phone back but the problem still not resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again after 2-3 days i have given phone to nokia priority they said they have to check, then they took my phone for 10-15 days and after that they said i've to pay Rs. 1600 as the may mobile have sent to Pune Location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not worth to purchase Nokia Mobile anymore in lifetime due to this kind of service.</p>

            <p>Folks, I think I've found a workable solution. &nbsp;The trick is to block messages using "Inbox and Sweep Rules" rather than a "Block Senders List". &nbsp;When using the former, you can specify messages that "include these works in the sender's address". &nbsp;Then for
 the action, choose "Move Message to Folder" and then "Junk Email". &nbsp;I've set it up for email addresses that end in:</p>
<p>
</p><p>.club</p>
<p>.info</p>
<p>.online</p>
<p>.work</p>
<p>.top</p>
<p>.xyz</p>
<p>.space&nbsp;</p>
<p>.biz</p>
<p>.top</p>
<p>
</p><p>This gets around the issue of spammers changing the parts of their address between the @ and the final period/dot. &nbsp; So if a spammer uses &nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** in one email and then *** Email address is removed for privacy *** in the next, they'll both get routed to Junk Email. &nbsp;This seems to
 be very effective so far. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, I'd recommend adding this capability to the "Blocked Senders" section of the options. &nbsp;"Inbox and Sweep Rules" isn't the most intuitive place to look. &nbsp;Or simply allow users to specify *.xyz&nbsp;in the blocked senders list. &nbsp;</p>

            The image shows a clustered column chart where as the options you are being given would strongly suggest you have a stacked column chart. Did you check the chart sub-type as I suggested?<br />

            And that option is not available for stacked columns. Think about where the label would end up if you could position it outside end. It would actually appear in the next stacked section of the bar.<br />

<h2>            5800 not sending messages</h2>
                    
<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quite a few time recently my phone has decided not to send text or picture messages - or send them several times though they remain in the outbox as not being sent!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I turn the phone off for several hours (say overnight) it sometimes sorts itself out, but obviously I can't do that during the day!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done a search on the internet for messages not sending and some say the number might have been banned on my phone, but this isn't possible as I don't know how to bar the number(s) plus the messages aren't going through to my 2 main contacts!!!</p>

have you checked with your service provider that your sms settings are correct?

<p>I agree. The ability to download to any device is a MUST HAVE feature.</p>
<p>I hope Nokia fixes this SOON!</p>

<p>It makes sense that if it´s possible&nbsp;to ACCESS/BROWSE OVI store on a PC/laptop/whatever it seems OBVIOUS there shud be an option&nbsp;to :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;download to PC/Laptop (missing ??!)</p>
<p>2) send to my phone - and incur operator charges (ok, fair enuff)</p>
<p>3) send to a friend (ok, might be useful&nbsp;for Nokia marketing)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where 1) is HIGH priority and 3) is LOW priority</p>

<p>Most likely, Ovi Store only supports downloading directly to the phone, because Ovi Store has no real pirarcy prevention mechanisms (no license/activation keys, no copy protection/encryption, etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. The OMA DRM v1.0 forward-locking that Ovi Store supports for some content types (not all supported content types and not on all devices), is not a real piracy prevention mechanism.</p>

<p>However, if you're a real techie, you can extract the files once they're installed in your phone. Oh yeah, the freeware apps on Ovi are available on forum.dailymobile.se in downloadable to PC form.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>My first experience with the OVI store: a few days ago.</em></p>
<p><strong>Result?</strong> Shocked that the only option was to download to phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's as if <strong>Nokia </strong>think we all have <em>cheap data plans and internet on phones is as common as water</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of that they ignore <strong>decades worth of PC networks</strong>. The personal computer is the
<em>centre </em>of the digital universe, Nokia. Not some esoteric device nobody has or finds useful. There should absolutely be an option to download to PC. It's so obvious!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only reasons I can think for Nokia to insist on phone-only downloads is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>1) tracking you more effectively by identifying your phone and other personal data<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>2) reducing support costs on their staff</em>&nbsp; (no more "how do I put this on my phone?" questions from those downloading to computer first)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is truly bizarre the computer was ignored and not placed at the centre of their digital universe, but somehow this doesn't surprise me coming from Nokia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is an easy way of extracting the setup file from already-installed applications, giving more details to those users stuck with this
<strong>extremely restrictive</strong> problem would be very helpful.</p>

 us to protect your account" where it shows me that they will send me a message to my OLD phone number, which I already dun have anymore!!!

    <title>Windows 10 blank display during installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garethgarswood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 blank display during installation</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a serious problem with trying to install the WIN10 Tech Preview. I've tried various builds since early DEcember, including the latest 9926, and all are the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is a DELL Inspiron M5030 which previously had Win 7 64BIT installed with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During installation, it works fine until it gets to the 'Getting devices ready ...' prompt. Usually around 28% the display just goes blank - blue/black screen. The disk light shows there is still disk activity as though it is contiunuing with the installation.
 This goes on for 10minutes or so then all quiet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider myself to be an expert but theres nothing I can do if the screen goes blank! Obviously a driver issue and I've seen lots of posts relating to DELL but most of them at least have something on the screens.</p>
<ol>
<li>First attempt was to install over Win 7 - that failed.</li><li>Second attempt was to install as a dual boot system with WIN7 and WIN10 on separate partitions. I could 'see' the files on the WIN10 partition when I booted into WIN7 and suggested, in another post on this forum, I might be able to do something from there
 - intall a driver on WIN10 partition, edit one of the registry files etc., but didn't get a response except to wait for the build following 21st January</li><li>Third attempt was to install build 9926 on a reformatted hard drive - ie. nothing on it at all. That has also failed.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>All installations resulted in the same outcome - display blank in the midle of installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've left it for many hours - no change.</p>
<p>I've installed it with external LCD screen attached - no change.</p>
<p>I've selected a Repair -&gt; Troubleshoot etc. and eventually was able to select 'Low resolution mode' - no change with or without external monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No point contacting DELL for a display driver because as I can't see anything to be able to install the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft want users of legacy PC's - and the DELL 5030 is not that old - to upgrade to WIN 10 then they have to take note of this problem otherwise there will be 1,000's (if not 10's of 1,000's) of users who attempt to upgrade their WIN 7 machines and
 be left with a 'brick' - the majority will have no technical experience whatsover and will not be able to recover. Not good publicity for Microsoft trying to recover from the poor receipt of WIN 8!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gareth</p>

            <p><span>Hi Gareth,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As the hardware does not have the drivers, even the basic driver would not work with Windows 10, as it does not meet the requirements to install Windows 10.
<span>&nbsp;</span>You will have to upgrade the hardware or change the laptop if you need to install Windows 10.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Well, it is not possible to 'slipstream' the drivers to the ISO.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

            There is nothing you can do to prevent someone else from using your address when they sign up for a service.&nbsp; What will discourage them is that they won't get very far in the sign-up process if the service expects them to access a confirmation message
 and click some link in it to confirm because they'll never see that message since you own the mailbox and they don't have access to the message.

                    <p>Hello Team,<br />
<br />
Initially I purchased domain from GoDaddy. Then I have purchased <strong>Office 365 Email Essentials
</strong>from GoDaddy. However I am not able to configure emails for that particular domain. If I check in GoDaddy then it says<br />
<br />
"domain has already been used to set up an office 365 account at Microsoft"<br />
<br />
And ask me to login to Microsoft account and remove from there. But I do not have any credentials to login and do the needful (I never created any emails there).</p>

<div>Hi MohammedAlshehri26,</div>
<div><br />
<div>From the description, I understand that you have purchased Office 365 subscription and domain via syndicate partner GoDaddy. If you don't know what Office 365 account is currently using the custom domain or if you don't have control over the Office 365
 account that's currently using the custom domain, please contact GoDaddy support for further assistance.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regarding this point, we would truly appreciate your kind understanding.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Best regards,</div>
<div>Shyamal</div>
