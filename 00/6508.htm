    <title>Problem with Nokia CK-7W HandsFree Car Kit - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem with Nokia CK-7W HandsFree Car Kit</h2>
                    
<p>My wife&nbsp;recently bought a new car and the dealership installed a CK-7W bluetooth kit for us. However, we're having a really annoying problem with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every so often, at completely random times, the stero in the car switches off for just a second and a really loud and annoying "beep" comes through the car speakers. At first I thought it was something to do with the cars settings&nbsp;so I searched through the
 car manual and even phoned the dealership back. However, the guy who sold it to me didn't know what the problem was and advised me to bring it back to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a while until I can get back to the dealership, but I'm pretty sure the problem lies with the bluetooth kit rather than the car. The reason I say this is because the annoying beep coincides with whenever the bluetooth connection is lost with the mobile
 phone it's paired with i.e. I think the beep is happening when the bluetooth kit is switching itself off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife has a Sony Ericsson phone and I have a Nokia. I don't think the problem lies with the phones, because it happens no matter which phone is paired with it. It also happens when there isn't even a phone in the car or when both of our phones have the
 bluetooth switched off!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The manual provided with the kit (and available for download on this website) is totally useless. It barely explains how to use the kit properly or what each of the buttons/dials does. Also, there's a little light on the remote control button. Sometimes
 it's on, sometimes it's off, but most of the time it flashes. The manual says "The indicator light has three states: On. Flashing. Off." But, totally unhelpfully, it doesn't say what each of these states mean!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My guess is that the bluetooth kit is randomly switching itself on and off, and then when it does switch off that is when the beep happens. But the very unhelpful manual provided with the kit is giving me no clues as to whether this is normal or not, or
 how to stop it happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The random beep drives us absolutely crazy. It's really loud and makes you jump whenever it happens and there appears to be now way even to turn it down! It's spoling our enjoyment of the new car. I cannot believe this is normal for this bluetooth kit and
 I feel fairly sure there must be a simple way to turn this beep off. But as I say, the manual is totally useless, so I'm turning ti this board for help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please someone help me with this! Do you think I've got a faulty kit or is there a simple way to cure this problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi daveduck</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I expect that they were happy to charge you enough, but why fit an outdated unit such as CK-7W to a new vehicle? It doesn't have noise canceling features such as newer CK-100 anyway and you would probably be disappointed with it's performance if trying to
 use newer phones. If one of you was using cradle connection and the other Bluetooth, I might have seen a rationale behind fitting this unit with reservations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a way of stopping the "beeps" if the permanent +ve red wire is connected to same source as the IGN +ve Blue wire so unit reboots each time ignition is switched on, rather than being left permanently on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The going rate for using a non-accredited Nokia carkit installer is a bit cheaper for the dealer but you have got the worst of both world's, a fitter not really familiar with Nokia products and poor advice.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your reply scoobyman. I'm going to print out the bit you said about stopping the beeps and take it back to them so they can sort it for me!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm interested in what you've said about them fitting an outdated system. I don't actually know how much I've paid fot the kit because it was thrown in with one or two other extras during my bartering with them over the price of the car. In your opinion,
 should I be asking them to change this kit for the CK-100 you mentioned? Or if I decide to buy a CK-100 myself, how much should I expect to pay for one? Finally, would the CK-1oo definitely be compatible with a Sony Ericsson phone? (I don't know exactly which
 model phone she's got, but it's a fairly new one)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks again.</p>

<p>I would definitly get them to change the kit to a ck-100 this kit will work well will all new phones. The ck-7w worked well with Nokia phone but had problems pairing with other makes, i think the problem lies here. The loud bleep sounds like they have not
 used the correct loom for your car, you probably have a car with an amplified speaker system e.g. audi, mazda and you will need a loom to reduce the output to low level. Let us know how you get on.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having considerable trouble with OneDrive.&nbsp; I have Office 2016/365 and use Windows 7, 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched the internet to resolve the problem and I can't find the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open a new MSWord doc it is not automatically saving to OneDrive. When I click on "AutoSave" (upper left corner of the Word doc)&nbsp; a window appears giving me the option to save to OneDrive, when I select this I am not given the option to save it to
 a specific folder and I then cannot find it anywhere in my OnceDrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, if I do not click "AutoSave" and save it normally, it is not saved to OneDrive either even though the folder I've saved it in is a saved folder in OneDrive.&nbsp; I am so confused and have multiple documents and versions floating around that I am not
 finding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
<p>

            <p>Try removing your Virus checker if it's not Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to do a complete image of your system drive, preform a fresh install,&nbsp;then restore the system partition from the image back to the new system partition, and then try updating to the latest build.</p>

            Hi Raymond
<br />
<br />When that user activated Office 2019 on their PC, it became locked onto their Microsoft Office account and that cannot be removed from their account.
<br />
<br />If you are reselling Office licences, you need to be aware that Office 016 and Office 2019 licences do this, once they are installed buy a user.
<br />
<br />This means that whenever they need to re-install Office, they only need to log into their account on Office.com and click Install . . .

            Yes, I understand that.&nbsp; But the customer claimed that they never installed or activated the software, but license is still under their Microsoft account.&nbsp; They are wondering if there is a way to remove that from their account.&nbsp;

<p>Hi tariq1972,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting and welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Bluetooth you do not install device specific drivers. Instead both devices you want to pair need to have the required profiles in their Bluetooth implementation to work together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &nbsp;specifications for the&nbsp;<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/find-products/accessories/all-accessories/headsets/bluetooth-stereo-headsets/bh-503" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">BH-503</a>&nbsp;are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth version</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bluetooth version: 2.0 with EDR </li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<strong>Bluetooth profiles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Headset Profile (HSP) </li><li>Handsfree Profile (HFP) </li><li>Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) </li><li>Audio Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your computer needs to support the bluetooth version and the profiles specified to be able to pair with the BH-503.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps, let us know how you get on.</p>

<h2>            I can no longer convert works files to word. I get requires newer version of works converter error.</h2>
                    I have the installed latest version. I have reset office and removed and reinstalled the converter. No matter what I have tried I still get the error stating "This file requires a newer version of the Microsoft Works Converter than is currently on your
 system. Do you want to download the new converter so that you can work with this file."

<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>When I am using the mobile app and reply to a thread and add an attachment, the attachment adds multiple times even though I only added it once. Also, while sending the message/reply, it only shows the attachment added once. However when I check with
 sent folder, it shows the file was attached several times. Also the recipient confirms that they see the same file multiple times. How can I stop this? Example attached - the same file is attached 13 times.</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5f36b3c-ffc4-475b-b3b9-6982b0dc0d33?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5f36b3c-ffc4-475b-b3b9-6982b0dc0d33?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Unless you explicitly force them they may not stay in the current tab.&nbsp; Some are coded to open differently, for example, most of the links which are given as examples in this forum.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you might have more luck dragging and dropping the link somewhere
 in the current tab.</p>

            My IE just started doing this (nothing new installed).&nbsp; I started looking for answers and came upon this page.&nbsp; About two minute later, the behavior stopped on its own.&nbsp; So my advice for anyone else who comes upon this issue is to wait a few minutes and
 see if it goes away.&nbsp; It is very annoying though.

 I set-up something I wasn't suppose to. But I tried everything that I know. Can someone please help me out? I would really appreciate. Thanks.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello, you could try this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-clicking the page number field that is off in your document&nbsp;(I'm assuming it's in the footer) and selecting
<strong>Format Page Numbers </strong>from the contextual menu that appears.</li><li>The <strong>Page Number Format</strong> dialog box appears and in the <strong>
Page Number </strong>section click <strong>Continue from previous section.</strong></li></ol>
<p>If this doesn't do the trick, worst case scenario - you can set the <strong>Start at</strong> number to coincide with the respective page number&nbsp;it should be in your document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>At some point you must have restarted numbering at 23. Go to the first page 23 and use Insert | Header &amp; Footer | Page Number | Format Page Numbers. Set the page numbering to "Continue from previous section." Then go to the next section (an easy way to do
 this is to use the Browse arrows at the bottom of the vertical scroll bar, with the browse object set to Browse by Section). In each section, access the Format Page Numbers dialog and set "Continue from previous section."</p>
<p>If you don't have any Continuous section breaks, you can do this more easily in the header or footer (wherever the page numbers are), as you can use the Next button in the Navigation group on the contextual Header &amp; Footer Tools | Design tab to skip to the
 next section (you can also use the Page Number | Format Page Numbers command on the H&amp;F Tools tab).</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like it's not available there!</p>
<p>You can ask Excel team to add it from <a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304921-excel-for-windows-desktop-application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meanwhile, Hans's solution is the way to go but with some improvements as follows:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Sub ShrinktoFit()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Selection.ShrinktoFit = False Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.ShrinktoFit = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.ShrinktoFit = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This makes the macro work as a toggle button ON/OFF.</p>
<p>And no need for the error statement!</p>

            <p>This is not being done by Outlook since Outlook doesn't have a "Junk" folder of its own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most likely you have a 3rd party&nbsp;security suite (virus scanner)&nbsp;installed which does this. Disable this and try again. See:
<a href="http://www.msoutlook.info/question/20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Permanent Link to Disable virus scanner integration?">
Disable virus scanner integration?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it is an Exchange account, the filtering could also take place on another device which accesses this account. It is therefor best to turn off all of the other devices while troubleshooting this to verify which one is doing this. You could start with
 turning them all off and then use OWA to access your mailbox. If it still happens now, the scanning/moving takes place at Exchange level.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 for Mac Crashes and fails to open now......</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else suffered with Outlook 2016 crashing resulting in the application failing to open. &nbsp;I was trying to forward an invite at the time, when Outlook just crashed. &nbsp;However unlike other instances this time it fails to open, returning the same error
 every time, full crash log below. &nbsp;I have tried the obvious, as in rebooting but to no avail. &nbsp;i can still access my mailbox through the O365 web portal, so i know the mailbox is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking at a reinstall currently, but wondered if this has been seen before, or if there are any tips with investigating such a failure on a Mac, been using Mac's for years but only for the past 6 months for work so still learning the ropes</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running the latest OS 10.11.4 on a Macbook Air and was running the latest version of Office</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Dear ThangNguyen, Yes.. That is correct, Autodiscover should point to Onpremise, Service domain must already be pointing to Office365, for all port and autodiscover below are the references:</p>

<p>Hi Thang,</p>
<p>According to the error message, the issue occur due to the certificate used in the Autodiscover process is not matched with the Autodiscover DNS record.</p>
<p>Currently this is required when deploying hybrid, we don’t have any official ways to skip the checking part. For more details about the hybrid certificate requirements, please refer to:

<h2>            reconnect outlook 2016 to outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>I just followed the "Action" email from "Outlook" to reconnect my Windows 10 Outlook 2016 to Outlook.com.&nbsp; I read the instructions several times to make sure I followed them correctly.&nbsp; But the procedure resulted in two changes that have messed up my outlook.com
 account.&nbsp; First, it changed the name of my email account from my email address to "outlook_(long series of letters and numbers)@outlook.com", type Microsoft Exchange.&nbsp; It also locked down my email account by requiring a password in a small window with a gray
 background.&nbsp; I tried the only two passwords I have that are related to Outlook or Windows, but neither works.&nbsp; The password window offers no way to request my password be reset.&nbsp; I cannot find any help in Microsoft Support.&nbsp; I would greatly appreciate anyone's
 &nbsp;help!</p>

            <p>"Raymond Ave", thanks for your helpful suggestions.&nbsp; I apologize that I failed to add a few details.&nbsp; I am unable to open my outlook.com email in Outlook 2016 (which I prefer) on just one PC.&nbsp; But I AM able to open and use that email account in a web browser
 on that PC.&nbsp; Also, I can use the account in BOTH Outlook 2016 and a browser on my other PC.&nbsp; Since I am able to access the email account online on both PCs and in Outlook 2016 on the first PC, I am reluctant to "recover" my account, since it doesn't seem to
 be broken.&nbsp; It would appear the problem is in the way the account is installed in Outlook 2016 on the first PC.&nbsp; To complicate matters, I originally opened my outlook.com account with a non-Microsoft email address.&nbsp; I hope this makes sense.&nbsp; Thanks! NelsonYY</p>

            <p>Nelson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the first issue with the extra characters in the email address I have seen this be caused by the primary alias in Outlook.com not being correct.&nbsp; To workaround this issue go to
<a href="https://account.live.com/names/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the second issue with the authentication prompts double check if you are using two factor auth.&nbsp; Log into
<a href="http://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.outlook.com</a> to make sure your credentials work there. If you previously setup Two-Step Verification, follow the guidance in this topic to create a new App Password to connect to
 Outlook 2016 or Outlook 2013, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-two-step-verification</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have confirmed your password is correct then the authentication prompt is likely a bug.&nbsp; We are currently investigating a fix.&nbsp; The issue has to do with credential issues with&nbsp;IPv6.&nbsp; If you want to try a workaround try setting "Prefer IPv4 over IPv6
 in prefix policies" by clicking the Download Link for it in this KB article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/EN-US/kb/929852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/EN-US/kb/929852</a>.&nbsp; After setting this policy you have to reboot for it to take effect.&nbsp;

            <p>Dean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check if you need to reconnect by&nbsp;doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Open Outlook</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Click File, Account Settings, Account Settings</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; In the Email Accounts dialog locate your Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it shows as Type <strong>Exchange ActiveSync</strong> then you need to remove it and add it back or create a new profile per instructions in this topic,
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Reconnect-Outlook-2016-or-Outlook-2013-to-Outlook-com-for-uninterrupted-email-access-cda1751d-9503-40bf-bf76-e79454ac5eb3?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>After you reconnect your account you can confirm it is connected correctly doing the same steps above and when the Type shows as
<strong>Microsoft Exchange</strong>.&nbsp; Connecting as Exchange is a much more robust experience and supports a lot more features.&nbsp; The Outlook.com team will be&nbsp;blocking Exchange ActiveSync&nbsp;starting next week so important to get this done if you want uninterrupted
 email sync in the Outlook client.</p>

            <p>A few weeks ago, I received a "Final" notice to reconnect, to avoid losing my Outlook connection.&nbsp; I made myself reread the instructions several times, and tried to analyze if I understood them correctly, and which option I should follow.&nbsp; I decided to follow
 option 2 and first remove my account, then reinstall it.&nbsp; Voila!&nbsp; It seems to have to worked.&nbsp; So far, I have had no problems.&nbsp; Thanks to everyone for your input.&nbsp; Sorry if I wasted time for anyone.&nbsp; I hope everyone else was successful also.</p>

            <p>Hi Dean - I am having issues ATM with the reconnect.&nbsp; We have 6 family email accounts operating on&nbsp; Outlook 2016 - have followed the directions to reconnect all accounts but are experiencing major&nbsp;issues with one account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 5 that have successfully reconnected, and are in working order, all show up as type
<strong>Exchange ActiveSync <em>not as</em> Microsoft Exchange </strong>regardless of how many times the accounts are removed and re-added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 1 account with major issues says that it is successfully completed but does not show any emails.&nbsp; Logging into this account in a web browser shows that the update is effective - the new logo &amp; formats are visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really at a loss - this has been going on for weeks now and I'm really frustrated by the lack of assistance from Microsoft and would really appreciate some help and some results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>James</p>

<h2>            Windows insider Greenscreen Error code KERNEL_AUTO_BOOST_LOCK_AQUISITION_WITH_RAISED_IRQL</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently encountered an error with windows insider build 17763 (full version number: 10.0.17763). I got the error code indicated in the subject of&nbsp;KERNEL_AUTO_BOOST_LOCK_AQUISITION_WITH_RAISED_IRQL I am not sure what caused it, as I was watching Netflix.
 I do have an overclocked i5-8600K running at 4.74GHZ on all cores. I have attached the .DMP and the .NFO as a onedrive&nbsp;link. If there is anything else I can provide, please let me know.</p>

            That is kinda what I thought but the OP seemed to have no idea that it could have been one of the recovery or system partitions. So I answered like it could have been a normal drive as I had an E: drive with my Windows 7 on it.:)<br />

<h2>            Scan colors inverted</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 and Office 2007. When I scan a document with either Office Doc Scanning or Office Doc Imaging, the data is white and the background is black.&nbsp; How do I reverse that?

            In Microsoft Office Document Imaging, click the Scanner... button. Change it from the WIA scanner to the one that just displays the name of your scanner. When you print now, everything should be back to normal again.

    <title>How to re-apply filter in protected worksheet in Excel for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to re-apply filter in protected worksheet in Excel for Mac &#40;Office 365&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have locked a worksheet (with certain cells unlocked) and need other users to be able to reapply the filters I have set when they enter data in the unlocked cells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping they could click on 'Home' (ribbon)- 'Sort &amp; Filter' - 'Reapply', but this option is greyed out even if I ensure that the protection settings allow users of the sheet to 'Sort' and 'Filter'. As soon as I remove protection, the 'Reapply' option
 becomes available. Is there anyway to make it available when the sheet is protected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help much appreciated!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nick.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To answer your query, you can only reapply filter when the sheet is not protected.
</p>
<p>
