                    <p>I've had an activated copy of Windows 10 since it was free. I just changed the mobo in my computer, and now it didn't retain the activation status when I reformatted my hard drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have my code for my Windows 8.1 anymore and the troubleshooter cant authenticate me. How can I solve this?</p>

<p>Changing the motherboard can invalidate the license depending on the type of Windows 8.1 license you upgraded from: retail or OEM preinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</span></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that
 licensing too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Full version (Retail):</span></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Upgrade version (Retail):</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>OEM :</span></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What happens if I change my motherboard?</span></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<span>OEM license&nbsp;</span>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase
 a full retail Windows 10 license.&nbsp;<span>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><span>b. Stand-alone software.</span>&nbsp;If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you.
 You may also transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the
 software came on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If its an OEM preinstall, then you will need to purchase a new Windows 10 license.</p>

<h2>            Intel Compute Stick and 1511 &#40;b10586&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Any news on progress for update of Intel Compute Stick?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The November update is no longer offered, but b10240 is not as performant as Windows 8.1 on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel is saying that them and Microsoft are investigating the matter, it would be nice to be fed back on progress,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>just as a good PR gesture :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I wrote elsewhere, a Win 2 Go USB stick works well, so that could help with debugging the cause of the mis-installation on the actual eMMC.</p>

            <p>An interesting finding from an Intel forum just came to my attention:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">I've had many problems as listed by multiple users (windows install freezing at different
 stages) but finally managed to install windows 10 (latest build 10565) without copying over any apps or settings and almost instantly either after logging in or left on the logon screen it crashes.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">Mouse cursor moves but can't do anything. After restarting and loading into safe mode everything
 is fine. After loads of testing and changing the startup services loaded (via msconfig) I managed to narrow the problem down to the wireless adapter. With that disabled I can load up windows 10 fine and nice and stable.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">Not exactly useful though as the intention is for me to use my ICS as a network streaming
 device :S At the moment I've re-installed windows 8.1 and going to install windows 10 (build 10240) as other users seemed to say this works. Fingers crossed! But all in all looks like my problems (and potentially others) is the wifi drivers/adapter. I'm hoping
 a driver update will solve all!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">
Interesting finding, disabling the Wifi adapter, never tried that.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">
That does not account for the fact that a Win To Go stick loaded with 10586 works perfectly with the Wifi on.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">
I thought it was a USB controller issue bad interaction with the internal eMMC drive, as it probably shares the USB controller.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">
So a solution would be to either install it on the eMMC, disable Wifi and use an external Wifi dongle</p>
<p style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">
or what I actually prefer, use</p>
<p style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">
a Win To Go Enterprise USB an d keep internally either Win 8.1 or Win 10 10240.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">
Either way, one has to use an external USB to have 10586 working.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">
This is not ideal, until Intel and Microsoft fix this issue.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">
I still believe it is a USB controller issue / conflict with the eMMC channel.</p>

    <title>70-411 Exam Retake Policy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike_776  say:</h3>
<h2>            70-411 Exam Retake Policy</h2>
                    <p>I failed the 70-411 exam for the 2nd time in a 12 month period on January 17, 2017. I know the retake policy says that I will&nbsp;need to wait 14 days before I retake the exam a 3rd time.&nbsp;I understand&nbsp;this to&nbsp;mean that the&nbsp;soonest that&nbsp;I can take the exam for
 the 3rd time, will be&nbsp;on January 31, which is exactly&nbsp;14 days after January 17. However the policy is a little vague. Does it mean that I will need to wait&nbsp;14 days and then on the 15th day I can retake the exam, or just 14 days? Thank you for any assistance
 that you can provide!</p>

            The solution to your problem is to click on the speech recognition microphone first before you open Word.&nbsp; Once the speech recognition is started, right click on it, click on options, enable the&nbsp; dictation scratchpad and then open Word.&nbsp; If you do it in
 this order everything should work fine in Word.&nbsp; The scratchpad will not come up.&nbsp; All the command will work right within Word itself.&nbsp; If you open Word first before the speech recognition and do not enable the scratchpad - "command not available" will come
 up.&nbsp; Hope this helps.&nbsp; <br />

<p>Hi Judy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two ways on how you can connect your printer to your computer. You can either connect the device through USB or wireless connection. Now, if you want to connect it through USB, make sure that you install the printer driver first before proceeding
 to the setup. And if you want to connect it through WiFi or wireless connection, just simply connect your printer to your WiFi network, then add network printers to your PC through the Device.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, you may also go to the manufacturer's website where you can follow the step by step procedure on how to connect or add printer to your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you're able to connect your printer to your PC. Send us a reply.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth Headset Will not Connect</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. I have a lenovo x200 running win7 64bit.</p>
<p>Purchased a Plantronics 975 Headset that can connect to two different devices (phone and laptop).</p>
<p>After pairing for the 1st time to the x200 (after it was paired with the phone). It worked OK.</p>
<p>Since then, it will not reconnect. Attempts to remove and pair again did not help.</p>
<p>On the Bluetooth settings, I have checked the "Control Skype Calls using a hands-free device"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Set up the Bluetooth enabled device so that your computer can find it.</p>
<p>To do this, you must first:</p>
<p>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn the device on.</p>
<p>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;Make it discoverable.</p>
<p>When a Bluetooth enabled device is in discovery mode, it broadcasts a wireless signal that allows it to be detected by other devices or computers. This is sometimes called pairing mode. When most devices are discoverable, they are also in pairing mode, ready
 to be paired with your computer.</p>
<p>To learn how to make a device discoverable, check the information that came with your device or go to the manufacturer‚Äôs website. Methods for making a device discoverable can vary widely from one type of device to the next. Some Bluetooth enabled devices
 are always in discovery mode. Others, such as most mobile phones, need to be placed in discovery mode by selecting discovery from a software menu or pressing a button on the device. Discovery buttons can be very small and hard to spot, often placed on the
 bottom of a mouse, keyboard, or similar device. The button may be labeled with the word "connect," or another similar term; a Bluetooth logo; or it may not be labeled at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: To control how your computer pairs with Bluetooth enabled devices</strong></p>
<p>You can set several options for how your computer finds (or is found by) Bluetooth enabled devices.</p>
<p>1. Open Control Panel by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;In the Control Panel search box, type Bluetooth, and then click <strong>Change Bluetooth settings</strong>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;In the Bluetooth Settings dialog box, click the<strong> Options</strong> tab and do any of the following:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;To make your computer discoverable to Bluetooth enabled devices, select the check box for
<strong>Allow Bluetooth devices to find this computer</strong>.</p>
<p>When a Bluetooth enabled computer is in discovery mode, it broadcasts a wireless signal that allows it to be detected by other computers or devices. This is sometimes called pairing mode. If you check this box, your computer will still be able to detect
 Bluetooth enabled devices that are in discovery mode, but they will not be able to detect your computer.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%25207%2fMain%2f8%2f2%2f8213b463-e8f0-4f63-8a17-643e1bef46a9%2f8213b463-e8f0-4f63-8a17-643e1bef46a9.jpg" /><span>The
 Options tab in the Bluetooth Settings dialog box</span></p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong></p>
<p>To help protect your computer, only make your computer discoverable when you want a Bluetooth enabled device to find your computer.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow you to add Bluetooth enabled devices to your computer, select the check box for Allow Bluetooth devices to connect to this computer.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;To be notified when a Bluetooth enabled device is trying to connect to your computer, select the check box for Alert me when a new Bluetooth device wants to connect.</p>
<p>If your computer does not recognize the Bluetooth device follow the below mentioned method.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: My computer doesn't recognize my Bluetooth enabled device.</strong>
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several things to try:</p>
<p>¬∑&nbsp;Remove and then reinstall the device:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Click the Start button, click Control Panel, click Hardware and Sound, and then click Bluetooth Devices.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Select the device that's not working, and then click Remove.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Click Add, press the reset button on the device (or make it discoverable following the manufacturer's instructions), select the My device is set up and ready to be found check box, and then click Next.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;If the device is not found, repeat the previous step. When the device is found, select it, and then click Next.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Follow the rest of the instructions in the wizard.</p>
<p>¬∑&nbsp;Make sure the device is turned on and that the batteries don't need to be replaced.</p>
<p>¬∑&nbsp;Make sure the Bluetooth adapter for your computer is attached and turned on, and that the device is turned on and discoverable. If you're not sure how to turn on discoverability, read the instructions that came with the device or check the manufacturer's
 website.</p>
<p>¬∑&nbsp;Make sure that you installed the device using the correct program. If not, reinstall the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            What is requiring use of the Product Key?   The reason I ask is that these are not used normally in Windows 10 Activation except for retail packaged copies that come with the key enclosed.   Factory OEM is embedded in BIOS chip,  free Upgrade is a Digital License recorded in MS Activation servers with your PC's hardware ID - these both self-activate.  See also:  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/activation-in-windows-10

A tool to read a lost retail or embedded OEM-BIOS key is here:   http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip

            Hello Angel, Thank you for trying but that didn't work. Took ages to repair but when I went to WLM it asked me to log in again, I did so and then closed it down. When I tried to access my mail again I got the same log in message. Nothing seems to have
 changed.

            Hello Angel, update on my problem with having to log in every time to WLM, I am still being asked to log in every single time but now if I click on the x at the top without putting my password in the page closes down and I can continue to read my mail.
 I suppose this is marginally better than having to log in but it hasn't resolved the question.

    <title>Why does my controller keep disconnecting&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does my controller keep disconnecting&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Two days ago my controller started disconnecting randomly while playing. At first I thought it was my battery, so i switched it out, and it still kept disconnecting. I reset my Xbox by holding the power button and the controller works for a while(sometimes
 an hour or more). The issue seems to be connected with Xbox live, since sometimes i lose live connection as the controller disconnects. I tried resetting my console to factory default, but that didn't work. I'm extremely frustrated, and about ready to switch
 to a PS4, PLEASE HELP!!!</p>

<p>Here are a few possible causes and solutions to your problem buddy:</p>
<p>1. Is it possible that during your epic gaming moments that you move around? Possibly tapping or smacking your controller? If so then you are loosening the batteries within the slot. If this is possible, you've already damaged your controller. This is what
 i had done to Xbox 360 controller and whenever I moved, the controller would cut off. Try staying calm when you hit those 360 no-scopes or them across map projectile kill.
</p>
<p>2. Is it possible that you are sitting too far away from the console? After those 720-double-y-no-scope kills, do you travel away from your console? This too may be the cause as the Xbox has a set radius of wireless connectivity. Moving out of that radius
 will result in the controller shutting off.</p>
<p>3. Is it possible that during long nights of owning some zombies and creepers and building epic mansions, you may have switched out dead batteries withe dead batteries on accident? This shouldn't disconnect you then allow hours of game play but could still
 could be the problem. Hey! Go buy some batteries bro! Can't keep owning those endermen and slaying the enderdragon without refilling the sticks!</p>

<p>The wifi cards are the fault of the disconnect issues. I replaced mine on Friday and have not had a single disconnect yet.. The fact that you're losing both at the same time is in fact the card. Ost people usually lose the ability to keep sync with the controller
 while others have issues with the wifi. Try connecting the console using a network cable, if you stop losing connection to live then your issue lies with the wifi card. You can buy the cards used, I recommend eBay because of their buyer protection. You can
 look up videos and illustrations on how to take the console apart to replace the card. It's relatively easy to do.</p>

<p>I am having that same issue as well. I spent $149 to send the system out for repair after buying another controller and charge and play kit. Only for it to stop working again 6 months later. You think xbox would have said send it back and we will send you
 a brand new one or something but nope. My button to sync the controller does nothing. I can't even play if the controller is connected to the console with a USB cable.

<p>I am talking about the sync button on the console. I have updated the controllers as well. I just got off the phone with customer support and they confirmed that is my console since I have done all the steps and walked him thru them while I did them. Do
 you all think that xbox said we will repair or replace it for free? Nope! I will have to now pay $135 to have my Xbox fixed.

<p>I have had the exact same problem since day one, I thought it was a bug to be ironed out - er nope still there. I have mine connected via ether net cable and don't get kicked off live but I do still lose my controller connection even though i never use wirless
 as that just won't stay connected for long.</p>
<p>I often have to rest the xbox which fixes it for that session. Still bloody annoying. I did send my console off for repair but I think they just erased my hard drive and entertainment it back.</p>
<p>I've heard that replacing the wifi helps, this has been occurring a long time, coincidentally I'm on my third controller, they seem to break too easily (all differing faults, I also take great care of my stuff)</p>

<p>I'm still running strong with no disconnects. Your best bet is to go on eBay and find a used wifi card. It is rather simple to replace especially with the tutorials available on YouTube as well as the web. The card cost me about $20 shipped and took all
 of 10 minutes to replace. I tried starting a class action lawsuit because of this but all the firms I contacted won't take the case. Seems either they're afraid of Microsoft or take it as a joke when I mention it's about a video game console. The other problem
 is when you send it in all they do is send you out a refurbished unit that sometimes ends up having the same issue either right away or a little ways down the road. All in all save the $100, buy the card and install it yourself. Oh, and don't fall for anyone
 trying to sell them as new or you'll end up wasting your money.</p>

<h2>            wow64.dll file locked on windows 7 home edition</h2>
                    wow64.dll is locked on my windows 7 home edition.&nbsp; It is inaccessible even after "full control" permission was granted for the User through Properties, Security.&nbsp; I receive an error message frequently that the specified module cannot be found and I assume
 its because the final destination, wow64.dll, is locked.&nbsp; I dont know what to do. Should I delete it and try to reinstall? Anyway, please give me some suggestions. Thanks<br />

<p><span>Hi </span>sksultan578<span>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When your laptop battery is no longer working normally, there‚Äôs a chance that the battery itself or your motherboard has a static charge. In order to make it work normally again, you‚Äôll need to discharge it. To do this, follow these workarounds:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #1 - Discharge your battery:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Shutdown your computer.</span></li><li><span>Remove your laptop batter temporarily.</span></li><li><span>While it was removed, press the power button for 15 seconds to drain it.</span></li><li><span>Re-attach the battery again and start your computer.</span></li><li><span>Once started, press <strong><span>Windows + X</span></strong> and click
<strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Expand the <strong><span>Batteries</span></strong> category.</span></li><li><span>Uninstall the <strong><span>Microsoft ACPI Compliant Control Method Battery</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Go to the menu and click <strong><span>Action &gt; Scan for hardware changes</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Wait for <strong><span>Windows</span></strong> to scan your computer for available resources for this hardware.</span></li><li><span>Restart your computer.</span></li><li><span>Check if your battery is now charging.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #2 </span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">-
</span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Update your BIOS and chipset drivers.
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can check </span><span>your computer manufacturer‚Äôs official website and look for the section that is related to driver downloads.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #3 ‚Äì Replace the laptop battery.</span></strong><span> We would like to know if you have a spare battery for your laptop. If yes, can you test if the issue will still happen to the other battery? The error "<strong>plugged
 in, but not charging</strong>" persist because your laptop is now depending on the AC power adapter and it is now caused by a motherboard issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #4 ‚Äì Contact your computer manufacturer.</span></strong><span> If you still experiencing this issue after performing the steps above, you may need to request for a service warranty from your computer manufacturer.
 They will help you repair your computer for both hardware and software issues or best, replace the battery or the motherboard itself. Visit their support website directly to find their contact details for on-site repair services.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I‚Äôll reply to you as soon as I can.</span></p>

<p>Hello, did this issue begin after installing any new programs? Is this a laptop? I've seen this happen before and updating touchpad drivers has helped. Please also do a complete scan with your antivirus. Please post back with more information if this doesn't
 help. </p>

<p><span>Hi BingMeASunkist ‚Äì Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community.<br />
<br />
AFAIK, programs that require updates must bypass UAC safely and,<br />
if they are used by a Standard User then an administrator password<br />
is required (e.g. works as permission). <br />
<br />
I hope you find this information useful. If you need any further assistance,<br />

connect to the internet safely and download information (updates or music). <span>

<p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>High CPU usage on Windows Media Player can be caused by having too many information stored in the Library. We suggest following the steps below to resolve the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Open <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Turn Windows feature on or off</strong>.</li><li>Open <strong>Media Features</strong> and untick Windows Media Player.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> the <strong>OK</strong> and then reboot the computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>When the computer restarted, perform the steps 1 to 5 again and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to us if you need further assistance.</p>

<h3> thecritter93  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Can&#39;t See the App Bar</h2>
                    Hi, when I mouse into the left hand corner no little window shows up with what the next app is, and the list of open apps doesn't appear when I mouse down from there (but little clear boxes do). It used to work fine before I upgraded, so I wasn't sure
 if it was supposed to be like this or not. My investigations suggest that there is something wrong. Any ideas how to fix this? Thanks! - Emily

            Hi,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's been a few days and it literally just happened again. I noticed it when I was trying to watch a movie using the video app (I usually use VLC) and it wouldn't load (I left it for around 5mins - the file works fine) and ended up just exiting out. This is
 when I noticed that the app bar was missing again. Any idea why it keeps doing this? It's so frustrating!

<p>Also keep in mind that the app bar will only show up if you have already opened a Windows Store app.&nbsp; If you haven't used any since the last time you logged in, the app bar won't have anything to show and so it won't be there.</p>

            Nope, no updates, but I did install xbox smartglass for the first time today (i didn't have it prior to the last problem, so I don't think that's relevant). I also haven't turned my pc off since I did the restore on the 1st, and have 3 apps open currently
 - xbox 360 smartglass, mail and settings. All I've done since is work on a word doc, use google chrome, check emails on mail, mess around with smartglass, watch a few videos (using vlc and videos), and call on skype (desktop not app). Something is up with
 the videos app (it just wouldn't load and after I closed it it didn't show up on apps bar but was still open in task manager), but that's fine cause I usually use vlc anyway.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Just to recap the problem since I can't show you a screenshot (it doesn't show up). When I mouse into the left corner the little preview window doesn't show up with the next app to switch between, and when mousing down from there it doesn't bring up the
 bar with the other open apps.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not sure how much of that is relevant/useful to you, but there you go.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hey VenomGoesDeep,</p>
<p>that's indeed a curious issue, I would like to ask you to refrain from mentioning other players GT's in this thread though, If an enforcement team member is needed you can PM them the Gamertag if necessary.</p>
<p>now, if I may ask, what kind of error pop up is displaying when you try to remove the friend?</p>

<p>Did this ever get resolved? We're having the same problem.. &nbsp;A gamer just appeared in our friend list today, we didn't invite nor ask them. &nbsp;Now we can't get rid of them. &nbsp;Keep getting the same error as mentioned above. Very frustrating!</p>

            <p>Hey there, CrummyLoki6! This thread is a bit old. We currently have a service alert up about friends lists on our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Live Service Status</a> page. If that is removed and you are still running into issues, please post up a new thread detailing what you're seeing and troubleshooting you've already completed.
