<p>On a similar note my Excel 2010 slowed down on saves just after installing Visual Studio. I need to open and update 8 or so spreadsheets at one time, saving them took a second or so, now they go one at a time, 1/2 a second each. You might not have VS installed,
 but how about your virus checker, is that affecting file saves?</p>

            Thanks Paul.&nbsp; I uninstalled my previous Virus software last night and have reinstalled a new one and did a full virus scan to see if that helps.&nbsp; I'm also wondering if I have a corrupt file that is making it slow down.&nbsp; I'll give these both a try. Thanks
 again.

<p>All I meant was to temporarily disable your virus checker to see if it makes any difference. Are you saving on a local file or network drive, or on some form of removable storage?</p>

            I have a 18-month old hi-spec laptop running Win 7. I have been running Visio 2003 on it since I had it and the time taken to save a file the first time after opening up Visio has always been excessive. I recently downloaded the trial version of Visio
 2010 Premium (32-bit as it needs to run alongside older Office 32-bit products) hoping that it would be able to save files quicker. It doesn't. I just created a new drawing file that is just 314KB, but Visio 10 took 3 minutes 45 secs to save it, during which
 time it showed the (not responding) message at the top of the Window. After this long save period, the system worked normally again and subsequent saves took only 2-3 seconds. I get similar delays the first time I use the page setup and print dialogs. What
 is going on and can you help fix this horrible bug? Alan Cassidy

    <title>Problems &#38; bad design with Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sailorkane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems &#38; bad design with Mail</h2>
                    <p>Mail looks like a major leap backwards. &nbsp;I synced my email and it decided to get the bodies and headers of the emails out of sync in Mail. &nbsp;So if I clicked on an email, it would say it was from person A, but the body was email B, and body of email A was
 farther down the line. &nbsp;A couple hundred emails were like this. &nbsp;Total blunder/bug in the program. &nbsp;The design of the calendar portion of Mail is even worse than Live Mail. &nbsp;Can't see the colors on the screen, even with "bright colors", which is apparently
 the only color option. &nbsp;This makes the program useless. &nbsp;Going to android to manage calendar, probably email as well. &nbsp;Only thing left to MS is Office. &nbsp;If it weren't for the hours I have invested in excel and word, I'd be able to dump my PC in the trash,
 and good riddence. &nbsp;Someday, android will have an acceptable word and excel alternative....</p>
<p>As a question: &nbsp;1) anyone else have the mail sync problem and found a solution?</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;Anyone else have either a way to fix the calendar part of mail or can suggest a free/cheap alternative?</p>

 video calling. Could you please rectify this issue. I am strongly considering moving to other platforms since this issue has been haunting me since more than a month now.</p>

<p>I have a HTC Mogul as well. I am&nbsp;having problems with installing this Voice Command software. I purchased it today, tried to install but it didn't work at all. Then I read online that&nbsp;it must be&nbsp;installed on the main device
 so I removed it from the SD card and moved it to the main device. Again, it would not install. I then removed the file from all memory and reinstalled&nbsp;it again to get the same error message each time: 'usppc_full_new.exe&nbsp;is not a valid PocketPC application.
 (Of course, I soft reset my device each time between installs)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is anyone else having this problem? I have looked over many websites attempting to find a solution but cannot. I am a newbie to PPC's and am totally stumped as to what to do.
<strong>Any help would be appreciated?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really want this to work. I love voice recognition not the dumb set up voice tags. I don't want to waste the $40+ I spent. Suggestios? Comments? Feedback?</p>

 I am very disappointed that there is no help online or by voice to help with this Voice Command software product.</p>

I flashed my PPC6800 with a newer WM6! Note that the newer version did not show it as updating anything major but what the heck. Then I installed VC 1.6 on the fresh system and it installed correctly. It did not work with the bluetooth headset, reset did not
 do it but I&nbsp;reinstalled&nbsp;VC again and it worked?<br />
<br />
In the past working with MS products, uninstalling/reinstalling has helped. I guess they do not know how to install in their own OS.<br />
<br />
Now in a month or so there will be a new firmware&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;6800&nbsp;an update for EVO rev A, I hope it&nbsp;all works after that.<br />

            An update, I have never gotten the Bluetooth H700 to work right, it seems to hear some command and skip others? In general I would have to say VC 1.6 is NOT ready for WM6. I am considering returning the 4 copies of VC&nbsp;1.6 our office bought.<br />

<p>I finally got VC installed on my Mogul. Unlike other files that you can put either in phone memory or SD card, VC must first installed on your PC then synched to the Mogul in phone memory. Like stedj, I have a Moto H700 and cannot get it to work directly.
 I can say a name, it will find the name and repeat it back to me but when I confirm with either saying yes or correct. It is relly not worth it without a bluetooth to use. In reading various sites, many people are having the confirm problem. Microsoft VC site
 says the BT must have a Microsoft stack. Does anyone know of what BT's have a Microsoft stack? I thought the H700 did but cannot find any direct specs. Any suggestions are appreciated.

<p>
<span>Anyone tried this hack? Did your BT work properly with VC and Mogul after trying it? Hey, stedlj, this may be our answer. How do you do this? I assume this is a registry change? I

<p><span>Some WebPages specify exactly where text should print on the page. If the webpage you're printing specifies

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to Windows Live</h2>
                    I bought a Nokia Lumia today and have been trying to download the Marketplace so I can use the phone. I was told to sign in to my Windows account to do this but repeated attempts I was just told "We're having a problem connecting to Windows Live". I have
 checked my internet connection and signal so this error is not the fault of mine, how can I get this to work? My phone is redundant without the Marketplace app.

            Official support for WP7 devices like your 7-year old Lumia 710 ended in 2014. Judging by many other similar reports from users it seems that you can no longer set up a default MS account on such devices. I would strongly recommend that you return the
 phone and get your money back if you can, then buy a different phone.<br />

<p>Free trial and/or full product.</p>
<p>I need to ultimately upgrade to this, but need to see if i can load this to import my old Access 2002 database.</p>
<p>Old Access program will not start.</p>

            <p>Microsoft no longer sells 2007. They consider it obsolete (I consider it the best version they have).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll need to buy it from a third party vendor such as Amazon or a computer store.</p>

            <p>By the way, i already have parts of Office 2007 on this machine, not fully licensed yet, but i'm wondering how i can tell if Access 2007 is on the machine, just not installed?</p>
<p>I see from the start menu under Office i have for 2007 Excel, OneNote, PowerPoint, and Word, but not Access.&nbsp; Either it was not bundled or it has not been activated.</p>
<p>Maybe even this was an Home&nbsp;&amp; Student pack.&nbsp; I'm not sure, since i don't have any disks to reference.&nbsp; I think on this machine all my install files are loaded on the machine.</p>

            <p>My guess would be that Access is not installed. To find out search your My Programs folder (and subfolders) for msaccess.exe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Access was not included in the basic or the Home/Student Office2007 package; you had to either buy it separately or buy the Office Pro suite.</p>

It should work fine in 2010. 2010 should run on Vista. It runs on XP.

            <p>Thanks for the info.</p>
<p>Let me step back again.</p>
<p>My main issue is that i can't start any of my Microsoft Office XP Professional products anymore.</p>
<p>Possibly a registration issue or something else.</p>
<p>It keeps closing due to DEP protection.</p>
<p>Since i can't seem to solve the DEP or other issues i'm having with this, my thought is are there any other ways that i can get that database exported, maybe via command line options, or copied to a backup somewhere or any other ideas.</p>
<p>I can't shell out hundreds of dollars if it isn't going to work.</p>
<p>If my last resort is to forget it i'm really in a pickle</p>
<p>i know i should have got off of the Microsoft Office XP Professional suite years ago, but found it way to comfortable to work with what we had and didn't want to go off the Vista platform.</p>
<p>This is still no excuse, just didn't make it a priority to upgrade.</p>
<p>This will be a tough lesson to learn if is can't get it.</p>
<p>As you probably know by now, i have several threads out to diff places on this issue, and haven't been able to get any concrete feedback that has helped my issues.&nbsp; Unfortunately, just more questions.</p>
<p>i.e. the whole DEP and 'bcdedit.exe' issue that vista is forcing me to use.</p>
<p>I find no helpful info about using 'bcdedit' for my issue at all.</p>
<p>frusted and rambling...</p>

<h2>            &#34;Sorry, we can&#39;t sign you in.&#34; error in Halo&#58; Spartan Strike</h2>
                    <p>I just bought this app 2 days ago and every time I launch it on either my Lumia 640 (Windows 10 Mobile Preview Build 10586) or my Windows 10 PC I get this error. I've tried signing in at Xbox.com and launching the game from the Xbox app itself and no luck.
</p>
<p>I really hope I didn't waste 6 dollars on this.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a7e0396-77ed-4d77-84a2-1357838b613c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a7e0396-77ed-4d77-84a2-1357838b613c" /></a></p>

            <p>Not running insider previews as of late but have had this issue from time to time.</p>
<p>The new xbox app has an option to check internet status, it will check udp, ports, nat&nbsp;</p>
<p>configuration, protocols and security level.</p>
<p>Next check xbox status from the man xbox website under the help options; I would login first.</p>
<p>If &nbsp;the above items are not an issue I would then check the router-modem if it is letting the required tcp ,udp and port protocols to work.</p>
<p>Last, check what firewall and antivirus is in use on the system is allowing &nbsp;the program to connect, &nbsp;protocols and ports are open.</p>
<p>If xbox is having any issues it could affect some but not all games connecting to the service.</p>
<p>An option to be contacted when the services is fixed is available.</p>
<p>From my own experience, much of the xbox services are piggybacked on each other.</p>
<p>So an xbox one or 360 issue seems to overlap and affect pc services also. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

<p>Do you also have "Microsoft Office Desktop Apps" installed?<br />
This is the Windows Store version of Office 365 which comes pre-installed (but not automatically licensed) on some new computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove that before installing Office 365 for Business as they don't mix well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, you'll now have to remove both&nbsp;<span>Microsoft Office Desktop Apps</span> and&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Office 365 for Business, reboot</span> the computer and then re-install
<span>Office 365 for Business afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
D</span>oing an Online Repair on your Office 365 for Business installation after uninstalling&nbsp;Microsoft Office Desktop Apps might suffice already as well in most cases.</p>

    <title>Referencing Shapes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mpgaaaa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Referencing Shapes</h2>
                    <p>I have three shapes that I'm using to dynamically&nbsp;create a single shape through VBA.&nbsp; The main shape (a circle)&nbsp;with&nbsp;a Character and a Number in the circle.&nbsp; I'm grouping these three shapes together to make a single shape I can move on the worksheet.&nbsp; I
 have five of these shapes that have different color circles with different characters and numbers in them.&nbsp; As an example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>RedA1</p>
<p>BlueA1</p>
<p>GreenB1</p>
<p>PinkC2</p>
<p>YellowD1</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these five shape groups are grouped into one single group called imgGrp_Circles, so the Shape Selection Pane on my sheet looks like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- imgGrp_Circles</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - RedA1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red_Circle</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - BlueA1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blue_Circle</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - GreenB1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Green_Circle</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - PinkC2</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pink_Circle</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - YellowD1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yellow_Circle</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is once I group my 5 shape groups into the "imgGrp_Circles"&nbsp;shape group&nbsp;I can't access the individual grouped shapes like "RedA1" to move it around on the worksheet.&nbsp; It fails in my VBA code when I use</p>
<p>
</p><p>With ActiveSheet.Shapes("RedA1")</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</p>
<p>End With</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't even select the "RedA1" group in the Shape Selection Pane on the worksheet.&nbsp; Are you not able to access a shape group in a shape group?&nbsp; I was under the impression a shape group just created a new shape object so I figured it would act as any other
 shape.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm not just missing something and you can't actually reference a shape group in a shape group then is there anyway using VBA to merge the three shapes that create the "RedA1" shape group into a singe shape?&nbsp; I never need to access the 3 shapes individually
 once I've put them together they will always act as a single shape.&nbsp; So if I can make a single shape out of them that would resolve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA...</p>

<h2>            Images in Excel being distorted when converting to PDF</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I'm having problems with images in Excel being distorted when converting to PDF. This spreadsheet is a receipt template we use at our company.&nbsp; Basically when you open it in Excel, the logo appears at the top, where we want it to be. But when you convert
 to PDF, the logo is enlarged, obscuring the other information that is supposed to appear below it. I have tried everything I can think of, even using different versions of the image and starting the whole spreadsheet over from scratch, and it keeps coming
 out the same.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Excel 2016 - Filter by color - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j_novacek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 - Filter by color</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am experiencing problem with AutoFilter-Filter by color, what I believe is a bug in Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to reproduce:</p>
<ul>
<li>create two columns of numbers, for example:</li></ul>
<p>colA colB</p>
<p>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10</p>
<p>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20</p>
<p>30 &nbsp;&nbsp; 30</p>
<p><strong>40 &nbsp;&nbsp; 50</strong></p>
<p>50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50</p>
<p>60 &nbsp;&nbsp; 60</p>
<p>70 &nbsp;&nbsp; 70</p>
<p>80 &nbsp;&nbsp; 80</p>
<p>90 &nbsp;&nbsp; 90</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Now use conditional formatting on second column with a condition "if cell value equals A1 then format cell with red background".</li><li>All cells in colB should be red now, except of fourth row (because there are different values 40!=50).</li><li>Enable AutoFilter</li><li>Filter on colB by color, choosing "<strong>without background color</strong>"</li></ul>
<p>Now, as a result of this filter, I have two rows, one without color and <strong>
one red</strong> - only because both of them have same value (50).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can replicate this behaviour with simillar but different scenarios (more colors etc) and there is always problem with differently colored cells "overriding" color filter because the value of the cell is same as another cell with color which is being filtered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I doing something wrong? When I use "filter by color" I expect to see only correctly colored cells as a result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have non-english language version of Office, so some terms (like "without background color") are only my best guess what might be used in EN language version.

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As per the data provided by you, it seems that when you apply filters it get applied on first row of the spreadsheet. So when you select the
</span><strong><span>without background color </span></strong><span>filter, it select the no color cell from the cell below the row in which the filters are applied. So you get two cell one without color and one the cell on which the filter applied.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to insert one more row on the top of the spreadsheet and insert the name of the column such as Col1 &amp; Col2 above 10 &amp;10. Now apply filter on topmost row namely Col1 &amp; Col2 from Data&gt; Filter. Now choose
</span><span><strong>without background color</strong> </span><span>filter and check if it shows correct cell.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please post back with the updated issue details for further assistance.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem, and stumbled upon your post while searching for a solution. Your realization that the other equal values got also caught on the filter (like the two 50 in your example), made me think about&nbsp;trying another way to apply the conditional
 formatting, I've tried&nbsp;the "Use a formula..." option&nbsp;and it&nbsp;worked for me! just&nbsp;like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb7782b0-d122-48c9-98d7-4ca763d290b1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb7782b0-d122-48c9-98d7-4ca763d290b1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And applying to the range of values to be compared:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5de928f3-d0e4-4417-93b2-955ba0ebc8a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5de928f3-d0e4-4417-93b2-955ba0ebc8a5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This way autofilter's Filter by Color&nbsp;option works&nbsp;as expected. In my case, I needed to highlight the values that changed from on column to another, and then filter them out by color.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Freddy.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive Business Hanging on Creating Folder</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>this question appears to have been asked repeatedly on these forums but the threads all disappear into individual troubleshooting with the representatives and I can't locate a definitive resolution:</p>
<p>Upon logging in to my business O365 account with OneDrive, the app wants to create the onedrive folder. After I give it a location for the folder, the application hangs. Activity monitor shows the process using 101% of CPU and it will not stop unless force
 quit. The folder is never created. The application does not crash. There is nothing generated in the console logs. There is nothing in cache files because nothing gets synced.</p>
<p>The advice given to others includes deleting all cache files, deleting keychain files, using Hazel to uninstall everything, uninstalling the application, reinstalling the application, restarting the computer. But I am not having any luck. I cannot get past
 this step in setup.</p>
<p>The affected computer is running 10.10.5. I cannot upgrade to El Capitan for troubleshooting purposes because of legacy software requirements. I am able to have success with a different computer running El Capitan 10.11.3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd appreciate any guidance on a definitive series of steps that might be taken to move this forward.</p>
<p>Thanks, Edward Spencer</p>

            No, that's a limitation imposed by OS X. You may want to look into the use of some of the OS X windowing features, such as Spaces or Mission Control.<br />
