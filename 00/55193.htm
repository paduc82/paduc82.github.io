<h2>            how do you disable an internal graphics card&#63;</h2>
                    I got an NVIDIA GeFORCE 7300 GS OC graphics card and I install on a Levovo windows vista, but then&nbsp;it begins to a conflict with the internal video card, so then I try to get into the BIOS but the only options I have is change the internal graphics card
 to from 8 MB to 1 MB. I can't figure out how to turn off the internal graphics card.

<h2>            Can&#39;t see wireless networks on W8 using a TP-Link WN823N</h2>
                    I have just bought this wireless adapter after reading that it is compatible with Windows 8. The device works fine in a Windows XP machine. However, on Windows 8 it appears to have installed correctly but I cannot see any wireless networks when I try to
 connect. The blue light is blinking slowly.<br />
<br />
The device shows up as "Realtek RTL8192CU Wireless LAN 802.11n USB 2.0 Network Adapter".<br />
When I configure it the device status says "The device is working properly".<br />
The driver date is 16/07/2012, version 1021.0.716.2012<br />
<br />
When I the Diagnose facility in W8 it says problems found - "There might be a problem with the driver for the WiFi adapter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not fixed"<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated.

            I had a reply from TP-Link suggesting that I uninstall AVG antivirus and ZoneAlarm firewall. Finally got around to it today and it worked like a charm, and stayed working after I reinstalled both.<br />
<br />
Router now repositioned and good reception being enjoyed all around the house.<br />
<br />
Thumbs up for TP-Link!<br />

    <title>Yoga 13 WLAN driver not working with Windows 10 Pro upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> easenger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Yoga 13 WLAN driver not working with Windows 10 Pro upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Computer: Lenovo Yoga 13 with 8.1 pro, patched and updated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked Lenovo website, and they state it is compatible with Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran Windows 10 upgrade, downloaded Windows 10 drivers from Lenovo site and installed them</p>
<p>
</p><p>One driver update was for the WLAN card.&nbsp; Device Manager lists the device, and says it is working correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I go to Network &amp; Sharing, Adapters - no adapters are listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make matters worse, since this laptop has no built-in wired NIC, I had purchased a Belkin USB NIC, Model F4U047.&nbsp; That also does not work on Windows 10.&nbsp; So I have no network connection at all, and no way to get one.&nbsp; Tried downloading the Windows 8.1
 driver for the USB NIC, but that doesn't work on Windows 10 either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp; Is there a USB NIC that works with Windows 10?&nbsp; How do I get the LAN driver to work?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After much Internet searching, found that this problem was not new to Windows 10.&nbsp; Many reports are out there since Windows 7 where a NIC is found in Device Manager, but the Network Connections is blank.&nbsp; Most were resolved by going to HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Network
 and deleting the Config binary.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in Windows 10, that isn't a value in the registry.&nbsp; I put in a call to Microsoft, and after two days and escalation they told me that my only option was a reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that I didn't have a network connection, I tried the ISO.&nbsp; The ISO I downloaded last week kept failing at 20% (I'm going to try to re-download for my other machines to see if that helps).&nbsp; So I ended up having to use the OneKey Recovery tool to put
 it back to Windows 8, run all the updates, and then upgraded to Windows 10, which worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE:&nbsp; I un-installed the McAfee, Nitro Pro, Automatic Reminder, Office Trial, and any other bloatware before the update.&nbsp; The McAfee uninstall is critical and even mentioned on the Lenovo website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect my problem was caused by the Sonicwall VPN software I had installed initially.&nbsp; If you have any VPN software installed, I'd recommend you uninstall it before the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other problems I had are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Periodically, the keyboard stops working.&nbsp; A reboot so far has fixed this.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The touch keyboard comes up and then disappears within seconds, making it practically useless.&nbsp; This was fixed by download the Intel VGA driver for Windows 10 from the Lenovo website and installing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the keyboard stopped and the touch keyboard wasn't functioning during the initial update where you absolutely have to put in your password, the on-screen keyboard through the ease-of-access tools was a life-saver.&nbsp; Try that if you run into the same
 problem.</p>

            Hi Hikari.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />A Reset or Refresh will use the Windows 10 image file stored on board to reinstall Windows 10.  Only if you run the PC maker's Factory Recovery (which will be labeled that clearly) will it reinstall Windows 8.1 which is not desirable.  
<br />
<br />The Reset may have been customized by your PC maker to restore all the preinstalled bloatware.  So the Fresh Start leaves out the bloatware and only reinstalls the MS Store apps. 
<br />
<br />You can study the differences here:
<br />Reset: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-reset-your-pc-completely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-re...</a>
<br />Refresh:  <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-fresh-start-feature-in-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use...</a>
<br />
<br />Finally, the quality of the install in Windows 10 is hugely important and the very best install is the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can look over the steps which are quite a bit more involved than the automated methods I mentioned first.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

The Reset may have been customized by your PC maker to restore all the preinstalled bloatware. So the Fresh Start leaves out the bloatware and only reinstalls the MS Store apps.
<br />
<br />
You can study the differences here: <br />

Finally, the quality of the install in Windows 10 is hugely important and the very best install is the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come
 back to report another problem: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>. You can look over the steps which are quite a bit more involved than the automated methods I mentioned first.
<br />

I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I am not that confident with the clean install process. I have installed Windows previously on an old pc like you did, deleting partitions...but what you have said about bios and UEFI I am new to that. And I am not so sure about how to install drivers manually...Will
 windows automatically install them??</p>
<p>And I don't have digital license&nbsp; for Windows 10 pro but Windows 10 home..Will it be automatically activated after connecting to the internet??</p>
<p>Sorry to bother you this much. I'm just on high school. I just don't want to mess up my pc or dad will kill me :3</p>

            You can change the User folder name by one of these methods:

<br />
<br />If you have performance issues you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. 
<br />
<br />If you do all of this and it performs well enough then you don't need to do a Fresh Start, Reset or Clean Install.  But if you want to try one I'd do the Fresh Start: <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-fresh-start-feature-in-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use...</a>

<h2>            USB 3.0 Not Detected</h2>
                    <p>Hi i have a Gigabyte <a href="http://uk.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3311&amp;dl=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
GA-P55-USB3 Motherboard</a></p>
<p>I installed windows 10 x64 Pro (clean) a few days ago, My USB 3 ports that are built into the motherboard are not being detected or if they are i can not see them. Ive tried installing the driver (Renesas(NEC) USB 3.0 - 2.0.30.0) and doing just about anything
 i can think of, has anyone had the same issue and does anyone know how to solve the issue.</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance Æon Ward</p>

<p>SOLVED:::</p>
<p>I figured it out it was my bios for some reason my USB 3 had been turned off in bios.
</p>
<p>I switched it back on and guess what, when I restarted I got BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH saying error inaccessible boot device</p>
<p>I had to do a full reinstall because no mater what I did I could not work around it. It looks like windows 10 has the same issue as windows 8 the constant blue screens of death and restarting and resetting.</p>
<p>I am a&nbsp;little annoyed as this was supposed to be sorted out and it looks like it hasn't.
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>so a warning to other people back up you stuff before making changes to bios or other significant hardware changes.</strong></span>
</p>
<p>I would like to say I'm happy I figured it out, but by doing so I realises that windows 10 has the same issues as before well done Microsoft.</p>

<p>I had to do a full reinstall because no mater what I did I could not work around it. It looks like windows 10 has the same issue as windows 8 the constant blue screens of death and restarting and resetting.</p>
<p>I am a&nbsp;little annoyed as this was supposed to be sorted out and it looks like it hasn't.
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>so a warning to other people back up you stuff before making changes to bios or other significant hardware changes.</strong></span>
</p>
<p>I would like to say I'm happy I figured it out, but by doing so I realises that windows 10 has the same issues as before well done Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

<h2>            How do I know that a QualcomAtheros AR9485 adaptor is bluetooth capable</h2>
                    <p>My HP Envy 17t-200 has, according to device manager, a Qualcom Atheros AR9485 wifi adaptor.&nbsp; I cannot determine if this adaptor is Bluetooth capable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer cpu is an Intel Core i7-4720HQ running at 2.60GHz with 12.0 GB RAM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer was delivered with Win 8 and updated to Win 10.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had never needed to use Bluetooth until now but after searching for several hours, I have still not been able to determine if I can activate Bluetooth connectivity.&nbsp; If there is a solution I would appreciate knowing as soon as possible.</p>

            <p>Although both use the 2.4GHz band they are in different segments and are different protocols, Bluetooth has much simpler authentication processes and is a much shorter range. The Bluetooth IEEE standard is 802.15.1, Wi-Fi is a subset of 802.11 which is the
 Ethernet protocol. Despite all this jargon note the two standards and read this specification</p>

<p>
</p><p>The chip only supports 802.11 therefore it is NOT Bluetooth</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact the closeness of the two standards make it harder to coexist not easier.</p>

    <title>Bit Locked External Hard Drive won&#39;t unlock - neither with correct - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christian wilke  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bit Locked External Hard Drive won&#39;t unlock - neither with correct password nor with original key</h2>
                    <p>I own a Seagate 3.5 3TB external Expansion Desktop Drive HDD, which I have used for about 6 months prior to activating BitLocker.</p>
<p>The drive had never shown issues. I have decided to activate BitLocker about 2 months after upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both, password and recovery key/identifier are available to me and there is no error.
</p>
<p>I have 3 of the same type of hard drive but only one does not want to un-lock.</p>
<p>When I plug it in and wait, there is a prompt for the password; when I enter the password, it takes 3-4 minutes for the entry field to disappear and the drive will show in the explorer without the usual bar, which indicates size/capacity. When I click on
 it, I get an empty window or the drive disappears from the explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a right-click to manage BitLocker but all of the functions lead to a final error, reading this drive is not ready.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, I had attempted Windows System Restore, but this attempt failed since my OS does not roll back to the time required.<br />
I am at a loss and I would like to seek your advice, please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have not touched any of the PC's hardware and no alterations have been made, I am not sure what else I could do to un-lock this drive.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and frustration you have been through. I will be glad to assist you.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are getting drive not ready error this might be connectivity issue.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try connecting External hard drive to a different USB port and check. If issue persists connect to a different computer to check if its issue with USB port.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with hardware and devices. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with your touch Screen. Refer these steps:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows key +X</strong>, select<strong> Control panel.</strong><br />
2.&nbsp;Change the view by option on the top right to <strong>Large icons.</strong><br />
3.&nbsp;Click on troubleshooting and click on the<strong> view all </strong>option on the left panel.<br />
4.&nbsp;<strong>Run the Hardware and devices troubleshooter.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.

<p>
</p><p>No, this has not fixed it. I had tried that before, and it had been my first step.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the re-boot, I have entered my (correct) password to unlock the drive. Result: The little window stays for 5 minutes in a frozen state - then it disappears. It does not matter whether I am entering the password or the key under the advanced option
 in that same window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried command line. Same result.</p>

<h3> drcain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgraded from FPP&#47;Retail license - TRANSFER to &#42;completely new hardware&#42; - HOW EXACTLY&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In these forums and from the Microsoft Windows 10 end user agreement it has been successfully established, that if you upgrade to Window 10 from Windows 7/8.1 FPP/Retail version, the license for Windows 10 will remain also FPP/Retail, thus transferable to
 completely NEW hardware. <strong>Great news</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question that bothers is me is HOW exactly will this be possible, when after the upgrade to Windows 10 you don't get the Windows 10 activation key? I have also read, that there is no option for Phone Activation in Windows 10* (*might not be credible
 information).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So..</p>
<p>How can this transfer of Windows 10 to completely new HW be done if there is no Win10 Activation Key?</p>
<p>How will the Windows 10 installer know I have obtained the Windows 10 RETAIL license during the upgrade (because I have upgraded from Win8.1 RETAIL license previously)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know, that until July 29th, 2016, I can always install my Windows 8.1 and then repeat the upgrade - I don't care about that. I need to know about
<strong>future</strong> <strong>Windows 10 license/installation transfers, </strong>
<strong>after the free upgrade period has ended</strong>.</p>

<div><strong>Windows 10 handles keys differently</strong>. &nbsp;When you upgrade to Windows 10 via Windows Update from Windows 8.1 registers your computers hardware, and qualifying OS with a Microsoft Product Activation Server.
<strong>The device is then considered a Windows 10 device.</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Subsequently anytime you re-install (or clean install) the installation checks with those servers, finds the unique installation ID and produces the validation</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Since retail can be moved to new HW during the install it will check with the activation servers and generate the new GUID.&nbsp; I suspect they will verify via your email address (MSA)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>In short, keys are a thing of the past.</strong></p>

<h3> samurai7388  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Miracast on HP dv6-7250ca Will Not Connect to Roku 2</h2>
                    <p>
I am posting this as a Windows...Network issue, because I think wireless screen mirroring is effectively peer-to-peer networking. &nbsp;I apologize if there is a better forum for this.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I have the subject laptop and I believe that&nbsp;via Miracast I should&nbsp;be able to mirror my screen on our TV through&nbsp;a Roku 2 connected to it. &nbsp;I also have a Microsoft Surface Pro 2 and I have no problem with screen mirroring through the Roku 2. &nbsp;Both computers
 are currently running Windows 8.1(64-bit) OS, both computers found the Roku 2, and the Roku 2&nbsp;was successfully added as a wireless (Project) device.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The dv6-7250ca does see the Roku 2 and does attempt to connect to it for screen mirroring. &nbsp;The computer indicates '<em><strong>connecting</strong></em>' while&nbsp;the Roku 2 sees the attempt and shows its&nbsp;'mirroring' image on the TV screen but, after a few seconds,
 it simply stops with the progress bar on the TV screen at only ~30% complete and with no actual computer screen mirroring having occurred. &nbsp;I then check the Roku device status on my computer and it indicates '<em><strong>not connected</strong></em>'.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Because the Surface does connect and its screen is mirrored on the TV, the problem must be with the HP dv6-7250ca. &nbsp;Can anyone provide suggestions as to why it may be failing to connect with the HP notebook computer?</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thanks in advance.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My HP computer is apparently compatible with Miracast as I had mentioned that it does provide the option to '<em><strong>Add a Wireless Display</strong></em>' under
<em><strong>Project</strong></em>, and I also checked on the Intel website to confirm that the processor and graphics engine are compatible with WiDi which supports Miracast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the computer OS&nbsp;<em><strong>was</strong></em> upgraded to Win8.1 from Win8. &nbsp;I have done all of the '<em><strong>important</strong></em>' upgrades but not all of the
<em><strong>optional </strong></em>ones, as previous experiences with optional upgrades have needlessly and adversely affected computer performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, before I do the 122 outstanding <em><strong>optional </strong></em>upgrades, can you advise which ones may be pertinent to or required for Miracast to function properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. &nbsp;Your assistance is much appreciated.</p>
        </p>

            <p>
As much as I disliked the idea, I bit the bullet and installed<em><strong>all updates</strong></em>. &nbsp;I tried screen mirroring again but the result was the same.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Doing a clean boot did not resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Booting in Safe Mode with Networking prevented me from being able to access the screen mirroring option.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In addition to Windows built-in Defender, I also run SpyBot S&amp;D, and I disabled the latter with no improvement in the situation.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
As much as I would have liked to resolve this for a better understanding of the issue and for those not moving to Windows 10, I was&nbsp;running out of time; so, I opted to end this effort and instead I spent several hours last night upgrading the laptop to Windows
 10.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Serendipitously, I am happy to report that screen mirroring is functioning properly under Windows 10 on this computer.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Again, many thanks for your efforts to resolve this even though it remains <em><strong>unresolved for Win8.1</strong></em> on this computer.</p>

<h2>            Surface RT 8.1 Projection Issues</h2>
                    <p>Since I got 8.1 I've been unable to extend my screen to a monitor via the Devices charm. Making a selection via the charm doesn't always work. It only shows an image on the monitor if I unplug and plug in the cable, but even then then display is only duplicated;
 extension is disabled. Is this now a broken feature?</p>

            It's not recommended to change your account region to try to bypass region restrictions. If your account region and your physical location do not match, it can also cause issues purchasing content. You would also need a payment method from the region of
 the account. Any funds in your account would not transfer.&nbsp;

<p>Hi April,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in forums with this issue. When it comes to accounts for Xbox/Microsoft, there is no way to merge two accounts into a single account. If you would like to be able to monitor both accounts, you can use Family settings to designate
 them as part of your Family by listing them as child accounts with your own account as the parent one. Here are some handy support articles that can guide you and provide you with information on how to set up a Microsoft family account:</p>

            I continue to have problems with this game on windows 8. I can install it, play the game for as long as I wish, but after closing the game, I get the "Initialization Failed" error message after the videos upon attempting to reopen the game. I have tried
 all of the suggestions at the listed website, but to no avail. Any other suggestions? This is the AGE OF MYTHOLOGY 2001 PC CD game. No expansions, just the basics. &nbsp;I do have a product ID number if that helps

<p>Hi there, are you referring to the recent remake or the original game?</p>
<p>If you're receiving that error from the original game, it seems like your hard drive might not be an official Xbox product, which you will need to play Xbox originals.</p>
<p>If it's the remade one, I'd suggest doing as the error says and delete the game off the console through finding it on the hard drive and reinstall it.</p>

<h2>            Windows Freezes after login.</h2>
                    
<p>After login, Windows Vista freezes. Im am able to run in safe mode, so am guessing it is not a hardware issue.</p>
<p>Norton has done a deep scan and assures me that I do not have a virus.</p>
<p>Any Suggestions?</p>

    <title>Inactive Ambassador - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cyberphonics  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inactive Ambassador</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys! I signed into xbox live mail and saw a message saying I was flagged as an inactive ambassador and had to sign in to the chat or something to remain active. I just checked my ambassador profile and it's still active but none of the links related
 to ambassadors works so I'm not sure if I no longer have access or if the links are broken.</p>
<p>I still have a couple of weeks before I'll have internet outside of work again and I obviously can't spend too much time at work trying to post in the forums.If I have gone inactive, will I be able to go active again once my net's set back up at home and
 I can start using the chat and everything or will I have to re-apply? Thanks!</p>

<p>Greetings Lady Ace,</p>
<p>Have you checked for contact invites on Windows live messenger ?? it may takes 24 -48 hours for you to get active.</p>
<p>Also, since you still have ambassador status please send your question to the Ambassador forums.<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/ambassadorchat/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../default.aspx</a></p>

<p>Thanks all! Hey collecionador. I was already an ambassador for months but then my account went inactive I think last week (that's when I saw the message). I still see my ambassador profile and nothing on it SAYS inactive but I don't have the badge anymore
 as pointed out and when I clicked the link to the ambassador forums, it said it wasn't the right page (I'm guessing because I don't have access to it anymore).</p>
<p>I'll try re-applying and see what happens.</p>

<p>Well then lol I went to apply again and when I hit submit, it took me to a page that said "Thanks for applying, but it appears you're already in the program...". So I guess reapplying isn't an option when you go inactive. I tried tweeting xbox support yesterday
 and didn't get a response. Maybe I'll try that again.</p>

<p>Hi o Lady Ace o,<br />
<br />
You can PM any of the forum support agents or XBOXAmbassadors account to see about getting you back in the program. Ambassadors who are inactive from the program for 60 days or great are automatically removed. But, fear not! They should be able to assist you
 in some way in getting you back into the program where you left off.</p>

<h3> jk_1014  say:</h3>
<h2>            Acer Aspire won&#39;t update to Windows 10, version 1803</h2>
                    So recently, there was a new update to windows 10. My laptop told me to update and restart, so I did, except it didn't update. Eventually, it claimed it updated, and I believed it, until I eventually could no longer open the start menu, which I read was
 a symptom of the software not being up to date. I checked the settings for a new update, and sure enough, it hadn't updated at all. Does someone know what to do, or is my laptop possibly broken?

            Hi JK, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            Hi JK, when you download the ISO file, double click that. That will mount the ISO on a virtual drive, which should open in Windows File Explorer, then double click on Setup.exe to begin the update . . .

<h2>            Headset totally stopped working with XBOX ONE. Lots of similar cases.</h2>
                    <p>As suggested I'm opening this issue.</p>
<p>I have a XBOX One and it works fine. After a few months, the headset started to sporadically work and finally stopped at all.</p>
<p>At first I tried changing several configurations on Xbox and on the game. I also tested the headset in other devices and got no problem with the headset.</p>
<p>Then I started looking for answers in the Web and, as a surprise, lots of people have the same problem. Some have bought new controllers, new headsets and have tried combinations of these. The problem persists. It works for a while and then stops. Have a
 look at this discussion:&nbsp;https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/408687/My+headset+sporadically+works.</p>
<p>Many people are really frustrated with this (including me of course). Some people believe the problem is related to bad material in the P2 door where the headset is plugged in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Brazil Microsoft told me since my headset is not Microsoft's they cannot help me.</p>
<p>Does anybody have an answer for this? Microsoft?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, if I could go back in time, I would think twice before buying X1. Really upset and frustrated.</p>

            What type of headset is it? If it's working in other controllers it may be the controller itself that's the issue. What have you done as far as troubleshooting ?

<p>It's a HyperX Cloud Stinger 2.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure the problem is the controller as I mentioned about the P2 door. The point here is that there are many controllers showing a similar problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read and tried the xbox one support articles about audio settings. All of them. I also have looked for answers about this problem and tried some combinations of these settings. The discussion I sent is a good example. I have also contacted Kingston
 (the headset manufacturer).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes it works as soon as plugged in, but a few seconds later stops completely. Most of times it doesn't work at all.</p>

<p>What is a P2 door? Are you referring to the battery cover?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read that iFixit thread yesterday and it included following solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>insert headset plug very slowly into 3.5 mm jack</li><li>Get a headset adapter if controller 3.5mm plug is broken and you don't want to fix it.</li><li>Update controller firmware especially if used with Xbox One S or X</li><li>Take controller apart (out of warranty) and adjust 3.5mm plug contacts so they make better contact with the rest of the controller electronics inside. This option sounds like what you may need for your controller if it only works for a few seconds.</li></ul>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Hello SeizedSpider,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question. Support was correct in saying that being it a third party headset that there is not a lot of troubleshooting we can do. The troubleshooting we can&nbsp; do is basically all on the website. Personally I have
 noticed after Xbox updates a lot of third party headsets don't work correctly. This is due to the software in the headsets are usually not compatible right after an update. This is all personal opinion as I have turtle beach headsets. Also if it has been a
 few months and you do think it could be the 3.5 mm adapter that going you can request a repair/replacement for the controller if it is in warranty. The website
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
device support</a>&nbsp; you can set up the repair for the controller. If you notice on all our troubleshooting says
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/wired-headset-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox one headset troubleshooting</a>. You could try getting an adapter and see if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>As P2 door I mean the hole where you plug in the headset. Sorry, my English is not good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In capital letters my answer.</p>
<p>

<li>insert headset plug very slowly into 3.5 mm jack - I TRIED THIS.&nbsp;</li><li>Get a headset adapter if controller 3.5mm plug is broken and you don't want to fix it.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would refrain from trying self repair on controller or console as that could void the warranty if it is still in warranty. I suggest trying an Xbox Headset adapter, as the 3.5 mm audio jack connection is not as reliable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't done so already, hard reset and power cycle your Xbox:<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console</span></a>

<p>Thanks Brad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really concerning to have headsets stopping working correctly after Xbox updates. I'll try an adapter for the headset. Now I'm thinking if I should buy it from Microsoft (expensive here in Brazil). Oh man.<br />

<p>Hello Spider,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Totally understand where you are coming from. We recommend getting a Microsoft adapter only because its a guarantee that its compatible. You can try a third party adapter but it may or may not work.</p>

<p>I really am frustrated with that. It doesn't matter where i am from. This should not be a solution. More and more cases appear everyday. Microsoft should do something.&nbsp; Unfortunately it is not easy to prove but is clearly a problem to Xbox users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it is not their fault. How come?&nbsp;</p>
