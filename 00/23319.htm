            the notifications+actions page will only show apps AFTER they've triggered a notification, not before. so, it is perfectly normal that they do not show up in there. once a notification comes through, they'll become listed.

            <p>I also have this problem on my 635 which had been working fine for over a year until just recently when notifications stopped coming through, except for phone, texts, &amp; email. I've tried everything I can think of, even resetting the phone but to no avail.
 Now none of the other apps which used to be there (even though notifications for them had stopped working) appear in the notifications+actions centre at all and no notifications have been received when they should have. The only apps which appear in the list
 now are device hub, phone, messaging, motion data, email, store &amp; wifi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can live without the likes of Facebook &amp; Twitter etc. if I have to, &nbsp;but I use TuGo wifi app for calls and texts as I have no mobile signal at home and notifications for this are also not working which is an absolute pain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone can shed some light on this. I used to love my phone but now I'm not so sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit. Ran Windows device and recovery tool and now all relevant apps appear in the notification centre and are working properly. Fingers crossed they stay that way :)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for posting the picture of your settings, this is where your problem lies.</p>
<p>Try dragging the slider under the Stop preview builds to the right because at present you are set to only receive the current branch updates (Release preview)&nbsp;which would only allow you to get updates for 10586 preview version and&nbsp;no others. There are three
 pre-set positions on the slider. <strong>a</strong>; Current stable build or Preview version (10586) this is the safest stable build and according to your picture is what you are on now,
<strong>b</strong>; Insider slow ring (next safest) this will give you not quite the latest build but it would have been well tested,
<strong>c</strong>; Insider fast, use this setting to get the very latest builds bugs and all. Only use this one if you are willing to possibly have all your data lost if things go bottom up, backup, backup and backup again! Having said that I've not had so
 serious an issue with fast ring that the computer has crashed beyond all hope, it's usually little things that don't work as expected or not at all. You can always uninstall the latest fast ring or slow ring up date and go back to previous build. If you do
 this then update will not try to upgrade again until the next build is released.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Hope this solves your problem, Rich.</p>

            Firstly if yoou have any security software installed they often have pop-up blockers &amp; anti-banner features - check these features out. I have experienced your problem with anti-banners.<br />
<br />
In Tools-&gt;Manage Add-ons, the add-ons are normally named something sensible. If not, there is no harm in disabling each add-on in turn until you find the culprit.<br />
<br />
How do you know that the problem is an add-on?<br />
<br />
It could be your Privacy or Security settings.

    <title>&#39;AutoFormat As You Type&#39; characters result in font change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrickmortensen12345  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#39;AutoFormat As You Type&#39; characters result in font change</h2>
                    <p>I have a custom font that I am required to use. When typing in it, all of the "AutoFormat As You Type" characters (straight quotes to smart quotes; three dots to ellipses; etc.) get converted to Calibri.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the Style, I see that Calibri is listed as the "Intl" font (I assume that means the font to use if a character cannot be found in the active font):</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">Font: (Default) CustomFont, (Intl) Calibri, 9.5 pt, Left</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Line spacing: Exactly 12 pt, Space</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After: 7.5 pt, Widow/Orphan control, Style: Quick Style</p>
<p>
</p><p>These characters (smart quotes, ellipses, etc.) DO exist in the custom font, so I'm not sure why they are changing -- I can manually apply the custom font after the autoformat happens, and it changes to the custom font.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do need to use the custom font, and I do want to keep the "AutoFormat As You Type" options.
</p>
<p>Can anyone point me in the right direction of where I can look to prevent the font change from happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 Version 14.0.6129.5000 (32-bit) on Windows 7 Enterprise</p>

            <p>Thank you for the quick reply, John -- that does work, and I had previously suggested it to our developers, but they said we do need to maintain Calibri as a back-up ("Int") font for characters that are not in the custom font set.</p>
<p>My problem is that the resulting 'autoformat as you type' characters *are* in the original custom font set, so they shouldn't be changing.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I agree, they shouldn't be changing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the restrictions that you company imposes, perhaps you could create 2 identical styles with a slightly different name for text, one with your custom font as the Intl choice and another using Calibri. Then use the custom font style for most text and
 the Calibri variant when there are characters that don't appear in your custom font. The latter situation probably doesn't happen as often as you use the AutoFormat feature.</p>

            <p>Hi MONETT123,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand you're getting a lot of email spam on your account. There are many possibilities why we acquire a huge number of junk mails, some of the following are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Senders email address is not added in our contact list resulting that their emails are filtered as junk.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Your address is associated to phishing sites.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</li></ul>
<p>To resolve this you can try the following solutions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the email addresses that are known to you in your safe senders list.</li><li>Block emails from potential spammers.</li><li>Set your Junk Mail filter to Exclusive.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can follow the steps below on how to add email address in safe senders, block spammers and setting your Junk Mail filter to Exclusive.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Add in safe senders list</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Sign-in to your account.</p>
<p>2. Click the Gear Icon located at the upper-right side of the page. </p>
<p>3. Select More mail settings. </p>
<p>4. Under Preventing junk email, click Safe and blocked senders.</p>
<p>5. Click Safe senders. </p>
<p>6. Enter the email address or domain that you want to add in your safe senders list
</p>
<p>7. and click Add to list &gt;&gt;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Blocking emails / contacts</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: You can skip step 1 and 2 if the emails that you want to block are in the Junk folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Choose the emails that you want to block in your inbox, by clicking the check box on their left.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Tagged them as Junk by clicking Junk located at the top beside "Delete".&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Go to your Junk folder, choose all or the preferred emails that you want to block.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Click Sweep and click Block from.</p>
<p>5. A pop up window will appear to confirm that "You're about to block the following senders"&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Click Block all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Configuring junk mail filter</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">1. From your Hotmail inbox, click the gear icon then
<strong>More mail settings</strong></font></span></p>
<p><font color="#000000">2. </font><span><font color="#000000">Under <font><b>Preventing junk email</b>, click
<b>Filters and reporting</b></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">3. Under <font><b>Choose a junk email filter</b>, select
<b>Exclusive</b></font>.</font></span></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000000"><span>Note: When you set your junk email filter to Exclusive, any emails that are NOT in your contact list and safe sender list will be automatically sent to your junk email folder so you should occasionally check your junk email folder
 to make sure that good messages don't get put there by mistake.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Hope this helps. Let us know if you need further assistance.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>The problem goes away after a reboot, and I've gone thorough steps like sfc /scannow and a few other steps Microsoft support suggested however there had been no progress, is anyone else having this issue or better yet have a fix?</p>

            <p>Already tried that I'm afraid, as well as a couple of Powershell commands to re-catalogue the modern apps and creating a new user account. None of which have had any effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that this issue seems to happen due to the modern apps taking increasingly long too respond until they seem to cross some time threshold until they simply stop responding at all.</p>

</p><p>I have Windows 7 Ultimate on my Laptop and still waiting for my notification to upgrade. &nbsp;My question is, I still have the Window 10 .iso on DVD and wanted to know if it's ok to install the Preview and be able to upgrade to 10 Pro? &nbsp;The message on the "Get
 Windows" say's it may take days or weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will there be problems of using it until then or will I be able to use it?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Tech Preview 10041&#58;  Random mouse clicks when using external mouse and keyboard</h2>
                    <div>When using an external mouse and keyboard, I get intermittent issues with left-mouse clicks randomly occurring.&nbsp; Wherever the pointer is located, it will click on its own about every 20-30 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried multiple mice (wireless and wired).&nbsp; When
 I disconnect the wireless keyboard and use a wired mouse or no mouse (just trackpad), there are no issues.</div>
<p>
</p><p>This is a major usability impairment and I can't find any reports of this happening with anyone else on the forum.&nbsp; I'm running on Dell XPS 12 and build 10041.</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing.<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. What is the make and model of the computer/Mouse?<br />
<br />
Microsoft have released the new Build 10074. I would suggest you to upgrade to the latest build and check if the issue persists. If the issue still persists, the issue could be due to some third party program causing the issue.
 a clean boot.<br />

<br />
Note: Follow </span><strong><span>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</span></strong><span>
 from article KB929135 to reset the computer to normal mode.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

            <p>I am now running Build 10074 and the same issue remains.&nbsp; I'm unable to upgrade to later builds due to corporate support policy.&nbsp; I'm running Microsoft mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; I have tried multiple models (Wireless Desktop 5000 and Sculpt Comfort Desktop).&nbsp;
 I have tried to update the MS mouse/keyboard software and have also removed it.&nbsp; No change in the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I disable the external keyboard and just use the mouse with the laptop keyboard, the issue goes away.&nbsp; However, the issue is actually the mouse clicking on it's own.&nbsp; It is very strange - and quite frustrating, as I often can't type a single sentence
 without a random click changing where my cursor is much of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried a clean boot and&nbsp;the issue&nbsp;still happened in that mode.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions????</p>

If the computer is connected to domain, then your company administrator might have set administrator rights not to install the programs. I would suggest you to contact your company administrator for further assistance.<br />

            I am getting the same problem. The cursor position is not moving, but a random left mouse button clicking is registering randomly, at least every few minutes. This is home install of the current build of Windows 10 not on a domain.

            I am having the same issue but on a private installation of Windows 10 Pro. My mouse clicks randomly, it does that spiral animation and chimes every few moments, not minutes. It is maddening.

            Let's do following -
<br />
<br />1. Open One Note &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Save &amp; Backup &gt; Make a note of Default Notebook Location
<br />2. Go to this location and your sections will be here in separate files.
<br />3. Try opening one by one to identify the corrupt section.

<p>You are in the wrong forum if you have a fake Nokia. The fake has a totally different operating system, hence you not being able to connect it to pcsuite or nsu. Also the reason why we woudn't be of any help to you.</p>

<p>I suppose that would be the manufacturers of the fake Nokia, if you know who they are, or the seller you bought it from. I suppose you could also try googling, but a company that manufactures counterfeits aren't going to want to highlight that fact. The
 fake N97 uses a totally different operating system. I wouldn't even know where to start.</p>

<h2>            How do i transfer app purchases from old account to new account&#63;</h2>
                    Ive been on the phone all day with microsoft and ive been transfered between the billing, tech support,store support,and the online chat help, with NO LUCK. So i have an old email account that i don't use anymore because its so ancient the its just collecting
 junk/spam mail, but i used it on my old Windows 7 phone for purchasing apps, as of yesterday ive upgraded to a new Lumia 920 (WP8 Device), and im using my NEW current email as the primary account, now a few months ago, i went on my xbox and changed my Xbox
 information to the new email, (i read online that thats one way to transfer purchases), but it did not work, im still being charged for the previously purchased app.<br />
<br />
How can i transfer my Windows Phone app purchases from my old none used Hotmail account, to my new Hotmail account without having to use my old account anymore?? Please and thank you. At this point this is getting me so frustrated.<br />

            <p>you cant...if those purchase licences did not come over with the transfer Gamertag option, then that it is...
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>its always been said... purchases are not transferable and transferring&nbsp;a gamertag could loose purchases!</p>

<h2>            Bing Ads - Callout Extensions - Device-Specific&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good day everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I usually build new accounts in Google first and just import to Bing.&nbsp; Bing generally imports my ad extensions OK enough that I'll have to make a few tweaks here and there.&nbsp; Sitelinks are generally the easiest since Bing supports desktop and mobile-specific
 sitelinks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I don't know if the system simply pulls in all ad extensions by default, or do so because it has the capability of supporting desktop and mobile-specific callouts?&nbsp; Although I have not seen an option to label a callout ad extension as desktop or mobile-specific,
 I figured I would confirm if anyone has utilized different callouts for desktop and mobile, or if Bing's callout ad extensions are meant to serve across both desktop and mobile because there is no option to label a particular callout as desktop or mobile?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>John</p>

 devices. They are also available on Android and iOS mobile phones for en-US markets only.

<p>
</p><p>The other day I did a windows update, and it had updates for both Office, and Windows 10; all went well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I read online somewhere that MS wants us to uninstall office, then do updates for win10, then reinstall office.

<p>
</p><p>The ONLY issues I have noticed is my battery icon disappearing from the lower right corner clock area--if I put my cursor where the icon should be--it tells me the battery level, etc--but again--there is no icon there--just an empty space.&nbsp;

<p>I got a similar problem w/ IE11 after the last forced win 8.1 update the other day. IE will not start, no matter what, no matter how. If you try, an IE window fires up, but stays blank, then a "(not responding)" is added in that window's head line, then
 it is closed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Task Manager shows IE, then IE "inactive" in red, then it closes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all the things you can find in the web, de-selecting and re-selecting it in the windows components, resetting IE to factory defaults, did even a system files corruption test (negative, all good).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to install an earlier version of IE, which is not allowed by Windows, hence does not complete.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to set back system to an earlier point before the last update, but will not work (possibly my running Malwarebytes and Bitdefender are preventing that from happening? Or it is not allowed by Windows?)</p>

<p>I am testing a fix right now for the same issue on a clients machine where I started cmd as an administrator and used regsvr32 to re-register the DLL file that was causing the issue.<br />
</p>
<p>I was able to find the DLL file that was the issue by using a third party free program that I use called appcrashview by Nirsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8.1 has only IE11 and is not able to roll back, you would have to return the machine to windows 8.0 to get IE10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try to run SFC /scannow in an elevated command prompt to see if that will resolve the issue with IE you are experiencing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great clue.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you have an APPCRASH there is a file called Report.WER created which contains more details such as in particular a list of loaded modules.&nbsp;&nbsp; I never realized the full path was given by the associated&nbsp; Event record.&nbsp; The most likely reason
 for the crash will be an interferer and having a list of loaded modules can be a quick way of identifying one to try to get rid of as a troubleshooting step.</p>

<h3> cjr333  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016. Can&#39;t open workbooks unless Excel is already open.</h2>
                    <p>Since installing Excel 2016 I can't open workbooks direct from a file location, nor from 'Recents' listed when using (Right Click) Excel icon on Taskbar.&nbsp; Trying to open an existing Excel workbook from 'Recents' here, or its files location, I get an Excel
 worksheet screen, but it is blank and with all functions 'greyed out' except the 'FILE' Tab . I click that and get a list of my Excel files, including 'Recents'.&nbsp; From here I can open my worksheets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(A 'normal' Left click on the Excel icon on Task bar opens Excel 'home' page, with templates etc. and a list of my worksheets. They open OK from here).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is this the way Excel 2016 now opens worksheets. I.e. cannot open from anywhere except from lists within an already open Excel.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 7.&nbsp; (I've checked in Properties, the 'Open with program',&nbsp; is Excel 2016).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I've also just noticed right clicking Word 2016 Taskbar icon doesn't even list any recent files)?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I am novice, any help appreciated. Thanks</p>

<h2>            How sync Outlook 2013 calendar with calendar.live.com &#40;outlook.com&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    I have been using Windows Phones for years (Windows Phone 8, currently Nokia Lumia 920) and my and all of my family members calendars (they are also long time Windows Phone users, some WP 7.8, some WP 8) with the native calendar app.&nbsp; The native calendar
 app uses our microsoft logins, which syncs with xbox 360 and calendar.live.com (which I have heard is referred to as outlook.com, but the website still says calendar.live.com, I'm looking at the calendar now).&nbsp; I have Outlook 2013 (64 bit) on my laptop, and
 would really like to sync my Outlook calendar with the calendar.live.com.&nbsp; I am tiring of having to copy and paste calendar information from Outlook into my calendar.live.com events to gain access from my phone.&nbsp; There was previously an Outlook Hotmail Connector
 plugin, but that does not work with Outlook 2013.<br />
<br />
I attempted to add a new account in Outlook to access the live calendar (Outlook.com or Exchange ActiveSync compatible service), but have been thwarted in my efforts.&nbsp; What server should I use, outlook.com, calendar.live.com, hotmail.com, etc?&nbsp; I have tried
 using outlook.com, along with my login information as the username (my personal e-mail address, which is not on a Microsoft hosted domain), and my associated password.&nbsp; No luck, it doesn't recognize my username.&nbsp; If this is the correct approach, how can I
 find out what my outlook.com username is, since it doesn't seem to be the same as what I use for login from my phone and when logging in online, and I can't find other username information on calendar.live.com.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Andy<br />

<h2>            Removing the paragraph in TOC</h2>
                    <p>Hi there guys:</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm starting to get back to using MS word in the workplace after five year layoff.&nbsp; I forgot some house keeping procedures.&nbsp; My question is TOC</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Legal, I use two levels in TOC when doing a document.&nbsp; The first one (heading 1) is fine because its just a title but the second level (heading 2) includes the entire paragraph.&nbsp; I only just want the first sentence in heading two to reflect in the TOC.&nbsp;
 I tried highlighting the selected text in each of the heading 2.&nbsp; I just i had to go into index and mark it, but that wasn't it.&nbsp; If anyone can help me with this matter, I would be grateful.&nbsp; I apologize in advance if I'm not clear in my instructions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example</p>
<p>Contents</p>
<p>I.&nbsp;&nbsp; Text words</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; "im writing a sentence",&nbsp; as we speak as i do my best to clarify this matter with a solution, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wanted " im writing a sentence" in the TOC and not the rest of the header 2.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Select the paragraph that you want to have only the first sentence appearing in the TOC, and apply some other style that is not in the TOC. (Normal will work for a demonstration). Then select only the first sentence and apply Heading 2. By default Heading
 2 is both a paragraph and character style, so you can apply it to a portion of a paragraph. Then update the TOC. Viola! Only the sentence formatted with Heading 2 appears in the TOC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably, you don't want a mismatch in appearance between the first sentence in Heading 2 and the following text. So make a new style that has the same characteristics as Heading 2, but call it something else (could be "Not in TOC") and in the Paragraph
 settings for the style ensure its level is Body Text. Apply it to the paragraph, then apply Heading 2 to the first sentence. Now the appearance matches, but only the first sentence appears in the TOC.</p>

            <p>You can insert a style separator by pressing Alt+Ctrl+Enter and then you can apply a non-heading style, such as Body Text, to the portion of the paragraph following the style separator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When working with style separators, it is best to display nonprinting marks. Click the ¶ button on the Home tab. You'll find that an ordinary paragraph mark is represented by a pilcrow, ¶, while a style separator is represented by a pilcrow surrounded by
 a dotted line.</p>

<h2>            Nokia E6-00 Conn. failed&#47;Authentic. failed</h2>
                    
<p>hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just switched from Nokia E72 to Nokia E6-00. When I try to connect to internet through a private APN from Vodafone with username and password I receive the following error: Conn. failed/Authentic failed. Using the default settings from Vodafone, the connection
 works.</p>
<p>The same setting I used on Nokia E72 and everything worked fine. This APN is used for pushmail service from my job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please give me some help because I really dont know what more can I do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gipiul</p>

            Hello gipiul, the authentication failed message is displayed when there's some mistake in the password/username. So you may check those once more.
