<p>I really like this new update.&nbsp; I find some things seem to work better and the touch seems to work better.&nbsp; On thing that I havn't got working yet is my Bluetooth.&nbsp; Before updating I had my earpeices working fine
 and my keygboard.&nbsp; I tried to sync them up wit my device and I can't seem to get them to sync.&nbsp; When I ask my device to search for new bluetooth devices it comes back with there aren't any.&nbsp; I have my Bluetooth to recognize devices but it just won't find them.&nbsp;
 I am in the process of removing them and reinstalling them. I will try that but in case it doesn't work I was wondering if anyone had the same problem.&nbsp; Everything else seems to work great and I like the new blue color or colour depending where you are.&nbsp;

<p>there are programming errors that we can do nothing about.</p>
<p>turn off Error Messages in IE</p>
<p>Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Advanced tab, uncheck "Display notificattion about every script error"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: If the above setting gets turned back on for some unknown reason then you probably have the spyswat toolbar installed (it is known to have this bug,,,, turning error messages back on by itself)... Uninstall the spyswat toolbar.... you do not need it
 in IE8 as Ie has its own popup blocker. (Tools&gt;Popup blocker settings)</p>

            <p>There are other important issues with New MSN Money.&nbsp; My biggest complaint is that the stock charts no longer allow a person to do their own charting, i.e. look at 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, 10 year terms, put in moving averages of varying lengths, put in events.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyond that, the stock basic charts don't tell the dividend paid or the yield--one of the MOST BASIC things that an investor needs to know--what does this stock pay me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please restore these relatively simple capabilities, please.&nbsp; They are important investor tools.&nbsp; They are not something we can do without.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Tools" button provided gives nothing to an active investor.&nbsp; Most of what is given is for people trying to balance a checkbook, not someone trying to buy stock.</p>

<p>I just found this out today. Money charts are no longer helpful, no moving averages! Who programmed this baloney? Uneducated people are allowed to redesign the website and leave out crucial features but more Bling! and probably adware.

            I'm in total agreement. The problems seem to be compounded when no action is taken to correct the failures. &nbsp;I've received promises and assurances that the situation(s) will be corrected and even been given phone numbers to contact real people only to
 have those contacts actually refuse to talk with me. My frustration is deteriorating into pure anger and, after more years than I want to remember, I'm losing faith in MSN. They seem to be hell-bent on fixing things that are not broken and we, the users, are
 the worse for it. My MSN worked fine and was a great help for me, personally, and I don't understand why those features cannot or have not been incorporated into the "new" MSN that we are forced to use.

            <p>As mentioned in the article below, you need to have read, write, create, and delete privileges on the folder the database is being shared from.&nbsp; These permissions haven't
 changed for a shared database scenario.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If you plan to share a database, the .mdb file should be located in a folder where users have read, write, create, and delete privileges. Even if you want users to have different
 file privileges (for example, some read-only and some read-write), all users sharing a database must have read, write, and create permissions to the folder. You can, however, assign read-only permissions to the .mdb file for individual users while still allowing
 full permissions to the folder.”</p>

<h3> flyboy38  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Security Update KB2596927 &#47; MS14-082 Dec 9, 2014 breaks things</h2>
                    <p>For anyone who cares, I just want to put out there that Office Secuirty Update KB2596927 (MS14-082) released December 9, 2014 breaks working Excel .xlsm&nbsp; workbooks/VBA projects under certain circumstances.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First the pertinent specifics (dirty details) -</p>
<p>
</p><p>WindowsXP - SP3 and current security patches (yeah, yeah, yeah, unsupported I know. That's why I said "if you care". If you don't then please just ignore me!</p>
<p>Office 2007 - SP3 12.0.6712.5000SP3 MSO 12.0.6683.5000</p>
<p>VBA project references to Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library and Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.8 Library (and others presumed non-related)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update arrived last Tuesday December 9 with a group of five others (KB2920790, KB 2920792, Something for Word2007, Junk Email Filter, and Malicious Software Removal Dec). Installing them all broke me bad (described below). Looked for answers and solutions
 but could find none. Performed a system restore which put me back, then installed the updates one-at-a-time until I broke again. Problem isolated to this particular patch. All other patches in the batch are now installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is simple and absolutely catastrophic! The controls on workbook sheets are no longer recognized or addressable. The visual elements remain, you can see them, but attempting to access them in design mode to change their characteristics and/or
 view their properties yields nothing more than a reference to the sheet on which they reside. The control is not recognized as being there. Any VBA code referencing the control also breaks as the control&nbsp; name is no longer recognized in the namespace. BOOM!
 A perfectly long-working Excel workbook / project now a smoldering pile of unusable wreckage. Luckily System Restore is sufficient to undo the damage (if you happen to catch it before you've changed a whole bunch of other things ... timing is everything).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I just gotta remember to never allow this particular patch to install :)</p>

<p>
</p><p>In the new Skype for Mac, the option to automatically sign in is still not available. However, if you will just close the Skype app without signing out, the next time you will open the application your account is signed in automatically.</p>

<h2>            Naming Convention</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I am going to make tables and I think I don't need naming convention(specially prefix)&nbsp;for my fields in tables until I use VBA.</p>
<p>For examples, if my field names are like EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Zipcode, CellPhone, then these are ok to use.<u> Am I right</u>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I use like lngEmployeeID, strLastName, strFirstName, strZipcode, strCellPhone, dtmHireDate, then I have to use caption property to display appropriate name on the table datasheet view. I don't think I need prefix when I make tables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So prefix like lng, str, and dtm will need when I use codes, is this right?? </p>

<h2>            Error 0x800705b4 for Windows Defender on 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since yesterday I have been getting prompts say I need virus protection, however I have Windows Defender. Upon checking I found that Defender was turned off. Trying to turn it off gives the error code&nbsp;0x800705b4. I have tried everything I can find so
 far, to help along here is some basic info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 8.1</p>
<p>I have never had another antivirus on the computer</p>
<p>Windows Defender is greyed out in Services, and does not allow me to alter it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>Ok, as suggested there, delete the <strong>Windows Defender</strong> key which you have created. Try the third
<em>DISM</em> command mentioned here:</p>

            Tried the above but still no luck. Windows Defender service is up as running, however I get a warning saying turn on spyware protection and clicking 'Turn On' on Defender causes the error. It is set to automatic, but the options for start, stop and restart
 are all grey and cannot be clicked.

            <p>Yes. &nbsp; I am disappointed in the length of the vibration that comes with a call notification.</p>
<p>It is about one second in duration and even with the haptic alert set on high I miss calls.</p>
<p>My wife is a serious diabetic and I need to respond quickly to her phone calls.&nbsp; There are times, doctors office, meetings etc, when I have to put my phone on vibrate.&nbsp; With the phone in my pant pocket I do not always feel it.&nbsp; So I purchased the Band 2
 thinking that it would solve my problem.&nbsp; A 2 1/2 hour chat with tech support brought no improvement.</p>
<p>I do keep the Band snug on my wrist to increase the chance of my feeling a call signal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am 82 years old and I really like the Band 2 but fear that I will have to try something else.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions will be most welcome.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            Create a form for the client information. Put a combo box control&nbsp;in the form's header. Use the wizard when you add the control and you should get an option to use it to find the selected client.

<p>
</p><p>For better answer, I will describe little bit details on here.</p>
<p>(i) Because the two slots for activation is already full, the install button is inactive status, firstly. So, I make deactivate for this machine, then use install button. I doubt that this procedure make some problems for activation scheme.</p>
<p>(ii) The other machine (also Mac) is successfully activated.</p>

            <p>No. The link does not say anything about the solution. Some of the related articles are also same. My problem is not solved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried regional setting several times, re-installing several times, and updating and activation. All the ways are not effective for the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it is time to back the previous version.</p>

    <title>MS Query cannot see beyond 65536 rows in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MS Query cannot see beyond 65536 rows in Excel</h2>
                    <p>Good day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to use MS Query from within Excel to retrieve data from another Excel workbook (Excel to Excel).</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Query does not seem to be able to see Excel rows beyond the 65536 row limit of earlier Excel versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This results in: </p>
<p>1. Any named ranges with a specified row &gt; 65536, e.g. A1: C100 000 not being visible as an available table in the MS Query Wizard.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>2. If the range is defined as A:C, only 65536 rows of data is returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Excel 2016 (365) on Windows 10 PC</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any assistance / workarounds to enable &gt; 65536 records to be retrieved by MS Query would be appreciated.
</span></p>
<p><span>For legacy reasons I cannot use PowerPivot / PowerQuery.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Query will not work with named ranges exceeding 65,536 rows.&nbsp; Split the data into multiple worksheets with no more than 65,000 rows of data on each sheet and then assign named ranges.&nbsp; That will work.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the copy and paste solution is what I was trying to avoid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for using MS Query is the ability to use a UNION query to combine different ranges into a single pivot table for data reconcilliation (comparison).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data is part of a constantly changing workflow process, each data range has a different source, have different different formulas to make the data comparable, and are frequently updated etc. Splitting them up (even if they can be UNION'ed together again)
 will make them difficult to manage with constant updates to the underlying data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

    <title>Action disappears after using hyperlink - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blackiball  say:</h3>
<h2>            Action disappears after using hyperlink</h2>
                    <p>I made a Bingo game, and I have slides that go from number 1-75, with 20 numbers each slide. When you click on the number, you go into a differen't slide that ask a question, and I made a hyperlink to go back to the "root menu" that shows numbers 1-75. Also
 I made it so that when you go back to the menu, the number you clicked changes color.&nbsp;But if&nbsp;I go on and click on number 75 thus going to question 75 and going back back to the root menu of #61-75, and I navigate back to this slide. "Number 1" which should've
 still bin&nbsp;a red color changes back to the original color. It does this when you go click on numbers "2 slides out". So for this example, going to 1-20 &amp; 21-40, number 1 would remain red but at 41-60 &amp; 61-75. Number one would change back into the original color.
 How do I prevent this?</p>

            If you are using triggers so the change of color is an animation that is triggered by clicking on itself, then the slide would be reset by "going forward" to the slide. That is, if you land on the slide before and perform a Next Slide action (by clicking
 a hyperlink or hitting space bar or mouse click or ...). If that is the case, make sure all your hyperlinks are directly to a specific slide and not set as Next Slide.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>If, on the other hand, you are using VBA, then you should post some code so we can see what is going on. &nbsp;With something this complex, VBA might be the best option even though it has a steep learning curve. &nbsp;I say that because so much of the code to make
 this happen can be reused or copied and pasted.</div>

            I would definitely use triggers if that isn't what you tried.<br />
<br />
A problem with vba is the shapes will stay red even when you close PPT.<br />

<h3> mikek703  say:</h3>
<h2>            Temporarily turn off sleep mode&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to temporarily disable sleep mode without changing the sleep settings each time?&nbsp; Or a way to wake it up if an email message comes in? I am waiting for an email and when the computer goes to sleep my Outlook does not receive emails.&nbsp; In fact
 if I awaken the computer and click on send/receive in Outlook nothing happens.&nbsp; I have to exit Outlook and open it again.&nbsp; I would like the computer to wake up if I get an email, or at the very least I want to be able to turn it off without having to reassign
 the sleep settings each time.</p>
<p>thanks.</p>

<p>"Insider" is a setting in Settings/Update and Security/Windows Insider Program.&nbsp; Each device has to be set up to receive insider preview builds on its own so you don't transfer anything.&nbsp; You just set up the newer computer to receive insider builds.&nbsp; The
 newer computer needs to be running an activated Windows 10, of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your question is really about transferring the Windows 10 license itself, you cannot transfer an OEM copy or a free upgrade from a year or so ago if the original Windows 7 or 8 was OEM (installed on the computer at the factory). &nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed some of my appointments are missing in&nbsp;outlook calendar my MAC computer. At home, I am using my Microsoft Outlook in MAC to update the appointments in calendars and my assistant will update my calendar using her windows computer at office. To my
 surprise, I realised some of the appointments I had booked in earlier disappeared or some events still retained on the calendar despite I had deleted them. &nbsp;I am using Microsoft 365 outlook on both computers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have following questions I hoped I can get some answers:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How frequent does the MAC outlook calendar sync with cloud? Is there any way I can deliberately sync MAC outlook calendar with cloud&nbsp;?</li><li>&nbsp;If same calendars being updated in MAC and windows PC almost the same time, which calendar will get updated first?</li><li>&nbsp;Is there any place in Microsoft outlook that I can set the "updating frequency" of the calendar with the cloud?</li><li>I have deleted recurring event on my MAC Computer and create a single event but both single and deleted recurring events &nbsp;still appeared on my calendar in my assistant's windows PC. How can we solve this issue?</li></ul>
<p>Thanks in advance for all the help I am getting!</p>

<p>I was having problems with Windows update, automatic, manually.&nbsp; It was getting stuck and then saying in red my computer wasn't protected because it was out of date. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Troubleshooter, didn't work.&nbsp; I tried various fixes nothing worked.&nbsp; I've now completed a clean install of windows and it is all working fine.&nbsp;</p>
