<p>Hi,</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was helping my aunt to update her C7 (RM-675) model. I tried to help her by installing the PR1.2 update first through SW Update as it showed up there. I managed to download the file with size of almost 7000kb through Wi-Fi on the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the phone requested for a restart, the screen went white and a word "Updating" showed up. However, within ten seconds, there's a message showing "Restarting the phone" on the white screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phone booted into the homescreen and a message popped out saying "Phone not updated. The software package is not compatible with your phone. Please check with your local service provider".&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That didn't make me give up. I went to try again using USB connection to Nokia OVI Suite. The system checked there's an update of PR1.2 and I chose to update it. At first, the system requested for a phone backup and so I waited for it to finish backing up
 the phone. Later, I downloaded the PR1.2 software update with the file size of 175mb. When finished downloading, there's an error message showing up "Something went wrong". The system suggested me to restart the Nokia OVI Suite and then after several attempts,
 I couldn't detect the updates anymore. The result returned with "No updates available".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to try my luck on *#0000# and check for updates. I could detect v22.014 update was available for download with the file size of 25000kb+. Again, I finished downloaded it and phone requested for a restart and it took me to the white screen and the
 same word "Updating" appeared on the screen again. I thought this time finally I could update to Symbian Anna. Within ten seconds, the phone got rebooted and went to the homescreen again showing up with the same message of&nbsp; "Phone not updated. The software
 package is not compatible with your phone. Please check with your local service provider".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone product code was 059D0B0. She bought this phone in Malaysia from a local dealer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the product code variant and this variant is from Spain, I wondered? The latest update for this variant is only 014.002 which I checked on the Nokia official website and still I could detect Symbian Anna update on OTA on the phone. Can the person
 in charge please check what is wrong with the situation that I'm having? BTW, we're from Malaysia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also had problems with the upgrade to Symbian Anna.</p>
<p>My carkit didn't work, telephone went off and on frequently, etc.</p>
<p>Nokia helpcenter told me that my carkit should be upgraded with</p>
<p>new firmware and that had to try to reinstall Symbian Anna.</p>
<p>I tried to reinstall Symbian Anna a few times but nothing worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I solved the problem!!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Make a backup of your files, pics, video's, etc.</p>
<p>- Put your phone back in the factory settings</p>
<p>- sofware update via Wifi or LAN</p>
<p>- Installs Symbian Anna 1/2 en 2/2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EVERYTHING WORKS FINE NOW!!!! &nbsp;also my carkit......</p>
<p>applause for Nokia helpcenter.............NOT!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will only take about 10 minutes to configure your telephone</p>
<p>and maybe some stuff from your backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tip: put as much as you can on the extra memory card,</p>
<p>I think most you have it in your phone.</p>

<p>I don't know who has called you, but it certainly wasn't Nokia, as we would not need your IMEIs to enable the Symbian Belle updates. If they would call again, don't give out your IMEI.</p>

            I am from India. I have been receiving calls from people claiming to be Nokia guys and asking for IMEI number(similar to the story posted by RajenderReddy above). I declined to share it an asked them to send me an email from their official email id. They
 indeed sent me an email as below:<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** to me<br />
###########################<br />
Hi Sir,<br />
<br />
We understand that my team member, had a discussion with you regarding your Nokia phone upgrade to Symbian ANNA.<br />
Request you to provide your IMEI number so that we can update your records in our database.<br />
<br />
"Thank You" for choosing Nokia.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Bhushan Ropalekar<br />

The number from which I have been getting these calls is +91-20-67273600 (a landline number from Pune, Maharashtra, India)<br />
Can someone please clarify if these are authentic enquiries from Nokia?

            These are not authentic calls as Nokia as already has asserted on Facebook as well as in this forum that IMEI is not needed for belle or Anna and they never collect IMEI numbers.

            Exactly similar situation to Uddhav, I went ahead and called Nokia Care India. They say its a genuine call. I'm still sceptical. It's like a bank asking user to share the account number, and no way of telling what they will use it for.

            Hello friends don't ever give your IMEI number. These calls might be fake calls. IMEI number is very important. Upto my knowledge i think that there's no relation between software update and IMEI.

<h2>            Creating the right tenant for School</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>Am ready to deploy a subscription for a school.</p>
<p>Now I want to do it right the first time :)</p>
<p>I want to create a tenant that can be used for the school´s administratton but also for free for teachers and students.</p>
<p>Is that possible?</p>
<p>The reason that I ask is because in near future they want to move the administration from on premise exchange to O365.</p>
<p>And the teachers and administration share the same domain eg. contoso.edu.</p>
<p>So if I go ahead and create the auto tenant with my fírst user and claim the domain for educational purpose.</p>
<p>Can I then afterwards buy into that tenant and create a subscription for the administration ?</p>

<p>Or do I have it all backwards ?</p>

<p>Regards Lars</p>

<p>Hi Lars,</p>
<p>Yes, it is. To achieve the requirement, you can set up an Office 365 Education plan tenant and it’s free. Below are the detailed steps:<br />
1.&nbsp;Click the green <strong>Get Started</strong> button in the <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/academic/office-365-education-plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article </a>to begin a FREE trial.<br />
2.&nbsp;Complete the form to create an account and verify that you are affiliated with your organization.<br />
3.&nbsp;During the trial, follow the steps in the Office 365 admin portal to verify that your organization is a qualified academic institution. If you are nearing the end of your 30 day trial and have not received your eligibility verification notice from Office
 365, please feel free to post back.<br />
4.&nbsp;If eligibility is confirmed, Office 365 Education offers will become available in the Office 365 admin portal.<br />
5.&nbsp;Go to the License Management tab in the admin portal to reassign your trial users to the Office 365 Education offer.</p>
<p>For more information, please refer to the following article:</p>
<p><a href="https://products.office.com/en/academic/compare-office-365-education-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://products.office.com/en/academic/compare-office-365-education-plans</a></p>
<p>Regarding “So if I go ahead and create the auto tenant with my fírst user and claim the domain for educational purpose. Can I then afterwards buy into that tenant and create a subscription for the administration”, yes, you can. After claim the domain for
 educational purpose, you can then create a subscription for administration&nbsp;such as Education E5.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks,<br />

    <title>What Happened to My Ribbon Icons&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What Happened to My Ribbon Icons&#63;</h2>
                    All of a sudden they became almost transparent as though the entire Windows Theme changed. It's very difficult to see them now. How can I change them back?

<p>I have a couple of questions in regards to how to deal with this to see if anyone has tried it or has any suggestions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Does anyone know if I can uninstall the updates from 10-3 without uninstalling all of Office - 365.&nbsp; I do not know if these are really updates or if they are actually re-installs?&nbsp; I'm attaching a photo of the updates from 10-3 that caused this unwanted
 change.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c4a2239-1ef8-45ca-ae0e-97aa3c31bd64?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c4a2239-1ef8-45ca-ae0e-97aa3c31bd64?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; If this will not work, has anyone tried installing just a desktop version and turning off automatic updates?&nbsp; I think I have a desktop version from about 2 years ago.&nbsp; I realize I will not have updates for 2 years, but it will be better than the visual
 distraction of this new look.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Commentary:</p>
<p>For us, we have been allowed to choose our own office software at our company based each person's comfort and experience level.&nbsp; This change requires the brain to have to search for things each time because the mental pathways from using the product do not
 match to the new visual.&nbsp; This change substantially weakens the argument for continuing to have multiple office systems based on experience and only serves to bolster the argument for moving all to one system.&nbsp; Since Google is the more dominant system in our
 environment, I fear that the productivity challenges that this will cause will be all that is needed to force standardization on Google at our company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've learned all too well that these posts have no affect on Microsoft and changes never come despite having seen some posts in the pasts where thousands of people asked for the change, nothing ever happens.&nbsp; I specifically recall the request that continues
 today where people have asked even begged to have the icons for attached documents to be smaller for many reasons including making it easier to see all the attachments without having to scroll.&nbsp; Microsoft simply refuses to make the change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows/suggestions/14833446-option-to-make-attachment-icons-scaleable-in-micro</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It appears that Microsoft is going for a large and clunky motif.&nbsp; we live in a time of amazing graphics and it's comical to think what would happen if an x-box game's graphics regressed to this state.&nbsp; Truly the new ribbon seems like a prototype of something
 to come and the opposite of sleek and finished.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for those still reading and wondering why i wrote this if I know that it's just shouting at the wind.&nbsp; Well, the simple answer is that the benefit of shouting at the wind is to get it out of my system which clears my brain and allows me to find solutions,
 which in this case will have to be alternatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've started to look for alternative email clients and the one that seems like it would be a good replacement for outlook and actually has a lot of the requested features is eM Client.&nbsp; {https://www.emclient.com/}</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I do know is that this has already chewed through a few hours in just 2 days so the productivity loss is already measurable and I fear soon to be actionable.</p>

<p>Hi wzf23wzfwzf23wzf,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, you need to change the Autodiscover record and MX record. If you migrate from other email provider to Office 365 and add your custom domain in Office 365, you need to change the DNS records. Please refer to this article to edit your DNS records in your
 Domain provider:</p>

</p><p>Skype doesn't support all calls to all number rangers in every country. The number you are calling may not be reachable through Skype, usually&nbsp; these are premium-priced or geographic/country specific numbers. is this happening to one specific number only?
 How about trying a different device or using

            The number in question is using a standard area code. &nbsp;Since the area code was implemented in early 2016, not many people are currently using it. &nbsp;Having said that, I love that the response is effectively "use something else to make the call" instead of
 skype actually investigating/incorporating the newer area code. &nbsp;Perfect attitude if you want to retain customers.

<h2>            Have stopped receiving eMails from mailing lists, while my mum has stopped getting newsletters she&#39;s subscribed to.</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In March, my mother stopped receiving eMails from Biblegateway, a website we have both been receiving newsletters from for two years now. She tried to resubscribe to the newsletters she had been receiving three times, and all three times, the site said she
 had been successful, but no eMails were forthcoming. I sent an eMail to the site staff a few days ago informing them of this, but today I realised that I, too, had stopped receiving eMails from somewhere, specifically, the NVDA Mailing List. I have been signed
 up to this list for a number of months, and have never gone a day without getting messages from them. Even the eMails I send to the list are sent back to me along with everyone else signed up to it. That was how I tested my supposition. I sent an eMail to
 the NVDA list, and another mailing list I am subscribed to, and did not receive a carbon copy back for the NVDA one. There were no eMails in my junk folder, and Mum didn't have any BibleGateway eMails in HER junk folder either. Neither of us knows what is
 going on, but we are both concerned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for any typographical errors in this post. For some reason, my screen-reader will not read my message while I'm in the editor, although it does say the keys I press</p>

            <p>I've had similar issues but mine is in receiving email blogs that I've subscribed to through Feedburner.</p>
<p>I went to Yahoo.com and signed up with a new email and resubscribe to all the site emails I haven't been receiving through my MSN email address ad that fixed my problem until MSN helps us fix this problem, and I will know it's fixed when I resume the blog
 emails to my original MSN email address since I'm still subscribed to them all through that address. It's been going on about 2-3weeks for me.</p>

<p>I don't know why it does that, because it works with another webpages, but always restart with the same application.</p>
<p>I appreciate you tell me if I will be able to emulate IE9, and try it.</p>
<p>The website is an application that may not work correctly with IE11.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Guillermo</p>

            <p>Hi Guillermo,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please follow the steps below:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Do a <strong>clean boot</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>open up the <strong>run</strong> box</li><li>type in <strong>MSCONFIG</strong></li><li>go to the services tab and put a check mark on <strong>HIDE ALL MICROSOFT SERVICES</strong></li><li>click on <strong>DISABLE ALL</strong>, <strong>APPLY</strong> and then <strong>
OK</strong></li><li><strong>restart</strong> the computer and try IE again</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If step 1 does not work</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Downgrade to previous version of IE</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>go to <strong>control panel</strong></li><li>search for <strong>installed updates</strong></li><li>click on view installed updates and search for<strong> INTERNET EXPLORER</strong></li><li>highlight <strong>INTERNET EXPLORER</strong> and click on<strong> uninstall</strong></li></ul>
<p>It will automatically downgrade or rollback your IE to the previous version installed in your PC</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>Nica</p>

            <p>Hi Nica,</p>
<p>Thank you for you help, I tried first clean the boot and still the problem, I look for the second step, but I don't know if you are aware that the Internet Explorer is part of Windows 8.1 and there is not a separate update.</p>
<p>May I be able to emulate a previous version of IE11, the reason I ask for this is because the company for the application I use with Internet Explorer still working to fix some issues with IE10, if I will be able to simulate IE9 will be great since this
 version is already tested and works fine.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Guillermo</p>

Internet Explorer 11 is the default Web browser in Windows 8.1. You will not be able to install Internet Explorer 9 on Windows 8.1 Computer. But instead you can open the website in Internet Explorer 9 compatibility mode.<br />
<br />
</span><span>a. Open Internet Explorer.<br />
b. Press F12 key on the keyboard.<br />
c. Click on browser mode and select different version of Internet Explorer.</span>

<h2>            Win 10 TP Build 9879 re-booting too many times and more......</h2>
                    It took 1.5 hrs, 4 automatic reboots, some with progress bars, some without and 1 manual restart to get it to work. Much too long, looks like it hangs (although it doesn't), too may "setting things up" even more "settings thing up &amp; downloading apps" after
 initial login, multiple color screen shown progress yet I prefer progress bar or % complete. If there is only 1 user, my so many setting things up???? needs lots of attention. Yosemite and any Linux do much faster and cleaner installs

<h2>            Minecraft, malware and Bing</h2>
                    <p>This&nbsp;is feedback&nbsp;but for some reason I cannot provide feedback directly to Bing from New Zealand so hopefully someone at Bing sees this discussion.&nbsp; We recently bought a new gaming PC for our kids.&nbsp; I fired it up a couple of days ago, walked away for a couple
 of minutes and - boom - the Bing search engine took us straight to malware on a search for a Microsoft product!&nbsp; My son connected the computer to the internet in my brief absence&nbsp;and as this was the first use of the computer I had not changed the default browser
 or search engine.&nbsp; Nor had&nbsp;I a chance to activate the security software - this was literally 2 minutes into turning the PC on for the first time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, he searched "Minecraft Download" on Bing.&nbsp; He asked if it was OK to download Minecraft.&nbsp; Given minecraft is owned by Microsoft and he had searched through Bing I figured it was all ok - why wouldn't it be?&nbsp; He clicked on the top link in the search results,&nbsp;except
 it wasn't a search result, it was an ad, but&nbsp;those ads look very similar to search results, and promptly downloaded malware.&nbsp; After three hours of trying to clean up the computer, I gave in and took the computer back to the shop to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The guy at the shop also searched "Minecraft download" on Bing and the top result was the same as for my son.&nbsp; The link takes you to a "pcapps" page with a fairly convincing looking Minecraft download link.&nbsp; The guy at the shop couldn't believe it.&nbsp; Well
 done Bing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I know my son should have been more closely&nbsp;supervised for the download, but I am nonetheless astounded that the top ad for a Minecraft search on Bing (of all places) was a link to malware (FYI Optimizer Pro and Omiga Pro).&nbsp; It was a good lesson for
 my son, a lesson my wallet didn't need, and also an excellent reminder for me for why I use Google.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bing is spitting out a&nbsp;link to malware as its top ad in a search for a Microsoft product, it is not a ringing endorsement.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I hope you know the urls used in Bing Search engine.&nbsp; Many of these fake urls are hidden in search engines.&nbsp; Report them here.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You have to remember there is a third-party involved in this and for this reason always report these urls to Bing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bing doesn’t control the content that websites publish or that appears in Bing search results. To make sure content is removed from search results, your best option is to contact the webmaster for the website that published the content and request that it
 be deleted or removed. Until the webmaster removes the content from their website, it will continue to exist and can be discovered by going directly to the web address or by search engines like Bing.</p>

            Yes, I downloaded the "Windows 10 for Skype" version about two or three weeks ago.&nbsp; Today, I was unable to change my status or even see my status. Last week I was able to do that. Is that a new "feature" to not have control of one's own status?&nbsp; The suggestion
 of switching to the old version to change status seems to be awkward.&nbsp; So why is this happening and can it be switched back to be more convenient.&nbsp; I also don't seem to have all of my contacts displayed now, nor are is their status indicated, unless they are
 Online.&nbsp;

<p>Thanks but I can't help but wonder why in the hell there are two versions of skype available. I am using the latest Windows 10 and expecting to get the most advanced and complete working version of skype and I'm left with a version of skype that's not even
 able to do a simple change of status. Consumers like me who get the latest versions of windows are entitled to a complete working version of skype. Come on microsoft! you're better than that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now, I have the latest version of windows 10, latest version of skype and to get the working functionalities I want from skype, I have to install a classic version. I think Microsoft from now on should start changing the word, UPDATE to OUTDATE! Downgrading
 is microsoft's game I guess!</p>

<p>Up to this version of Skype it was easy to change your status. Only new version did this step into the deepest past.</p>
<p>Who does such a job?</p>
<p>The problem is - on mobile you can't downgrade without downlodable App - and there is nothing to be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downgrading is the only way - unfortunally unpossible with support of MS. But they ignore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same problem was with WhatsApp some months before - and they returned to old version because of massive protest of users.</p>
<p>Why do developers the same mistake again?</p>

<p>Like many with the new 'upgrade' I can't change my status from Online to Away - it's a disgrace! I guess it has much to do with marketing - so Skype can claim to have so many subscribers online at any one time (when we are not). This is very underhand.

<p>Skype team, C<span>hanging your Skype online status into&nbsp;</span><span>Away
</span>or one of many other options is a smart and useful feature, which is no longer available in new Skype app. Suggesting to switch back to old classic version is a joke or shame on Microsoft part. One thing that Microsoft should let the Skype community
 know without mincing words in no uncertain terms is... <em>is this an unintended bug or done by purpose in the new Skype app</em>? If done by purpose, why? What was Microsoft's crazy thinking on this bug or change? This feature was working flawlessly in previous
 version, now it does not! There is no way now! Too bad! It shows lack of simple common sense on the part of Microsoft Skype program team or lack of basic knowledge about how your own Skype community users use the app. Why would Microsoft Skype team take away
 one of the most used and basic features with no prior communication to customers or taking customers input before making such a change? This current state of the new Skype app is not acceptable and needs an immediate fix from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the online help links below, it appears that it should be possible to change the status to a variety of options. This current help page and earlier version behavior confirms that this is a bug that needs to be addressed by Microsoft ASAP.</p>

<p>This creates even worse problems. &nbsp;My Win 10 desktop PC keeps installing the old desktop version for some reason, and when it does so, Skype malfunctions on all devices:&nbsp;<br />
1) Notifications completely stop in iOS<br />
2) Whole segments of conversations are lost/ go missing<br />
3) Notifications bunch up on PC - nothing then suddenly 100<br />
<br />
So, basically people cannot reliably get hold of me via Skype, which as you can imagine is causing a lot of problems. &nbsp;And still the icing on the cake which is this retrograde step to limit status flag.</p>

<p>If you want to be like Apple and remove features in order to become "slicker" then you need to make them obsolete first. Just removing them for no good reason is a bit ... well it's not good.</p>

            Since you don't say what "the wrong cells" means, I assume you mean that the links don't update to reflect the inserted columns/rows.
<div><br />
<div>if you insert a hyperlink to, say, cell D3 in sheet2, XL doesn't update the cell to D4 if you insert a row at row 2.</div>
<div><br />
<div>One way to ensure your hyperlinks continue to point to the desired cell is to name each one (using Insert/Name, or just by typing each name into the Name box on the Formula bar when the cell is selected). You can then hyperlink to that name, and the reference
 will update when you insert rows/columns.</div>

<h3> jackflap  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 crashes saving VBA &#38; clicking tools &#124; digital signature</h2>
                    <p>It was suggested to me that I post this problem fro resolution in this Community:</p>
<p>I desperate for a solution so please excuse what appears to be "long winded"</p>
<p>My thought was to get all info I had into this post.</p>
<p>***********************************************************************************</p>
<p>I just installed MS Office 2013 Pro 64 bit / Windows 7.</p>
<p>Previous version was Office 2007.</p>
<p>I had a single macro (small) installed on Outlook 2007 with a digital signature.</p>
<p>I have removed digital signature &amp; macro, reinstalled MS Office 2013&nbsp; and the same problem reoccurs.</p>
<p>Each time I save VBA or access tools | digital signature, Outlook 2013 crashes.</p>
<p>Here's what the dialog box says it is sending to Microsoft:</p>
<p>&nbsp; C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Temp\3972783.cvr<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Temp\CVR9398.tmp.cvr<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Temp\WERB414.tmp.appcompat.txt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Temp\WERB4EF.tmp.mdmp</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How can I correct this issue???</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>I created another user and access to Outlook 2013 was flawless.</p>
<p>I'm concluding that my issue is with the outlook.pst file. ??</p>
<p>How do I correct my problem without losing contacts, calendar appointments, etc. if the issue is in the outlook.pst file?? I did run scanpst.exe and repaired the file, but no effect on the problem.</p>
<p>Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Microsoft do not recommend the use of 64-bit Office unless it is required because you are running very large, very complex Excel workbooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might see if changing to the 32-bit version overcomes the issue.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br />

Thanks for your reply is very thought provoking:</p>
<p>I installed the trial version of Office 2013 and fortunately, for me, the cost is just my time to install the software. If I had spent $400 for the software, only to learn 32 bit software was MS recommended, I would be livid had I purchased the 64 bit version!
 I am planning to purchase full version Office 2013, however, the grief I have with this issue is giving me second thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be very interested in your thoughts relative to my update information above.</p>
<p>The issue appears to be limited to the user account that I had with Outlook 2007 with a macro and a digital signature. I have removed the digital signature certificate and the macro, yet the problem still remains.</p>
<p>Additionally, I removed the mail profile and created another profile. This action did not correct the problem with my "main" user account. Another created user account did not exhibit the problem.</p>
<p>Again, the issue is if I save VBA or attempt to access tools | digital signature, Outlook 2013 crashes.</p>
<p>On opening Outlook 2013, A message appears that the digital signature certificate has been tampered with. The certificate is non-existent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really need to get this resolved</p>
<p>If you, or some else out there, could provide recommendations to fix this issue it will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>I'm of the belief that 32 bit vs. 64 bit software is not the root cause as it works flawlessly in a newly created user account.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p><br />
I am not sure that I can provide any more assistance other than to suggest that you post to the Microsoft Office Outlook Forum

            <p>Since you didn't tell us what version of Excel you are using, I'll provide 2 sets of instructions to deal with the printed version of the worksheet:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Excel 2007 and/or 2010 - you will have several "Tabs" across the top of the sheet instead of the older Excel 2003 and earlier menu items.</p>
<p>Go to the [Page Layout] tab and in the {Page Setup} group, click on the little pull-down arrow at the lower right corner of that group.&nbsp; The Page Setup dialog will open;</p>
<p>To fit to page, go to the [Page] tab in the dialog and click on the "Fit to:" button and choose 1 wide by 1 tall to fit all of it on a single sheet of paper.&nbsp; If you have a really long (lots of rows) worksheet, you can choose 1 for wide and delete the entry
 in the "tall" setting to get it all to fit in 1 sheet's width, but go on to other sheets to printout all used rows.</p>
<p>To get gridlines to print, while still in the Page Setup dialog, go to the [Sheet] tab and check the box next to "Gridlines".</p>
<p>For Excel 2003 and earlier, use the menu:&nbsp; File --&gt; Page Setup which will bring up the Page Setup dialog and you can then follow the instructions above to complete the tasks.</p>

<p>Thank you, ManuelCapiro, for taking the time to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not find the File menu item you mentioned but found my answer while looking around for it.&nbsp; I am new to Outlook but have used many different systems over the years.&nbsp; I understand that different versions might look differently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I did (see&nbsp;screenshot).</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Clicked on the Settings wheel on the upper right corner.</li><li>Scrolled down to the bottom and clicked on Mail.</li><li>From the left navigating panel, scrolled down and found Email Signature.</li><li>Clicked on Email Signature and edited my signature line.</li></ul>
<p>Thank you for setting me on the right path.</p>

    <title>Linking Word and Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allanlundy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Linking Word and Excel</h2>
                    <p>It seems to be pretty straightforward to link an Excel doc to a Word doc so that data in a particular cell in Excel will appear in the Word doc, but I need to go the other way around.&nbsp; Specifically, I need to locate a number or text in a Word doc (this can
 be set up to be relatively easy, such as the first cell in the first table), and have that appear in the first row of an Excel doc.&nbsp; Then open a second Word doc and have it do the same -- copying the number or text to the second row of the same Excel sheet.&nbsp;
 Thousands of Word documents will need to be done this way, so it needs to be automated, as in using macros.&nbsp; I have Office, Word 2016.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; Thanks very much!

            <p>If the Word documents have not yet been created/distributed, try the following. I haven't explored the new content controls, but since the form fields are still there, I suspect this will do what you need.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Show the developer ribbon in Word</li><li>click to enable design mode</li><li>Under controls, select more [drop down]/legacy/text form field (stay away from the Active X controls)</li><li>then right-click the control on the page that was just added, click properties, then change the bookmark name to something unique and meaningful that represents what that specific field will be used for. For example: FirstName, LastName, ZipCode, PartNumber,
 etc. Avoid spaces and special characters in the name</li></ul>

<p>here is some code to get you started- this is in Excel VBA, used to open and grab data from all files in a target directory. Note that I last used this in Excel 2010, so YMMV (especially if you are using 64-bit Excel 2016). You will see that in addition
 to just a few open text fields, I was also collecting data from a bunch of radiobuttons (this was a survey, so I had a bunch of questions, and within each question I had multiple levels of response- so I used shorthand in naming the buttons in Word so that
 they would be easy to identify).</p>

            Thanks for taking the time to respond, KERATL!&nbsp; As it happens, I set up the text form field and it didn't work -- attempting to enter something in that spot deleted the field.&nbsp; This was true even with a pristine Word doc, although I need to be able to
 add info into old docs.&nbsp; What I actually need is something to get doc properties such as word count.&nbsp; I was able to insert fields using Quick Parts, and that did the first part of the job for me.&nbsp; I am still working on linking the result to Excel.&nbsp; As you
 see, I don't need anything as complex as your survey requires.&nbsp; Just something that will take the result of the Quick Parts inquiry and stick it into an Excel cell.&nbsp; I will pick apart your macro soon to see what I can use.&nbsp; Thanks again!

            Once you have completed creating your form, be sure to turn off design mode, and before sending to users I usually protect the document as well. Users can enter data into form fields, but not delete them. HTH.

            Can you use a browser and login to Web Skype to see whether your login ID and password combination is working or not?

            Try signing into the account using the email address and password associated with your Skype ID. 
<br />
<br />I would also try running Skype diagnostics on your account:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics</a>
<br />
<br />Also sign into Skype for Web to confirm if you are still unable to send messages. 
<br />
<br />Skype for web
<br /><a href="https://web.skype.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/en</a>
<br />
<br />Still not working?
<br />
<br />Check Skype status to see if its functioning in your region:
