<h2>            Can&#39;t send or receive messages on 2 different Xbox One consoles with two separate accounts- everything else works fine</h2>
                    Has anyone has this issue? &nbsp;I can play games, join parties, talk over mic, but I can't receive or send messages. My Conversations will not load as well. &nbsp;When I try to send a message it says "Sorry Something Went Wrong." &nbsp;I have an open NAT...UPnP is on
 - but my Xbox doesn't show up on the list - not sure if that matters. &nbsp;DMZ is active as well. &nbsp;I also did a port forwarding to access the port my xbox is using. &nbsp;One of the consoles received this error message when it tried to update 0x80a4001b. &nbsp;I've spent
 countless hours on this and nothing works!! &nbsp;I am so frustrated. &nbsp;Even the Xbox Support people can't figure it out! &nbsp;Thanks in advance.&nbsp;

<h2>            Unable to use my Proximus TV V5 decoder via OneGuide</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Gents,</p>
<p>I try to configure the OneGuide application in order to use my decoder.</p>
<p>When I introduce the brand of the decoder and the 3 first letters of the model, my decoder is not available in the list displayed by the configurator.</p>
<p>The only way for configuring OneGuide is to introduce the IR code of the decoder remote control. But I don't know it and my tv provider is not able to give me this code</p>
<p>I'm from Belgium and my service provider for the television decoder is Proximus.</p>
<p>Here are the&nbsp; information about the decoder:</p>
<p>Brand: Cisco</p>
<p>Model: ISB8320-E</p>
<p>Provider: Proximus-Wallonie</p>
<p><br />
Is there anyone who can help me to complete the configuration?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply, I need to use Openwith as I have .jpg files associated with another Application. Though this is more of a work around then a solution, it does work in
<strong>some</strong> cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see this solution primarily as at best a workaround as it requires out of application work within the OS to make the app function as required. Really if the best way to view, organise or reorder your photo's is through the operating system then what is
 the point of this kind of photo management app anyway? I'm scratching my head on what exactly the app Photos is good for? If Windows OS could actually display video files through the -manage/viewslideshow option on the OS window, I would have virtually no
 use for the Photos app at all. It seems mainly to be just a pretty visual display of my photo folders, with few practical functions for either creating or viewing slideshows or editing the photo folders it reflects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I want to view my photos as a slideshow or organise the photos that I have for a slideshow, the first thing I need to do is
<strong>close the Windows Photos app</strong> and use the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I want to post process a photo using Photoshop or Light room it's impossible to easily put the photo back into the correct place for a Windows Photo slideshow viewing. I guess I could look at going through each image using the OS window and editing the
 'date taken' property through the file properties setting, which would then allow the file to be sorted into the correct date order by the OS for the 'Open with' Photos slideshow to then display them in the correct order. But really this seems like a very
 clumsy way of creating anything but the most basic of slideshows and seems to be making a manual task of what computers should do best.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes the Windows Photo app not a lot more than a very basic Slideshow viewer or photo tweaker with limited practical functionality, it really just comes across as a half baked program. Endless frustration has me on the lookout for a more efficient
 app that can organise my photos for slideshows, as this app in its current state is pretty much a fail in my eyes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another kinda solution I have found within Photos for a chronological sort is by creating an Album, but even this has just revealed another short fall of the app. Reordering your photos is not possible in Albums, so any thought of adding custom slides or
 adding retouched photos is just another missing basic function within the app. (Without resorting to editing properties of the file in the OS). This short fall makes the Albums feature virtually useless for me, except again for a very basic slideshow in chronological
 order. Or as an exercise in removing the new albums that Photos endlessly insists on creating for me without request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply, but in the end I found that anytime I used the photo app I just end up running around in circles trying to find a solution for relatively simple missing functions, that should be a basic foundation for any photo slideshow app.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Welcome to modular design!&nbsp; I use four separate programs to do what I consider fairly basic tasks and I'll soon add a fifth if MS doesn't make resizing any better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Photos was designed in the modern style - a very attractive but minimal program.&nbsp; Anyone with ambitions needs to supplement it with other programs - I currently use Explorer, Photo Gallery and Paint.&nbsp; Serious photo enthusiasts use even more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explorer is a no-brainer for anyone that's not satisfied with Photos' Albums.&nbsp; It lets you have descriptive names, tags and a rating scheme.&nbsp; It also makes it much easier to locate pictures once you move them to different folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Slideshow, don't use Photos at all.&nbsp; Use Photo Gallery or possibly Photo Viewer.&nbsp; The former is
<strong>much </strong>better at it plus lets you use a convenient flagging function.&nbsp; If you install it (via MS download) follow the instructions on the web for disabling scaling in its executable.&nbsp; It sounds like a hassle but is really very simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I don't even use Slideshow any longer.&nbsp; I use Photos' Edit screen, which is what appears when you first open Photos after clicking on an image in Explorer.&nbsp; People balk because of all the "chrome" but you can eliminate all but the bottom line's&nbsp;three
 controls.&nbsp; Use F11 to remove the top line, then single click to remove the remaining line.&nbsp; If you can move the scroll wheel without moving the mouse, even the "back/next" arrows will stay off the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why bother with all that?&nbsp; Because it gives me total control over the display.&nbsp; I can edit the picture using the many tools that&nbsp;Photos provides.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I can zoom in for greater detail (press&nbsp;&lt;ctrl&gt; while using the mouse's&nbsp;scroll wheel).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I must admit I'm not at all sure about the best way of ordering photos if date sequence is inadequate.&nbsp; Sorting by name, tag or ranking all are reasonable.&nbsp; If you want full control,&nbsp;download&nbsp;Windows Movie Maker from MS or buy something similar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can I check if parts in my computer are damaged&#63;</h2>
                    I left my laptop in my bag while it was still running (I had a setting on where closing the lid does nothing) and when I took it out it was very hot. I am worried that some of the parts inside might be damaged, is their a way I can check this without taking
 my computer to a shop? Thanks.

<p>Most laptops have access to compartments where the hard drive and ram are located and can be removed with a screwdriver .</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if the unit is under warranty and you open it, it can void the&nbsp;</p>
<p>warranty.</p>
<p>Most laptops have temperature limits that will shut it down if things get to hot, be it the hard drive, cpu, ram ect.</p>
<p>Hard disk sentinel ( paid ) and crystal disk (free ) are good at hard drive </p>
<p>diagnostics. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For cpu core temp is ( free ) can monitor the cpu, give highest temp </p>
<p>readings.</p>
<p>How long was the laptop in the bag for, was there any smell coming from the unit or to hot to touch.</p>
<p>Using compressed air to blow out the cpu &nbsp;air duct as well as a laptop cooler would help in the future.</p>
<p>You could run prime95 or other similar stress program to see if it is stable.</p>
<p>Most laptops have only one small fan to keep the cpu and maybe gpu unit cool, it is not much.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Normally standard manufactures like Dell and all used to ship the product with an inbuilt diagnostic utility to check standard hardware functions. As this is manufacturer specific and not part of Operating System, its better to check the manufactures website
 on how to invoke this utility. Also, all computers are equipped with a feature called thermal shutdown, were the computer will automatically shutdown if it crosses the threshold thermal limits.</p>

            Hi Eng, when upgrading from one version of Windows 10 to another, there should be no requirement for a Product Key - are you being asked for a Product Key?
<br />
<br />Are you manually applying this upgrade and if so did you boot from the installation media or are you running the ISO from inside Windows 10?

<br />Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.

<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Exception: you can double click the ISO (or right click it, choose Open with &gt; File Explorer), mount it and start the upgrade in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save.

<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Once you have the Windows 10 Spring Creators Update ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade. If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:

    <title>Can&#39;t get internet to work for a while after boot on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gabriell&#39;huillier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t get internet to work for a while after boot on Windows 10</h2>
                    So suddenly, my computer started having this weird problem where both Wifi and Ethernet connection won't work for a few minutes after booting my computer. If I use the troubleshoot function, it says that my internet doesn't have a valid IP configuration.
 If I just leave my computer running for upwards to 10 minutes, the problem will go away and my internet connection will be fine again. However, this happens everytime my computer either wakes up from sleep or is turned on, and I would like to get a better
 fix to this. This problem wasn't triggered by an update or anything.

<br />Right click each then click uninstall

            <p>Hi Curt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. What is the error message you get when you try to install SP1?</p>

<p>
</p><p>The most common causes of this problem are: </p>
<ul>

</li><li>
<p>A program on your computer, such as an antivirus or antispyware program, is interfering with the installation of the service pack.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>

            <p>Since even Posting this Question about How to install Win10 onto my Nov. 2007-vintage HP Pavillion DV6500 type laptop, I got a "bit" further, but still ultimately Cannot Solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I No-op'd anything that even Looked like an Anti-Virus. i don't have Any bought/commercial AV installed anymore, but apparently I still had M.S.E. Microsoft Security Essentials running. After many arduous re-boot attempts, trying to figure out "how" do
 you turn MSE off, I somehow eventually get it "Uninstalled" it's gone, not running. So, WindowsUpdate Successfully downloaded like a bunch (14 or 15 of them) Updates, things like Office 2007 whatever, normal security patches I think, what-not. But It REFUSES
 to install the "Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (KB9xx637)" (whatever number, I had it on my screen, now it doesn't Show that number again, What Kind of Visual U.I. shenanigans is that to make life troubleshooting Windows so difficult? anyway...) I simply CANNOT
 get this laptop to install Win 7 SP 1. I think I have to Give Up on installing Windows10. The news is ripe with lots of issues, re-booting, problems with folks trying to Upgrade to Win10, so it is probably just as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;But, for Completeness, this is Exactly the text I see in my WindowsUpdate menu, everytime this SP1 thing Doesn't install: &nbsp;"Failed: &nbsp;1 update&nbsp;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&nbsp;Error(s) found:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Code 17 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Windows encountered an unknown error".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot, Microsoft. Totally meaningless error to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;To be honest, I have had NOTHING but problems with this Hewlett Packard DV6500 Media Center type of Notebook. I just keep it running long enough to make sure I get important Files, home-movies I edited, and Gigabytes worth of Photos edited with HP SmartPhotos
 Correl Photos whatever, and then Back it up to 250GB external MaxTor drive, and then i will toss it in the trashcan.</p>

<h2>            How to disable Windows Vista from automatically installing hardware drivers on restart</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having issues pairing a bluetooth speaker, resulting in blue error screen. I have another post on this particular topic and was advised to uninstall my Bluetooth drivers, restart my machine and then install the latest Bluetooth driver from Asus.
 However, after uninstalling my Bluetooth drivers and restarting my pc, Windows automatically installs the original drivers back. I have searched high and low and have found no way to disable this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My original post about my problems with my Bluetooth speaker can be found here:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Instead of uninstalling it, disable it. Then boot, uninstall, reinstall. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may not need to reboot after uninstalling it. You could just update the driver without uninstalling it at all (this is the normal way).</p>

            <p>Thanks Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this, but it didn't work 100%. It worked at first, but my machine crashes if I restart with Bluetooth speaker turned-on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of curiosity, when I expand the Bluetooth tree as you suggested, there are two parts; Generic Bluetooth Adapter and Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator. Why are there two?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your instructions with the Generic Bluetooth Adapter, managing to change it to Asus-BT-183. So, under the Bluetooth tree I have Asus BT-183 and Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator. This combination crashed during restart with Bluetooth speaker on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to replace the Microsoft one now, maybe it's causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help,</p>
<p>David</p>

            <p>Update. I can't seem to replace the Microsoft one. If I disable it Bluetooth stops working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really want to play music through my Logitech UE Boom box, but 8/10 times my computer crashes and I get a bluescreen. I am sure it is the Bluetooth drivers that are causing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ASUS notebook from 2007. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I download the Bluetooth driver from Asus, it downloads VFPsetup-32 on my desktop (Install wizard). This is not detected if I try to "let me chk &amp; locate driver" as you suggested.</p>

<h2>            Jogos e Consoles pirateados - Opini&#38;&#35;245&#59;es</h2>
                    
<p>Eaí galera, de boa? Jogando alguma coisa?</p>
<p>Desde quando eu comecei a ler o fórum, eu andava percebendo que esse fórum não é só para ajudar as pessoas. (A JURA? ACHEI QUE O FÓRUM NÃO FOSSE GERAL '-')</p>
<p>Mais tem uma coisa a mais aqui, que é a educação de alguns aqui (TÁ, TIRANDO ALGUNS AQUI, QUE, NÉ, É DIFÍCIL SUPORTAR).</p>
<p>E vim expor minha opinião sobre os consoles e jogos pirateados.</p>
<p>Só pra começar, aqui no Brasil é difícil ter vários jogos novos de uma vez, porque aqui, o preço é absurdo, 4.000 reais um Playstation 4, na época do lançamento.</p>
<p>e 200 reais em um jogo lançamento, e se é edição especial, ai que o negócio esquenta.</p>
<p>Eu tive um Playstation 2 piratão (A SEU HIPÓCRITA!), calma, era Play, né, o Xbox original era difícil de se achar.</p>
<p>E a escapatória era o Pleisteicho. Pleisteicho! Já que tinha uma pilha de jogos e é o console mais vendido da história, junto com o GTA Rio de Janeiro, oops, digo San Andreas huehue brbr</p>
<p>Mais chega ae;</p>
<p>Imagina que você é um produtor de jogos Indie, sem publicadora</p>
<p>Daí você lança seu jogo á 20 reais</p>
<p>e faz fama, chegando a 100.000 cópias vendidas</p>
<p>Que legal!</p>
<p>Maaaais, a vontade de jogar o jogo é impossível de superar vendo vídeos</p>
<p>Mais a pessoa que quer jogar não tem nem 20 reais pra comprar o jogo, mais sim pra gastar 50 reais no camelô do Seu João com filmes, jogos, musicas etc.</p>
<p>E o que ela faz?</p>
<p>Vai no The Pirate Bay!</p>
<p>Acha lá o seu jogo, que algum cara pirateou,</p>
<p>e começa a jogar.</p>
<p>Vai la no seu Email e fala que o jogo é uma bela de uma porcaria.</p>
<p>Lembrando ; quando alguem pirateia, pega de graça, ela não tem o MENOR direito de reclamar ou se manifestar falando do produto.</p>
<p>Então a critíca dele não vale nem um centavo.</p>
<p>Algumas semanas depois, seu jogo bate a meta de 500.000 cópias vendidas</p>
<p>e você resolve aumentar o preço pra 50 reais</p>
<p>Mais isso é necessário, pra produzir um DLC ou uma sequência</p>
<p>E denovo o cara pirateia, alegando que ; 50 reais é muito caro. '-'</p>
<p>50 reais não é um absurdo, já que ele gasta mais de 100 reais em coisas desnecessárias.</p>
<p>Esses 50 reais seria tão util quanto uma garrafa de água</p>
<p>e você não tem mais algum lucro perante á seu jogo.</p>
<p>Já que os que se diz ser fiél a uma marca que ele pirateou,</p>
<p>o jogo está ultrapassado e caro.</p>
<p>Lembrando ; não existe ser fiél a uma marca que ele pirateou, já que ele pegou o produto com modificações, e pirateado, não dando o lucro á empresa, e sim pro Seu Anthenor do camelô que vende tudo.</p>
<p>Pare de piratear jogos, filmes, consoles, TUDO!</p>
<p>Você está cometendo um crime e participando dos 1% da escória do mundo.</p>
<p>Desde quando eu peguei o 360, não compro jogos piratas, nem acessórios.</p>
<p>Posso levar ban se eu tiver o&nbsp;console destravado.</p>
<p>Prefiro ficar com a consciência limpa do que não pagar nada em um jogo.</p>
<p>Poste suas opiniões aqui! Vou ler todas!</p>
<p>Valeu, Falou!</p>

<p>Aew manim belo post, em fala em play2, eu tive um play2 destravado ate pq como você disse naquela epoca ngm usava original, Pra acabar com a pirataria falta muita fiscalização do governo, ja que muitas vezes ja vi policiais comprando jogos pirata.
</p>
<p>Torço para acabar os PIRATÕES mas como todos nós sabemos nunca vai acabar!! Infelizmente :(</p>

<p>Olha cara... Gostei de você, vou te contar uma historinha..</p>
<p>Ha um tempo atrás, percebe-se realmente que era dificil mesmo de ter jogo de "pleistexo" ou seja lá como chamam e que o xbox era dificil de achar. Mais vou contar uma coisa sobre mim, na época eu tinha o console e era pirata.. Mais chegou uma hora que eu
 tinha que mudar, e deixar de ser burro. Larguei o console e ganhei um pc, comprava jogos super baratos e originais para o minha maquina com requesito recomendado, hoje não o uso mais para jogar, pois o Xbox 360 quando o adquiri me fez feliz, nunca pensei que
 teria um. agora você sabe por que existe a GWG? Exatamente por isso, para não existir pirateadores... Eu tenho dificuldade, muita dificuldade em comprar jogos de 200 reais, mais em certos sites confiaveis eu encontro pela metade do preço ou 50 reais mais barato,
 Eu junto dinheiro nem que seja começando por 10 centavos. Ultimamente não to comprando jogos sabe... Eu pego os jogos da GWG quando são interessantes.. E quando não são nem experimento, prefiro vir aqui e ver os comentários dos vossos amigos da Live que adquiriram
 o game. Então é isso cara, melhor console travado do que destravado. "As pessoas mudam mesmo que seja para o bem ou para o mal"</p>

<p>Belo post Man!! Realmente a pirataria é uma droga! &nbsp;Dificilmente alguém passou longe dos consoles e jogos piratas pois desde a década de 80 era difícil ter as coisas a não ser importadas. Quem nunca teve um "Nintendinho", "Master System", "Family Computer"
 ou qualquer outra coisa? Tudo isso era cosole pirata, cópias do "Nintendo" que veio pro Brasil oficialmente muito tempo depois. Naquela época não tinha jeito, tinha que ter o que o mercado oferecia.</p>
<p>Hoje, temos mais alternativas, temos oficialmente consoles fabricados aqui jogos, acessórios e uma pá de coisa. A pirataria deveria até diminuir com isso mas ainda tem gente que acha justo a pirataria por que tudo original acaba sendo caro. Se parar e prestar
 bem atenção, é notável que a pirataria não compensa. Estamos lotados de promoções de jogos, bons GWG, acessórios a preços acessíveis e de qualidade... Sinceramente, só lamento muito os pirateiros que se acham os ban ban bans com seus jogos piratas e consoles
 destravados. Um dia isso vai acabar, podem apostar!!</p>

<p>Valeu ae galera! Tô até pensando em escrever a parte 2 do post.</p>
<p>Sobre as opiniões, eu realmente compreendo com todas,</p>
<p>jogos de PC são baratos, mais você precisa de um requerimento pra jogar.</p>
<p>Dynavision e Polystation eu joguei cara, cartucho com 64, 128 jogos era muito f***!</p>
<p>Vinha com muitos jogos...</p>
<p>Devia ter um esquema anti-pirataria, rastreando IP e talz, seria bom!</p>

<p>Eu penso que cada um faz o que quiser e pronto. Eu só compro original, mas tenho amigos que não. Jogamos juntos sem problema. Bom, eu posso pagar um jogo de R$ 200,00, que é o que custa no nosso país, mas nem todo mundo pode. O que eu vou fazer? Comprar
 briga com meio mundo que pagou dez reais pelo mesmo o jogo ali na banquinha? Não. A minha parte eu fiz.
</p>
<p>Também não critico e não saio ofendendo as pessoas. A forma como elas gastam o dinheiro delas é problema delas. Eu sei do meu. E além de tudo, não trabalho para as empresas de games. Se elas quiserem em contratar para ficar de chorume pelas redes sociais,
 beleza, passe o contrato que eu assino.</p>
<p>Se a pirataria é um problema para uma pessoa, bom, então antes de tudo essa pessoa deve parar de baixar até fotos da internet, pois a imagem pode ter direitos autorais. Não é o que eu vejo, as pessoas que mais criticam pirataria de games são também pessoas
 que baixam filmes e discos da banda favorita logo no lançamento.</p>
<p>Não cabe a mim, nem a ninguém criticá-las; cada uma faz o que quer.</p>

<p>Ô cara abraço u.u!</p>
<p>Realmente eu usava produtos piratas, sim, pode me chamar de hipócrita.</p>
<p>Mais era filmes, jogos de PS2, e jogos de PC.</p>
<p>Mais hoje eu percebi que, pagar 5 reais em um jogo lançamento é muito, mais muito tentador,</p>
<p>pagar aquele Far Cryzinho novo por 5 reais, aiiiiiii e lindo de ver o preço ali</p>
<p>Buuut, pagar mais caro vai resultar em coisas boas, tipo, vai entrar na sua mente pra não deixar o jogo espalhado por ai já que ele é original, você não corre o risco de ser banido etc.</p>

            You need to click the Dependencies tab to find out which of the listed services failed. Examining the Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc) might also help.

<h2>            Administrators Group Can&#39;t be given full control&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This must be a bug because it doesn't make sense:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to reinstall Windows but when I put in the data backup SD card, having change the ownership and given full control to all the files I still can't delete/move files from the drive even though I am a member of Administrators group. I have checked security
 settings for the folder and it does show that Administrators group have full control. The folder shows up as readonly but when I try to disable the readonly flag the system goes through all the files in the folder and the sub folders (takes ages everytime).
 Then when I close the properties and reopen it, it is readonly again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way that I have so far managed to do anything is by assigning full control to my login name (member of Administrators) specifically and even then there are inconsistencies that I can't account for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on?</p>
<p>And could you let me know if there is quicker way of editing securities on huge folders. There needs to be a quicker way.</p>

            <p>Hi and thank you for your feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>As I mentioned in the original submission this was a complete reinstallation from scratch. There was no upgrade involved.</li><li>The issue started right from the beginning, i.e. once I installed Windows 10. I knew that I had to change the securities on my external storages that were setup by the previous installation. I knew that&nbsp;old administrator/(s) would show up as unknown. Therefore,
 first and before attempting to modify the contents of the external storages, I&nbsp;changed the owner ship to from the old Administrators to the new Administrators and passed it on to all subfolders and even checked the effective access in the Advanced option to
 make sure that Administrator Group had full access. But when I tried to move files I was not given access. I had to provide full access to the specific user (Babak) who was already a member of Administrators before I could modify the content on these external
 storages that were setup by the original installation which was an upgrade from Windows 7 but had worked perfectly well with the upgrade to Windows 10 for almost a year. So this has nothing to do with upgrade issues.</li><li>This is happening on all other external storages (USBs SDs) that were originally setup for the original Windows 10 installation. However and probably interesting point is that although the effective access shows Full access by the administrators group a
 member of the same group cannot view the Auditing data (return with access denied)&nbsp;until the specific user is given full access and not just as a member!.</li><li>I know how to get into safe mode. Please note that I was a certified Microsoft SQL administrator&nbsp;ever since 2004. So, I am hardly a novice on Windows issues.</li><li>I have noted that there are two other users have reported the same issues. Please note that I am running a pro 64 bit version and that might indicate to an issue in the Group Policies that is different to Home version.</li></ol>

    <title>Recording my voicemail message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kd johnson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recording my voicemail message</h2>
                    <p>I have had a Skype account for many years and have the voicemail enabled so that people can leave me a message.</p>
<p>On investigating a different issue this morning I note that my personalised greeting has disappeared and is replaced with a generic "The person you are calling is not available".&nbsp; I hate those anonymous greetings, because one is never sure whose voicemail
 it is and who one might be leaving a message for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I change my voicemail greeting (or restore it back to what it was for many years)?</p>

    <title>Why can&#39;t I select multiple messages in Skype for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arka debnath  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I select multiple messages in Skype for Windows 10 UWP&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I and other people in my organization uses Skype heavily for communicating with clients, and we need to copy some of those conversations to a temporary files as action items.</p>
<p>Now if a client sends an instruction in 20 separate messages, we need to mark each of the messages one at a time, copy it and paste it in the notepad. Instead, we totally want to select all 20 messages together and copy it somewhere else.</p>
<p>It is really annoying to copy each messages separately.</p>
<p>I have found in some other discussion where the suggested answer is to download the deprecated Skype for Desktop which is totally not an acceptable answer.</p>

</span></p>
<p>

<p>

    <title>Folder permissions, windows search engine permissions, default - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rhantolq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folder permissions, windows search engine permissions, default permissions.</h2>
                    <p>Something around one year ago the permissions on my pc were changed by something and I have encountered many problems since.</p>
<p>Generally, the default system permissions were changed somewhere in my main partition C:\ causing problems while installing software (installers couldn't operate in %temp% folder) and search problems (no results popped up).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to have my search function working again in every folder and the easiest way to do this is to change the SYSTEM permissions in every folder that has problems.</p>
<p>My questions are: <strong>What permissions do I need to assign to my folders for the search engine to work?</strong> Are all permissions I assign to SYSTEM safe? (can malicious apps use SYSTEM permissions? should I restrain them?) Can I just assign
<em>full control</em> to SYSTEM in C:\ and everything will work? (probably not since not all subfolders seem to inherit permissions from C:\). What are default permissions to
<em>desktop </em>folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for not being concise but the permissions on Windows really puzzle me. Thank you for all the answers.</p>

 to provide the details.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to follow the methods mentioned below to fix the issue with the search index.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Check if the Windows Search service is running</span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Open the run command (Windows + R key) and type in
<strong>services.msc</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Scroll down and look for <strong>Windows Search</strong> from the list.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on Windows Search entry. In the Status column (see above picture), you will see Running if the service is running. Ensure that the Startup type is Automatic or Automatic (delayed) by checking the Startup type column.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Rebuild Search Index</span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on Start, type in <strong>Indexing Options</strong> and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Once the Indexing Options is launched, click the ‘<strong>Advanced</strong>’ button to open
<strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on <strong>Rebuild </strong>button under ‘<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>’ section.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on OK button and Windows 10 will start rebuilding the search index. It might take time to complete the process.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Restart the computer and check the status of the issue.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In regards to your query about SYSTEM permissions, it is not recommended to assign full control to SYSTEM under permissions. However, the default permissions for the Desktop folder are 'System', 'User of that particular account'
 and the 'Administrator'.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer the steps mentioned below to configure User permissions for Files and Folders.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Right click on the specific folder you wish to modify and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on <strong>Security</strong> tab to view all the names of the users or group along with their list of permissions.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on <strong>Edit</strong> button.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Choose the account for which you want to make any changes under the
<strong>Group or user names</strong> segment.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Allow and Deny are the two options available under
<strong>Permissions for Authenticated Users</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Give permissions for each operation by choosing the access or deny checkboxes.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Method 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you wish to return the system to using its default permissions, I would suggest you to create a new user account, transfer all the required data to the new account and check if it works for you. This is because creating
 the new user account will create that account with the default permissions.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Network slowness</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>Over the past week I have started noticing traffic to what appears to be a Microsoft IP address of 204.79.197.223.</span></p>
<span>Over the past week I have started noticing traffic to what appears to be a Microsoft IP address of 204.79.197.223.</span></p>
<p><span>This has taken several of the clients I serve down to where all of their network based applications are unusable. I have used Solarwinds netflow to track the ip address
 and try and look at the traffic. This is happening to more than 1 PC across many networks(Vlans) the only common Microsoft elements I see are office 2013 home and business, Microsoft net-framework 4.5.2 and Windows 7 x64 Pro. I have attached a screenshot from
 Solarwinds.</span></p>
<p><span>The event viewer system and application logs point to Office click to run and installing updates.</span></p>
<p><span>I need to identify what process is causing this behavior. I can use Microsoft network monitor but have no idea how to configure the filters on how to identify the individual
 process.</span></p>

    <title>Computer taking long time to restart following installation of update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim brig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer taking long time to restart following installation of update referenced as kb2977629</h2>
                    <p>I am currently trying to install updates received over the last couple off weeks and it takes forever for the computer to restart.</p>
<p>Specifically, I attempted to install 13 updates this morning (I download automatically and install manually due to nature of users of this computer) and after over an hour the updates were not installed...screen dept saying restarting. I ended up shutting
 down the computer and eventually going back to restore point from this morning. I am now trying to install each update individually to identify which is causing the problem. Unfortunately, the first one I tried is KB2977629 and so far it has been saying restart
 for over 40 minutes at this point.</p>
<p>Is this normal for this update (computer is running Windows 8 and was up to date on updates before 9/6).</p>
<p>Thank you for any insight into this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Update, after over 2 hours it is in the "Preparing to configure Windows Do not turn off your computer." stage. Only 12 more updates after the computer finally restarts. Is this normal?</em></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>[You will want to print these instructions (or copy/paste into Notepad) for offline reference. IMPORTANT =&gt; DON'T SKIP ANY STEP &amp; perform all Steps in
<em>reboot!</em> None of the steps can possibly harm your computer.] </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:
<p>
</p><p>2a. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar). </p>
<p>
</p><p>2b. OPTIONAL BUT VERY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED: Uninstall AVG Free &amp; reboot - then make certain that Windows Defender &amp; the Windows Firewall are enabled. [1]<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Right-click on the file you saved in #1a above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the Norton utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4a. Right-click on the following link &amp; save the download to your desktop: <a href="http://iefaq.info/attachments/133/ie8-rereg.all.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">ie8-rereg.all.zip</span></strong></a>&nbsp;[2] </p>
<p>
</p><p>4b. Right-click on the file you saved in #8a&nbsp;&amp; select EXTRACT ALL. This will create a new desktop folder also named
<strong>ie8-rereg.all</strong>. The folder will contain both of the scripts below (plus a third one that you will NOT use).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note =&gt; The scripts are good for IE9, IE10 &amp; IE11, too,</p>
<p>
</p><p>5a. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar), open the folder created in Step #4b above&nbsp;&amp; double-click on the file named
<strong>ie8-rereg.32on64.cmd</strong> to run the script.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5b. Repeat for the file named <strong>ie8-rereg.64on64.cmd</strong> <em>then reboot.

                    I am using Skype for Business on a MacBook. When I organise a meeting I am signed in as a Guest. A participant can then make me a presenter. Is there a setting that I can change to stop signing me in as a Guest to my own meetings? Thanks.

<p>Hello David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the screenshots I can see that you joined the meeting as a guest using <strong>
Skype Meeting App</strong>. From the second and third screenshot you uploaded, we can see there are 2 options. One is
<strong>Sign in if you have an Office 365 account</strong>, and another one is <strong>
Use my Skype for Business desktop app instead</strong>. Please click either of the 2 options to join the meeting as a presenter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose sign in <strong>Sign in if you have an Office 365 account</strong> in Skype Meeting App, it will let you sign in the Office 365 for Business account first and then you will be the presenter of the meeting since you organized it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose <strong>Use my Skype for Business desktop app instead</strong>, it will open a new meeting window using the Skype for Business for Mac client, instead of the Skype Meeting App. Then you will join the meeting as the presenter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please feel free to let me know if you have any other questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<h3> nowin7ultimateupgradesucks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel ICH9r reset to IDE from RAID on bios update-now windows no boot</h2>
                    So windows will not boot to my RAID 1 mirror after a bios update on a gigabyte board with ICH9r.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I had the VISTA boot partition on a ICH9r RAID 1 arrar.&nbsp; I updated the bios with the gigabyte windows utility called @bios.&nbsp; The bios update reset all the bios settings (unbeknownst to me), notably changing my SATA ports from RAID/IDE to IDE.&nbsp; When I rebooted
 windows it detected the previously RAIDed drives as new IDE drives to boot from and installed drivers for them.&nbsp; When I went into the bios and set the SATA ports to RAID windows could no longer boot from the array.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I would like to know how to fix this so that I can re-enable my RAID 1 array.&nbsp; Any help is hugely appreciated!<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
What you might have to consider doing on this problem is to delete the RAID array completely since it is already damaged, probably unsalvagable.&nbsp; Have you tried delete and recreate the RAID array?<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance,
