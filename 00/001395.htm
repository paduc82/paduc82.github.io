<h2>            App crash in insider preview build 17093</h2>
                    <p>i have sent way too many feedbacks about this and it's been going on ever since the first build right after christmas holidays break&nbsp;</p>
<p>been getting app crashes for this specific <strong>game application</strong>, the app wont even open, the crash happens right after i try and launch it
</p>
<p>and here is the data i could find in event viewer&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Faulting application name: Atlantica.exe, version: 1.1.1.3, time stamp: 0x5a7b41a6<br />

<p>
</p><p>if there is any other logs needed from other different apps (like diagnostic data viewer) please let me know and i'll provide&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i know there is a good chance this will not be solved unless a whole new build is released with the fix but im desperate and open to pretty much anything to try so please if you have a chance to solve this do not hesitate to post the method</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you in advance</p>

</p><p>i have tried all possible CMD file corruption fixes, i have done DSIM/scannow, i have tried a clean boot install with an ISO i made from the update that i did to my machine, i tried creating different users and i of course tried the troubleshooting&nbsp;compatibility
 with windows 8/7 and all of the available ones, but none of them worked</p>
<p>
</p><p>the application works flawlessly on previous builds but ever since build&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(28, 32, 34, 1)">17074 i believe it has been crashing, i sent several feedbacks about this hoping with every new build that it gets fixed but nothing
 so far </span></p>

<p>yes i know that most of them don't but not this one, this application gets updated weekly, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>and i know beta is not for everyday use that doesn't mean they shouldn't fix app crashes, they already released a build to the slow ring and it was still crashing and it's not the first time that an app keeps crashing in beta previews and and gets fixed
 few builds later even without updating the app itself which means the issue is on MS's side not the application developer</p>

<p>&nbsp;If that app is important to you why don't you do a dual boot system where you can have the current public build where that app runs, the primary reason for the Preview program is to test Windows 10 and it's apps and to report any issues using the Feedback
 Hub where you also can report issues with 3rd party software, I'm sure MS has enough problems just getting Windows 10 software to run and worry about 3rd party when it is time to release the RTM versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As for things working after a couple of newer builds&nbsp; maybe the 3rd party developers have built an update and passed it to MS, as I don't know what happens at MS when it comes to 3rd party issues, Time for me to get back to testing Windows 10 version 17093
 and see if any issues with the new things just released.&nbsp;</p>

            dual boot doesn't really seem much of a solution, it's more of avoiding the issue, i'll wait till it's either fixed or i go back to public builds, doesn't seem to be getting solved by anyone except MS i believe

<h2>            Can&#39;t open any hyperlinks in Excel 2010. &#40;This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer.&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I Can't open any hyperlinks in Excel 2010. (This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, I am wanting to create an index sheet which links to the other sheets in the workbook, but can't follow the hyperlinks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Google Chrome and IE, but use Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what the problem is, but supposedly it has to do with chrome or IE?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am not very savvy fixing this type of stuff, but would like to get this resolved, as I need that index sheet to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<p>the link I created in my index sheet looks like this and is supposed to lead to another sheet within the same workbook. It's got nothing to do with IE nor Chrome.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 deleted messages reappear immediately</h2>
                    I have tried to delete spam and the like. I delete and go to the deleted items folder and delete them again and they immediately reappear in the inbox. I have tried starting in safe mode but the same thing happens. I suspect a problem with synchronization
 or some other set up but I do not know how to cure the problem. In truth I have no idea how to set up Outlook 2010 other than start it and create accounts. I did include an archive of important emails from another machine. I would uninstall and reinstall but
 I am afraid of losing data, also the erroneous&nbsp;setting&nbsp;may be preserved and thus the problem would continue.
<div>.<br />
<div>&nbsp;I am accumulating emails that I do not want and can do nothing about it.-&nbsp;Help!</div>

            Thank you Diane. Google Mail - IMAP probably auto configured by Outlook. I now realize that part of my problem is using IMAP rather than POP3 but I had expected there to be some means to immediately delete email. Apart from not wanting loads of junk, there
 is a question of privacy when others have access to the PC - I do not necessarily want persistent email.
<div><br />
<div>I observe the following behaviors.</div>
<div>[1] move message to "bin" and the email immediately disappears from "bin" and returns to "all mail" {Thus "bin" appears to be singularly pointless}</div>
<div>[2] delete messages from "all mail" and the messages appear in both "all mail" and "deleted"</div>
<div>[3] empty or delete messages from "deleted" and they disappear from "deleted" and reappear/remain in "all mail" despite a notice saying, "... permanently delete ..?"</div>
<div>[4] messages moved to "junk email" remain in both "junk email" and "all mail" but if then deleted from "junk email" they remain in "all mail" and appear in "deleted" too.</div>
<div>[5] messages moved to "spam" remain in "spam" only; but if deleted from there they return to "all mail" and "deleted"</div>
<div>no matter how one tries to remove messages they are always to be found either in at least "all mail" or "spam"</div>

<div>I have not tried leaving messages in "deleted" or "spam" or "junk email" for a long period (I understand (please comment) that the Google server will empty one or more of these after 30 days but even if that works, it is too limited.&nbsp;Is there any means

    <title>Unable to add worksheet tabs in Microsoft Excel 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nappingtom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to add worksheet tabs in Microsoft Excel 2010</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to add a new tab to an Excel file that I have used for quite a while in 2010.&nbsp; When I try to add the worksheet (whether by right clicking an existing tab or clicking the icon) I get the following error message:&nbsp; "That command cannot be used on
 multiple selections."</p>
<p>I only have one cell in one worksheet selected, so the error message makes no sense to me.&nbsp; I have also determined that if I open a new worksheet, I can add tabs, but in more than one existing one I cannot.&nbsp; Please help.</p>

            <p>I had the same issue in Excel 2010.&nbsp; When ever I tried to open a new workbook within the excel spreadsheet I got the error "That command cannot be used on multiple selections"&nbsp; all I did to get around it was re-save the document by doing a file-save.&nbsp; Nothing
 changed, as it&nbsp;is the same location and same file name.&nbsp; Closed Excel and reopen it and then it worked perfectly. Very odd.</p>

            Hans, thanks very much for this tip.&nbsp; I was really stumped.&nbsp; I thought I had just one worksheet active but when I scrolled way to the last sheet (which was hidden by the scroll bar because I have lots of sheets in the workbook) I found a second sheet was
 white (selected).&nbsp; So both sheets 1 and 10 were selected.&nbsp; I found that if I manually clicked on another sheet tab, then the [Group] in the title bar went away, and if I control-clicked another sheet tab, then the [Group] reappeared.&nbsp; If I did a .Add when
 [Group] was there, it failed, but if I did .Add while [Group] was not there, it succeeded.<br />
<br />
I thought selecting another worksheet (say #2) and then going back to #1 (so I could insert a sheet before #1) was a bit kludgy so I looked for an "Ungroup" method (like destinationWorksheets.Ungroup or something) but couldn't find one.&nbsp; Then I tried to
<i>activate</i> sheet 1 with destinationWorksheets.Item(1).Activate but that didn't ungroup them.&nbsp; Finally I tried to
<b><i>select</i></b> <b>sheet 1</b> with <br />
<br />
<b>destinationWorksheets.Item(1).Select</b><br />
<br />
<b>and that worked!</b>&nbsp; So I do that immediately after I open the workbook and that fixed the .add problem (no need to switch to worksheet #2 and back again).&nbsp; Kind of quirky.&nbsp; I got this spreadsheet from a statistician who had made changes to how he created
 it and he must have somehow saved it with two worksheets selected (grouped), and that was what caused this problem.&nbsp; He must not have done that before and I didn't notice because the second selected worksheet was hidden by the scrollbars.<br />
<br />
I hope this can help someone else.<br />

Thanks Don. For everyone else, when you click on the Protect Workbook button, a dialog will pop up, with two check boxes. One of them labeled "Structure" is selected, implying if you hit OK the workbook structure would be protected from further changes. If
 you are unable to insert a new worksheet, please click on the Protect Workbook button, and deselect the "Structure" checkbox, and then hit OK. You should be able to insert a new worksheet after that.</p>

            <p>Sorry but... that's not easy. The links Gina posted will hopefully help you transfer the&nbsp;<em>data</em> in the tables; but Foxpro and Access have utterly different and incompatible user interface programming. The screens and code in your Foxpro data can,
 at best, serve as visible design targets for building Access Forms and Reports from scratch. This will almost surely include some (perhaps substantial) restructuring of your tables; Foxpro is (in my experience) somewhat less "relational" than Access, and Foxpro
 tables often are somewhat denormalized and often include calculations. All these can be done in Access, but they're done
<em>differently</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck, and lay in a good stock of coffee or your preferred legal mental stimulant.</p>

            <p>Hi sorby393,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a few questions about your issue with the phone being stuck on the connect to PC screen that should help narrow the issue down a little.</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens if your connect your HD7 to your PC for a while? </li><li>Does the connect to PC screen ever go away or does it stay on the connect to PC screen?</li><li>Have you tried soft resetting the phone? This can be done by removing the battery (if possible) and will not delete anything from the phone.
</li></ul>
<p>Please let me know and I'll be happy to work with you to find out what options we have.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, </p>
<p>Nate W.H. </p>

<h2>            Adding corporate acount to Nokia Messaging Service</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using push mail using the Nokia Messaging service on the E72 device. Is is possible to add my corporate email account (say *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) mail account to the Nokia Messaging Service account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When start the new email account setup wizard, it asks for my email and password. As the its one of the non-standard accounts, I use the "Others" option. It asks me to give the email id and password. After enetring that it asks if I want to add the email
 address to Nokia Mesaging service account or I want a seperate mailbox that uses manual delivery... I use the option "Add the email address to Nokia Mesaging service".. a message on the screen then says "Defining mailbox" and then the wizard quits abruptly
 without defining the mailbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even tried adding the account using email.nokia.com, but does not work. Is it possible to do something like this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is your corporate account accessible from the Internet at all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Normally a corporate e-mail account is accessible only from the inside-network and otherwise accessible from the outside using non-standard protocols (hence the need for "Mail for Exchange", "Lotus Notes Traveller", etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless your company provides for external access and you are given instructions on how to configure said access, there is no way Nokia Messaging will be able to access your corporate e-mail!</p>

            Even if there was an "autosave" you've gone on to save other changes since any automatic save might have taken place, so any saves prior to the last one would be irrelevant. The only option to recover deleted content is

Word, like many other programs, does have an <span style="font-style: italic">AutoRecover</span> feature but that does no good in a situation like this. It's designed to help protect the user from data loss caused by

            Hi Phillip:
<div><br />
<div>I never recommend turning AutoRecover OFF (the name of the control is AutoRecover, which makes clear that it is not an auto-save).</div>
<div><br />
<div>AutoRecover will protect you if a) You have saved the document&nbsp;previously, b) Word crashes, &nbsp;and c) it knows it has crashed (i.e. if there is a power failure, or an error in Word's program code). &nbsp;As Bob notes, it does no good at all if Word exits normally,
 or if the user makes a mistake.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There's a long list of circumstances under which it won't help. &nbsp;However, I don't recommend turning it off, because on very rare occasions, it might help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I DO, however, recommend turning ON "Always create backup". &nbsp;That saves a copy of the file every time you save, in the same folder as the document, labelled "Backup of ...".</div>
<div><br />
<div>If anything bad happens to the original, open Backup of and continue on your way. &nbsp;You will keep everything up to the most recent save.</div>

<div>Hope this helps</div>

    <title>OneNote Class Notebook will not sync with Onenote Desktop 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sheila pace  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Class Notebook will not sync with Onenote Desktop 2016</h2>
                    <p>My school is using Class Notebooks. My users can access their teacher's notebooks online. The notebooks do open in the desktop app. Yet, every time some of my users open the desktop version, it prompts them for a user name and password. Using the same user
 name and password that allowed them to access and edit their teachers notebooks online, it reports OneNote needs a password to sync this notebook. Then it continues asking the same question in a never ending loop, never logging them in or syncing their teacher's
 newest notes.</p>
<p>This is happening to 5-10% of approximately 180 students. Their computers were all set up with the same Win 10 image. Their 365 accounts were created using one single csv upload. The notebooks were populated by pulling names per class from our SDS, Blackbaud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried repairing Office, deleting the 365 account and recreating it.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            &#34;Scratch off label&#34; on card with Product Key is really tape that peels the Product Key off the card so it can&#39;t be read.</h2>
                    I bought a subscription to Office 365 Home Premium at Staples. For $99 I received a small package with an orange card in it. The instructions inside the package were to "scratch off label on the card below to locate your 25-character Product Key." However,
 there was no scratch-able label, only a piece of shiny tape with black and white designs on it. I was able to peel a little of the tape back at one end after quite&nbsp;a bit of trying, as it was stuck tight. As I peeled it back I could see the first 5 characters
 of the Product Key, so this is obviously what they meant by "scratch off label." However, as I continued to peel, the paper started coming up with the tape, peeling the Product Key up&nbsp; with it so it couldn't be read. So I started from the other end so see
 if I would have better luck that way. The same thing happened. I could see the last 5 characters, and then the paper started coming up with the tape. I tried to see if I could somehow pry the tissue paper like layer of

    <title>Using a Toshiba Satellite- Reflashing older Bios&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mayank ahuja  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using a Toshiba Satellite- Reflashing older Bios&#63;</h2>
                    I am using Win Vista. I flashed a higher version of BIOS which was not supported by my laptop. Strange things started to happen on my comp like &nbsp;Windows Media player doesn't even open anymore, IE8 crashes the moment I try to open and if it opens, it doesn't
 display any website while other browsers works just fine. Above all, my DVD burner doesn't get detected. It can open files and drivers are detected and installed properly. But whenever I try to burn anything thru nero and other softwares too, it says "No burner
 detected"
<div>I believe that BIOS has corrupted my firmware and some sys files too. Can some one tell me how to re-flash the older BIOS ( no diskette, no burner working)?</div>
<div>Or if I try to restore my laptop to factory default settings,will I able to get my older BIOS back?</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            Hello Mayank Ahuja,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting.&nbsp; The only thing that will return your BIOS back to the way it was is to reflash it with the old or original BIOS version.&nbsp; This is something that is hardware related and you must either check the manufacturer's support site or contact
 them for more details.&nbsp; <br />
<br />

    <title>How do I add members to groups in Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I add members to groups in Office 365</h2>
                    My outlook account is through my job (in a public school system). I created an Office 365 group to communicate with members of a team I coach (and their parents), share files, etc. I am trying to add members (NOT guests) to the group now (some students
 didn't turn their contact info in on time for me to invite them with the original batch when I created the group). When I click on the link that says "add members" and enter emails for the people I want to add, it marks them as "guests" and says they will
 have limited access. Is this just at the beginning, and once they accept my invite and join they'll have full access, or is there something else I need to do to add members that I am not seeing? Thanks in advance for any help!

<p>Hello Lauroesch,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, if the users are not in your organization which means they don't have the same domain with you, they will be as a guest added to the group. And an guest only has the Reader permission.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I restarted it and reset manually the date and time.</p>
<p>My location is turned on.</p>
<p>I tried in the "server" to write m.hotmail.com, bay-hotmail.com and another one which i found in this site.</p>
<p>I uninstall Messenger and install it again. But is can not connect with facebook, it always says "waiting for network". And it says that the version does not support my phone. But i have enought free space. So i think the messenger does not work because
 i can log in my microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It said to me when it was written in server eas.outlook.com that i need to log off my account and log in , but i can not find from where i can log off.</p>

 until your phone vibrates and restarts. Note that you should not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a soft reset didn't work, we suggest that you perform a hard reset instead. You can reset your phone under Settings:<strong> Settings<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt;
 About &gt; Reset your phone.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Make sure to back up all of your files before performing a hard reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Go to Settings<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Backup

<h2>            Need to create a gradient background in Access 2010...</h2>
                    
<p>I am working in Access 2010 and I am trying to create a gradient (two color) background&nbsp;in my form header. I am also trying to create a bar, similar to the ones used in "Microsoft Access 2010 Templates - Forms", in which I can use for my toolbar; to host
 my command buttons.</p>
<p>I am really fascinated with the design of the templates and I have been struggle to figure out how to create similar.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Jale01,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I believe most of the templates use a background image on the form to make it look as if they are using two colors within the form header.<span>&nbsp;</span>To
 see this, you can do the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>+&gt;Open Access 2010.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>+&gt;In the Office.com Templates section, click on the Samples folder and then download the standard Northwind sample database.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>+&gt;With the Northwind database open, open up one of the forms in design view.<span>&nbsp;</span>For example, the Customer Details form.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>+&gt;Once in design view, bring up the Form Properties window.<span>&nbsp;</span>To do this, right click on the form and choose Form Properties.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>+&gt;The properties dialog should now be displayed and it should be showing the form properties.<span>&nbsp;</span>Click on the Format tab in the properties sheet.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you look at the Picture property, you will notice it is shows Image.<span>&nbsp;</span>If you delete the value for this property and then view the form, you will notice the form header really only has one background color set.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hopefully that helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Best Regards,</span></span></p>

    <title>Charting multiple start and end times day after day - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Charting multiple start and end times day after day</h2>
                    <div>
<blockquote>Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if anyone can help with this as I can't seem to manage it on my own.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.excelforum.com%2fimages%2fsmilies%2fconfused.gif" /><br />
<br />
I have to create a chart for trading data on which I can show the times that trades were booked and authorised in a day, day after day for a month.<br />
<br />
For instance, I may have 5 trades on one day which will have been booked at different times and would all have been authorised at different times and am looking to present this data over the course of a month. I've been trying to have a time scale on the verticle
 axis and dates along the horizontal axis. I'd like for the legend to show only 2 icons, one for all of the trade booked times and one for all of the trade authosised times. Essentially I'm looking for patterns and outliers.<br />
<br />
I've been trying to use a line chart for this but have not been successful so far.<br />
<br />
I'm using Excel 2010 by the way. <br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks, David. </blockquote>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>There are two options to display timeline data easily:</p>
<p>Use a calendar program - Outlook calendar can import Excel data with start / end time</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based upon the type of work you can also create Color Categories</p>
<p><br />
If you want to share the information, you can use a web based calendar as well.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Use MS Project <br />
Project can also import timeline data from Excel</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Use Visio and adda timeline type of object</p>

<h2>            Clam AV run in Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Win 7 detects many threats not detected by MSE</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I was using Windows 7 Home basic 64bit with Microsoft Security Essentials - all constantly updated and scanned.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently I installed Ubuntu 12.04 using WUBI (Windows based UBuntu Installer) and now have a dual boot of Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04.</div>
<div>I installed Clam Antivirus on Ubuntu 12.04 and run a complete scan. It detected about 50 threats. Mostly part of PDF files and a few Windows 7 gadget set up files, a C-Cleaner and Recuva setup files too.</div>
<div>I scanned those folders using MSE and also those particular files individually using MSE, but it didnt indicate it as a threat.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Are those detected by Clam AV false positives?</div>
                </div>

            <p>You are using a Linux based antivirus to scan files on a Windows based operating system.&nbsp; Can't you see what's fundamentally wrong with that idea?</p>
<p>Since both MSE and ClamAV also contain their own lists of potentially unwanted software (I believe that ClamAV calls these PUA) they are also likely to differ on these, since the criteria used to determine these types of detections differ from one protection
 application to another.</p>
<p>If you want a second opinion for your Windows operating system, you should try some of the free&nbsp;online on demand scanners that are at least&nbsp;designed to work with Windows.</p>

    <title>I cannot edit recurring event on my Microsft Office Outlook Calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> merino_1_3  say:</h3>
<h2>            I cannot edit recurring event on my Microsft Office Outlook Calendar</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue that occurs very randomly. Every so often, when I have a reoccurring event that I've created (and have included multiple people), I'm unable to "send updates" to the team. I was able to find the reason for this: if you click the "Scheduling"
 button when you're in the event, your name should be the first name listed. For whatever reason, mine is not. Does anyone know how I can fix this issue? There are reoccurring events with no end date that I need to edit, and need the updates to be reflected
 on everyone's calendars. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If additional information is needed, please let me know. I need to find a solution to this problem!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
