            Hi Fatshark2k,<br />
<br />
If you have enabled "<em>Allow users to remember multi-factor authentication on devices they trust Days before a device must re-authenticate (1-60):</em>", the best practice is we should
<strong>not </strong>delete the cookies in the browser, or we will be prompted to enter the verification code for one time.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

    <title>lost photos and text messages from phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abigailhogg  say:</h3>
<h2>            lost photos and text messages from phone</h2>
                    I connected my Nokia Lumia 800 to my computer this morning just to get it to charge and it started doing all the stuff it insists on doing through Zune.&nbsp; During the process it lost the connection then it went into restore mode and when I checked my phone
 it appears to have lost photos, videos and text messages from the beginning of June until the present.&nbsp; All the photos and videos went but I have them backed up on the computer up to June so resaved them to the phone but have still lost some and they aren't
 in the obvious places on the computer.&nbsp; The loss of text messages is a real pain as I use the phone for my business and there is no way of backing them up from the phone, which is a major drawback of this phone/software.&nbsp; Any ideas what's happened would be
 really appreciated.

            <p>Hello AbigailHogg:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you have experienced with contenting being removed from your phone.&nbsp; I can certainly understand how this would be a frustrating experience and hope that we might be able to recover at least some of the
 missing photo's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for what happened here, it sounds like your phone was restored to a previous restore point.&nbsp; If that is the case this tends to be a point that was created when the phone was last updated.&nbsp; If you did update your phone in June, around the time you noticed
 these text messages&nbsp;missing, that is most likely what happened.&nbsp; How this happened on it's own, I am really not sure.&nbsp; For more information on the restore process and what it does see this article,
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/basics/restore-a-backup-to-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/basics/restore-a-backup-to-my-phone</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In regards to the text messages, you are correct that there is no process of backing this up.&nbsp; With that said the only available option to possibly recover any missing text messages would be to contact your mobile operator to see if they have any back or
 ability to recover sent and received text messages.&nbsp; Text does require the use of a cellular data network so there may be some record on their end that could be provided to you.&nbsp; If not, I am afraid those text messages would be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to the pictures we might be able to recover these.&nbsp; When you connect a phone to a computer with the Zune software and the phone is linked with the account you are signed into, pictures should automatically sync to the PC.&nbsp; The following process
 may take some time but could result in finding the missing pictures.&nbsp; On your computer click the start button and then type *.jpg in the search box and press enter.&nbsp; This should bring up all the files associated with this extension.&nbsp; Look through the files
 and see if you can find the missing pictures.&nbsp; There is a chance that the pictures were moved or saved to a non standard folder.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing worth doing is signing into your SkyDrive account.&nbsp; Pictures can be uploaded to SkyDrive from the phone.&nbsp; Sign into
<a href="http://skydrive.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://skydrive.com</a> with the email listed on your phone as Windows Live.&nbsp; You should find a pictures section, review this.&nbsp; I would specifically look for a section titled mobile uploads.&nbsp; Since we are on this, I might suggest
 you set your phone up to automatically upload photos to SkyDrive so you will always have them backed up.&nbsp; This is done by going to settings &gt; applications &gt; camera + pictures &gt; check the automatically upload pictures to SkyDrive box.&nbsp; If you are unable to
 find the photo's in any of the above locations, I am afraid the photo's will not be able to be recovered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

<h2>            Excel trendline looks fine but the equation is completely wrong</h2>
                    <p>I used excel to fit a curve to some data points (x,y). I&nbsp;chose polymer with power of 6. The ploted trendline looks ok. However, when I tried to use the original x data to calculate y using the trendline equation, it doesn't appear right.</p>

            <p>You are missing important decimals - about 9 of them - for each number. </p>
<p>-4E-6 might be anywhere in the range of</p>
<p>-.0000035</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>-.0000045</p>
<p>Try changing your equation to include a cell reference, say $E$1&nbsp;- and vary&nbsp;the -.000004 in that cell reference to see the sensitivity of your fit&nbsp;to small changes in that number.</p>
<p>Anyway, select the trendline formula, then use Format / Selected data labels and change the format to show many more decimals. Your fit equation is actually</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>y = -0.00000426304965744917x6 - 0.000404395186132845x5 - 0.0156586854722786x4 - 0.315255948282067x3 - 3.47696520520208x2 - 19.2249265710339x - 30.1506382306834</p>

<br />
See my explanation dated 7 Dec 2011 to a similar question in another discussion (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-excel/exel-2007-displays-inacurate-trendline-for-high/1300c027-4470-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5">click
 here</a>).<br />
<br />
Instead of copying the coefficients from the display of the trendline, try the following.&nbsp;
array formula</span> (press ctrl+shift+Enter) [*]:<br />
<br />
=LINEST(B3:B552,A3:A552^{1,2,3,4,5,6})<br />
<br />
Then put the following formula into C3 and copy down:<br />
<br />
=SUMPRODUCT($fG$2:$M$2,A3^{6,5,4,3,2,1,0}).<br />
<br />
Then the max absolute error in D3 is about 0.17, compared to about 11.88 when you used the rounded coeffecients copied from the display of the trendline formula.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
[*] [EDIT] Enter an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">array formula</span> by pressing ctrl+shift+Enter instead of Enter.&nbsp; Excel will display an array formula surrounded by curly braces in the Formula Bar, i.e. {=formula}.&nbsp; You cannot type the curly braces
 yourself.&nbsp; If you make a mistake, select the range, press F2 and edit, then press ctrl+shift+Enter.<br />

            You will indeed need an Exchange server email account to activate this feature. On the other hand, Hotmail supports Direct Push through Windows Live which should be loaded on your device and needs to be configured.

            Open Windows Live in Start - Programs and click Menu - Options. Select Sync schedule and set it to As items arrive. From now on, emails will be pushed to your device once they reach your msn inbox.

            Sorry, I no longer have a belle device... Symtorrent hasn't been updated in a while although the creator does say that the self signed version should work on newer devices such as anna &amp; belle.<br />
<br />
Seems developers are slowing down creating apps for (ex Symbian) devices as it doe seem to be an OS which is slowly getting phased out... Looks like Nokia maybe moving more to Windows Phone.

<h2>            Word document missing pages at end after windows upgrade</h2>
                    <p>When I upgraded my Windows from 8 to 10 I went to the end of my word document and saw that the last 30 pages have disappeared (the&nbsp;document is now approx. 300 pages). When I try search for something on those pages, Word can't find them. I also can't add
 any more pages to the document or move text onto the next page - it all just disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Any help would be great as you can imagine it is not easy to just copy and paste 300 odd pages of document without getting major issues elsewhere.</p>

<h2>            Using Office 365 Product Key with a different Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I have a problem with my Office 365 account in my laptop. My laptop is Dell Inspiron 15 and it was purchase on November 2017. It was purchased together with a Microsoft Office 365 with a Product Key (so it's not a subscription online), the laptop
 and office 365 was purchase by my partner. So when he bought the laptop, he installed the Office 365 on the laptop using his Microsoft account. Now, I switched account to the Office 365 using MY Microsoft account. But it said: "You've signed in with an account
 that isn't associated with any Office products" So I tried entering the product key, but it said that I already installed the product. How will I use the product Office 365 using my Microsoft Account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping for a positive response on this.</p>

            Hi Jessa,
<br />
<br />Just to clarify, as long as it is Office 365, it is a subscription. What you should try to do before that other account can sign in to Office 365 applications is to share the subscription with the account.
<br />
<br />You can share your subscription with up to 5 family member. Here are the steps:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-your-office-365-home-subscription-with-up-to-four-people-b389b9ce-3ae3-4a82-9017-39d79972fcba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-...</a>
<br />
<br />After doing that, your partner should be able to sign in.

<h2>            Office 2010 after upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10 my Office 2010 (Home and Student edition, 3 user license) refuses to work and all my documents are "locked"&nbsp; The system tells me that my product key is not valid.
</p>
<p>I have tried to remove and reinstall on my laptop. Again I get product key not&nbsp; valid.</p>
<p>I had no problem under Windows 7 (desktop) or Windows 8.1 (laptop)</p>
<p>I am bereft that I cannot get my work done for my next presentation. It is now Tuesday &amp; the upgrades happened on Saturday - unbidden and automatically on bot desktop and laptop.</p>
<p>The "information" button on the error notification tells me I have to buy a new version of Office.</p>
<p>But I already have one - and the original CD-- legitimately bought 3 or 4 years ago from a local dealer.</p>

            <p>Since you are getting the "invalid key" message you will have to contact the help desk at the "activation" center.&nbsp; Normal MS Support cannot help with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start the activation process again, but this time select "Phone Activation".&nbsp; When you phone in, don't reply to the initial prompt. Wait (a long time) until you are given the option of talking to a live "service" rep.&nbsp; Explain the problem, that you are re-installing
 on the same computer after a Win 10 "upgrade". They should enable the activation to complete.&nbsp; A few people have said they were told that they had "activated too many times".&nbsp; That is nonsense, in the license terms, there is no limit to the number of times
 you can activate an Office license.&nbsp; You are still within the 3 computer limit, which is the only one that counts.

    <title>BlackBerry Connect and Nokia E70 Firmware v3 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            BlackBerry Connect and Nokia E70 Firmware v3</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a Nokia E70 running now firmware v3 who solves many problems and the phone is really faster.<br />
But i cannot use anymore the BlackBerry Connect who is not available for v3 firmware.<br />
Where is the update for v3 firmware ?<br />
Where is the BlackBerry Connect 4 for firmware v3 ?<br />
<br />
I cannot beleive that a company like Nokia is not able to provide on time hardware and updated software!<br />
<br />
I will stop to promote Nokia mobiles for business use because they don't care at all for their existing customers...<br />

            As I know, firmware v3 for E70 was released only for a single product variant (Finland). So you can hope it is delayed until the Blackberry software will be really ready for it.

    <title>How do i put display names to my formula choices in drop down - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do i put display names to my formula choices in drop down</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am struggling to understand how to use "Display names" in my drop downs that link to different formulas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I am creating a drop down to give total results on a costings sheet for my business.&nbsp; I need to add a drop down option to show the difference in end totals by selecting a different level of percentage accounted for an item.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a drop down using each calculation formula, however when i actually use the drop down it just gives the results of the formula as options to choose within the drop down.&nbsp; Not the name of each formula?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i.e&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Display name</p>
<p>
</p><p>"15% Affordable" -&nbsp;=SUM(C27*15%)</p>
<p>"20% Affordable" -&nbsp;=SUM(C27*20%)</p>
<p>"25% Affordable" -&nbsp;=SUM(C27*25%)</p>
<p>"30% Affordable" -&nbsp;=SUM(C27*30%)</p>
<p>"35% Affordable" -&nbsp;=SUM(C27*35%)</p>
<p>"40% Affordable" -&nbsp;=SUM(C27*40%)</p>
<p>"45% Affordable: -&nbsp;=SUM(C27*45%)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do i get the drop down to show the display name only, yet when selected the input into that cell will be the result of the formula used in that display name?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Drop downs only have 1 value. But you can use that value in a lookup, like VLookUp or Index(Match()) to retrieve an associated value to be used in calculations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I created a table for the lookup text and their associated number values.</p>
<p>Then I created the drop down list to pick the text</p>
<p>Then I created a VLookup to translate the lookup text to number used in the calculation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I prefer to use the table feature since it makes formulas more easy to understand, assuming you use descriptive names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lookup table name is "Rate_Drop_Down"</p>

    <title>How to import UTF-8 contacts into Outlook&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ondrej simecek  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to import UTF-8 contacts into Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I need to import contacts with non-English characters into Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, Outlook 2016 STILL only supports CSV files with ANSI encoding even today, which is a complete disgrace. Despite Excel 2016 handily saving into UTF-8 with many options, the same functionality absolutely needs to be added into Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All contacts with non-ansi characters come out garbled after import. Is there any solution to this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a communication app, the Outlook suite is crippled for anyone in non-English speaking world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How has no one in the development team still not noticed this?</p>

<p>This is only a cumbersome workaround, applicable when you connect Outlook to Exchange server. (not my case)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your assistance, and I know that "some" manner of import can be done using Outlook.com via Gmail import, but that doesn't offer field mapping and tools which are available in Outlook import.</p>
<p>

<p>I am also upset just like Ondrej - and I do not have Exchange - just office 365.</p>
<p>

<p>nope, that's my problem as well, and I consider it a critical omission.</p>

            I completely agree with Ondrej, the omission of this functionality is unacceptable. I just spent 3h 15min on a remote desktop assistance session trying to use the outlook.live.com/people/ workaround with UTF-8 encoding, and still no success. The time spent
 on this remote desktop session is only a fraction of the total time that I have waisted on the issue so far - an issue which would have been prevented&nbsp;if this basic functionality of importing CSV files containing foreign language data was included in your
 service offering.

            Outlook 2016 and outlook.com - two products from the same company and cannot import/export non-English&nbsp;characters between each other - Shame! So many people are using programs in their native languages and cannot sync.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Issue resolved. Don't rely on Microsoft to provide you with a solution, use the SyncGene 3rd party service. After literally dozens of ineffective instructions from the Microsoft Support Team and a remote desktop access session of more than 3 hours, I lost
 my patience and opted to figure this issue out myself. Microsoft was simply wasting too much of my time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SyncGene service does however require you to activate two-step verification and add an app password on your Microsoft Live or Office 365 account (which won't take more than 10 mins), but this company has provided a solution to what Microsoft was unable
 to solve in several attempts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already gave Microsoft a 1-star service rating and will be following through now to inform SyncGene of their superior capabilities and excellent free service.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. Can log in the email account under account aliases, but cannot send or receive any email from primary email address *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Have created alias in office 365 to replace *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>New email alias: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Please help to recover our primary email address *** Email address is removed for privacy *** due to all of our clients are using this email to contact with us.</p>
<p>

<p>Acelyn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your advice is rather unconventional.</p>
<p>After removing an alias, it will not receive or be able to send emails.</p>
<p>The removed alias address will be unavailable to add back for 30 days.</p>
<p>Ten aliases can be added yearly to an account.&nbsp; You did not ask how many aliases would need to be removed or how many aliases where created this year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot see the addresses that were posted.</p>
<p>Is the address an @hotmail.com or @outlook.com address?</p>

</p><p>Thanks for your kindly reply. We have created alias, and can send and receive emails but since the alias is another email address, most our clients still sent to our original email address and have been rejected. Clients sent to our original email, we cannot
 receive in our alias email address. </p>

<h3> bovrilman  say:</h3>
<h2>            X-envelope-to in email header</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
<p>I receive emails from a particular sender and it comes blind copied; the way the email is worded it suggests that it has been sent to a number of other recipients.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My question is: at the&nbsp;internet header <strong>x-envelope-to</strong> in some of&nbsp;these emails, my email address is&nbsp;listed as the only address; sometimes there is also one other email address for someone else.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am correct in thinking that all the email addresses of all the recipients are supposed to be listed in this internet header line?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or could the email have been sent to a lot of others and their email addresses would not necessarily show up in this internet header?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can anyone shed any light on this?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Visio 2013 internal error&#58; &#35;3400 action 2011&#58; link data to shapes, cannot connect to data source</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 64 bit, Office 365 Pro Plus and Visio Professional 2013 32 bit.</p>
<p>In Visio - Link Data to Shapes - Microsoft SharePoint Foundation List&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; the connection fails when I click finish,&nbsp; to link to a SharePoint Online&nbsp;list.</p>
<p>The errors shown are &nbsp;</p>
<p>"Microsoft Vision is unable to connect to this data source" and then &nbsp;"Visio internal error: #3400 Action 2011: link data to shapes"</p>
<p>I have tried a few sites with very simple lists "title only".</p>
<p>Repairing Visio has not cured this, as I&nbsp;read it has for other people.</p>
<p>I can upload Visio files to the site and open in Visio services, enterprise features are enabled on the site(s) and I am a global admin.</p>
<p>Is there something I am missing?</p>
<p>All help greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Laura</p>

<p>hi laura,</p>
<p>please try the options below to check the outcome:<br />
<strong>option 1</strong>. close and reopen the visio file. close and restart visio.<br />
<strong>option 2</strong>. restart your computer and then restart visio.<br />
<strong>note</strong>: before you link to a sharepoint list, please make sure you're not sign into office portal with your work/school account in browser.</p>
<p>if the issue persists, i'd like to confirm the following things:<br />
1.the screenshot of the error message "microsoft vision is unable to connect to this data source" and then "visio internal error: #3400 action 2011: link data to shapes".<br />
2.for "i have tried a few sites with very simple lists title only.", do you mean can't all the lists be linked or you can link a list but it only display title?<br />
3.do you choose <strong>link to a view of list</strong> or <strong>link to a list</strong>? does the issue occur with both these two operations?<br />
4.navigate to the site, click the setting gear&gt;<strong>site settings&gt;site permissions&gt;check permissions&gt;</strong>enter your work/school account&gt;<strong>check now</strong>. capture a screenshot for your permissions in this site.</p>

<p>hello tim,</p>
<p>thank you for coming back to me. i tried all the instructions&nbsp;below before&nbsp;i then tried a repair of visio. but have done so again today just in case&nbsp;with the same results.&nbsp;i have restarted both visio and my machine&nbsp;a number of times now without seeing a
 change.</p>
<p><strong>please try the options below to check the outcome:</strong></p>
<p><strong>option 1. close and reopen the visio file. close and restart visio.</strong></p>
<p><strong>option 2. restart your computer and then restart visio.</strong></p>
<p><strong>note: before you link to a sharepoint list, please make sure you're not sign into office portal with your work/school account in browser.</strong></p>
<p>1. the errors i see are <a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ac1da789-6099-47c7-8eba-934b82618f9d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>2. i can't link any lists. i made a brand new list custom list with the default columns and that also did not work. i have tried a few site collections on my tenancy and all are the same.</p>
<p>3. i have tested both link to a view and link to a list, both show the same errors</p>
<p>4. i have checked that i am a site collection admin on the site and in the owners group, these are the check permission results

<p>what is the best way to diagnose this further the event logs do not show anything other than the error messages.</p>

<p>Hi Laura,</p>
<p>When you open <strong>Control Panel</strong> and search for <strong>Windows Update</strong>, can you update the system? If yes, please try updating the system.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, do other admins encounter the same issue? Could you let them try the same operations on their computer?</p>
<p>If it's convenient, can you change to another computer and sign into Visio with your work/school account to check the outcome.</p>
<p>Let us know the results when you have time. They can help us know if the issue is related to SharePoint (if other admins encounter the same issue) or your computer (if you only encounter this issue with your personal computer).</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<div>Hi RHR2,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since you mentioned that you have already checked missing emails from other folders in your account, there's a possibility that Deleted Items folder has been set up emptying each time you sign out. That can be one of the reasons why you can no longer check
 missing emails from the Deleted folder.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>For this, we suggest checking if you can still recover email that's been removed from your Deleted Items folder by following these steps:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. In the left pane, select the Deleted Items folder.</div>
<div>
<p>2. At the top of the message list, select Recover items deleted from this folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7bacf3a7-f5fe-496e-95c1-7fa254d4e6ef?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7bacf3a7-f5fe-496e-95c1-7fa254d4e6ef?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>3. Select the items you want to recover and select Restore.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Notes: You can only select all if all messages are visible. This is to prevent accidental actions on messages you cannot see.</div>
<div><br />
<div>CTRL+CLICK selects individual messages, SHIFT+CLICK selects everything between two clicks.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Recover items will be restored on their original folders when possible. If the original folder no longer exists, the message will just go to your inbox directly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you continue to have this issue even after performing the above steps, please reply to this thread. The system will notify me so I can get back to you and provide you more answers.</div>
        </p>

            Thank you for the suggestion but it does not solve my problem.&nbsp; There are recoverable emails in my delete folder but they only go back apx. 3 months.&nbsp; I am missing emails that are older; i.e. six months ago (and longer ago).

<h2>            Importing text file into excel 365 - windows 10</h2>
                    Up until today I never have had a problem but now every time I try to import data from a .txt file it is imported as a Table and the lines are truncated. &nbsp;Any suggestions?&nbsp;

<p>a work around is to open the file from excel (so your 1st thing todo is starting excel). then, by opening the text file, you endup in the text import wizard - as before..</p>
