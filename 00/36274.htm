<h2>            Mouse Cursor Dissappears using Some USB Docking Stations</h2>
                    <p>I'd like to add to this thread.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new Surface Pro 3 that I've been using for a couple weeks now along with a USB Plugabble device and up to today, it's ran beautifully.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just ran an update on the Surface, rebooted and not only am I experiencing the same disappearing mouse pointer scenario when plugged in to the USB docking station, I no longer have mouse functionality on my attached keyboard device; the integrated pointing
 device is no longer working.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope you guys get this figured out soon.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Not super-encouraging to hear this is still happening on the brand new Surface Pro 3s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new dock for that model is supposed to be available soon as well, so I'll be curious to see if the problem remains with that device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately it doesn't seem like this issue was ever escalated to any engineers on the Surface team, or they can't recreate it, or they don't know how to fix it.</p>

            Pretty sure it's associated with the off brand wireless card they keep putting in it. It would seem like a driver update would be able to fix it, but they don't seem inclined to address it. The wireless card also has issues on corporate wireless networks. Card also does Bluetooth. It's a shame, because this is the big issue keeping us from standardizing on the surface in our firm. Not happy with the venue from Dell, but can't deal with a wireless device with a **** wireless card.

            <p>I have a Surface Pro 2 - running Windows 8.1 - I also use a Surface Pro Docking station with external Screen and wired mouse. &nbsp;My Surface Pro has the Microsoft Surface Power Cover, but since I am using the docking station and external keyboard, I am not
 using that keyboard when the surface is in the docking station. &nbsp;But some days, by mouse pointer just disappears. &nbsp;the mouse still works and I can open up Personalization screen and then Mouse Pointers and get the Mouse pointer back, but how annoying. &nbsp;I am
 telling my co-workers that my preference is NOT to go with a Surface Pro - as this is so Annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read other threads, but I haven't seem to find any answer to my problem - other than rebooting or doing what I say above. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a SP3. </p>
<p>cursor disappearing scenario as above.</p>
<p>Seems to be mainly be when type cover not attached when docked (but can occur when attached too).</p>

<h2>            signing into Skype</h2>
                    Skype shows 2 ID's for my account and when I tried to sign in it would not accept my password.&nbsp; I changed password and still can not get in.&nbsp; Why is Skype part of my email account because changing the password also changes my email account password?

            Microsoft merged all their service logins to be able to log into any Microsoft Service. Xbox, SKype, Hotmail, Outlook, and probably 5 others I forget. I know that doesn't answer all of your question. Maybe you have an old Skype username you can use for
 SKype? You probably made a new Microsoft Account when you made your first sign in for Windows 10. I see that a lot.

<p><span>Hi Delon,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A peripheral like a printer requires manual driver installation before it can be recognized by the computer completely. This is required since each printer has its own features based on their manufacturers.
</span><span>To make sure that we can provide the appropriate resolution to your concern with your printer, we'd like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Which version or build of Windows device are you using? To know, press <strong>
Windows + R</strong> to open the <strong>Run</strong> window. Type <em>winver </em>
and press <strong>Enter</strong>. A new window will open showing the version and build number of your Windows device.</span></li><li><span>What is the exact make and model of your printer?</span></li><li><span>Did you recently upgrade to Windows 10?</span></li><li><span>Do you have a CD driver installer for the printer?</span></li><li><span>Can you check the manufacturer's website for updates for the printer?</span></li><li><span>Are you using a desktop computer or laptop?</span></li><li><span>Can you check if the colored cartridge was inserted properly into the printer?</span></li></ul>
<p>

<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.

<br />i am sorry to say that Skype does not support "inbound porting," so in other words you can not bring you own numbers into Skype.

            I have no idea why you sent me info on using my Command Prompt window. But I did what you recommended and let it scan my system. No problems.&nbsp; Now how about answering my original question please ? HOW DO I MAKE THE TASKBAR CLOCK LARGER ? I am not talking
 about grabbing the taskbar and pulling it up to make it thicker either. I need to make the fonts in the Taskbar Clock LARGER. I used to use Tclock and could change the font sizes, plus a lot of other cool things. But Win10 does not support Tclock, and the
 tiny fonts in the clock are just too small for me to see unless I get close to the monitor. Can someone please tell me how to make the taskbar fonts larger ?<br />

<p>I just received an email follow up from Microsoft asking if I was satisfied with the help I received ,about enlarging my task bar clock. Well you asked for it. After I posted my question, I received one (1) answer (lol) from
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/92614ceb-f8e1-4571-b70c-b172cd1c260d" title="Annu Singh">
</a><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/92614ceb-f8e1-4571-b70c-b172cd1c260d" title="Annu Singh">Annu Singh</a><span>Microsoft&nbsp;</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/lang/page/faq#faqWhosWho2" title="Support Engineer">Support
 Engineer</a><span> </span>.&nbsp; If you read her reply on how to enlarge my task bar clock. Then you will see why I am laughing. Her reply was a jumbled mix of several different ideas. And none of which had anything
 to do with my problem ! After realizing that she had no idea how to help fix my problem. I went to the internet and found a wonderful free program ! It is called Tclock, by Stoic Joker. If you want a truly user friendly program, that will not only allow you
 to adjust the size of your task bar clock. But also do dozens of other handy things, then do a search for the program and check it out for yourself. I will not post a link, because I know they will delete my whole post if I do. But it is easy to find, and
 you will be very pleased with the results. Good luck to all !</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. And to Annu Singh, I suggest you learn to answer peoples questions rather than trying to confuse them with your supposed microsoft knowledge. I think the term "Educated Idiot" would apply here.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem with font-size in the taskbar-clock display, and I'm still using Windows 8.1 (I'm not going to move to Windows 10 until there's no other choice!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The text displayed when hovering over the clock used to be a fairly readable 9pt or so font, until yesterday.&nbsp; Then Windows Update grabbed a whole bunch of "Optional Updates".&nbsp; After these updates were installed, the font size is barely readable, somewhere
 around 5pt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And before anyone asks, yes I did check the "More Information" KB articles about each of the updates before installing them.&nbsp; None of them gave any hint of messing around with font size for the taskbar clock...</p>

<p>I use DS Clock (<strong>http://www.dualitysoft.com/dsclock/index.html</strong>) for many years (since Wiondows 7) and turn off the taskbar clock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DS Clock is free and support 64-bit Windows 10. You can select your own font type, size, color and you can customize it. Very easy to use.</p>

<p>I refuse to risk getting that sticky soda all over my controller/steering wheel. Also water is healthier and if you spill it, well, it's just water, no worries, but with soda it make stuff all sticky and attract ants.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
StartUp Repair often works from a Windows 7 Installation Disk or Windows 7 Repair Disk
<br />
when it&nbsp;does not from Recovery or a Recovery Disk. If needed how to make a Windows 7<br />
Repair Disk is below. A Repair Disk can be made on any computer with a CD burner running
<br />
XP, Vista, or Window 7 as it uses no files from the Host computer.<br />
<br />
<p>You can try some of these in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.</p>
<p>Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>

<h2>            Issues with System Startup - StartupRepairOffline</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Upon starting my computer, normal start does not work. Startup Repair completes with the following error details:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Problem Event Name: StartupRepairOffline</p>
<p>Problem Signature 01: 6.1.7600.16385</p>
<p>Problem Signature 02: 6.1.7600.16385</p>
<p>Problem Signature 03: Unknown</p>
<p>Problem Signature 04: 21201068</p>
<p>Problem Signature 05: AutoFailover</p>
<p>Problem Signature 06: 11</p>
<p>Problem Signature 07: NoRootCause</p>
<p>OS Version: 6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.1</p>
<p>Locale ID: 1033</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I run windows 7 on Dell Inspiron 1440 and never had this issue before. I have tried the advanced options given after the diagnostics check finishes but no luck there too. I do not have a restore point, and the Memory Diagnostics came out without any errors.
 I have not made any recent major changes to the computer, and it showed no signs beforehand that there was any issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Fn+F2 and Fn+F12 also does not take me to the intended page. I checked the CDs provided by the manufacturer and do not find the relevant one for Windows 7 startup.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The only option I see is to restore to Factory Image at the risk of losing all my personal data.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please provide me the solution to get over this issue and be able to access my critical personal data. I am not a techie, hence layman's explanation would be highly appreciated.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Subashini</p>

<h2>            Is Windows 10 CoreSingleLanguage is the same as Windows 10 Home Single Language&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows Tablet that I force shutdown while it updating windows. After that I cannot boot windows anymore. So I download Windows 10 to flash drive for reinstall. (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO)</p>
<p>But when I check in my Microsoft Account, this device show windows edition as "Windows 10 CoreSingleLanguage".</p>
<p>So I would like to know&nbsp;Is "Windows 10 CoreSingleLanguage" is the same as "Windows 10 Home Single Language"? Because when I try to reinstall, it doesn't has "Windows 10 CoreSingleLanguage" for choose.</p>
<p>If not, where can I download "Windows 10 CoreSingleLanguage"?</p>

            Hi Nalinee, I am Dexter, an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />Could you please tell me the model of your tablet?
<br />
<br />I wonder if it's using a Windows RTM version.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />Yes, it is the same edition.

            Hi Nalinee,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Core is another name for Home so CoreSL is Home SL.
<br />
<br />See this guide for forcing Windows 10 Home/Pro media to Install Home Sl:

            Well, from my survey on lenovo.com, this laptop is using Windows 10 Home, so you should not worry about the difference between the names of CoreSingleLanguage and HomeSingleLanguage, just install the Windows Home. If you have problems with activating, try to activate it via Microsoft Chat Support.
<br />
<br />Here is a guide for you:

                    <p>Hey, so I replaced my heatsink, and now my computer is acting up. It won't show anything on the screen, the moniter won't even get any signal! It also doesn't read or write to any USB device. When I unplug anything from the computer, it turns off. It's completely
 unresponsive. Is there anything I can do?</p>

            But I can't because it doesn't read from my keyboard or mouse, and it doesn't display any graphics, even in the BIOS. The GPU isn't disconnected, because I'm using the one that's built in to the motherboard (It's custom built).

            I contacted them, and they didn't know anything. I visted two different computer repair shops, still nothing, I thought that I might of damaged the CPU, so i replaced it twice with no results.

            I can't replace this PC because it has a game I've been programming for the last year. If I replace it, I will have to redo all of the graphics, music, code and levels all over again.

<p>
</p><p>We have carefully reviewed this thread. The best thing to do for now is to check every detail of the hardware on your computer. Does your motherboard have a CMOS battery in it? Is there anything that could possibly cause a malfunction on the system itself?
 Have you tried testing your internal drive on a different PC?</p>

                    <p>Just bought an ASUS ROG GL552V for black friday.&nbsp; I plan to migrate the windows 10 install to a m.2 SSD I purchased at the same time.&nbsp; I want to ensure if something goes wrong that I can do a completely fresh install to the m.2 if necessary, but I can't

<p>
</p><p>I thought maybe I could see it in my Microsoft account since I registered during the windows install, but I don't see it there.&nbsp; Can anyone give me some directions?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Tommy,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in this Microsoft forum.</span></p>
<p><span>You wish to know how the scores in the game Solitaire can be reset. It would help if you could let us know which version of
 solitaire have you installed?</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you contact the Game developer on this issue or check the online manual of the game.</span></p>

            this is no answer because there seems to be no way to reset games. as far as a version how do you tell?

<p>How did you reset it before?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Vista / Windows 7<br />
C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft Games\Spider Solitaire<br />
To reset scores, delete SpiderSolitaireSettings.xml</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solutions for older versions may work in Windows 8</p>

            solutions for windows 8 seems not to be available. in windows 7, you just reset the game. in windows 8 give f4 for reset but that does not work either.

            The only work around that I have found is to uninstall the app and reinstall the app to reset the score in Solitaire. It is an odd way, but it worked.

<p><strong>Microsoft Solitaire Collection is a combination of card games</strong> and it does not have a Common reset option for all the games.</p>
<p>Some games have the <strong>New Deal option</strong> when you right click to start a new game.</p>
<p>However, on certain games have the option of resetting the Cumulative Scores. Follow the instructions and check if this.</p>
<p>a) Click to open the game<br />
b) Press Windows key+C<br />
c) Click Settings<br />
d) Click on Game Options<br />
e) Click on Reset Cumulative Score and this is game specific.</p>

            That only works if you have it on one computer. I have a desk top,&nbsp;a laptop, and&nbsp;my old &nbsp;laptop for my grandchildren. If I delete it on one computer it seems to go online and take the scores from the others. no matter what computer I am playing on the
 score comes up the same on all of them. &nbsp;I do not like it. I have great stats but the grandchildren doesn't. and they have rouined my score.

            Do the grandchildren have their own accounts?&nbsp; You should have separate user accounts for each individual.

<h2>            Windows 10 performance improvement</h2>
                    Finally!&nbsp; With the KB3081424 "patch", Windows 10 is beginning to perform like a&nbsp;well-sorted&nbsp;Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 desktop OS.&nbsp; Everything seems to have speeded up and so far, I haven't seen any unexpected re-starts or screen blanking.&nbsp; Boot time is
 still slow and Edge is a work in progress and is&nbsp;still&nbsp;a&nbsp; bit flaky,&nbsp; but hopefully those problems and a few others&nbsp;will be corrected with future weekly(?)&nbsp;patches.&nbsp; Looks like Windows 10 may turn out to be a winner.&nbsp; Way to go, Microsoft!

    <title>Gesture Detection for Webcam - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shri_13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gesture Detection for Webcam</h2>
                    <p>I was just thinking about <strong>controlling mouse from a distance just by gesturing our hands</strong>. Also handling presentations, media etc. at a distance will be easy.
</p>
<p>As almost every PC's comes with an integrated webcam now a days then, <strong>
can a webcam be made to detect that hand gestures (instead of special sensors)</strong> so every one can use this feature (if made available) on their current PC's (with webcam, instead of buying new one with sensors).<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Can&nbsp;this feature</strong>
 (hand gestures via webcam) <strong>be</strong> <strong>made available in the upcoming upgrade of Windows 10?</strong> It will be really helpful to know as I am already excited for Windows 10. Nevertheless Windows will always remain my favorite.</p>

    <title>When is the screen flip on the ASUS Taichi21 going to be fixed&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianbotkiller  say:</h3>
<h2>            When is the screen flip on the ASUS Taichi21 going to be fixed&#63;</h2>
                    I'm not in the mood to retype everything about this issue, especially since both sides know about it. &nbsp;The initial issue can be found in this thread:&nbsp;
<div>http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/40af92bd-ca9a-4c41-ada0-139d72c15309</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The bottom line is that the taichi21's auto flip to tablet doesn't work with windows 8.1. &nbsp;The latest video drivers for windows 8 don't work with win 8.1 at all, and this laptop is essentially useless because of this.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As ASUS's fix for this is "contact microsoft", I'm going to be a really squeaky wheel here, because I don't believe that a less than one year old laptop should not be compatible with an incremental update to a OS. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, Microsoft, are you going to do anything about this? &nbsp;</div>

            I realize that -- but what I'm saying here is that ASUS is passing the buck, saying that it's MS's fault, so the only thing I can do is get the ball rolling on both sides. So far, no one is budging.&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Well since most here are volunteers there is nothing we can directly do to help.<br />
<br />
Contact Microsoft Support as suggested above. Also remind ASUStek&nbsp;of their OEM<br />
responsibilities - ask to speak to higher management. Ask in their forums to keep the<br />
issue alive. <br />

I get that, but NO ONE is helping here. &nbsp;Not Intel, MS, or ASUS.&nbsp;

            <p>The solution I found trough copy pasting solutions I&nbsp;collected &nbsp;trough forums of dissatisfied clients (be it the 21 version or like mine the 31 version )in the couple of hours after it happened is the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>BE WARE, APPARENTLY NOT THE BEST OUT THERE, BUT IT DOES WORK 100%</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Install older driver for graphics (<a href="http://dlsvr04.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/DriversForWin8/VGA/VGA_Intel_Taichi_Win7_64_Win8_64_Z917102857.zip)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://dlsvr04.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/DriversForWin8/VGA/VGA_Intel_Taichi_Win7_64_Win8_64_Z917102857.zip)</a></p>
<p>2. Delete last update from windows (KB2919355) - how: left side screen - search - type: control panel - chose "programs" - right side screen, second option, so click on the one with updates in it - right click on mentioned update and click un-install.</p>
<p>3. Restart pc</p>
<p>4. If problem not solved use step 2, but uninstall last Intel driver</p>
<p>5. redo step 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point the 31 version is "fixed" in the sense the touchscreen works again, only negative side effect is when internet is open with multiple screens it is no longer visually shown by a ScreenCam, but just the site title (if anyone knows how to get
 the former back, I am listening with much interest by the way ....).</p>
<p>The rest is the same and works perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again ... there are probably better ways out there, so keep looking for a perfect solution, and keep me posted as well, but in the mean time, I can confirm this works and it takes max(download included -&nbsp;for Europe at least) 30 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope this can at least be of some help .... </p>
<p>
</p><p>And a good evening to you all</p>

<p>If you are referring to the Dodge Challenger SRT8 392 with the Forza Horizons livery on it. The code is only available through certain retailers when you pre-order. They are Amazon.com and Best Buy. The will only be available on Forza Motorsport 4 not Horizon.

                    <p>So, I recently did a system restore and now i can't open one of these apps: People, Calendar, Camera, Photos, Phone Companion, Xbox, and Windows Store. Before i did the system restore, I could open these apps just fine but, whenever i try to open windows
 store it opens for a blink of a second and it closes, and when i try to open any of the listed apps:</p>
<p>-People</p>
<p>-calender</p>
<p>-Camera</p>
<p>-Photos</p>
<p>-Phone</p>
<p>-Phone Companion</p>
<p>-Xbox</p>
<p>-Windows Store</p>

            <p>Same here and happened after a system restore (had to do it as computer could not boot up completely).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems it only happens with metro style apps, but not all of them, for example Feedback is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case Store, People, Mail, Calculator and Photos are not working. There are some others I can't identify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of them don't come up with "this app can't open" message when you try to open them.</p>

</p><p>-----------------------------------------Answer was given by&nbsp;<strong>Niranjan Manjhi
</strong>on the&nbsp;thread in the link above, and there are other suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>I would suggest you to clear the Store cache and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key +<strong> R </strong></p>
<p>Type <strong>wsreset.exe</strong> and press <strong>OK</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Disable the security software and check.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it works for you!</p>

<h2>            MD5sum of Windows 8.1 ISO</h2>
                    I downloaded Windows 8.1 (Single Language - English [United States] ) 64 bit via the Micrsoft media creation tool. Before burning it on to a DVD I would like to check whether MD5 Sum value of the ISO is correct, is there any way to check this?

<h2>            Password to log in to computer</h2>
                    <p>I have a MS account.&nbsp; It has a randomly generated password.</p>
<p>I used to have a different password for logging into my lap top.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to the botched rollout of the latest Win10 updates it's taken me a week to get the Version 1511 to work properly on the laptop.&nbsp; However, now I must use the MS account password to get into my laptop.&nbsp; I don't need the same level of security to get
 into my laptop as for the MS account.</p>
<p>How can I get back to having a different password for my computer than the MS account password?</p>

<p>I followed directions for Win 10 Home.&nbsp; When the process was complete the laptop shut down and restarted.&nbsp; However I could not log in; kept getting message that password was incorrect.&nbsp; Tried numerous times to no avail.&nbsp; Also tried using my MS Account password
 which did not work.&nbsp; I also noticed that the "hint" did not appear below the password box.</p>
<p>I had to do a total Reset which of course wiped out all the installed programs and data. It is to be hoped that this will work but I won't know until sometime tomorrow as it typically takes 6-8 hours for a total Reset to complete; I know because I've had
 to do it numerous times in the past week on both my laptop and my desktop as a result of the MS "updates" being pushed onto machines.</p>
<p>There is something terribly wrong with Win10 and the recent (last 2-4 weeks) "updates" that MS is forcing onto&nbsp; customers.&nbsp; MS should acknowledge that it has mad a horrible mistake and stop forcing these "updates" until it can discover all the problems,
 correct them and test them.</p>

            Integrated devices of the type found on desktop motherboards and ALL laptops rely on drivers supplied by the computer manufacturer. It is the way things are.<br />
<br />
The good thing is that desktop motherboards generally have a couple of free PCI slots, one of which can be used to install a PCI sound card. Look here for something compatible, and then head off to your preferred retailer, buy one and then install it..

<h2>            Intel HD Graphics 4600 update broken.</h2>
                    There is an issue with the latest Intel HD Graphics 4600 driver that is being pushed by Windows Update.&nbsp; Last night the drier was pushed to the computer and caused major problems.&nbsp; I have a Dell Laptop, with only one screen.&nbsp; With the latest driver update
 that Microsoft keeps pushing to the computer, even though I uninstall it, it now shows I have 7 monitors.&nbsp; If I disable or disconnect a monitor via Device Manager or the Display settings it adds another one.&nbsp; How do I prevent the update from installing because
 it is broken?&nbsp; Granted this needs to be fixed by Intel, but I want to prevent this display driver from installing.
