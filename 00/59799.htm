<h2>            Programs are TOO SMALL</h2>
                    <p>Look, I have searched this database of forums up and down, inside and out, to try and find a solution to my problem. I'm no techy, though I am constantly learning. So I purchased an Asus notebook q534 and I was excitedly downloading all of my previous programs.
 My web browsers were fine, games were fine. But when I went to open up Photoshop CS5, it was absolutely antlike in size. I went to try to fix the resolution of the screen in Display, and&nbsp;</p>

<p>SO SMALL. What is this, a software for ants? Jokes aside... Several other programs that I need for my work do this as well. I have tried everything, and I am starting to think that until Windows 10 is updated again (I have been completely updated as of 10:54
 pm 7/19/17) there might not be a light at the end&nbsp; of the tunnel. You can see by the taskbar/startbar/whatever that I am currently exhausting a lot of options as I make this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also need to note that when I went to my display settings through control panel, this is what I got.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There isn't the two-window option. "Better one, Better two". I'm not sure if this is a new thing or not. I was previously on a dinosaur Toshiba Satellite from 2009 (may it rest in peace) I just want this fixed. Any and all suggestions are gratefully accepted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is very important to have the correct resolution setting on your Windows PC as it facilitates better display of the content and clarity of the images. Higher the resolution, sharper are the images and contents on your PC. To assist you with your display
 settings concern, you may follow the steps provided below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your computer, right-click your mouse and go to <strong>Display Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Advanced Display Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click on the drop-down menu for <strong>Resolution</strong>. </li></ol>
<p><em>Take note that lower is the resolution, larger is the content displayed on your screen. From the available options in the drop-down menu, select the one you want and click</em>
<strong>Apply</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know it if answered your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind regards.</p>

            No, this has not helped. I tried this before, and tried it again at your guidance. There isn't an "advanced display settings" option, or a dropdown menu for resolution. Unless you are counting the options that were available for me to alter the WxH as
 seen in the second image of my initial post. I wonder if putting it to the resolution of an older model of screen would fix it, but it would be very blurry most of the time, or overly compact, when it came to running other programs/apps. I learned this after
 testing about ten options with the resolution.

<p>You can simply adjust the resolution of the icons displayed on your computer by clicking on the drop-down menu.</p>

    <title>Can you use Windows Virtual PC without hardware Virtualisation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hook1701  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can you use Windows Virtual PC without hardware Virtualisation Technology enabled&#63;</h2>
                    <br />
Does anyone know a way to get Window 7's Windows Virtual PC to work without Virtualisation Technology enabld in the BIOS?<br />
<br />
I have just learnt the Sony&nbsp;does not support Virtualisation Technology in their Vaio BIOS which was an annoyance using 'Virtual PC 2007' since I could not hardware enable it but it did still work.<br />
<br />
However having just upgraded to Windows 7 I have found that 'Windows Virtual PC' will not run unless Virtualisation Technology&nbsp;is enabled in the BIOS.<br />
<br />
Reading through the forums it has become clear there are still a number of OEMs that are not enabling Virtualisation Technology however losing the ability to use Virtual PCs at all in Windows 7 unless your OEM supports it is just silly.<br />

            Unfortunately a little fact a little know fact about Sony is that they only allow limited updates to the BIOS.&nbsp; VT is not one on the things that is visible, changable or otherwise able to be set.&nbsp; Therefore as much as I would like to do as Andre suggest
 it is simply not possible.&nbsp; There is a BIOS hack out there but reports are mixed on it's success and I would rather attempt a software resolution before hacking the BIOS.<br />
<br />
Sony have not committed to changing this situation either so for the near future I either find a non-BIOS dependent workaround or revert back to Vista.&nbsp; Of course Sony don't mention this in there Sales or Support literature either (until just recently in some
 geographies) so until you buy and try you have no way of knowing.<br />
<br />
I suppose the warning here is if you want XP-mode or need to use virtualisation don't buy Sony or wait for MSFT to issue a patch so that Virtual PC in Win 7 does not require VT enabled on the hardware, al la Virtual PC 2007.

<p>Thanks a lot for answer! My device &nbsp;(Samsung <span>

<p>Thanks a lot for your answer. Already tried that out, without succes. So, at the end found it necessary to make</p>
<p>a new installation of windows, with the back up dvd's. And that fixed it. But took some time, as the correct driver</p>
<p>was not included in the win 7 package,&nbsp; but in an accessory HP dvd !</p>

                    <p>Announcement has it that there were system updates released for Surface 3 and Pro 3 on 1/21/2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e8fdeb7-683d-47ec-bc2b-739da98e36db" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e8fdeb7-683d-47ec-bc2b-739da98e36db" /></a></p>
<p>
I'm excited and went to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/install-update-activate/surface-3-update-history?os=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/install-update-activate/surface-3-update-history?os=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface 3 update history page</a> only to see that "<strong>Release date for the latest available system
 update for Surface 3:</strong><strong>9/29/2015</strong>". And then I went to the download page for "<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">software, firmware, and drivers for the Surface 3</a>".
 There the current version is 11/9/2015. I checked Windows Update twice and, nothing new was found.<br />
</p><p>So, dear Microsoft Surface Team, where did you release your great works?</p>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hi all,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I was running out of space on my hard drive so I moved all my files to the company cloud, made those files I use more often "available offline", and created direct links
 to those folders on my desktop to work directly from the cloud.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The idea was to have all files available "location free", reduce the space used in my hard drive, and at the same time being able to work offline from my computer if need
 be.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The problem was that, when connected to internet, the system was constantly syncing, slowing down any action (minor changes in .csv files or renaming a file would take
 10-15 sec). I tried setting a syncing schedule but that wouldn't work. The last thing I tried was setting the folder to "work offline" from the "home" tab -&gt; "Easy access" scroll down.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It seemed to work but once I was done working, when I tried to set it back to work online (click again in "home&gt;easy access&gt;work offline") so it will sync all files, the
 options "sync" or "work offline" were not available. I've tried to sync it manually from the "sync center" but is giving me an error.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">How can I set it back to work online or sync the files again?</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for the fast response.</p>
<p>I've tried your suggestions but I do not have the "Always available offline" check box available. It's there, just not available, and it is actually unchecked.</p>
<p>I do not have available the "Sync no..." button available either. It says: 'This folder is offline because of a network disconnection or unavailable shared folder'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the error message in the Sync Center, it only says:</p>
<p>'Sync failed with Offline Files'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your help.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 factory reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lrthomas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 factory reset</h2>
                    It seems since the last time I performed a factory reset in Windows 7 Home Premium, the function has been removed and replaced with reinstalling Windows from a disc. As I got Windows with my computer, I do not have a disc. Can I access the factory reset
 through the command line? Is there another way to perform a factory reset?<br />

<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>

</p>
<p>For Fujitsu,<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>p<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>ress the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</font></span></p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have to try more than once to get any of the above to work. If after repeated attempts, you have no luck or the machine reports that there is no recovery partition, your only option is to
 contact the computer manufacturer and ask for recovery disks for the model.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the reset, you should get<span style="font-weight: bold"><font> all</font></span> updates from Windows Update EXCEPT for hardware devices. Next, you should install a good anti-virus
 solution. ONLY AFTER you have done this should you replace stuff from backups or install anything else.</p>

If you are in the habit of performing Factory Resets, why not make life easy for you in this way?
<div>
<ol>
<li>Reload Windows and all applications.</li><li>Create an image of your installation. Store it on an external hard disk.</li><li>Burn a Windows Repair CD.</li><li>When things fail again, boot the machine with this CD, then restore the image created in Step 2.</li></ol>

            To reload windows, would I require an installation disc from Microsoft? My version of Windows 7 Home Premium came with the computer I bought from the shop, so I don't have a physical disc. Using the product key with my computer, is there a way of getting
 a virtual copy of the installation disc from Microsoft?<br />

<p><span><span>Hi jarmour116,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try running the troubleshooter that automatically diagnoses and repairs problems with Aero effects
 in Windows Vista. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Troubleshoot problems with Windows Aero</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are still facing issues, then you may try a system restore to an earlier point before the updates
 were installed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state, programs and updates you
 installed are removed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To perform System restore, you may refer the following link:</span></span></p>

            <p>This doesn't fix the error as the errors are in the changed .dll files forced with the installation of the KB971029 (which is now a "high priority" update which is said to be a solution to the recent trend of virus from flashdrive uses. This update is automaticly
 installed without the user knowing about it until the good little window which ask for restarting the computer appear.)</p>
<p>But it actually gives a hint about what is really affected by the changes as 2 services seems to be malfonctioning and can't be started/restarted when using the link :</p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-problems-with-Windows-Aero" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-problems-with-Windows-Aero</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Desktop Windows Manager</p>
<p>- Theme service</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Desktop Windows Manager is disabled and CAN'T be enabled as an error in the .dll make it automaticly stop upon activation and makes it INVISIBLE to the computer. (It can't be seen in the services anymore)</p>
<p>The Theme service is unable to support the Aero/Vista theme as the Desktop Windows Manager is disabled.</p>
<p>A temporary solution to this is to do a system restore to before it got installed and stop the service "Microsoft Update" until a fix to the update is given to fix the issue.</p>
<p>So, we got the option of either doing what Microsoft doesn't suggest us to do (system restore+disable Windows Update) or we can keep that classic theme for a couple of weeks or months until we got some fixes that should have been made before making this
 patch a high priority..</p>

I'm not sure if this is against Microsoft policy but since they are not taking this seriously, I figured we can do whatever we want to fix this issue...
<div><br />
<div>Below are sites that walk you through on how to download a patched version of the three main theme dll's (the same ones affected by this stupid update).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>By replacing the .dll's that were corrupted by this update, I was able to get Aero working again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just in case anybody asks, all of the downloads are clean and were scanned with NIS 2011, MSE, and Malwarebytes...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please read the directions thoroughly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is fairly simple, but just in case, nobody but YOURSELF will be liable for any mistakes...</div>

            The current solution is a bit too complicated. I chose System restore and disabled updates.
<div>I&nbsp;copied&nbsp; the faulty Update file name, will do all others but this one.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I guess this problem is affecting only a small number and is not a priority for Microsoft, unless it's a way to get XP and Vista users to upgrade.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have 3 PC's two running Windows7,&nbsp;Vista is running on my second PC now it's waiting for the Chrome OS.</div>

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 not working at all</h2>
                    The company I work for bought a bunch of Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 as a gift for our customers. We had the mice pad printed with our company logo and website. Now that we are testing the mice we are finding that they are not working (3 of 3
 so far). The computer can find the mouse and says it is working properly but we can't get the mice to respond or do anything.

            <p>That's an interesting problem and I could not find a way to disable it like the others you have already done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you right click something and drag it Windows looks at the number of pixels the mouse has moved to decide to offer that copy/move/shortcut menu.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you ever noticed that when you are holding down Ctrl to select a bunch of files suddenly they are all copied?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened is the mouse pointer was dragged (accidentally of course) a certain number of pixels to signal windows that that copy/move menu should be used so it made copies on the next click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think you can turn that feature off but you can change it so you have to move the cursor a really long way before it pops up that menu.</p>
<p><br />
A bad side effect is that it affects all operations where you click and hold to drag something but you can see how this works and then you can undo it easily if you need to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default value on my system seemed to be 4 pixels (not much) so you can increase it to a really big number like 1000 pixels which for me means i have to drag way to the right side of my screen before I see that menu - hopefully your user won't figure
 that out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The adjustment is in the registry and since there is no quit without saving or undo options in the registry editor be sure to make a System Restore point and export the registry key before making adjustments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start orb/button and in the box enter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>regedit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then choose to run regedit.exe as Administrator:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fde9c99c-7215-4195-85e6-a18329593220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fde9c99c-7215-4195-85e6-a18329593220" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Navigate to here and make a note of the current values of DragHeight and DragWidth (mine was 4) then change to some big number like 1000:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d644b54-be93-4459-b5d9-f2f9733df1c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d644b54-be93-4459-b5d9-f2f9733df1c2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this is a per user setting a logoff/logon cycle will be required but I always like to restart the system just to be sure the changes stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me that means I have to right click (hold) and drag more than half way across the screen for that menu to pop up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adjust those values to whatever works for you.</p>

            <p>Now I've decided that I really don't like the side effects of this adjustment (like left click and dragging has changed too) since it changes the way I have to do things.</p>

</p><p>I undid the adjustment but maybe it will be okay for what you need.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Dear </p>
<p>User have rights to many locations in System. how many you protect. User have access on the source file.&nbsp;application right the data in this file in user login.
</p>
<p>problem is that this is analysis data and if user moved this data to some other location and process it with different result and submit then&nbsp;main problem came.
</p>
<p>So user should not&nbsp;be cut, copy or move the file. Rest all we achieve but only this option still open after disabling right context menu.</p>

Hi Jennifer, thanks for your answer but I'm afraid you didn't get my question. It's not an issue to import back the file that I exported previous within the machine of same verion but between 2 machines, one 1607 and the other 1709. In 1607, the export file
 is in TXT but 1709 takes only DAT!

<p>Here is my answer to your questions:</p>
<p>1. Chinese input is built-in application to Windows 10, which comes with this function "user define phrase"</p>
<p>2. No, they're different. As I said, one is version 1607 (export/import file format: TXT) and the other is 1709 (export/import file format: DAT)</p>
<p>3. screenshot... (from version 1709)</p>

            <p>Which bluetooth device are you trying to use?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To show the bluetooth device in the notification area, you may have to change a bluetooth setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer&nbsp;to this&nbsp;article provided&nbsp;by HP for more information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>hi-thanks for the link ,but afraid no joy ,the item I am trying to connect are trust 18214 Bluetooth headset,,i have a Bluetooth tablet ,this finds them but will not connect,just keeps trying to pair&nbsp; -&nbsp;,,the&nbsp; one I am trying to find answers for, is a desktop-&nbsp;has
 windows 8 pro for this I am using a Bluetooth dongle[have tried 2] it shows straight away Bluetooth in device manager[and removes if dongle removed] on clicking it says device working correctly ,and that's as far as I&nbsp; get ,i set headset for connection ,try
 installing,- nothing ,just get no device found ,and have tried installing from different areas on the pc ,all to no avail ,it does nothing,it,s just as if something is not turned on.</p>
<p>when I follow these links,i do not get on my screen what they say,i never get a screen where it says turn on Bluetooth, is it possibly anything to do with drivers that have not installed properly when I downloaded win 8 from Microsoft ,although on installation,it
 seemed to do a check on completion[I was on 7] hope this explains a little better.</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<h2>            Partial install of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 10 partially downloaded.&nbsp; My WI-FI reception just cannot handle the size of download...almost dial-up speed.</p>
<p>I need to uninstall Windows 10 (or the parts there are there) because my security updates, etc. are piling up and I need to download those.&nbsp; I've tried to click on the ones I want to download - it still starts downloading&nbsp;with Windows 10 even though it is
 not checked.&nbsp;<br />
(1) How do I remove it from waiting to download?</p>
<p>(2) How do I remove what has already been downloaded?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand the inconvenience that you are experiencing. I will definitely assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To understand the issue better, I would like to know which operating system are you using currently?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are using Windows 8.1 try the below steps to cancel the downloading file.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and click on <strong>
Control Panel</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check on <strong>Windows update</strong>, now you can cancel the downloading.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>If you want to cancel the installation and remove the prompt to Update</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You can remove the Windows 10 update by uninstalling the <strong>KB2990214
</strong>from Windows Update. Follow the steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open the start menu and search for "<strong>View installed updates</strong>".</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Search for "<strong>KB2990214</strong>" without the "". You should find an update that was installed today.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click and press "<strong>Uninstall</strong>".</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Reboot and run <strong>Windows update</strong> again.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>In future if you want to upgrade to Windows 10, I would suggest you try upgrade using Windows 10 ISO and check if it helps. Download Windows 10 ISO and create media from the below link</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you complete creating media. Insert the Windows installation DVD in the DVD ROM and restart your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Do not perform clean and custom installation. If you do so, activation issue will occur.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.</span></p>

            Hi and thanks----- I have windows 7 home and foolishly believed the 10 update ad that was popped right at me with all the " goodness" of the update choice. Midway in the download, my brother warned me of all the downsides and negative consequences. &nbsp;Ok,
 so now it is sitting in my tray waiting to be fully installed. Already, I can see the slowness etc. &nbsp;I just want to efficiently &nbsp;and correctly remove the whole thing. I tried the recovery/ restore routine only to repeatedly get the &nbsp;" unspecified error box
 (0xc0000022) &nbsp;Any tips would be greatly loved. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for coming back to us with the current status.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Letâ€™s try simple methods and check if this helps. Follow the below method.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If a computer is infected by a virus, lots of resources will be taken up to greatly slow down computer performance. I suggest you to run virus scan (<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>) and check if it helps to resolve the issue.

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persist, try the below method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to boot the system in clean boot and check if the issue still persist.
<span>Clean boot</span> process will help you determine which third party program/app that is causing this issue. It could be some other application or programs, which runs on the computer at the background, leading to this issue. Please visit the below link
 on how to perform <strong>Clean boot.</strong></span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 failed to load, now stuck on Undoing Changes screen</h2>
                    <p>I have a new HP notebook, Windows 8 preinstalled. I tried to install Windows 10, but after 8 hours I figured something isn't right. So I powered it off, thinking I can go to system restore. Now it is stuck on "We couldn't complete the updates, Undoing changes
 Don't turn off your computer" screen. Has been frozen here overnight.</p>
<p>I tried to do a hard restart and boot into safe more, but that We couldn't complete screen just comes back on.</p>
<p>There is a partition on the drive with a recovery on it, but how do I access this?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>Hello Rakesh,</p>
<p>The notebook will not boot from media device. </p>
<p>I downloaded Windows 10 as per Carlos, a wonderfully helpful Microsoft tech, and plugged it in the usb port.</p>
<p>I then unplugged my notebook and removed the battery. I then put the battery back in and plugged it in as well.</p>
<p>From there, I powered on the machine, it didn't catch the usb.</p>
<p>I then pressed esc key while powering up, this brought me to a new screen where I was able to try to boot from the usb.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I received an error message stating the file I just downloaded, was not complete and set up couldn't continue.</p>
<p>Back to square one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help is welcome,appreciated and requested.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jeff</p>

            <p>Hi Again,</p>
<p>I do appreciate your replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I called the Microsoft help line, the kind person let me know that on my HP the only way to boot into a sagfe mode is to press the esc button while loading. The F8 didn't work.</p>
<p>After getting into the recover screen, I was able to access the rescue portion on my disk and reset the notebook this way.</p>
<p>I am unsure why it hung so badly, and that no one was knew about the esc key to boot.
<br />
Now I do, and hopefully anyone who reads this thread will be helped.</p>
<p>I used the Windows media as per Carlo's instructions and was able to finally upgrade to Windows 10, significantly better for my use than Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again,</p>
<p>thank you for your assistance.</p>
<p>Warm Regards,</p>
<p>Jeff</p>

            <p>Hi Jeff</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to take my PC to an IT specialist who&nbsp;could only fix my PC by removing the hard drive.Get it to someone reputable as soon as possible.&nbsp;Luckily he could back up the data on my PC&nbsp;and he had to&nbsp;do a roll back to the Pre-installed Windows 8 SL version.
 However on startup,&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows requires the product key. Best Buy whom I bought my pre-installed Windows laptop from, did not supply a product key. Stuck again. Make sure you have your product key and you'll have no problems.</p>

            <p>Hi Shaleen, mine had a rescue / reinstall on the drive, separated by a partition wall. usually they come like that, with a partition. What I found very disappointing was no one could provide the key, even tho I registered with Microsoft. The rescue has the
 key. Same thing about booting into safe mode. I was really surprised so few knew how do do this. I talked to 9 people, from HP to Microsoft, only one person knew.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Perhaps ask your IT person to set it up, was about 4 gb, not too big. And give you instructions on how to access it.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Jeff</p>

<h2>            Why is my tower computer shutting itself off in Windows 10 Anniversary version&#63;</h2>
                    All my tower computer system settings indicate that my computer is supposed to remain on 24/7 but since the automatic update to the Windows 10 anniversary edition it shuts itself off after periods of inactivity. Which settings have been changed by this
 update that would cause this to take place?

            <p>Hello John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you run the Power Troubleshooter and check if it sees any problem on your device, here's how to run the Power Troubleshooter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows </strong>button + <strong>X</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Control </strong><strong>Panel</strong>.</li><li>In the search box, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Power</strong>, then click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you may check the built-in extensibility for power policy settings in Windows 10. The configuration of these settings is exposed to the user in the
<strong>Power </strong><strong>Options </strong>control panel as the <strong>Change
</strong><strong>plan </strong><strong>settings </strong>option. Many Windows power policy settings are also configurable through the
<strong>Change </strong><strong>advanced </strong><strong>power </strong><strong>settings
</strong>option, including WiFi power management policy and battery threshold and action policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how to get to the <strong>Power </strong><strong>Options</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows </strong>button + <strong>X</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Control </strong><strong>Panel</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Hardware </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>Sound</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Power </strong><strong>Options</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Update us on the results.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you David Haz. Regarding the six step process for using the Power Troubleshooter, on my computer the fifth step needed to be "In the search box, type Power." It's similar to your step three. After I followed steps three and four there was no "Power"
 icon to click until I typed it in the search box. That means, of course that you steps 5 and 6 will get numbered 6 and 7 once you add the fifth step I suggested in the second sentence above. Once I had entered "Power" in the search blank and clicked on it,
 it basically gave me the option of clicking on a setting that would make my machine more efficient by putting it to sleep. Unfortunately, I already know how to put my computer into the various power modes and had checked all those before posting my question.
 Which means that neither of your two suggested ways to fix the problems helped me at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's something I will pass along to you and to anyone else who may read this reply to your suggested help. My computer has not turned itself off since I posted the question. That should give someone cause to smile. Possible reasons for this humorous development
 include:</p>
<p>1. Computers really do have a mind of their own. It saw I was tired of its errant behavior and corrected itself. NOT!</p>
<p>2. I rebooted.&nbsp; Likely cure. Here's why.&nbsp; I had checked my power settings two or three times on different days and changed them to ensure the computer was not configured to shut itself off. I clicked to apply the changes when I made them but I did not reboot
 the computer. You should not need to do this so I didn't think to try it.&nbsp; Since the computer had been shutting itself off I assumed that any configuration changes would complete themselves when I restarted the machine. This was apparently not happening because
 whatever changes the Windows 10 Anniversary update had made were putting the machine into hybernation or sleep, not really a full shutdown. So I did a full shutdown, rebooted, left it running and this time it did not shut itself down.

<h2>            Error Cannot connect to Xbox. Please, try again later, wghen trying to connect to Xbox account on the Metro games of Microsoft Studios</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Cannot connect to my Xbox account on the Metro games of Microsoft Studios</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 8.1 Pro (64-bit) originally licensed on my laptop. All updates are installed, and there is no security issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point is I cannot connect to my Xbox account on the Metro application games of Microsoft Studios like Pinball FX2, Jetpack Joyride, Wordament that I've downloaded from Windows Store application of Windows. When it tries to connect to the account, an
 error message "Cannot connect to Xbox. Please, try again later" appears on the screen, and it fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can login to the website of Xbox, and it seems I don't have a problem with my account there. Also, I can successfully login to the Metro application of Windows 8/8.1 called "Games" with my Xbox account, and I see all games I own, all my achievements etc.
 faultless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you know, one's Windows Live account used to login to Windows is related to his/her Xbox account as well. A few week ago I changed the password of my Windows Live account from the computer settings of Windows. May the problem be related to this issue?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I've tried to uninstall a game, then to re-install it downloading from Windows Store again, but the same problem occurs again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the problem? How can I fix it? I would be glad if you aid me. Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>But did you really read my whole post?</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, the problem occurs on my laptop, not on an Xbox device. I have Microsoft Windows 8.1 Pro (64-bit) operating system installed on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I have no problem with my Internet connection. The problem is just that I cannot login to my Xbox account (linked to my Windows Live account) on any Metro game of Microsoft Studios.

            I read you disabled the firewall but its worth trying this anyway. Open the charm search box and find allow app through windows firewall. Then find the correct entry and make sure it is checked. After that attempt disabling your virus protection to see
 if it makes a difference. You can use windows defender which is built in real time protection. When you are inside the app causing the issue you should be able to open the charm menu and clicking settings see which account it is using.

            <p>My all Metro-style Xbox game applications are already allowed completely according to that configuration list of Windows Firewall. Disabling my anti-virus protection didn't solve anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe this issue would be solved after formatting my harddisk, then re-installing Windows. But I don't want to do it just for these games.</p>

            <p>To be able to fully support the monitor you are using, two conditions mustr be met:</p>
<p>The video card must be properly detected and identified&nbsp; and thew video monitor must be properly detected and identified. To see if that is the case on your system.&nbsp; right mouse click on the desktop or navidate to Control Panel\Display. check to see if the
 actual display adapter and monitor are anmed or if they are given as "generic" or similar discription.</p>
<p>If the description is not specific, go to the web site of the display adpter and monitor and see if they have device drivers available.</p>

            <p>What happened possibly is an error that happened somewhere between Walmart and Microsoft. Usually gift cards when they are activated at the register they activated before they can be used. I&nbsp;would recommend going into the store with a receipt&nbsp;asking for a manager or supervisor, they should be able to assist you better, if they are unable to help at store level ask who actives their cards it may be a company such as Blackhawk who is a major distributor for gift cards they may be able to help as well. If not able to get any assistance from either party you can try contacting the Microsoft Xbox Billing department, which you can do from here&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us#4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us#4</a> They should be able to help you figure it out.</p>

    <title>About the action of Win7 OS in Neighbor Cache Entry - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fengchanglv  say:</h3>
<h2>            About the action of Win7 OS in Neighbor Cache Entry</h2>
                    <p>During the assignment of IPv6 address through SLAAC, a host gets IPv6 an address from the Prefix Information Option of Router Advertise from a router. the state of the IP address is stored in host, &nbsp;the state &nbsp;changing procedure is as &nbsp;followsï¼š</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f066e58-8ede-4316-b70b-1cc97c226f3b" /></p>
<p>As display in the figure above, when the state of an IP enters <strong>Stale</strong>, the host will send a Unicast Neighbor Solicitation to detect whether the target host is still reachable or not. But in our test environment, &nbsp;when the state of an IP enters<strong>
 Stale</strong>, Windows 7 system never sends a<strong> Unicast Neighbor Solicitation</strong>. I wonder if the state from<strong> Stale</strong> to
<strong>Reachable</strong> can only be triggered by &nbsp;a host sending data packets ?? If no data packets are delivered between the router and host all the time, &nbsp;does the state of an IP stay in<strong> Stale</strong> if reachable time expires??</p>
