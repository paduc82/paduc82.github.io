<h2>            Conditional formatting not picking up e-mails &#39;where I am the only person on the TO line&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Using VIEW SETTINGS &gt; CONDITIONAL FORMATTING for my inbox, when I check the box "where I am the only person on the TO line" it only applies the conditonal formatting if the name says EXACTLY "Jay Garland". If they use my e-mail address and the TO line says
 &lt;myemail address&gt;&nbsp;or my name enclosed in quotes or some other variation, it won't apply the formatting. Is there some way to get the CONDITIONAL FORMATTING to check on the e-mail address being used rather than what appears in the TO line?</p>
<p>I have found a work-around, and that is the SENT TO line type in every variaton of what is sent to me: ie my name, my name in quotes, my e-mail address, etc. While it works, it is rather clunky. Is there a neater solution here?</p>
<p>By the way, I used Outlook 2010 with Business Contact&nbsp;Manager and all my contacts are stored in Business Contact Manager and my CONTACTS folder is empty.</p>

            <p>Oh... it's that line. The checkbox only uses the display name. The field above it should use the address (the From field there looks at the address), but it apparently also uses the display name field. (I recall discussing this with someone at MS a long
 time ago, but rarely get questions about it and have forgotten the specifics of why outlook doesn't look at the underlying To address in a mailbox.)
</p>
<p>Try this: on the advanced tab, create a rule To (exactly) alias@domain then create a second rule for (exactly) your display name. That is working here - that field definitely only checks the display name - but if you add multiple lines for the same field,
 they are OR'd together. </p>
<p>As for outlook picking up data from contacts... It's not that smart. &lt;g&gt; If it were, we could do a lot of cool things.</p>

    <title>Copy primary and related table records in one command button. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garygoodson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy primary and related table records in one command button.</h2>
                    <p>I am setting up a recipe database which also sets Point of Sale cash register system parameters. &nbsp;This is done with a Primary table; tblRecipes using RecipeNum as Primary key and Secondary Tables containing register parameters; they are tblMicrosGeneralInfo;
 tblMicrosConddef; tblMicrosPrintdef (and some others)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The secondary tables uses a One to One relationship with the primary table with [Recipe#] as Primary Key (related key) in the secondary tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All relationships are working.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using my current database (Q&amp;A), when I want to add a new recipe record, it is common to copy an existing record and modify it through editing, &nbsp;I also copy the Point of Sale information database record. &nbsp;I am changing to access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current goal is to provide programming in access 2013 to select a recipe record in my table Recipes, which is very similar to the new record needed, then copy it and get the secondary table records copied at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a command Button on<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> frmRecipes</span> labeled COPY which copies and appends the selected record to the same tblRecipes and displays the new record on the form.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have an event programmed on the frmRecipes, [RecipeNum] field, to openform
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">frmRecipeDetail.</span>&nbsp; In the form, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
frmRecipeDetail, </span>&nbsp;there is a command button programmed to openform frmMicrosInformation, which contains the table information for the register parameters. &nbsp;The form f<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">rmMicrosInformation</span>&nbsp;is a form with tab
 control. &nbsp;Tabs include&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">frmMicrosGeneral; frmMicrosConddef; frmMicrosPrintde</span>f (and some others)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have copied a Recipe record, renumbered it to an unused recipe number (no duplicates are allowed), saved it then open the Micros Information Form, the tabbed forms&nbsp;frmMicrosGeneral; frmMicrosConddef; frmMicrosPrintdef all have the new Recipe# filled
 in properly but the other fields only display the programmed default value found in their respective tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps when I renumber the new record, the child tables default back to programmed values. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help me with a solution to <strong><em>copy primary and related records in one operation</em></strong>, that would be very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, Gary</p>

            <p>Tom,&nbsp; I need to take this one step at a time.&nbsp; Your comments in bold&nbsp;italic</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>run append query to copy the recipe record, </strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I created an append query to add certain field values to the tblRecipe from the tblRecipe; using the recipeNum as the criteria.&nbsp; The append did not work due to Key Violations, the fact that the RecipeNum is a Primary Key.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>auto-assigning a recipeID (note how I get rid of the funny characters that cause notational difficulties)</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find the function in the query design to create an expression or formula to auto-assign or change the RecipeNum.&nbsp; Is it an update query?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>retrieve the recipeID</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I assume this phrase means to begin an Update Query to renumber or to just view the results?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>run several more append queries to copy the related records, using the retrieved recipeID.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get the first one completed, then I will work on the related tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Re auto-assigning a recipeID: you can either use an AutoNumber, or you can use the DMax+1 technique.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>In reassigning record number, I will probably use DMax + .01 for the copied RecipeNum Record until I have a chance to modify it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I understand this process,&nbsp;I have several more similar table relationships that need this programming.&nbsp; I will be able to manage that&nbsp;without help.&nbsp; As of now though, I appreciate your help.</p>

            <p>Hi Gary,<br />
Whenever I get a new database I first review the database design, because it is the foundation that everything else is built on top of. At this time I'm only focused on major structural issues and major design challenges.</p>
<p>Following are must-fix items from my perspective. This is not just opinion, but based in the rules of normalization and set theory.<br />
1. Change primary key from double to long integer. Double is an inprecise data type ("approximate numeric") and thus not suitable as a PK. In your case you may want to keep RecipeNum as a double, but then you have to introduce a RecipeID Autonumber as the PK.
 This will also require fixing up all FK's that are currently linked to RecipeNum. This can be done with update queries.<br />
2. PK values should not be shown to end users, in most cases. Rather they should be meaningless numbers that are there for structural integrity only.<br />
3. tblRecipe contains a "repeating group" with regards to pricing. Pricing levels should be spun off in their own child table, 1:M related to the parent table. An exception would be if this db is specifically written for a POS system that we will keep for the
 lifetime of this application, and that always will support 4 prices and no more. The same is true for tables such as tblMicrosConddef: if the unusual field names reflect the POS system you have my blessing. It may be useful to use the Description field in
 table design to further describe the field (e.g. 1-1 = Egg Style).<br />
4. tblRecipe contains fields such as Price@1025 which I don't fully understand at this time but are possible calculated fields and as such belong in queries, not tables. I know we have a Calculated Field data type now, but it should not be used here.<br />
5. tblRecipe contains calculated fields such as ImagePath with literal values "C:\PMWeb\Images\" &amp; [RecipeNum] &amp; ".jpg". The path to images should not be hard-coded but be in a SystemSettings table and the full path to an image should be calculated in a query.<br />
6. Speculating, I think tblRecipe.[Photo?] is a calculated field. It can be eliminated or calculated in a query by checking if ImagePath is null. Similarly [No Allergen?] can be calculated from Allergen being null.<br />
7. I don't understand the child tables such as tblMicrosGeneral well enough yet, but it appears you are duplicating information. Several fields are shared between this child table and its parent, and that is most likely wrong. If those parent values are needed,
 they can be looked up using a query. Only the FK is needed.<br />
8. Use the most precise data type. tblRecipe.Price1 should be Currency, not Single.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the category of recommendations:<br />
1. Don't use spaces or other funny characters in object names. They may cause notational difficulties.<br />
2. Don't use reserved words such as tblRecipe.Name as object names.<br />
3. Don't use negative logic like [No Allergen?]. It always causes me to pause and ask what exactly a checkmark means.<br />
4. You could probably use more required fields, e.g. tblRecipe.Price1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry this does not directly answer your question about copying a recipe, but in my view it is a necessary precondition.<br />
I'd be happy to further assist you once these changes have been made.</p>
<p>Best of luck with your project.</p>
<p />

            <p>Gary, first let me say that even without seeing your app, I agree completely with Tom's suggestions except one. I disagree that a PK cannot be used as a visible ID for a record. If you understand that the ID is only a unique identifier, then it can be shown
 to users if you fell the need to. But there is no requirement to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the reason you were probably getting a key violation is that your append query included the PK field. You cannot do so. You either have to generate a new PK BEFORE the Append or use an Autonumber and retrieve it after the Append. Since I almost always use
 Autonumber PKs, After I do the Append, I use code like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>lngNewPK = DMax("[RecipeID]", "tblRecipe")</p>
<p>
</p><p>to capture the generated #. Then I can use Append queries to include that value as the Foreign Key in your child tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another point here is I question to 1:1 relationships.&nbsp; Based on what Tom wrote it sounds like you shouldn't be using so many. You should be working towards a more vertical and less horizontal design.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>I wrote: PK values should not be shown to end users, <strong>in most cases</strong></p>
<p>What I had in mind for the exception is a natural key such as tblStates.StateAbbrev.</p>
<p>Especially for beginners numeric behind-the-scenes autonumber PKs are preferred because they enforce the notion that they should be meaningless. In the sample application we have:<br />
</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1216</td>
<td>Chocolate &nbsp; Muffin</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1216.5</td>
<td>Chocolate Muffin &nbsp; Petite Size</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1217</td>
<td>Apple Crumb Muffin</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1217.5</td>
<td>Apple Crumb Muffin small size</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is a clear example of the PK being given a meaningful value for grouping purposes. With my admonition I wanted to point out this is a bad idea.</p>
<p>Grouping should probably be done using a RelatedItems table. An alternative is a NAICS-like code where subsequent digits refine the product. Exact implementation would require some analysis time to better understand the OPs business (rules).</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am still a little confused why an assigned number, in this case RecipeID, should not be used as a primary key and the child tables using the same number as the foreign key.&nbsp; It is a logical relationship.&nbsp; The RecipeID is visible to the user and intuitive.&nbsp;
 It is not duplicatible and therefore cannot corrupt.&nbsp; I will continue to read to understand .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do understand that in order to use the append query for this copy routine, I will need to use autonumber field as I cannot append with the PK field included and I assume that you cannot leave the PK field blank in the new record as it will evoke PK violation
 error.&nbsp; However, the command button COPY seems to work just fine leaving me in the new record in edit mode.&nbsp; I can then just change the PK field to the record number that I choose (non duplicated).&nbsp; My problem is that the child tables did not copy correctly.&nbsp;
 They did copy though.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your point about the 1:1 Relationships.&nbsp; I will be changing my primary recipe table to include the fields from the many tables with&nbsp;the 1:1 relationships.&nbsp; The recipe table will neccessarily be over 130 fields due to the bit settings in the Point
 of Sale register programming.&nbsp; I do have child tables which use "1:Many" for the recipes; Recipe Sales and&nbsp;Recipe Ingredients.&nbsp; I can set up COPY button on those forms as well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I would like to create a standardized database and I will continue to read and understand the need for a hidden autonumber PK in&nbsp;the Parent table and FK in the&nbsp;Child tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your input.&nbsp; I appreciate the time and thought that both Tom and you have given to this question.</p>

            <p>The Copy command does not commit the record, basically what it does is fill in the controls on the form. If you tried to commit the record without changing the PK it wouldn't allow it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when you try to append with a SQL query, that is committing the record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a choice. You can either use an Autonumber, or you can generate a new ID BEFORE you append it. Either way will work. So you can use the latter method if you want to preserve your ID. However, using Double Precision number as a PK is NOT a good idea.
 Double precision numbers are accurate to (I think) the 15th decimal place. So its possible to have 1216.5 as a visible number but what is stored is 1216.50000000000003. This will not match to 1216.5!</p>

</p><p>If you will have 130 fields, then it is highly likely your database is not normalized properly. It is highly likely that you are encoding data using field names. You should be striving for a more vertical structure rather than horizontal.</p>

    <title>set default version to open Excel files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> asiachinahongkong  say:</h3>
<h2>            set default version to open Excel files</h2>
                    
<p>In addition to the&nbsp;Office Starter 2010 preinstalled in the new HP desktop, I have also loaded it with Home &amp; Student Office 2007.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Words files, I can select which program to open the files with, in which case, I can set Office Words 2007 to be the default program opening the Words files.&nbsp; But, I cannot do the same for opening Excel files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following message was prompted when I open an Excel file :"Thre was a problem sending the command to the program" unless I open an Excel file with&nbsp;"Microsoft Application Virtualization DDE Launcher" that comes with HP desktop.&nbsp; By doing so, the Office
 Starter 2010 Excel is used to open the file.</p>
<p>Can someone advise how I can set the default program to be Office Excel 2007 (same for Words files)?&nbsp; I am unable to browse the programs folder to locate the Office Excel 2007 program.&nbsp; I do not want to uninstall the preinstalled Office Starter 2010 which
 I think is the easiest way to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Exchange ActiveSync Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently our IT team has installed Office 365 and I am not able to configure my Official Outlook ID on Outlook 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was previously using Office 2013 where i can configure my Outlook by manual configuring the Exchange settings. Now in Outlook 2016 there isn't any option available. However, I tried through Exchange ActiveSync option but it's giving error "<em>Log onto
 Exchange ActiveSync mail server (EAS): Could not locate the specified server. User name and/or password are not valid. Please verify the information is correct.</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me as we have to use 2016 now onward and we are not able to configure our emails on it.&nbsp;</p>

            I switched the DVD drive with one from another PC, they both worked.&nbsp; Then I swapped them back to their original PC's and they both worked again properly.&nbsp; Perhaps my "faulty" drive had had an incorrect connection but the problem has gone away, so I'm
 not planning on trying to reproduce the error - just glad it has gone away.

<p>I find that while I'm driving I often want to leave myself a task.&nbsp; "remember to call ___ when I return to the office." or "look up _____ website".&nbsp; I want these thing to be in my Outlook Tasks, not a note.&nbsp; I also
 really want to be able to do this leaving a VOICE note.&nbsp; I can't type while I drive, but I can select a task icon on my home page to leave a voice message fairly easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I leave a audio message that will go to my Outlook Tasks?</p>

            I had the same problem you did.&nbsp; What I do is really 2 steps:&nbsp; 1) record a voice note, then 2) when I get to a place where I can input I create a task or appoinment.

            <p>Personally, i prefer Norton Internet Security; its better than most of the antivirus programs i have tested (McAfee, Nod32, Avira, ...)</p>
<p>Sure all of them will slow the computers little bit, but Norton has the best performance and protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never used Windows 8, but it was excellent on Windows XP, Windows 7, and it does support Windows 8

            In Windows 8, you already have Anti-Malware protection which is Windows Defender and it provides you all Anti-Malware protections which you need. However, if you want to use other Anti-Malware product , you could do so and it will disable Windows Defender.

<h2>            How to copy&#47;paste content control checkboxes</h2>
                    <p>I have a template in Word 2013 that contains multiple content control checkboxes.&nbsp; The purpose of the template is for my workers to be able to complete it in a consistent format and then cut &amp; paste it into our agency database.&nbsp; I cannot create the template
 in the agency/provincial database, so this copy &amp; paste method is the best solution.&nbsp; However, when I copy &amp; paste the control checkboxes don't copy.&nbsp; Is there a way I can fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It sounds like that to me, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't need to allow users to correct mistakes (like that never happens!), you can open the Properties dialog for each check box content control and check the option for "Remove content control when contents are edited". Then each check box that the
 user clicks will be converted to a simple character, Unicode 2612 or <span>
<span>☒.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To be more user-friendly, leave the content controls in place until you're ready to copy/paste to the database. Just before you do that, run this macro to convert all the check boxes to characters:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sub ConvertCheckCCs()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim CC As ContentControl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim idx As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ActiveDocument<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For idx = .ContentControls.Count To 1 Step -1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set CC = .ContentControls(idx)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If CC.Type = wdContentControlCheckBox Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CC.Delete<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next idx<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub</p>

            Hi Jay - do you think I can take this to the next level and create a "COPY" button that contains the macro above, but will also copy the rest of the document to the clipboard?

<p>Sure thing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add this line between the "Next idx" and the "End With":</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Content.Copy<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To create the button, right-click the Quick Access Toolbar and click "Customize Quick Access Toolbar". In the dialog, open the top left dropdown and choose Macros in the list. In the list of macros below that, click the item that ends with "ConvertCheckCCs"
 and then click the Add button between the lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you click the OK button, it's a good idea to select the new entry in the right-hand list and click the Modify button. Then you can remove the template and module names from the Display Name box, leaving only the macro name that will appear as the
 button's tooltip; and you can choose a button image other than the generic macro icon. Also, you can use the up and down buttons to the right of the list to change the order of the Quick Access buttons.</p>

<p>Hi Jay - I got the copy button to work!&nbsp; But the convert didn't work and the checkboxes didn't copy.</p>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub ConvertCheckCCs()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim CC As ContentControl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim idx As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For idx = .ContentControls.Count To 1 Step -1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set CC = .ContentControls(idx)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If CC.Type = wdContentControlCheckBox Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CC.Delete<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Content.Copy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what the error is?&nbsp; I changed the names of my check boxes to "CheckBox1"....up to 9 to see if that was the error, but that didn't work either.</p>

<p>The code looks ok, so something about the check boxes isn't as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One possibility is that, in the Properties dialog of each content control, the box for "Content control cannot be deleted" is checked. If that's the case, insert the following line just before the "CC.Delete" line:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CC.LockContentControl = False<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In your first post you said you had content control check boxes, but I wonder if perhaps they're one of the other types of check boxes, such as ActiveX:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f4da1da-5926-4b91-b8ed-2144b2776b20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f4da1da-5926-4b91-b8ed-2144b2776b20" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>They look different in the document, too:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cdb00164-2a25-453c-aafc-074aedf97d7c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cdb00164-2a25-453c-aafc-074aedf97d7c" /></a></p>
<p>If they aren't content control check boxes, then in the For statement the expression ".ContentControls.Count" will have the value zero, and the entire For...Next loop will be skipped. Then only the .Content.Copy statement will execute, so you'll get a copy
 without the check boxes.<br />

<p>You can use the macro below to change ActiveX check boxes to plain text. This one is more complicated than the one for content controls, for two reasons: Simply deleting an ActiveX object doesn't leave a plain-text copy of its contents the way a content
 control does; and VBA access to ActiveX objects is inherently more complex because they aren't really Word objects but are sort of shoe-horned in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This version looks at all the inline shapes, because ActiveX check boxes belong to that collection (along with pictures that are inserted in-line). For each one, it looks at the OLEFormat.ClassType. Pictures don't have an OLEFormat property, so just trying
 to look at it causes an error; the On Error statement makes the macro skip to the end of the loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is an OLEFormat property, the macro checks its ClassType. Only check boxes are "Forms.CheckBox.1", while other kinds of ActiveX controls have different ClassType values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once we're sure we have an ActiveX check box, its Object property is assigned to oCtrl. We store its Range, Value, and Caption in variables.
</p>
<p>

            Hi rs_saunders,<br />
<br />
There is an update that has been released today fixing an issue related with syncing documents.<br />
When you try to sync the next time, you would be prompted with a message indicating an update.<br />
Please install that and let us know if you are able to sync the documents now.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<h2>            Cannot answer Skype calls on Android</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>WHY CAN I NOT ANSWER ANY SKYPE CALL THAT COMES IN ON MY ANDROID??&nbsp; Why is there is no button to press to answer the call?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Community FAQ says to turn on "answer calls automatically" which makes no sense.&nbsp; With this setting turned on, who then answers the call - the phone, Skype, or the person being called?&nbsp; (Just to be clear, I want to answer ALL calls myself.&nbsp; I do not
 want the phone, Skype or any other entity to do it for me as that would breach my personal security.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate a quick reply as I cannot answer incoming calls until this is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Saurav,</p>
<p>Thank you for your question.</p>
<p>Sharepoint 2010 cannot support multiple Yammer Webpart on the &nbsp;same page. If you would want to add Yammer Webpart, you may do it on another page. I hope this helps. thank you.</p>

<h2>            As I am unable to get either my Updating Surface Pro 4</h2>
                    <p>As I am unable to get either my desktop or laptop to update to 14316, I decided I would up date my surface.
</p>
<p>The problem I encountered with the other two have something to do with a&nbsp;problem with IRQ_Not_less or Equal. &nbsp;There really seems to be no solution to it, at least none that anyone has told me.</p>
<p>That being the case, as I said I decided to update the Surface. I had to set it to fast ring as I was not upgrading with 14295, as there was supposed to be a problem with the fingerprint reader if one did.</p>
<p>Well I set the Surface up to get the update, but now it will not even see any sort of update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to say, I wonder if I am just not supposed to have 14316.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any help out there for this problem?</p>

    <title>Shape won&#39;t color-fill as per layer rules - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oldhasbeen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shape won&#39;t color-fill as per layer rules</h2>
                    <p>I've set up some layers as so:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a183a3fc-38c8-4d12-9258-307ddc642924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a183a3fc-38c8-4d12-9258-307ddc642924" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I assign a layer with a color specified to a shape, it doesn't fill the shape - it just gives it a coloured outline:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8cf9971b-fcfd-450f-b197-68eef2e847f3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8cf9971b-fcfd-450f-b197-68eef2e847f3" /></a></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can reproduce your issue in my Visio 2016 and Visio 2013. Applied one Layer on a shape, the layer color did not fill in the shape color.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Visio 2010, the layer color can be applied to the Visio shape:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55711e0d-cb6d-4826-a855-c33cc21ac4ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55711e0d-cb6d-4826-a855-c33cc21ac4ff" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I will do further confirm if this is the default changes in Visio 2013/2016 or a known issue about it. Any updates about it, I will follow up here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            OneDrive for Business - Editing embedded Excel Online workbook</h2>
                    <p>I have an Excel Online workbook that I plan to embed on a site. The workbook is a dynamic dashboard of information that updates based on user changes to nested drop-down lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to clear a list, it is necessary to hit the delete key. This works ok in Edit mode (URL parameter action=Edit) but not when in embed mode (action=EmbedView).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all the appropriate URL parameters set, my main problem is that I need the key input to function but, unlike edit mode, I do NOT want the Excel ribbon to be visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the parameters I am using:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">&amp;action=embedview&amp;wdbipreview=true&amp;wdHideSheetTabs=True&amp;wdAllowInteractivity=True&amp;AllowTyping=True&amp;ActiveCell=H4&amp;wdHideGridlines=True&amp;wdHideHeaders=True&amp;wdDownloadButton=True</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">

<p><span>Hi Adativs,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, it seems that you want the workbook to be edited directly on a site in SharePoint Online.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, to move forward, I’d like you to confirm and provide the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. About “</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>I do NOT want the
 Excel ribbon to be visible”, could you give us some examples?</span></p>
<p><span>2. About “I need the key input to function</span>”, do you mean that you don’t want to open the embedded file in Excel Online to edit it?</p>
<p><span>3. Do you store the workbooks in the OneDrive for Business library and want to embed them on sites in SharePoint Online?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As some pages showing the workbooks in Excel Online may not be displayed on a site in the edit mode when setting
</span><span>&amp;action=embededit and you may encounter the error messages saying that This content can’t be displayed in a frame, you may not be type and edit something in the embedded workbook directly. In this
 situation, you may embed the workbooks in the view mode and then open them in Excel Online to edit them.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

<p>Hi Cliff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the reply, i will endeavour to explain more clearly:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Excel Online workbook is going to be published as a public-facing dashboard where users will only be able to make changes via the validation drop-down lists. The relevant worksheet cells are unlocked and, in its current format, the lists can be changed
 freely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, what it is not possible to do in embedview view mode is&nbsp;<em>delete</em>&nbsp;the content of the drop-down cells. This is wholly possible in edit mode, however in that view the Excel Online ribbon and menu options are visible, which my client does not
 want as it looks less professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I need is for a typical user to be able to follow the link to the work lol and interact with it (including deleting the content of specific, unlocked cells) but for the view to effectively be modal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot share the file here but if it would help to see it, I can DM you the link?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>adativs</p>
        </p>

<p><span>Hi Adativs,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your updates.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, it seems that you get the embedded code from the personal OneDrive online place (<a href="http://www.onedrive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.onedrive.com</a>) and paste the code in the site
 page in SharePoint Online. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So for further clarification, could you upload some screenshots showing “what it is not possible to do in embedview view mode is&nbsp;</span><em><span>delete</span></em>&nbsp;the
 content of the drop-down cells. This is wholly possible in edit mode, however in that view the Excel Online ribbon and menu options are visible, which my client does not want as it looks less professional.”?</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, to check if your requirement can be achieved, I’d like you to provide the file in

<p>Hi Cliff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, no - the other way round. I want to have an editable version of the workbook (i.e. where I can delete the content of an unlocked cell) but for the view to be modal - no ribbon, no formula bar, no menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I want the appearance of embedview mode but with the ability to edit - is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Thanks for your updates.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Based my investigation, it is not feasible to make no Excel Online ribbon, the formula bar and some menus invisible like the embedded view mode for the Excel file page in the edit mode. You may let users use the
 edit mode you meant.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

    <title>Append Query adds too many records - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philipepling  say:</h3>
<h2>            Append Query adds too many records</h2>
                    <p>I have an append query that is adding an increasing number of duplicate entries each time it is used. The first time it was used it added 1 record. Then it added 3. Then it added 7.&nbsp;Then 14.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a nearly identical append query on 3 other forms without issue, so I'm not sure what is wrong with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The name of the Form on which the process is launched is [AFS].</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I intend to have happen is that the user will press a button, enter the effective date, and then the new Addendum record will appear in the list box&nbsp; ([List50[) on the [AFS] Form which can then be opened from the list. All of that happens correctly,
 except that it also adds the extra duplicate records.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the VBA used to trigger it:</p>
<p>Private Sub Command69_Click()<br />
Dim strAddendumEffDate As String</p>
<p>strAddendumEffDate = InputBox("Enter the Effective Date of the Addendum as mm/dd/yyyy:", "Addendum Effective Date Prompt")<br />
Forms![AFS]![AddendumEffDate] = strAddendumEffDate<br />
DoCmd.OpenQuery "Append_Addendum"<br />
Forms![AFS]![List50].Requery</p>
<p>
</p><p>And here is the SQL of the append query:</p>
<p>INSERT INTO AFS_Addendum ( Plan_ID, AFS_ID, [Addendum Effective Date], Client_ID )<br />
SELECT [Forms]![AFS]![Plan_ID] AS Expr1, [Forms]![AFS]![AFS_ID] AS Expr2, [Forms]![AFS]![AddendumEffDate] AS Expr3, [Forms]![AFS]![Client_ID] AS Expr4<br />
FROM AFS_Addendum;</p>

            The number of rows inserted into the table will increase exponentially every time the query is executed.&nbsp; As more rows are inserted then the query will return that number of rows, so if the table originally contains one row only, the query will insert
 one row, then 2, then 4, 8,16 and so on.<br />
<br />
To insert a single row each time:<br />
<br />
PARAMETERS [Forms]![AFS]![Plan_ID] LONG,[Forms]![AFS]![AFS_ID] LONG,<br />
[Forms]![AFS]![AddendumEffDate] DATETIME, [Forms]![AFS]![Client_ID] LONG;<br />
INSERT INTO AFS_Addendum (Plan_ID, AFS_ID, [Addendum Effective Date], Client_ID)<br />
VALUES([Forms]![AFS]![Plan_ID], [Forms]![AFS]![AFS_ID], <br />
[Forms]![AFS]![AddendumEffDate], [Forms]![AFS]![Client_ID]);<br />
<br />
I've had to guess the data types for the parameter declarations on the basis of their names, so you might need to change them if I've guessed wrong.

<h2>            Saving Images in HTML Documents</h2>
                    I have a file (named index) that I save as HTML to post on a web site. Word automatically saves embedded images in a sub-folder, called index_files, and names them image00x.jpg. My issue it that when I edit the file and save it again, the assigned image00x
 numbers change! The impace is that I have to upload not only the changed text, but all of the unchanged images, which now have new names. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

            Hi Jim
<br />
<br />A HTML file cannot contain Images, therefore Word or any application will save a folder alongside the HTML file with the Image files and ususally CSS and possibly javascript, depending on the file functionality
<br />
<br />You cannot edit pictures or anything else in that folder after that HTML file has been created, you must copy them out of that folder, edit them and then copy them back into that folder . . .

            HI Jim,
<br />
<br />Word is a Word processor. Although it can save documents as web pages it does a horrible job of creating the code for the web page.
<br />
<br />That said, if you go to your document on the web and right-click on an image, you can copy the image location.
<br />
<br />In your Word document, replace that image with an INCLUDEPICTURE field directed to the picture already on the web. You will still have to update a bunch of files but no longer the pictures.
<br />Here is a link to a sample document.
<br /><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tx1vj1zht093bqn/Linked%20Picture.htm?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/tx1vj1zht093bqn/Linke...</a>
<br />Here is a link to the supporting folder created by Word which contains no image files. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2p4m2ljj0ctuyci/AAADUHb1E8yJpC-0K1p9zz_Ca?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2p4m2ljj0ctuyci/AAAD...</a>
<br />
<br />I started web page design using Claris HomePage a long time ago and never returned to Word for that. I currently use FrontPage which is also old but still available from third-party resources.

<p>Thanks, but I have no interest in writing actual HTML code (I used to do that for a living)! I will just continue to copy the changed file to the web server, then copy all of the (unchanged) image files with their new names.</p>

<p>Maybe I was not clear. In my source directory (on my PC), I have a file named index.htm. I have inserted a logo image into that file, named MOAA_masthead.gif. When I save the file, Word creates (or updates) the index_files folder, and puts the image in there,
 named image001.jpg. I currently have a total of 11 such images in the file. If I change the index.htm file - adding new text, not touching any of the images - and save it, the MOAA_masthead.gif will be saved with a new name, perhaps image002.jpg, and something
 else will be named image001.jpg. So, I have to copy all of the image files from the index_files folder on my PC to the index_files folder on the web server. This is not a major deal, just annoying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there are a lot of other tools I could use to create the web page, but do not want to spend any money, or time to learn a new tool. This web page simply presents information about our organization (and a few pictures), and is only editted every two
 weeks or so.</p>

            Again, the includetext field is a Word field. You do not have to do any HTML coding. Once you have the picture on the web once, you link to it in your document.
<br />Look at the sample files I sent. In the document and on the web it looks like the picture is in the document. It is actually independent of the document and displayed when you look at the document.
<br />
<br />Here is what the document actually has in it (showing field codes rather than results):<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7807857d-a3d8-420a-9f4a-9b0e7e47bb7e?upload=true" />

<h2>            Updating SourceName in PowerPoint for Excel Linked Charts and Tables</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following macro below which loops through linked tables and charts and updates the sourcename (i.e. the files are often moved and I need the charts/tables to point to the new location).&nbsp; It works on a PC, but unfortunately it is not working on
 a Mac - the charts and tables are not updating.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your help!&nbsp; The odd thing is that the charts will update when I run from my desktop and remove "harddisk:" from the beginning of the path.&nbsp; If I run from anywhere else, the source is updated upon double checking, but the charts don't update and
 it can't find the linked file.&nbsp; So this leads me to believe there must be some way to update the linked charts source and refresh the data via vba?&nbsp; But sounds like there is no way to make the linked tables/specific sheet references work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jaime</p>

<h2>            User Folders - Location choice during install</h2>
                    <p>Current best practice for power users is often to have an SSD for Windows/Applications, and a traditional HD for user files. It would be nice to have the setup wizard offer some choices if a second HD was detected, to facilitate this.&nbsp; I'm including all
 types of user data, including the desktop, bookmarks, and App/Roaming types of locations.</p>

<p>I don't see anything that would do that (I never did)...I believe it is a registry hack required to re-map this folder to another drive or partition. Is there something I'm missing?</p>

            <p>Not the Users folder. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The folder in the library that represents the one you want to change (Documents, Music, Etc.)</p>
<p>You can "Set Save Location" or just add&nbsp;an additional location&nbsp;to it. They are just references anyway.</p>

            <p>With a&nbsp;little more investigation, I think I know what you are talking about, but it is an incomplete feature:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/41b94a7e-66be-4bfd-b585-51310098d9e3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be a pain to have to do this with each of your folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) but what is worse is that there is "hiding" user data not captured. In this example, I created a Sticky Note...and it stored in AppData which is hidden and doesn't
 have a "Move..." option.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c680327-a0de-41ad-9ca8-07df888409f6" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I think the parent folder for Users needs to at least have a "Move..." option like the child folders - but better for the average user would be to give them a choice of locations if 2 hard drives are detected during installation.</p>
