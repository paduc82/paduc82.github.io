<h2>            Windows 10 Lockscreen not showing the &#34;Like&#34; button nor any information about the picture anymore</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think there was a new update to Windows 10 that now does not allow me to like the pictures on the Windows 10 lock screen and it does not provide any information about where the picture was taken like it had been previously. How can I bring the "like" and
 information about the photo feature back into the lock screen? Thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>            Inconsistent color banding &#40;dual monitor&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I like to hook my Surface 2 to an external monitor.&nbsp; Sometimes color banding on the second monitor is very apparent and other times the banding is barely noticeable.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what's causing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because when the banding is bad, it's real bad.&nbsp; I would like to know how to prevent this from happening again.</p>

            <p>Almost certainly the issue you are describing is the same that I had in this thread here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surf2-surfhardware/hdmi-output-by-surface-2-16-bit-colour/df33b7b8-4b07-4fd4-90cc-c3ff2958dedb?page=1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surf2-surfhardware/hdmi-output-by-surface-2-16-bit-colour/df33b7b8-4b07-4fd4-90cc-c3ff2958dedb?page=1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is&nbsp;the S2 outputting 16 bit colour for some reason. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the link helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short my eventual&nbsp;solution was to exchange my S2. New one worked just fine, with proper 32bit colour output via HDMI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that both of mine had a very small but detectable amount of banding on the S2's own screen (on live tiles, for example), which I assume is "normal" for the device.

<h2>            Windows 10 made two of my computers inoperable</h2>
                    <p>The bastards at Microsoft have destroyed two of my computers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to go back to previous version of Windows, but one of the computers keeps switching screens, and will not function.</p>
<p>My Asus laptop has a blue screen and it says to return it to the manufacturer for repairs. It is completely unresponsive.</p>
<p>Is there any way we can make Microsoft repair these computers? I spent many hundreds of dollarson these devices, and Microsoft is making no offer for repairs or restitution.</p>
<p>I can't even get in touch with the criminals at Microsoft.</p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas? Anyone know where Microsoft offices are so I can personally let them know how upset I am?</p>

<p>It's not like Microsoft wants your computer to have a problem LOL. &nbsp;They are trying to take care of billions of computers (that they didn't even build). &nbsp;That's why the company that built it (Asus for example) supplies all the support, even if Windows has
 a problem.</p>

<p>I'm glad you find it humorous that Microsoft has destroyed $800 dollars of my property. I wish I could do the same to them, buy much more, as I must waste quite a bit of my time trying to right the wrong done by Microsoft. I have also lost much valuable
<p>ASUS and HP want money from me to repair the Microsoft damage.</p>
<p>ASUS did not destroy my ASUS computer. HP did not destroy my HP computer. Microsoft destroyed these computers.</p>
<p>As I previously stated, I attempted to restore my HP to earlier operating system. Unsuccessfully. The screen flashes back and forth to another screen.</p>
<p>The ASUS is a total blue screen. stating the device is not repairable and must be returned to ASUS for repair.</p>

<p>I don't find it humorous, but it's definitely not like Microsoft wants this to happen. This wasn't like criminal mischief where they intentionally tried to mess up your computer.&nbsp; They send this out to hundreds and hundreds of millions of computers every
 day, and fleets of engineers try their absolute hardest to make it as smooth as they can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft did not damage your property.&nbsp; There's a software flaw, fine. But it's just software. It's not like it's been physically damaged/burned and broken. You don't need to buy a new device, you just need to reconfigure the software and get it back to
 working order. Yes it's a pain in the neck, yes it's a hassle. No it's not something you should have to do... but it's not actually destroyed/broken/requiring a physical replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The manufacturer that built the device is required by law to provide service for what they sell. That's their legal agreement for being allowed the licensing rights to pre-bundle Windows on the computers they sell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want, this community is full of people that will happily give their time for free to help out if you're willing to work with us. I and others can help guide you with what you can do.&nbsp;Which computer would you like to focus on first, the HP or the Asus?</p>

    <title>ILS Frequencies and the NAV&#47;COM in Radio Stack - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr. meer ahmad mydin meera  say:</h3>
<h2>            ILS Frequencies and the NAV&#47;COM in Radio Stack</h2>
                    Hello. I used to fly ILS-approach and ILS-final into landing airliner-jets about 10 years ago in FS2004. I used to enter the ILS -frequency of the destination-airport along with the Ground-frequency of the airport into NAV, which allowed my flight to lock
 onto the airport's ILS and turn into the runway after the ATC had given me the approach-vectors and brought me to the final. It required me to enter both those frequencies. But now using FSX, I find that I can only enter the ILS-frequency - both the Ground-frequency
 and the Tower-frequency cannot be entered into the second NAV because the display-range of the second-NAV display does not include the frequency being entered, and both these frequencies are outside the display-range. I need help in overcoming the difficulty.
 Thank you.

<p>Hello Dr. Meer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The panel you have shown appears to be the Airbus one, so I'm not so familiar with it.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, since all airliners basically have their instruments and their functions work in a similar way, I'll give what I would do in such a landing situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After ATC vectors you towards base leg of the Approach and then onto (long) Final Approach, you would already have done the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp; &nbsp;selected your allocated runway via GPS or FMC and ensure that it appears as active/registered.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; &nbsp;tuned your NAV radio to the ILS frequency of the allocated runway and made that frequency active.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; &nbsp;if you were flying using GPS mode, then you would need to switch to NAV mode during the turn onto Final.&nbsp; Or, if you&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; don't have the NAV button, then I see that LOC is available.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; &nbsp;as your Localizer (diamond) moves towards the centre, then activate the Approach (press the APP button).</p>
<p>e.&nbsp; &nbsp;your Glideslope (diamond) should also appear shortly whereby you can either manually alter your descent or let the aircraft capture the glideslope and descend that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, I'm unfamiliar with the Airbus, but that is the sequence of events I use for the B744 (though I don't have a LOC button).&nbsp; &nbsp;Let us know how you go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

<h2>            close lid option is ignored</h2>
                    I have an Acer laptop running Windows 7.&nbsp; In Control Panel Power Options, when I click "Choose what closing the lid does", I have it set to DO NOTHING when I close the lid (AC and battery), yet when I close the lid...it shuts down.&nbsp; This strikes me as
 counterintuitive.&nbsp; What am I missing?

            Hi Mary_m,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There might be some Acer power management software currently installed on your machine, often times this software will override the windows settings. I would check and either change the settings through Acer's power management program or uninstall it.
 Hope this helps - Edog<br />

    <title>Xbox One unreliable with 5ghz&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the phantom jug  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One unreliable with 5ghz&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Whenever I have Xbox One connected to router using 5ghz 802.11n, the connection is always slow and generally unreliable. I'll have different things in games time out, or streaming videos just not play at all. Also, when I turn on the Xbox (tested from both
 cold boot and instant on), it will take a while to connect or not connect at all. Requiring me to manually connect it. When I switch to 2.4ghz (or wired), all those problems subside.</p>
<p>I did some tests using the 'detailed network statistics' in the network settings of the Xbox One:</p>
<p>Speed Down/Up - Packet Loss Down/Up - Latency - Connection</p>
<pre>2.4ghz:</pre>
<ol>
<li>13.50/15.54 0% 0% 53ms 100% </li><li>18.05/15.71 0% 0% 59ms 100% </li><li>19.42/20.54 0% 0% 53ms 100% </li></ol>
<pre>5ghz:</pre>
<ol>
<li>12.62/1.07 0% 1% 59ms 96% </li><li>19.82/4.80 0% 0% 61ms 97% </li><li>09.29/1.42 0% 2% 62ms 96% </li></ol>
<p>The 5ghz downstream looks like it's adequate, but it definitely doesn't feel like that. I still get time outs and un-streamable videos with it.&nbsp;And upstream takes a nosedive from 2.4ghz. My other devices work fine on 5ghz, and max out at 60mbps down, and
 roughly same upload as wired.&nbsp;And for reference, wired performance:</p>
<ol>
<li>38.61/23.38 </li><li>57.56/22.68 </li><li>103.40/24.69 </li></ol>
<p>Router I'm using is a Netgear WNDR3800. 5ghz and 2.4ghz are being run at same time, both setup exactly same way and both use WPA2-PSK(AES). I've messed around with some settings on router, including nat and dmz, to make sure none of that is affect it. All
 my other wireless devices work fine with my router, some use 2.4 others use 5 and no speed problems with any of them. Just with Xbox One. Router and Xbox are both in same room, in clear view of each other, nothing in the way.</p>
<p>While I could stay with wired, I'd like to know if this is a hardware problem with the Xbox which needs to be fixed or not. Plus, I'd rather not have an ethernet cable dragged across the room if possible.</p>

<p>Using a dlink dgl-5500 no issues on the 5ghz nearly identical results as my wired connection very solid. &nbsp;I'd say an issue with your router itself or a defective xbox. &nbsp;This is with wpa2 aes 5ghz ac/n/a</p>

<p>Hmm, well, that's good to hear that at least it works with 5ghz... Now to figure out if it's the router or Xbox itself. Unfortunately I don't have a secondary 5ghz router to test out, so guess I'll have to mess with settings and see if anything changes.
 Thanks for the reply!</p>

<p>Well I contacted support and he said they "fixed" it by using a wired connection (which just seems like avoiding the problem):</p>
<p>Oliver: at 20:38:48</p>
<p>To tell you honestly ####, we in this situation we solved this kind of issue &nbsp;by connecting the Xbox One to wired connection.</p>
<p>Oliver: at 20:39:27</p>
<p>Xbox One console is a new technology that needs a good Internet connection.</p>
<p>And later gave link to router sub forum on here: <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/networking-hardware/02-routers/netgear/f/3113.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Oliver: at 20:46:43</p>
<p>You can post your concern there and they will help you a lot.</p>
<p>Except they don't provide support, and you can't post there.</p>
<p>Is there a problem with the Xbox One's wireless? All my other wireless devices work fine on my router, and my one year old cell phone shouldn't be multiple times faster and more reliable than the Xbox One...</p>

            <p>Greetings The Phantom Jug!</p>
<p>Appreciate if you could post up the make and model of your modem.<br /><br />Visit Netgear website and make sure your router is up-to-date with the latest version of firmware.<br /><br />Which wireless mode have you setup for your Netgear router?<br /><br />Do you use WPA2-PSK AES only, or mixed with TKIP?<br /><br />Could you manually change the wireless channel for the 5 Ghz band, if this is set to auto. The listed channels should be within the non-overlapping range.<br /><br />Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah, I looked at that link yesterday, but nothing in it helped. I haven't connected to any online games yet. I did try a few days ago, but it just sat there. I don't play a huge amount of online games, so lag isn't too much of a concern for me. But online
 play should be perfectly&nbsp;doable over wireless. Right now I have the Xbox One maybe 5 feet away from router, with nothing in between. Wanted to make sure distance/interference&nbsp;wasn't the problem.</p>
<p>What I really want is wireless to just be actually usable. Right now it's not. It's extremely slow/unreliable and basicaly unusable. I cannot stay connected to live, tiles and apps take forever to load or update and when I turn the xbox one on it almost
 always has problems connecting or even logging me in to live. If I switch to wired, everything works perfectly fine.</p>
<p>My internet right now is something around 150/20mbps (it can actually go faster). Now I'm not expecting speeds like that over wireless obviously, but I shouldn't be getting such slow speeds (I've gotten sub 1mbps before...) over 5ghz wireless-n. 2.4 seems
 to be a bit more stable, but it's still slower than where it should be and will have streaming/disconnection problems. My cell phone connected to same router will get 30-60mbps down (and ~20mbps up), and I don't have any stability issues with it.</p>
<p>I just reconnected Xbox One to 5ghz wireless, had to manually try 3 times because it would say "can't connect" (and my password was correct each time, it's not a particularly confusing one to enter) before it would connect, which happens quite a lot when
 trying to connect to wireless on Xbox One. Detailed network statistics state: 8.96mbps down/1.72mbps up, 56ms latency and 100% wireless strength. Plugged in ethernet, and got 85.04mbps down/18.05/mbps up, 51ms latency.</p>
<p>For router info, I'm using a Netgear WNDR3800 it's firmware is up to date. I use only&nbsp;<span>WPA2-PSK AES for both 2.4 and 5ghz, I keep mode on 5ghz set to 300mbps, I've tested with the lower ones as well (130 &amp; 54) with the Xbox One, and neither is any better.
 I've tested with different channels as well, which didn't seem to do anything (at least in making things better).</span></p>

<p>I did not. From what it looks like, there's either some kinda odd compatibility with my router, or this xbox's wireless is broken. Wish I knew someone else who had same router as me, so I'd know for sure.</p>

<p>Hey, I'm also having router problems with my xbox one. My brother and I couldn't get both of our xbox ones to have an open nat type on the same network, so I bought a dlink dual band router that Microsoft listed as having been confirmed to work with 2 consoles.
 Everything should work fine, but our xboxs can't even connect to the 5ghz band. They can connect to the 2.4 ghz band but will still have a strict nat.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>2. What is the amount of RAM installed on the computer? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a memory slot free then you can install additional ram, you can also upgrade the size of memory sticks to increase the RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have a laptop then you cannot add the extra RAM.</p>

<h3> mir .  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 system restore failure</h2>
                    <p>I accidentally deleted a big folder with a lot of my files in it and I am trying to restore to a point where it wasn't deleted which is last Saturday. But i get this error:</p>
<p><em>System Restore did not complete successfully. Your computer's system files and<br />
settings were not changed.<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
System Restore failed while restoring the directory from the restore point.<br />
Source:</em><em>%ProgramFiles%\WindowsApps</em><em><br />
Destination: </em><em>AppxStaging</em><em><br />
An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. (0x80071160)</em></p>
<p>I did every step as every other post recommended such as:1. Boot into Safe Mode.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on Start and click on Command Prompt (admin).<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type these commands below one by one.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd C:\Program Files<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; takeown /f WindowsApps /r /d Y<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; icacls WindowsApps /grant “%USERDOMAIN%\%USERNAME%”:(F) /t<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attrib WindowsApps -h<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rename WindowsApps WindowsApps.old<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reboot back into Windows.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run System Restore.</p>
<p>And in the end it did not work and I cannot restore to a previous point and I really need that folder back. Please help.</p>

            Hi Mir,
<br />
<br />Restoring your system to a previous date will not bring that folder back . . .
<br />
<br />A System Restore will restore the major Windows Files and your Windows Registry, it will have no effect on your personal files other than to remove any 3rd party software installed subsequent to that restore data . . .
<br />
<br />You will need to use a 3rd party application like the free version of AOMEI Backupper or the free version of Recuva to see if that data is recoverable . . .

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair from the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do<br />
not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friends (they are not copy protected) or make one. Also<br />
your System maker will sell the physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span></a><br />

<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Vista disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you can try System Restore from the Recovery or Vista disk.<br />

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
If you still have account access issues these may help :<br />
<br />
You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup. The ADMIN account in Safe<br />
Mode has no password by default (so unless someone changed the password it should be available).<br />
<br />
Some programs like the Google Updater (if you added the Google Toolbar, Chrome&nbsp;or Google Earth)<br />
has been known to cause this issue.</p>
<p>Error message when you log on to a Windows Vista-based or Windows 7-based computer by using a<br />
temporary profile: "The User Profile Service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded"<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947215</span></a><br />
<br />
How to Fix the Error "The User Profile Service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded."<br />

How to Fix the Error "Your user profile was not loaded correctly! You have been logged on with a<br />
temporary profile." in Vista<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/135858-user-profile-error-logged-temporary-profile.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/135858-user-profile-error-logged-temporary-profile.html</span></a><br />
<br />
BE VERY CAREFUL IF USING THIS ONE :<br />
<br />
DO NOT USE THE HIDDEN ACCOUNT ON A DAILY BASIS! If it corrrups you are TOAST.<br />
<br />
How to Enable or Disable the Real Built-in Administrator Account in Vista<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67567-administrator-account.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67567-administrator-account.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to user APPLY / OK then raise it back to<br />
ADMIN. This helps clear corruption. Do same for other accounts if needed after following the<br />
above message.<br />
<br />
You can use the Hidden Admin Account - Make another account as ADMIN with your same<br />
password (or two with same password) use one to test or fix the other.<br />
<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span></a><br />
<br />
If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember<br />
to always leave an Admin Account that is unused except to test and fix).<br />

            On screen keyboard does not pop up when required as did in Vista and anywhere but Internet Explorer 10 or 11. Tried your suggestion all I got was an onscreen keyboard that I have to click on to use.

<h2>            Windows 10 constantly losing internet - UNACCEPTABLE&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I've been using Windows 10 since it first came out and have really not had any problems until last week. All of a sudden my internet keeps shutting off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent an entire work day (a day where I could not do any work, and therefore lost time and money) trying to solve this issue. When i couldn't solve it, I went and bought a new PC thinking I would solve the internet issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nope!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my brand new PC is losing internet connection too. I did more digging to discover it may be an issue with Chrome. I read that a lot of people had some success by installing Chrome Canary so I downloaded that as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is still happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then read that there is a setting where Windows turns off the wireless modem or puts it to sleep so I found the setting to disable that. Still losing internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've ran the troubleshooter a million times. It actually does nothing at all..it just spins and spins and never comes up with any issues or suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now I am posting here. I know that some MS person will post a generic answer telling me to check this or check that...all of which I've done 500 times. Why don't you maybe consider fixing the issue? I am not a Mac guy, but I have to tell you I am about
 to return every PC I have and never use Windows again. I've lost now 3 almost full days of work dealing with this issue and this is pure insanity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any solution to this? The internet works 100% fine and then in a matter of 1 millisecond it's gone and I am left here for hours dealing with trying to get it working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers are up to date. ALL of the "fixes" I've found online I have tried and they all did nothing. The worst part is that I never really know which fix works temporarily or not at all because the problem is intermmittent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's NOT a problem with my modem, my wireless or my ISP. How do I know? Because the other 5 PC's in the house not running Windows 10 work fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't I just use those?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I have a brand new PC and would rather use that and have it actually work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the other thing I'm noticing is whenever there is any Windows update I am losing internet. I just had to restart because of some updates and when I restarted the problem is there. I am typing this now because at the moment it's working, but I bet if I
 were to start using Chrome again it would stop working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any MS people have a genius answer to tell me to use MS's junk browser that's not an acceptable answer. I don't like your browser and will not use it....so figure out how to make Chrome work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean...I know I sound like a baby here, but this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>FIX THIS!</strong></p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply, but as I mentioned in my post I have tried all of the typical fixes and none of them worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even had a MS tech remote connect and after an hour he said that "you should not be having this problem". The only 2 computers in my house (including 5 mobile devices) that could not connect were Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I solved the&nbsp; issue by buying a Mac last night, and now my internet is working non-stop.</p>

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Store app. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Store app, it should work fine now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<p>Hi Mahad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To have better clarity on the issue, answer the below-listed questions and get back to us.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Since when are you facing this issue?</li><li>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li><li>What is the make and model number of your computer and the version of your Windows 10 computer? (To check the version of your Windows 10, you can refer
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4027391/windows-10-see-which-version-you-have" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
See which version of Windows 10 you have</a>).</li><li>Check if your Windows is up-to-date by going to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>
Update and Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Updates</strong> and install all the Windows Updates if there are any.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, try the below troubleshooting methods and see if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to first run the Windows Apps Troubleshooter by going to <strong>
Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update and Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; Run the
<strong>Windows Store Apps</strong> Troubleshooter and check for the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Clear Microsoft Store Cache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> key and the <strong>R</strong> key from your keyboard and type
<strong>Wsreset</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>. Let the reset complete and Microsoft Store will launch automatically. Then,
<strong>close Microsoft Store</strong> and <strong>restart your computer once</strong> and check for the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Reset Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>Apps and Features</strong> &gt; Search for
<strong>Microsoft Store</strong> &gt; Click on <strong>Advanced options</strong> &gt; <strong>
Reset</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Restart the computer once</strong> after the Reset and check for the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4</strong>: New User Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above methods didn't work, then try creating a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
New Administrator User Account</a> and see if you are facing the same issue in the New User Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>
