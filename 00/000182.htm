<h2>            Vertical Error Bars Show Only &#39;Plus&#39; Though &#39;Both&#39; Is Selected</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a bar chart with two data series. For both series, the error bars are individual standard deviations added through the 'Custom' Error Amount and I have chosen 'Both' for the error bar direction. The error bars appear correctly on the second series,
 i.e., you can see the portion of error bar both above and below the data point. On the first series, however, it is only showing as 'Plus', i.e., only the portion of the error bar above the data point shows. If I choose 'Plus', the display is the same. Toggling
 back to 'Both' doesn't change anything. Making the data point bars transparent doesn't change anything, meaning the bottom portion of the error bar isn't "hidden" behind the data point. I have included a picture of the chart; please ignore the third series
 (black diamonds).&nbsp; Thank you in advance for your help.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2b6f278-4681-4d2b-b062-6f73fb6a58ad" height="263" width="486" /></p>

            <p>Hi Teylen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize, but I changed the chart because I didn't like the scatter/bar chart combo. I made several new iterations of the chart, with error bars, and never again had the problem. Perhaps a one-off "fluke"? I do appreciate your reply, and I am sorry I
 didn't save the file as it was. It would have been interesting to ferret out the problem. Please feel free to delete/close this post according to your policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Lisa</p>

<h2>            Saving Word doc with page breaks as PDF</h2>
                    How do I save a Word document with page breaks (I have a page break with 2 pages of the document in landscape layout) as a PDF without it splitting the newly saved PDF into 3 different files? I've tried everything to avoid this happening but still the
 resulting PDF saves as 3 separate documents, which is useless as a professional document. Thanks!&nbsp;

            Please search the forum for dozens of conversations on this frequently discussed issue. It is not something you can control from within Word, but there are a number of suggestions &amp; alternatives in those threads.<br />
<br />
IMO, the simplest is to use Apple's <i><b>Preview</b></i> app to combine the multiple PDF files into a single PDF document.<br />

    <title>Ghost .PSTs in Outlook 2003 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nkee1229  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ghost .PSTs in Outlook 2003</h2>
                    
<p>The ghostbuster add-in <a href="http://addins.howto-outlook.com/codetwo_ghostbuster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://addins.howto-outlook.com/codetwo_ghostbuster</a> <strong>worked wonders</strong> on two of my ghost files, HOWEVER, when I started opening/consolidating more .PST files, three more ghosts appeared and here's THE CATCH: The new ghost folders do not have
 names, so the plugin cannot find them!!! When, I right-click on the folder, a menu option for "Close " &lt;0w#25&gt;"" is available, but when I click on it, I get the error message, "You cannot close the mailbox that containts your calendar, contacts, and inbox."
 The thing is: this is NOT the main mailbox that contains the aforementioned items (which are stored on my server). Secondly, when I try to expand those folders to see what's inside, I get the error message, "Unable to expand the folder. The set of folders
 could not be opened. Show help &gt;&gt; <br />
(button)"</p>
<p>What now? I have screen shots that I can email, if you'd like to see them.</p>

<p>Okay, NOW I'm really panicking.</p>
<p>I tried to make a copy of my Master PST file, after having consolidated many old .PSTs into one folder in Outlook. In order to make the copy, I must have the .PST file closed in Outlook, but when I go to close the folder, I get the warning, "The operation
 failed. An object could not be found." I'm afraid if I use the same Ghostbuster utility (described above), it will delete my Master PST file as well.
<br />
<br />
What can I do to close the folder in Outlook without harming the original file?!</p>

<p><br />
You won't harm the file -&nbsp;you are harming the profile. Ok, so 'harm' is a bit strong since the profile was corrupt already (that's why you had ghosts). At this point, rather than trying to fix it, you'd be better off making a new profile and&nbsp;settting it to
 use the&nbsp;existing pst file.</p>

            As far as i know off, it cannot be done directly in Outlook 2010.<br />
For this you would have to write a macro.<br />

I'm afraid not.&nbsp; Monday is my day of so I set my OOO every sunday evening :-( <br />
<br />
I thought it shouldn't be that hard but apparently it is. <br />

I guess the girls and guys at Microsoft aren't used to working part time :-)<br />

Good luck and if you find a solution, please share share share.<br />

            <p>Does MS not have an answer for this? My mail and calendar app on my Lumia 640 is
<em><strong>1.24GB</strong></em> (and on my wife's 550 'only' 330MB).</p>
<p>This would not appear to be the data, as a) that is recorded separately in the storage utility and b) I have drastically reduced what syncs and it made absolutely no difference to the size of the mail app.</p>
<p>As with the original poster, I am unable to install updates because of this. Last night I had to uninstall WhatsApp in order to&nbsp;<em>just</em> create enough free space in order to install the lastest update. I doubt I will be able to install the Creators
 Update when it arrives without a full reset of the phone (assuming that even then that reduces the size of the app).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not possible to uninstall and reinstall the Mail and Calendaring app, which is probably what is needed. Where is this 1.24GB coming from, as the app obviously isn't this large? Caching data from somewhere? Other reports on the web have people indicating
 various sizes of mail app so there is a complete lack of consistency.</p>

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The size of the Mail and Calendar apps is directly associated to the amount of email and calendar items that you are syncing for each account.&nbsp; This includes any attachments that may be included in the email and/or calendar entries.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reduce&nbsp;the amount of storage&nbsp;used, you can reduce the amount of data being synced by changing the sync settings. Mail -&gt; Settings -&gt; Manage accounts -&gt; Change mailbox sync settings -&gt; Download email from, and selecting a smaller date range.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will
 need to be done for each account that contains a large amount of email/calendar events. Each account will need to sync before you will see a reduction in storage used.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can manually sync each accounts to speed up the process.</p>

            <p>Thanks, but I don't think this is the case as I stated originally. </p>
<p>Firstly, I reduced the amount of mail sync'd to 7 days and that is nowhere near 1.2GB and also dropping it from 1 month made zero difference. Secondly, the 'Storage' utility on WM10 shows both an entry for Mail and Calendar (1.24GB) and a separate entry
 for 'Mail and messaging' (16.6MB in my case). When I increased the sync back to 1 month, that latter figure increased to 18.1MB, so I don't think the 1.24GB represents real mail data. It might be cached, historic and redundant data the app doesn't clean out
 but there is definitely something wrong with the app itself and not the mail data file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice if MS acknowledged this issue (I am not alone with this issue) and even nicer if they fixed it.</p>

            <p>Also, removing both email accounts leaves the size of the app at&nbsp;<strong>1.22GB</strong>. Powering​ down doesn't remove anything so I'm left with an app taking 15% of available memory doing absolutely nothing 😣.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being able to uninstall and reinstall the app would probably help. Is there any way to do this as it isn't possible via the normal method in the later versions of WM10?</p>

<p>I don't suppose you received a response to your issue being reported?</p>
<p>I had to reset my 640 to create enough space to install the Creators Update and now the mail app is just growing again, as it did before.</p>
<p>It would be very helpful if it was possible to reset the app, as you seem to be able to do with other apps, but when I try the 'reset' button is greyed out. Does anyone know if it is possible to enable the reset functionality?</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>I had hoped there was a chance the Creators Update would address this after all the hassle I had getting it installed but it hasn't. I suspect in the screen print above, the mail app is actually 75MB in size and somehow it just acquires 'other' data, which
 is the 85MB and it just grows. This is not my mail data. This is likely to eventually reach 1GB as before, necessitating another phone reset, or maybe just a switch to Android instead, given this seems to be what MS are trying to encourage its mobile users
 to do anyway............</p>

<p>Again I suppose there has been no response from MS?</p>
<p>The mail and calendar app now has 157MB of 'data' (it was 84.7MB above) so it continues to grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

 that MS's feedback seems to be quite poor? There is a lot of feedback on the Feedback Hub about this but it doesn't seem to make any difference - more minor bugs get fixed but this one remains?</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>it is the same with my Lumia 730. I reduced the sync to 3 days and 7 days but the size of the app is not reducing at all (stays exactly the same!)</p>
<p>What is the recommended fix to be able to install updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help with some solution!</p>

                    Until I updated Internet Explorer I had no problem with keeping printing documents to one page.&nbsp; After updating, it is now printing the 'date and time' at the top of every page, and as a user and not a pro, I cannot remember how to shut off the 'date and

If you have the Menu toolbar, you can also use File\Page Setup.

                    <p>Please I need your help about a parcial sync between an smartphone with WM6.5 and my notebook, Outlook 2010 32b, Windows 7 Professional 64b</p>
<p>Example, I have a note OneNote mobile, and the same in my OneNote on&nbsp;the notebook.</p>
<p>If I edit the note on the phone, and sync as usual, there is no actualization on my notebook.</p>
<p>I can do that in the reverse mode, editing on my notebook, actualization OK on the phone.</p>
<p>I am trying to convert almost 300 Outlook Notes that was imposible to sync, but also this way I have problems.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>Hello. Unfortunately, the OneNote sync is only one way. Usually from phone to desktop. But yours apparently is from desktop to phone which is unusual. It does say the note can't be created on the desktop but maybe editing is OK. Don't know. If you read the
 comments, there are some workarounds mentioned like converting the mobile notebook back to 2007 format. Then sync may be two way:</p>

            Hello. Yes, I remember your continuing problem with notes and I am always sorry not to be able to help very much. Microsoft is just not very good at getting their own products to work together. Even the iPhone and android can do this. Their new Windows
 Phone 7.5 platform still can't I don't think. Maybe to Skydrive.I know that you do not want to use 3rd party programs but I would check out Companionlink:
<div><a href="http://www.companionlink.com/windowsmobile/outlook/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.companionlink.com/windowsmobile/outlook/</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>I believe that you will need the Pro version because you were trying to sync notes in different folders last time as I recall. It is kind of expensive but there is a trial you can do to make sure it works before you buy it. You would think Microsoft could
 do it but sometimes it is better to try a non-Microsoft solution and stop wasting your valuable time. I use the android version and have been happy with it. Good Luck to you.</div>

            <p>Thanks again. May I ask you two things?</p>
<p>1) when you say "sync notes in different folders". I use one group, named Notes, and after that about 300 Notes (like subfolders). I'm trying to sync only my notebokk with my smartphone. I'm afraid about to some "cutted" data while sync through Google "cloud".
 For example contacts data showed by Samsung soft in my phone, is far feewer than included windows Contact list.</p>
<p>Besides that in a preliminary view of companionlink, they mentioned notes as part of Contacts (Contatc notes), but no mention it as individual (as mail; calendar; tasks; notes; etc.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, pro version, if I read well, is ideal for multiple devices, as, I asume, is for sales group.</p>
<p>2) About 3rd party programs, yesterday I found PhatNotes for Outlook&nbsp;5.4.1, have you tested it? I know that´s not the native NOtes into Outlook, but it seems like it, and could by sync directly between my two devicesvia USB or Bluetooth, not sharing any
 other data.</p>
<p>Wath a mess...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>Hello. I'm not aware of any 3rd party programs that sync OneNote notebooks. The Companionlink will sync native Outlook notes by USB. If you click the USB icon, it will show notes as sync data. The page link&nbsp;defaults to a Google sync and Google does not sync
 notes. I know that the WMDC sync does not do well when data is organized in any&nbsp;way. I just sync recent data to my phone and archive the rest&nbsp;and don't try to organize it. Keep it very simple and it works for me. I think the Companionlink Pro is more for people
 that have complex data that needs to be organized. </p>
<p>I've not tested the PhatNotes but it is a very popular substitute for alot of people. Good Luck.

<h2>            Outlook 2010 will not send&#47;receive email.  Error 0x80048002</h2>
                    Outlook opens but when I click send/receive the green progress bar lower right of screen goes half way, and error message 0x80048002 appears for a few seconds.&nbsp; I have tried reinstalling twice, also turning off AV etc, but this all makes no difference.&nbsp;
 I have also checked all account data etc and it is OK - Outlook 2010 simply refuses to work.

<p>Hi WahyudinKurniawan,</p>
<p>I understand that your Outlook clients create duplicate .ost files automatically and just end up with (2). Please let me know if anything is misunderstood. I’d like to explain that when you specify a new folder location for the offline Outlook Data File
 (.ost), a new file is automatically created. Although it is not required, you can manually move the existing file to the new folder or delete the old one to avoid the download time that is required to re-create the file.</p>
<p>Since you have submitted a Server Request (SR) to Microsoft Support, could you please share the ticket number with me so that I can help you to keep monitoring the case status. By saying “they said to reproduce the issue??”, do you mean that they ask you
 if you can always reproduce the issue? If so, they want to know if all .ost files are duplicated, including newly created .ost files.</p>
<p>I have sent you a private message to collect the SR number. To read it:</p>
<p>1.Go to “Your details” section on the right side of the community site.</p>
<p>2.Click Private messages.</p>
<p>3.Click the subject title (request information) of the response to read the message.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Larry</p>

    <title>Cannot View Worksheet Tabs in Excel 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot View Worksheet Tabs in Excel 2010</h2>
                    Cannot see worksheet tabs in Excel 2010. &nbsp;Not ONE response on this subject as an iota a validity.&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;I have a 12-sheet workbook that I moved from Excel 2003 to Excel 2010 and it was fine.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Then I had to reinstall MS Office 2010 and now I am able to access only ONE worksheet within ANY of my workbooks. &nbsp;</div>
<div>Come on, MS, this should not even be an issue, much less one with no solution. &nbsp;</div>
<div>Give me my worksheet tabs. </div>
                </div>

            All suggestions nonresponsive. &nbsp;Worksheet would not respond to Options process or to PgUp/PgDown. &nbsp;
<div>Best answer: (1) Save original spreadsheet under a back-up name or to a thumb drive -- just in case!</div>
<div>(2) &nbsp;Open a new blank workbook -- call it [Name} New Copy or something similar. &nbsp;This new workbook will have sheet tabs.</div>
<div>(3) &nbsp;Set column widths in new workbook so you won't have to make adjustments later.</div>
<div>(4) &nbsp;In original workbook, copy the worksheet that MS Excel 2010 offers you (scroll across the columns for fastest process</div>
<div>(5) &nbsp;Paste original worksheet into new workbook worksheet; name the worksheet as desired. &nbsp;SAVE</div>
<div>(6) Go back to original worksheet and delete the worksheet you just copied into the new workbook. &nbsp;This will force Excel 2010 to offer you the next worksheet forward or backward in your original workbook.</div>
<div>(7) &nbsp;Repeat steps 4, 5, 6 until you have created a new workbook.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This works. &nbsp;I just did it with a 12-sheet workbook. &nbsp;Microsoft should fix this issue with a working command, but they haven't. &nbsp;This is the best go-around.</div>

<p>Hi Avsar,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The normal.dotm file is the default template of Word for Mac. If you want to save changes to replace the template file, you can’t save it directly when it is opened. You need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Save it as another name, for example, CustomTemplate.dotm. Close the file.</li><li>Go to~ <strong>/Users/&lt;your login name&gt;/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/</strong></li><li>Remove the Normal.dotm</li><li>Rename the CustomTemplate.dotm to Normal.dotm. </li></ol>
<p>If you are not saving the normal.dotm file, but just want to save the current document to a docx and meet the error message, you also can do the steps below to see the result:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quit Word app.</li><li>Go to~ <strong>/Users/&lt;your login name&gt;/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/</strong></li><li>Remove the Normal.dotm</li><li>Relaunch Word app to see if the issue is fixed.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there - I'm having conflict issues with AVG 2015 not allowing Outlook to connect to my xtra.co.nz email account of a pop3 mail server. I am using the same settings for the laptop that I am setting up as is for the desktop that I also use with the same
 configuration of software (without conflicts).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message that I get on the "Test Account Settings" page of the email account settings is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Log onto incoming mail server (POP3): Your e-mail server rejected your longin. verify your user name and password for this account in Account Settings. The server responded: -ERR [AUTH] (#MBR1212) Incorrect username or password."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet this is the same user name and password that I'm currently using on my desk top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no problems logging into other email accounts using outlook - only my xtra account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be welcomed</p>

    <title>SQL statement for concatenating multiple text fields which are not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> futureshock  say:</h3>
<h2>            SQL statement for concatenating multiple text fields which are not null.</h2>
                    I need a sql script to pull data from 20 different fields, where the field is not null.&nbsp; I tried using a nested IIF statement but it will only return one value.&nbsp; There could be multiple answers across these fields.&nbsp; For example one field (named the same
 as the result) might have "school supplies", the next might have "homework assist.", the next "clothing".&nbsp; I want to concatenate each of these in to one field where it would show the results like e.g. "school supplies, homework assist., clothing".&nbsp; The results
 could vary, from previous example, from one answer up to four answers.&nbsp; Please let me know if you need additional information.

            <p>Well first, your question indicates that your database may not be designed properly. Can you give us an example of your table structure?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to concatenate several fields into one, the formula is simple:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nz(field1) + Nz(field2) + Nz(field3), etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Nz function will return a blank if the field is null. By using the + instead of the &amp;, the spaces for blanks will be eliminated.</p>

            <p>My database is like a "catch all" database and very simple. I get a dump of data (only about 130 records&nbsp;by person) and I'm trying clean-up the data so that I merge it in to a form in Word.&nbsp; Currently, the data is hand written, on the form, but it's entered
 in to the system so I'm trying to streamline the process where I can just merge it and I'm done.&nbsp; I need the fields separate because there are check boxes that receive an "X" if the text is not null.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using the Nz function and it will only return the first field of text.&nbsp; If there are two fields with text I need it to return both.&nbsp;

            <p>Ok, so you are working with a dump of data that you have no control over. But I may have misread your question. Are you looking to concatenate values across RECORDS or within a record? If Within a record Nz should work fine., if across records, then you
 need to use a function like the the one here:</p>
<p>http://access.mvps.org/access/modules/mdl0008.htm</p>
<p>
</p><p>But You really didn't answer my question by showing your table structure. It would help us understand what you need and provide an answer.&nbsp;</p>

            Ok that helps. But it doesn't answer the question of whether you are looking to concatenate within a record or across multiple records. Do you want to see what is in school supplies and Hmwk Asst in the same record or do you want to see what's in School
 supplies for ALL records.&nbsp;

            I am looking to concatenate within a record.&nbsp; Each of those fields, within a record, have an x if that was the service performed.&nbsp; One record could have multiple answers e.g. Mary Smith - school supplies, homework assistance and tardies.&nbsp; I want to concatenate
 those answers in to one field where it lists them like "school supplies, homework assistance, tardies". I have the need to list them on the form individually also but they are already separate fields so that's not an issue.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Ok, so what you are saying is you want the FIELDNAME for each field that has an X in it to appear in a comma separated list. Now it makes sense. This would be easier if the data was more normalized, but you can do it with a series of IIFs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>IIF([School Supplies] = "X", "School Supplies, ","") &amp; IIF([HMWK ASST] = "X","Homework Assistant, ","") &amp; IIF([0-5 Tardies] = "X"."0-5 Tardies, ","") etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this will leave an orphan comma at the end but you can eliminate that with a Left() function.</p>

<h2>            Save as PDF Default Permissions</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>We currently use PrimoPDF to save files, but after 2007 with the built-in feature we are thinking of switching to that.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We are wondering what the default permissions of the PDF files are that Word 2007 saves?</strong></p>
<p><strong>We would like to occasionally be able to save the file as an editable PDF, but most commonly we don't want it to be editable.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PrimoPDF allows for comments to be added, graphics and text able to be copied, and the PDF able to be printed. &nbsp;It also allows for the file to be editable, but we have that un-checked so it is not editable. &nbsp;These are the things we would like in
 Word 2007 OR the 2007 Office Save As PDF or XPS add-in (either one works for us)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thanks!</strong></p>

    <title>Windows update failure from 17713.rs5 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows update failure from 17713.rs5</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys, I got stuck with the following issue</p>
<p>- My current version: Build 17713.rs5</p>
<p>- Due to some further issues, I can't use Recovery options: Go back to the previous version of W10</p>
<p>- I tested 17741 (fast) build. It downloaded, installed to some extent, but then I got stacked in the non-finished loop of restart request to finish the installation&nbsp;</p>
<p>- So I cleared the installation and swapped to slow&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Currently, I have downloaded&nbsp;10.0.17744.1003 (rs5_release) and I got the same issue.&nbsp; (see print screen)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help, please, how to advance from 17713 build?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thx&nbsp;in advance Jan&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p />
