<h2>            Xbox 360 error status 8015-1002 questions</h2>
                    
<p>I'm new to these froums so im hoping that this is the right place for this topic.</p>
<p>Over the past few days i have had trouble playing certain online games like Call of Duty Black ops 2 and Battlefield 3. At random times i will get a error message and it will disconnect me from live. I have tried multiple ways of solving this and just yesterday&nbsp;it
 had seemed to be working fine. Today when i turned on my xbox it asked me to download a update which as usual did not go through. When i would accept it just exits and nothing happens. Same thing happens if i say no. I cannot even get close to live and my
 xbox does not recognize any profiles.</p>
<p>Here is my error status report in the testing connection area.</p>
<p>W:0000 - 000B</p>
<p>X:0400 - F001</p>
<p>Y:20A8 - 4800</p>
<p>Z: 8015 - 1002</p>
<p>ID FFFF - FFFF</p>
<p>L: 0015 - 10F1</p>
<p>Q: 0015 -10F1</p>
<p>T: Wired</p>
<p>What are these codes trying to tell me? Is my Xbox or account banned? Am I flagged for&nbsp; a ban? If so how can i tell if&nbsp;I'm banned and for what reason?&nbsp;What am I suppose to do about this right now, not play xbox? Please help.</p>

<p>Hey, welcome to the Forums! &nbsp;Let me make sure I know what's going on. &nbsp;You were having disconnection errors, then after an update you're getting all kinds of new connection errors? &nbsp;There's a few things that can be going on. &nbsp;First off: did the update go
 through properly? &nbsp;Also, what step does the connection test fail on now when you try it? &nbsp;Let us know, and we'll figure this out!</p>

<p>Thanks for responding! </p>
<p>Well over the past few weeks I would be playing games on Live and a message would come up saying some files are missing or corrupt. After I select to restart my consul, the power button would shine a red light. (I have the Xbox 360 slim with the chrome power
 button) &nbsp;Once I restart my Xbox after I receive a message that would ask me to download a system update. The system update would be required to get onto live but yet when I press yes or no it just "minimizes" and I am stuck at my dashboard. This is where I
 currently am.</p>
<p>At this stance when I go to test my connection it fails at the final stage on connecting to live. It suggests restarting my router and all the other things etc. I have done many of the things multiple times with no success. If I press Y for the error codes
 I get the ones I have posted above. </p>
<p>Anything else I should check?</p>

<p>Huuuuuh, OK. Well, next thing I would try would be checking your system for corrupted files and also making sure you have enough free space to download the update. &nbsp;If that doesn't get it behaving, let's try solution 5 here:

<p>Ok I have not checked to see if my system had corrupt files. I have a 250gb hardrive with about 190 gb left of space. I will also try to usb solution asap.</p>
<p>Also is there a part of xbox.com where it shows how to check if your system has corrupt files?</p>

<p>Nah, that wouldn't be on Xbox.com. &nbsp;It's just something you'll see in your system memory- they will have a yellow exclamation point next to them. &nbsp;Fingers crossed that it behaves with that USB!</p>

<p>Does the USB require to be any size? I am still working on that solution. By the way the message I get frequently now is that some files are missing or corrupt and it forces a restart that doesn't work.</p>

<p>Hey saleenseven! That USB can be up to 32GB and at least 1GB. You will need to format it for use with your Xbox 360 console, which you can do taking the steps in this support article on
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">USB flash drive support for Xbox 360</a>!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, can you tell us the exact error message you're seeing there? Do you see any error codes along with the message? And did you get a chance to check for those corrupted files? Let us know!</p>

<p>I have checked for the corrupted files and did not spot any. And other than the network setting error code above I do get 1 other error code when the suggested update fails:</p>
<p>3F4A - 0000 - 3080 - 0300 - D000 - 0185</p>
<p>Also I am not sure if this has anything to do with it but when I get on it cannot find any profiles for a bit. Then it finally pops up and I log in. My slim is about 2-3 years old.</p>

            <p>The last 8 digit in your error code (D000 - 0185) means that a storage device was not found during system update. Turn off your console and remove all storage devices, including your USB memory deivce. <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Learn how to remove an Xbox 360 hard drive</a>.

<p>Ok I have taken out and re-inserted all of my storage devices (all I have is my 250gb hdd) After I restarted the dashboard started up rapidly quicker but I still have the same error codes...anything I should do next? Is my hdd the problem or my 360 the problem
 by being unable to read it?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Start menu not appearing</h2>
                    <p>Have seen hundreds of comments...</p>
<p>I updated to Win10 and Start Menu does not appear. Right clicking on it brings some options.</p>
<p>Cortana was running (I disabled, see below)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried:</p>
<p>1) Updating Windows. My system is up-to-date as of today (August 17, 2015)</p>
<p>2) Powershell in admin mode + Getappinstall something... (copied the command)</p>
<p>3) disabling Cortana</p>
<p>4) disabling graphics card</p>
<p>5) checking in registry the Start Menu or XMALLStart menu (tried both options)</p>
<p>6) changing from small start menu to full page start menu</p>
<p>
</p><p>No option above worked, ever. This is very frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What`s left? I really am not willing to do a clean install, first because of all the setup needed and second because come people said that the problem reappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to Win8 is the only solution?</p>

 out. How sad. The people who do get their computer screwed up, I feel sorry for them.

<h3> adriankomiå„ski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Occasional laggy scrolling on Surface Pro 2017</h2>
                    <p>One of the many problems (...) that I've noticed with Surface Pro 2017 (this generalization being purposeful, since I actually own three units) is that touch scroll occasionally (which the occasion isn't that uncommon) exhibits some strange jitter/lag, as
 shown on my video below (see especially 0:02):</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://youtu.be/J2pG-Wqyyjo</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue goes away after rebooting the machine - sometimes hibernating or even putting it to sleep is enough.&nbsp;All the devices have recent updates and firmware loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone noticed anything similar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. No, I don't use the device with wet or dirty fingers. And no, I don't suffer from Parkinson's disease.</p>

            I agree with your thinking that at this point, MS only will want to replace (after asking you to reimage all 3 and start from scratch). I've emailed an internal contact in the Surface group about your issue. Don't know if/when I might hear back - these guys are all at the MS Ignite Conference so if I do get a response it might be a couple of days. I don't know if the Fall Creator's Update (due out 10/17) will have an impact for you or change the experience. If it were ME, since release is so close, I'd put one of the M3's on Insider's Fast Ring and see if the issue occurs there. https://insider.windows.com/en-us/ 

MS doesn't open tracking tickets unfortunately for consumers.

    <title>Windows app store errors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows app store errors</h2>
                    <p>I have a Toshiba laptop. Windows 8.1</p>
<p>My app store randomly stopped working. If I try installing any apps it gives an error code. The two most common being:&nbsp;</p>
0x80004005<br />
0xc03f300d
<p>I've tried restarting it in the command prompt, clearing the cashe. Clearing temporary internet files. I even had a support guy virually access my computer and it' still not fixed. Halppp. I'm so frustrated. Do i maybe need to upgrade to Windows 10? Or is
 there a way to uninstall it and re-install it?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0224a32-48c8-49b3-9c61-8d456b5925cb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0224a32-48c8-49b3-9c61-8d456b5925cb?upload=true" /></a></p>

<h2>            Load an old version of Photoshop &#40;Photoshop 6&#41; in Windows 7</h2>
                    I have recently bought a new PC running Windows 7. I have old copies of some programs, including Photoshop 6 that I want to use. They do everything I need, so&nbsp;I do not want to pay to&nbsp;upgrade. Photoshop will not load in Windows 7. Can I do anything about
 this?&nbsp;

<p>I believe Photoshop used a 16bit installer up to version 7. A 16bit installer will never run under Windows 7 64 bit, but you have a good chance at running it in<strong> compatibility mode</strong> under Windows 7 32 bit.</p>
<p>If you have a 64 bit version of Windows 7, I believe you will need to run and install&nbsp;<strong>Virtual PC</strong> in&nbsp;<strong>XP Mode</strong> to have any chance of a fully operational 16 bit subsystem. If you are running Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate,
 you can use Windows XP Mode and Virtual PC.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Virtual PC</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx</span></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em>: you cannot run XP Mode on<strong><em> Windows Home editions</em></strong>. If you are using Windows 7 Home Premium, you would need to use<strong><em> Virtual Box</em></strong>,<strong><em> DosBox</em></strong>
 or any other 3rd party virtualization program that works with Home Premium. Please visit forums dedicated to these programs for more information.</p>

            <p>The solution was to uninstall and reinstall the driver for the card reader.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the Microsoft Store. He first asked if I had tested the micro USB card in another device. I had not, BUT, I HAD gotten it to work on my SP4 by using an external card reader attached to the SP4 by USB. &nbsp;So, I knew the micro USB card worked. He tested
 it in his SP4 and it worked there also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, then he uninstalled and reinstalled the driver for the card reader. Unfortunately, I didn't see exactly which device is the card reader, but I believe it had "USB" in the name.</p>

            Ok, so I know this counter-intuitive . . . but have you tried inserting the sd card when the Surface is up and running? I know that we are always told to make connections with the device switched off, but I had the same problem you are reporting until
 I inserted the card into the SP4 fully booted. I have since repeated the operation several times (powered on and off) with the same positve and negative results respectively. Hope this helps. Oh and save a shortcut to the SD card on the desktop and you will
 always have easy access. Hope this helps.

<span>This is my third surface book 2. First two had to be replaced due to hardware problems (usb&nbsp;ports not working, keyboard and touchpad were not working
 etc). This week I received the third device.&nbsp;Guess what! This time I have a detaching problem. Whenever I open Adobe programs it gives a warning and tries to detach the screen. I cannot believe it. I paid overall 3000CHF for this device (plus I had to pay
 180 for support and other costs to transfer my files to new devices) and it lets me down.</span></p>

            Hi riazriazbutt 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Let's first rule out whether the keyboard hardware is an issue or not. Can you use Keyboard tester and press keys to see if the keys are working correctly or not? If keys work as intended, then problem is not the hardware of Keyboard.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html</a>
<br />
<br />If no hardware issue - Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Till your problem is resolved and you need to do urgent and limited typing, use Onscreen Keyboard - Type OSK in Windows Start Search Box (Cortana) &gt; Click On-Screen Keyboard
<br />
<br />2. Run Keyboard Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down and click Keyboard &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall &amp; reinstall Keyboard Driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Keyboards &gt; Right click on Standard PS/2 Keyboard &gt; Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer to reinstall

            We do need the actual DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers were loaded, and what was responsible.<br />
You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
If you are overclocking stop.&nbsp; (chances are if you dont know if you are, you are not)a<br />
To enable us to assist you with your computer's BSOD symptoms, upload the contents of your "\Windows\Minidump" folder.<br />
<br />
The procedure:<br />
* Copy the contents of \Windows\Minidump to another (temporary) location somewhere on your machine.<br />
* Zip up the copy.<br />
* Attach the ZIP archive to your post using the "paperclip" (file attachments) button. (if available on&nbsp; your site, MS doesnt have this)<br />
&nbsp;*Please upload them to a file sharing service like Skydrive or"Rapidshare" and put a link to them in your reply.<br />
Link for how to&nbsp; upload below.<br />
http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive<br />
<br />
To ensure minidumps are enabled:<br />
* Go to Start, in the Search Box type: sysdm.cpl, press Enter.<br />
* Under the Advanced tab, click on the Startup and Recovery Settings... button.<br />
* Ensure that Automatically restart is unchecked.<br />
* Under the Write Debugging Information header select Small memory dump (256 kB) in the dropdown box (the 256kb varies).<br />
* Ensure that the Small Dump Directory is listed as %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
* OK your way out.<br />
* Reboot if changes have been made.

<p>NAT is open, network connection is all fine, youtube and twitch work, games work etc. Just Netflix with the issue.</p>
<p>I tried rebooting the xbox (energy save mode style).</p>
<p>I tried uninstalling the Netflix app and reinstalling.</p>
<p>Hope someone can help.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have received the following error after Win 10 2019 February update when we tried to install our software patch on Win 10:</p>
<p>patch Error:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Error 1309. Error reading from file: C:\Windows\Installer\$PatchCache$\Managed\24199AFB0A233AE4A817C9994D94147B\....&nbsp; &nbsp;Verify that the file exists and that you can access it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue appears to be caused by&nbsp;KB44870717 and KB4100347 windows updates because if we uninstall them our software patch can be installed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have checked the permissions on the file in the $PatchCache$ the error message refers to but SYSTEM has full permission.</p>
<p><br />
Has somebody else experience same or similar issue?</p>
<p>Is it a known issue?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As you said the issue appeared by caused by KB44870717 and KB4100347 windows updates. Similar issue may be faced by some users. I suggest to ignore updates such as KB4100347 (It is for Intel 'cpu's). 
<br />
<br />KB4100347 microcode update is loaded only if you have one of the CPUs supported. 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4100347/intel-microcode-updates-for-windows-10-version-1803-and-windows-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/410034...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But this security update is required for every system:

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS states that issue is fixed in 2019 March update.&nbsp; According to our investigation it appears to be true in most of the cases but not in all cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have received a different error when we tried to <strong>install </strong>
our software <strong>patch after </strong>Win 10 <strong>2019 March update </strong>
<strong>for our application installed after </strong>Win 10 <strong>2019 February update</strong>:</p>
<p>patch Error:</p>
<p>â€œError 1328. Error applying patch to file C:\Config.Msi\PT6C5F.tmp.&nbsp; It has probably been updated by other means, and can no longer be modified by this patch.&nbsp; For more information contact your patch vendor.â€</p>
<div><br />
<p>Our software patch can be installed without any issue after Win 10 2019 March update
</p>
<p>if our application was installed </p>
<p>- before Win 10&nbsp;2019 February Update&nbsp;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>- after Win 10&nbsp;2019 March update.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 FREEZES when automatically reopening apps after restarting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajnicolo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 FREEZES when automatically reopening apps after restarting due to UPDATES.</h2>
                    <p>Take Spotify (desktop player app) for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Spotify preferences set to NOT automatically start Spotify when Windows starts but Windows 10 will open it automatically, anyway, after the system restarts. These restarts are due to Windows Updates but probably have no direct affect on this particular
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PROBLEM:&nbsp; After the system restarts, Windows 10 automatically reopens various apps TOO SOON during Windows Startup and causes a conflict with Windows signing into ONEDRIVE (possibly), for example, and the system FREEZES and I have to power down and try
 it all over again. This time I have to sit through the entire process and watch for the apps to open so I can try to quickly close them before Windows 10 hangs/freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is incredibly aggravating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please resolve this annoying issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi ajnicolo,
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />With that utility, you can right click and delete any startup item in Windows 
<br />
<br />Just be careful not to delete any required process . . .

<p>Thank you but this does not resolve my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have time to run a utility before Windows 10 freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spotify (just one example app) isn't autorunning in this situation - Windows 10 is apparently trying to 'recover' an app and opening the app itself during the loading of Windows after a restart. Apparently it's a new feature of Windows but Windows isn't
 good at doing this, unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have to watch and wait for Windows 10 to open the app during this process and quickly close it, manually, to avoid the inevitable system freeze.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Various apps are open by default because I don't close all open apps every time I step away from my PC and Automatic Windows Updates are meant to happen when my system is idle for the sake of
<em>MY</em> convenience - the intent of which is much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft doesn't fix this issue then I have to manually manage Windows updates so that the system doesn't restart automatically and then close every single running app manually before manually restarting my PC. So I don't get to enjoy having Windows
 10 downloading and installing updates and restarting my system automatically when I'm away in bed or doing something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is a further PROBLEM because Windows Updates are so frequent and already often require some management due to failed updates that this becomes a constant irritation and I feel as though my PC and me work for Microsoft instead of the other way around.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>To troubleshoot try Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot) and/or boot with a Vista DVD.<br />
<br />
To troubleshoot BlueScreens using BlueScreenView and MyEventViewer and other methods see<br />
this thread.</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/c675b7b8-795f-474d-a1c4-6b77b3fcd990" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/c675b7b8-795f-474d-a1c4-6b77b3fcd990</span></a><br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The network drivers are implicated in one of the BlueScreens so update the WiFi, NIC, and if<br />
used the modem drivers - see next message.<br />
<br />
Two primary causes of these blue screen are&nbsp;video drivers and BIOS - Check with System Maker's<br />
Site for Display Adapter (Video) and BIOS and then Device Maker's site for latest Video. It can be<br />
other drivers so check while there. Turn OFF auto-driver installation as those are older and if<br />
Windows Updates suggests a driver just HIDE it. Antivirus is another possibility.<br />
<br />
<strong>See Generic Driver Update Methods and&nbsp;check running Driver Verifier in the next<br />
message.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 8E&nbsp; 0x0000008E is same as 0x1000008E</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>The KERNEL_MODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates that a memory access violation occurred.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enough disk space. </li><li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates.</li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p>If you plan to debug this problem, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2 (the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware installed is listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.</li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.</li></ul>
<p>If the bug check message lists a driver by name , disable or remove that driver. Also, disable or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file
 system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you have to start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the system by using the Recovery Console and then deleting
 the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x1E. You can disable memory caching of the BIOS to try to resolve the error. You should also run
 hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies. For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows
 installation that are associated with lack of disk space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and<em>.chk</em>files
 that contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more free space for the installation.</p>
<p>You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version</p>

            <p>I already have Windows 10. I am having several problems with Outlook 15 but this problem relates to my HP printer only. It has tried to download and&nbsp;install every day -&nbsp;unsuccessfully. The printer seems to work OK, but I guess&nbsp;the drivers/facilities etc
 are not updated? I am getting a bit fed up with these update error messages.</p>
<p>

</p><p>This worked for me, the key was to remove my printer in "Devices and Printers", which also removed the "unknown printer" in Device Manager. I then re-installed it and, when I reran Windows Update, the problem update went away. Hope this works for you.</p>

    <title>Xbox app fails to connect or sign in &#40;0x80131509&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox app fails to connect or sign in &#40;0x80131509&#41;</h2>
                    <p /><p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>



<p>I see lots of variations of 
what seems like the same issue but people are getting different 
solutions. In my case, I've tried all the solutions I <strong>see </strong>posted and 
none of them have worked. I hate to make a post that looks like more of 
the same, but just in case someone has the same thing and managed to fix
 it, here's my story: 
</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>------------ cross-post from <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/games_windows_10/xbox-app-fails-to-connect-or-sign-in-0x80131509/6592aae4-5099-482c-a0e5-777ae4a63c49">answers.microsoft</a> site--------------------<br /></strong></p><p>This is an issue with the game:&nbsp;</p><p>Age of Empires: Definitive Edition<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Windows <strong>version</strong>:&nbsp;</p><p>Windows 10 
Enterprise 2016 LTSB - completely fresh install, I installed the OS over
 the weekend and then installed the game once set up. Not really 
anything else running on it yet, no 3rd party anti-virus or 
modifications
 or optimizations made.<br /></p>



<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong></p><p>The game loads and goes through the title screens, then on the menu it says I must
<em>sign in to continue</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>If click Sign In: dialog box disappears for a split second, you hear the default â€œerrorâ€ noise, and it reappears instantly.<br /></p>



<p>If click Exit: the whole game shuts down.<br /></p>



<p><br /></p>

<p>I then open the Xbox app to try and sign in there. It fails to sign in or even connect.
<br /></p>



<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Error code: <br /></strong></p><p>(0x409) 0x80131509 from xbox app; no error code in the game<br /></p>



<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Some of the things Iâ€™ve tried:</strong> <br /></p>



<ul><li>Running as a local user, a Microsoft account user, an admin, a standard user, etc.
</li><li>Completely disabled firewall and virus scanning by Windows. </li><li>Ran the Windows App Troubleshooter: per 
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.microsoft</a></li><li>Performed the 5 suggested solutions found on this blog: 
<a href="https://windowsreport.com/xbox-app-windows-10-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">xbox windows app problems</a>:
<ul><li>Keep Windows 10 up to date</li><li>Reinstall the Xbox app</li><li>Clear Windows Store cache</li><li>Change regional settings</li><li>Enable the Xbox app from Services</li><li>Run SFC scan</li></ul>
</li><li>Checked this troubleshooting recommendation from Microsoft: 
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/games_windows_10/troublshoot-error-0x409-0x80070422-on-xbox-app/77e2180a-d250-40f0-b2ac-e6db925656d4">answers.microsoft</a></li><li>Submitted my <strong>DxDiag </strong>file, <strong>StoreLogs</strong>&nbsp;file,
<strong>StartupLog</strong> file, and <strong>Event Viewer</strong>
 file to the support team of the game. They're just sending me links to 
Microsoft support articles so I guess they didn't find anything specific
 in the
 logs. </li></ul>



<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Screenshots:</strong><br /></p>



<ul><li>In the game, I cannot get past this sign-in screen: [gif] <a href="https://gyazo.com/90fd540c6b0db54ed82bfa843d5bbe18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gyazo.com/90fd540c6b0db54ed82bfa843d5bbe18</a></li><li>Similar behavior in the xbox app: [gif]&nbsp;<a href="https://gyazo.com/18d9ce46d475318acd86be1de6a79760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gyazo.com/18d9ce46d475318acd86be1de6a79760</a></li></ul><p><br /></p>



<p><br /></p>

<p>Note
 that the Windows Store app is working fine. I purchased the game 
through there, and also installed other free apps like Netflix for 
example and those work fine. This is (probably) specific to making a 
connection to xbox services,
 even though it says they are running. <br /></p>



<p><br /></p>

<p>Hopefully this is specific enough :)<br /></p><br />

                    <p>I upgraded my PC and it has W7 Pro.&nbsp; In XP Pro the file syncronisation worked automatically once set up between my PC and NAS.</p>
<p>Syncronisation does not work in W7!</p>
<p>I have tried Sync Centre, but the files are not visible when I am unattached to the network.&nbsp; The only way I work is to do a xcopy between devices.&nbsp; This is slow and I need to remember to do it.</p>
<p>How do you remove, or neuter sync centre so the partnership created is gone, and no actions are take.&nbsp; The help screens only mention Media Devices.&nbsp; I want to totally disable Sync Centre so I can try Synctoy.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to end a sync partnership:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Sync Center by clicking the Start button, clicking All Programs.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Accessories, and then click Sync Center.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click the sync partnership that you want to end, and then click Delete.</span></p>
<p><span>Notes</span></p>
<p><span>â€¢Some sync partnerships might not offer an option to delete the partnership. If they don't have this option, try opening the
 program or location where you set up the sync partnership to see if you can turn it off or delete it using that program or location.</span></p>
<p><span>â€¢If you just want to stop a current sync in progress, do not follow the steps above, which will permanently end the sync partnership.
 Instead, right-click the sync partnership, and then click Stop sync with</span><span>â€</span><span> partnership
 name. The sync partnership will sync again at</span><span> the next scheduled time.</span></p>
<p><span>â€¢Deleting a sync partnership rarely deletes any files or other information. It only ends the sync partnership. If you delete
 a sync partnership, it should warn you first before it delete files or other information.</span></p>

    <title>All of my games are crashing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mckernan  say:</h3>
<h2>            All of my games are crashing</h2>
                    Hi, any help would be very appreciated.
<div>I have taken an Acer Aspire M5811 apart and done an overhaul on alot of the parts in order to run demanding new games on ultra settings.</div>
<div>All of the games work, but all of them crash after random times, sometimes 2 minutes, sometimes an hour.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To facilitate testing though, i've been primarily using the game "Mirror's Edge" to serve as an example as it is giving me the worst results and the most constant amount of play time before crashing (never more than 5 - 10minutes).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>my hardware is as follows;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-OS is Windows 7 Home edition 64Bit with service pack 1 installed and all updates done up to todays date.</div>
<div>-Intel h57 express chipset (driver version installed is 9.3.0.1020)</div>
<div>-intel core i5 CPU, 650 @ 3.20GHz &nbsp; 3.20GHz</div>
<div>-8GB of DDR3 RAM 1333MHz in 3 sticks, 2 x 2gb and 1 x 4gb, all of which have latency times of 9-9-9-24 @1.5v</div>
<div>-i have 1 x sata 1tb 7200rpm HDD that has windows installed, and 1 x 200gb sata 7200rpm HDD (RAID driver installed is 10.8.0.1003)</div>
<div>-750w Corsair PSU with 1 rail supporting up to 60 amps</div>
<div>-GTX 560 Ti by MSI, the TWIN FROZR II model with 2gb of GDDR5 and factory overclocked. (Driver installed is 8.17.13.142)</div>
<div>-onboard Realtek high definition audio (driver is 6.0.1.6526)</div>
<div>-JMicron JMB36X Controller (Driver is 1.17.53.0)</div>
<div>-I'm using a 1920 x 1080 42"tv as a monitor and have all games set to the same resolution, however windows is set to 1842 x 1036 in order to fit on the screen.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>now, i have tried absolutely everything, and i am out of ideas on how to fix this,</div>
<div>firstly, what i have tried;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>RAM(NEW):</div>
<div>-tried booting with one stick of ram at a time, always same issues</div>
<div>-never have issues in windows programs, only games</div>
<div>-never slowdowns</div>
<div>-windows recognizes all of the sticks appropriately</div>
<div>-reseated different sticks into every possible slot combination</div>
<div>-ran memtest86 for 6 hours, no issues were found</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Motherboard and Processor(existing)</div>
<div>-reseated processor</div>
<div>-reseated ram</div>
<div>-reseated video card</div>
<div>-unplugged and re-plugged all connections to insure they were locked in properly.</div>
<div>-flashed and updated the bios</div>
<div>-attempted returning bios to default settings</div>
<div>-insured bios recognized all installed hardware</div>
<div>-stress tested with OCCT benchmark tool, under 100% load processor cores never passed 51 degrees</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Video Card (NEW)</div>
<div>-ran 2 different benchmark programs to try and force a crash, furmark (heat stress testing) and OCCT (heat, PSU, and graphical error reporting)</div>
<div>-both programs ran for 15 minutes on full screen and did not have any issues.</div>
<div>-this video card has an extremely good heatsink, ruling out over heating. The GPU temp never went over 44 degrees while under a 100% load</div>
<div>-tested videocard in a friends tower and did not experience issues.</div>
<div>-games run smoothly without any tears or particles, they just stop responding all of a sudden</div>
<div>-I followed one users advice and reduced the clock speeds slightly, yet it still crashed, so currently clock speeds have been returned to factory settings.</div>
<div>-I followed another user of the exact model video card who claimed the GPU could cause instability because the voltage is set too low(1 volt) and claimed that for him, an increase to 1.037V solved his problem. Tried it, didn't work, also returned to factory
 settings. (not to mention success in furmark contradicts this).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PSU(NEW)</div>
<div>-Benchmark tested PSU with OCCT and Furmark and all results were normal.</div>
<div>-tested in a friends computer with no issues</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>OS(existing)</div>
<div>-attempted rolling back all drivers one by one and testing each time</div>
<div>-all drivers are up to date, windows is completely up to date</div>
<div>-attempted clean boot, but experienced the same problem</div>
<div>-windows DOES NOT crash when the game crashes, ctrl-alt-del works and the task manager kills the application without question.</div>
<div>-problem is encountered on every game installed</div>
<div>-while in game, even though the app crashes, music continues to play until i kill it</div>
<div>-attempted playing with sounds in windows disabled, still crashed</div>
<div>-all devices according to device manager are installed correctly, and all of them do not have available updates.</div>
<div>-OS has been freshly installed for the first time with this current hardware, so this should not be linked to registry problems</div>
<div>-DO NOT have ANY anti-virus, anti-malware, spyware etc installed whatsoever.</div>
<div>-attempted playing games at various resolutions, same problem.</div>
<div>-crashes do not result in BSoD</div>
<div>-all applications with a 64-BIT version have been installed in that fashion</div>
<div>-i have tried using the appropriate windows automatic repair tool on the website</div>
<div>-everytime i removed a driver i used Phyxion's Driver Sweeper to ensure there were no reminents before &nbsp;installing another version.</div>
<div>-i have also attempted running a file scan in the windows cmd, it doesn't find any problems, and it doesn't fix anything.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I think that covers everything,</div>
<div>the error i get is;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"the application is not responding"</div>
<div>with the option to either close program, or allow windows to look for a solution and then close program.</div>
<div>-i have tried the look for solution option several times.</div>
<div><br />

</div>
<div>By process of elimination i have determined that there is no hardware issue, and it's most likely not a driver issue as i have spent hours alternating them,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>please respond, i have searched and searched and searched and tried everything, yet still a problem.</div>
<div>i tried to make my specs and tests i've done as clear as possible in order to facilitate possible solutions.</div>

            Hi Mckernan,<br />
<br />
1. Does the issue occur while playing any particular games or all the games?<br />
2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
3. What is the exact and complete error message you get when the game crashes?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the steps from the following links:<br />
<b><span><br />
<strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong></span></b><strong><span>Game crashes or closes unexpectedly</span></strong><span><br />

<br />
</span><span>I would also suggest you to prove event viewer information.<br />

            thanks for the response,
<div>to answer your questions;</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. it happens in all games, as i explained</div>
<div>2. yes there were changes, as i marked above, there is new hardware, next to each part i put in brackets either (new) or (existing), meaning the part is either newly installed or was in existing working condition before the upgrades</div>
<div>3.i posted the complete error message i get already, in case you missed that in my previous post its;</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>
"the application is not responding"</div>
<div>
with the option to either close program, or allow windows to look for a solution and then close program.</div>
<div>
-i have tried the look for solution option several times.</div>

<div>i have already attempted everything in methods 1 and 2 in your response,</div>
<div>i'm not entirely sure how to fetch the information your asking for in method 3,</div>
<div><br />
<div>in event viewer, at least from what i have seen, the errors are registered but dont give detailed information like i've already provided. it just says the app was caught hanging,unless i'm missing something there.</div>
