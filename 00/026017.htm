<h2>            PPT Spanish spell check</h2>
                    I have a series of documents written in Spanish from a PPT document previously written PPT template. I suspect the template is in English because every time I try to spell check the slides it brings me to the US English dictionary even after choosing Spanish
 as the spell language. Is there a way to correct the template. Thanks

            <p>It's possible, though extraordinarily tedious, to change languages once the presentation's been created.</p>
<p>I've got an add-in for Windows PPT that's not yet released; I'd be happy to turn it loose on one of your existing PowerPoint presentation files and on the template if you'd like to send me a copy of each.</p>
<p>If so:</p>
<p>Copy and paste our conversation here into the body of the email.</p>
<p>Mention which "flavor" of Spanish you need ... there are around 20 variants, including two for Spanish/Spain (modern vs traditional sort).</p>
<p>Attach the files</p>

<h2>            CMD Ctrl&#43;C, Ctrl&#43;V feature breaks after installing VMWare Tools</h2>
                    <p>Installed Windows 10 on VMWare Fusion 6 at MacBook Pro early 2011.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feature with Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V in CMD works perfectly. After installing VMWare tools i had more productive system and norman graphics, but this feature was broked. As in Win8 it's just putting ^V to command line when i press Ctrl+V and don't copy by Ctrl+C.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed Windows 10 also to other VMWare on Windows without VMWare tools - feature works perfectly. So i'm afraid to install VMWare Tools now. Is it Windows bug or VMWare Tools bug?</p>

<h3> allanaxelrod  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onenote2013 Equation Editor PHI</h2>
                    When in the equation editor, the command \phi is meant to create an italicized lower case phi symbol, matching the default italicized font of the editor. &nbsp;However, after the first few entries, the 2013 Onenote equation editor uses the unitalicized symbol.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I use Onenote as my research and course notebook, and such small issues such as these can cause confusion when referring back to the notebook.</div>

            <p>I have the same issue. I found it is italic when you type a space after the command but not italic if you immediately start typing another command. For example, \phi\phi&lt;space&gt; will produce first a non-italic phi then an italic phi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the same font: Cambria Math, Size 11 and it occurs while in Equation Editor. I started having this problem when I upgraded to OneNote2013. In OneNote2010 \phi\phi&lt;space&gt; would produce two italic phi's. I use Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this isn't too late to reply, but this issue frequently bothers me and I would love to see it fixed.</p>

<h3> markalfredclarkson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows10 Update SNAFU</h2>
                    <p><span><span>Windows10 major update yesterday. Lumia phone running Windows no longer recognised by Win10. WTF does Microsoft keep doing this? It is a WINDOWS phone for F**ks sake. Compatibility with Windows devices should be a integral part of every Windows
 update. Not happy Bill.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>See also that now files can't be synced with One Drive. WTF does Microsoft release half-baked updates? Haven't got Quality Assurance?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>See the attached screen shot. Oh, you can't. No capacity on this blog to add media. There are no error messages for the Lumia. Win10 just pretends it does not exist. It is plugged in, and was recognised before the last Win10 update. This is the
 third time this year that Win 10 updates have caused problems with the Lumia not being recognised. The Files to which the OneDrive error message refers are the 30 or so music files I had on OneDrive, and which worked perfectly before the last Win10 update.
 Microsoft asked me what trouble shooting have I tried? None. Don't intend to do any. Sick to death of Microsoft SNAFUs. Last time I fixed the Lumia issue, it took a day and Microsoft (as usual) did not have a clue, what was wrong or how to fix the problem.
 At that time, a Google Search showed it is quite a common reoccurring issue, and an entry on the many Blogs I read told me how to fix it, and following those steps I got it resolved at that time. Really do not want to spend another day rebuilding functionality
 between the Lumia and Win10 every time 'Big Bill' sends me a computer destroying update.&nbsp; Am going to use iSpring Cloud for storage, and throw the Lumia in the bin and buy an Android. I am too busy, and really over this ****.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Anyone else getting this problem, or is Big Bill just picking on me?</span></span></p>

<p>Dear Microsoft</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read my article: 'Why no one should ever buy a Windows Phone', <em>LinkedIn</em> 16 June 2017 &lt;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-one-should-ever-buy-windows-phone-mark-clarkson&gt;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What â€˜trouble shootingâ€™ have I tried? None. Don't intend to do any. Sick to death of Microsoft SNAFUs. Not my job to road-test Microsoft products. Last time I fixed this Lumia issue, it took a whole day and Microsoft (as usual) did not have a clue â€“ they
 do not what is wrong, and do not know how to fix the problem. A Google search shows it is quite a common and endlessly reoccurring issue. Last time, an entry on the many Blogs I read told me how to fix it, and following those steps I got it resolved. Am I
 going to spend another whole day chasing down a solution to this problem? No! Why not? Because I have every confidence that the next Win10 update will again cause the same problem. Why? Because Microsoft has no commitment to Quality Assurance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, David Curry, from <em>readwrite</em> says Microsoft is planning a major 'upgrade' to Win10 later this year that is going to turn Windows 10 PCs into smart home hubs: &lt;https://readwrite.com/2017/05/12/microsoft-homehub/?utm_source=Boomtrain&amp;bt_alias=eyJ1c2VySWQiOiAiNDE0NWViZjAtNWQwZC00NmE1LThhMDMtOTE4ZTE4ODE3ZDQ3In0%3D&amp;utm_campaign=20170620%3Futm_source%3Dnewsletter&amp;utm_medium=Email&gt;.
 Bet that does not work out well for all us suckers who have to take compulsory Win10 updates, so we can road-test products for 'Big Bill'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The immediate answer? Buy any phone that is not a Windows Phone. The long term answer? Pray someone invents a better OS than Win10 - or any OS where they at least have a commitment to Quality Assurance.</p>

<h2>            How do I retrieve my old contacts in the new Windows 10 mail without have to retype them back in my scratch&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How do I retrieve my old contacts in the new Windows 10 mail without have to retype them back in my scratch?</p>
<p>I saved my old contacts list from my old PC to my new Windows 10 PC in the Contacts folder, but when I open up the mail
</p>
<p>app it can not find them. Where is the option to import contacts from that folder. I'm too lazy to retype them in by scratch and I won't do that either. If you can't do this then I will be using Mozilla Thunderbird which IMO 100% better than windows mail.</p>

                    I am seeing a bunch of clicks for which Bing is charging me that result in an average session duration of 2 seconds or less. No human has time to evaluate a page and exit within 2 seconds. This certainly seems scammy. What could be causing this?

            <p>Hi, KennethVogt! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your question! </p>
<p>
</p><p>We categorize clicks into three options: </p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Quality</li><li>Low-Quality</li><li>Invalid</li></ul>
<p>A click such as the one you described would fall into either the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
low-quality</span> category or the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">invalid</span> category. Although we cannot determine exactly how or why these clicks generate, we can use our&nbsp;systematic filters to catch&nbsp;and categorize these types of clicks.&nbsp;We recognize
 that these clicks are a very serious circumstance for advertisers, which is why&nbsp;Bing Ads uses real-time and post-click systems to help guard against clicks such as these to ensure your experience as an advertiser is a pleasant one. If clicks such as these
 are detected, our Traffic Quality team can flag the case and examine all accrued and highlighted data to validate these clicks are indeed low-quality or invalid, and issue refunds when appropriate.

    <title>Excel 2010 not responsive after macro completes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steven devaney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 not responsive after macro completes</h2>
                    <p>I have an Excel VBA macro that populates the current worksheet with data extracted from a database.</p>
<p>All looks fine.</p>
<p>It seems that when a PC (Win7) is booted up and someone logs in and starts Excel before all the system tray applications complete their initialisation processes (most visual is Symantic Endpoint Protection) then the macro is run and it populates the worksheet
 correctly. Then it crashes with "Program not responding".</p>
<p>The number of cells being populated is only about 100. The calculations are not complex.</p>
<p>I have compared the peformance monitor counters for the Excel process for the occasions when it crashes and when it works and they are very similar. I have also compared other counters (primarily memory counters) and all seem similar.</p>
<p>When I step through the code the failure does not happen.</p>
<p>I have put a debug msgbox as the penultimate line (the last one is Exit sub) and the msgbox does appear. When running this varient, it crashes after pressing the OK button.</p>
<p>The macro does include a class object event handler and it has an array (5000, 1) as string - the string length is&nbsp;not more than&nbsp;six characters. It also contains two user forms for logging into the database and setting criteria for data extract.</p>
<p>The total file size is 900KB. There are no graphs, charts or graphic objects at all.</p>
<p>This has failed on different PCs but they all should be approximately identical as this company has a standard installation process. It has also worked very well on different PCs.</p>
<p>When a failure has happened, restarting Excel does not help. Nor does a logout. The whole PC has to be restarted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anybody have any suggestions as to what I could do next?</p>

            At first try the code under normal conditions, when the PC is completely started. Close all unnecessary programs, e.g. Outlook etc.<br />
<br />
Open the task manager and take a look in the process list, sort that list by CPU and run your macro. Then you can see which other processes runs.<br />
<br />
After you get a feeling what's normal, try the same immediately after the boot until Excel shows "Not responding".<br />
<br />
I guess there is another process that <span>
<span>prevents that the macro can continue, I guess that process needs some CPU time. Kill that process (and maybe others) and see if Excel, resp. macro goes back to work.<br />
<br />
Another idea is that a process shuts down and reestablish the connection to the database...<br />

            <p>I would think if you deleted the .exd files in XP, then the workbook would work in XP but it would be cumbersome moving back and forth to newer versions (where the faulty update had been applied) where the fix would need to be performed again.&nbsp; Untested,
 but that is the impression I get from the information I have seen on this problem. &nbsp;

            Have you gone to the support site of the maker of your scanner for updated software/drivers, as this is the forum for testing newer builds of Windows 10 before being released to the Public and isn't a general support site for the Public builds of Windows
 10.

<p>Two or three things here Alan. 1607 is a version number not a build.</p>
<p>Go Settings, System, About and tell us what version and build you are on now. Plus which make and model of computer you have.</p>
<p>Second tell us what make and model of scanner you have, and what attempts you have tried.</p>
<p>Third this is the Insider forum for testing Windows 10 Insider builds. You should be here.</p>

<p>If you search and read these forums you will see that there are problems for many people with scanner software drivers. Mostly though it is the Insider builds and not the release builds that you and I have. My scanner software is removed with every new build
 and I have to reinstall it. If you have tried HP for up to date drivers and tried compatibility mode.</p>
<p>(Right click the driver application file and choose Troubleshoot Compatibility.) then post your problem in Feedback Hub.</p>
<p>If you have any more problems: as Joe and I have said, post them in the Windows 10 forums not the Insider forums please?</p>

<h2>            Outlook 15.11 - messages still bold after they have been read</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since the update to Outlook 15.11 I have had all sorts of problems, most notably the hourly (or more frequent) crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most frustrating thing is that many messages are still bold after they have been read. This lasts until I restart Outlook. I try to "mark as read" but Outlook thinks they have already been marked as read so it won't let me try that option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a fix for this? &nbsp;Or is it a bug waiting for a new update? &nbsp;I had to uninstall the 15.11.2 update as it crashed every two minutes....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jason</p>

            <p>Same here, and time to time, it crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that it crashes when Outlook canÂ´t connect to X mail server, for example if you lost wifi, and it tries automatically to connect, so it gets a timeout but the circle never stops and it hangs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of problems for me, more than 10 crashes a day, is a pity that Outlook now become this... IÂ´m a Office user and I translated my office apps to mac, but surely the Microsoft development department is more interested in Windows issues than mac...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope they really fix this, in Mac 2011 didnÂ´t have any kind of this problems, as well, they deleted the option to choose which mail accounts needs to be sync or not (if you prush the F9 or send/receive button).</p>
<p>
</p><p>An of course the request read receipt very important!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really canÂ´t understand where they try to guide the new Outlook 2016 without "BASIC" functions... any other email client (and cheaper) can do this and more in a Mac...</p>
<p>

            <p>It's crashing more than 10 times a day for me. I'd say about once every half hour. Sometimes it starts up, crashes, and then starts up again successfully. Thankfully it saves my work otherwise I would have no choice but to abandon the software immediately.
 Now it's just an annoyance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there isn't an update fix soon I may finally have to migrate over to Mac Mail. I've been using Entourage/Outlook for well over a decade but if it isn't reliable I won't have much choice.</p>

</p><p>Kindly review if any bugs on MS Excel&nbsp;or please suggest the best solution if I would like to avoid to do manual calculations as shown in column T. (Please ignore line 2 - 3, there's only one item on that customer.)</p>

<p>
</p><p>You need to change the format of your cells that contain the totals so that they display correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Home Tab, Number group, click the little arrow in the bottom right corner</p>
<p>Then on the Number tab, click Custom, and in the Type field enter hh:mm:ss</p>

</p><p><span>Thank you for your&nbsp;respond. I knew about the format&nbsp;cell HH:MM:SS&nbsp;and tried in prior, it doesn't work.&nbsp;I also try to use formula TEXT. For example,
 =TEXT(SUM(S3:S8),"hh:mm:ss").&nbsp; It doesn't work since excel turns value as 0 for function data subtotal or sum. It&nbsp;will be&nbsp;work with plus such as =S3+S4+S5+S6+S7+S8.

 you may see the difference?</span></p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer image below:</p>
<p>Rows A1:G8 are simply copy/pasted from your last post. Formulas in row 9 are:</p>
<p>E9:&nbsp;=SUBTOTAL(9,E3:E8)</p>
<p>F9:&nbsp;=SUM(F3:F8)</p>
<p>G9:&nbsp;=G3+G4+G5+G6+G7+G8</p>
<p>
</p><p>E9:G9 are formatted as Custom hh:mm:ss</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check, I reproduced the data again at A12:G19 but reentered the values and formulas to ensure they were being treated as times (apologies my regional settings turn the dates around).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So C14:C19 are date/times, formatted as dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm (note seconds not showing)</p>
<p>E14:G19 are formatted as hh:mm:ss</p>
<p>Formula in E14 is =$D14-$C14, and copied to range E14:G19</p>
<p>Formulas and formats in E20:G20 are as above for E9:G9</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Excel 2013.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I redo my task on new worksheet&nbsp;by follow your instruction which I have done that before. I can see that works with your computer but somehow it doesn't work with my computers at our office. I tried the same way with 3 difference PC in my&nbsp;office.&nbsp;It has
 given the same result.&nbsp;This make me feel like this&nbsp;is&nbsp;an issue&nbsp;with setup at "excel options" in advance setup but I couldn't figure out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the evident&nbsp;of&nbsp;2 difference views! </p>
<p>Picture I- show formulas in cells instead of their calculated results.</p>

<p>E9:G9 has been formatted as HH:MM:SS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please advise any&nbsp;advance&nbsp;setup that I should have done at excel option. I'm using Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013.

            <p>It looks like your figures in the duration columns (E-G) are formatted as text fields - note how they are justified to the left, whereas in my example above they are justified to the right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this: Select any empty cell and confirm that it is formatted as General. Enter a 1 into that cell, then copy it. Select the range E3:G8, then click the small arrow under the Paste button and click Paste Special. Select 'Multiply' in the Operation area,
 then click OK.</p>

<h2>            How to import csv file into a room calendar</h2>
                    
<p><span>i'm attempting to import csv calendar records (no option to make .pst ) into a room calendar in office 365 for education. i have followed a number of threads. converted the room
 mailbox to shared. all appears to work to import but the text calendar entry does not appear in the target calendar or any other calendar that i can tell. i've attached snippets from the process. the "capture" shows the "import a file" window with the target,
 shared calendar llc cl1 in the background. capture 2 shows the next window in the import process with calendar cl1 selected as the destination folder. capture 3 shows the "finish" window. upon clicking submit a small window opens showing the import process
 and indicating completion in a couple of seconds (there's only 1 test entry).</span></p>

<p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>Based on your description, I understand you import a calendar CSV file into your shared mailbox, but the calendar entries do not show up in the calendar.</p>
<p>To test whether the issue is related to the CSV file, can you see the entries if you open the CSV file directly?</p>
<p>If yes, you can create a new test calendar under your main calendar and import the CSV file to the test calendar to see if the issue is related to the shared calendar.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and efforts.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Robert</p>

<p><span><span>Thanks for posting the thread on our forum.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There may be no direct way migrating old usersâ€™ content to new usersâ€™ content. Iâ€™m afraid that you may need to sync the content from the old
 OneDrive for Business libraries to the new OneDrive for Business libraries with the OneDrive sync clients first and then upload the synced content to the new OneDrive for Business libraries as a migration way.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also search some third-party migration tools to see if they can provide a quicker way for the migration process.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks for your understanding.</span></span></p>

    <title>Can&#39;t view forwarded content in the body of an email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruth12smith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t view forwarded content in the body of an email</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping someone can help me with the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I received a forwarded message from one particular colleague I can see the new text that they've written but not the forwarded part of the message which should also be in the body of the email. I can see the whole email including the forwarded portion
 on my iPhone - but it's doesn't appear in the email when I open it in outlook. I'm using Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus. There is nothing on the page to expand the content - no dots, chevrons, etc and the HTML cuts out at the end of the displayed text so it's
 not the white font issue suggested in one of the help posts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Ruth</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear this is happening.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>1) As a first step to troubleshooting this, can you please try to clear your browser cache/cookies as this may help resolve your issue.<br />
<br />
Here's how to clear the browser cache/cookies: &nbsp;(you need to clear ALL cookies)<br />
<br />
*For Internet Explorer browser: Press CTRL+SHIFT+DEL simultaneously and click Delete<br />
*For Google Chrome: Press CTRL+SHIFT+DEL simultaneously and click Clear Browsing Data<br />
*For Firefox: Press CTRL+SHIFT+DEL simultaneously and click Clear Now<br />
(other browsers are similar)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2) Do you know if this particular sender is in your safe sender's list? If not include his/her email on that list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) What is the content of that body (as shown in your iphone)? Is it an image or plain text? Is there somewhere on Outlook.com on your browser where it says "Show content" when you open that email?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

<p>I followed steps suggested, but this didn't seem to have any impact, selecting the repair option resulted in a low disk space warning, though the drive had more than sufficient space.</p>
<p>I therefore deleted the OneDrive folder (local PC) then re-synced</p>
<p>This appears to have cured the problem </p>

<h2>            Why Outlook&#39;s Spam filtering is so bad&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The least I can say is that Outlook spam filtering is so bad that I had to create some rules to eliminate the Viagra and **** offers. I have more than 150 rules but Outlook still doesn't get that I don't want to receive offers for Viagra and ****.</p>
<p>Lately, I have been receiving some spams coming from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, so I decided to trash directly all the emails coming from "@emal.com". Unfortunately, I still receive spams from that mail extension. There's no object so my guess is that I had to do
 it this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone found a better solution for the unbelievbly poor quality of MSN spam filtering?</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>How do you access Outlook.com? Is it through a Web Browser or an Email Client?</span></li><li><span>Are you referring to the Outlook.com Web Access or MSN email client?&nbsp;</span></li></ol>

<p>
</p><p><span>Also, I would suggest you to set your Junk email filter to Exclusive. If the Exclusive level was set, messages from senders not on your Contacts or Safe Senders lists will be sent to the Junk folder. By default, the Junk folder will automatically delete
 messages after 10 days. This is more convenient as we don't have any control if senders are randomly changing their address. Follow the steps below on how to set to Exclusive and check if this helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Sign in to your Outlook.com account.</li><li>Click cog or gear icon then select Options.</li><li><span>Under preventing junk email, click Filters and reporting.</span></li><li><span>Under Choose a junk email filter, select Exclusive.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Hope this answers your query and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.</span></p>

            Yes it Oulook.com web access. I have tried the different Outlook and there was no improvement whatsoever. I already followed the steps and it doesn't change the quantity of spam I receive. At one point, it's MSN's job to handle the issue but I don't know
 why they are refusing. When an email has Viagra, ****, F*ckbuddy, I don't even know why it's not blocked directly.

            <p>I'm an OWA user (not by choice), and count me as one more person who finds Microsoft's spam filtering to be extremely poor. And the answer on this forum isn't much help either, since the problem for me is more about false-positives. Spam filtering is basically
 useless if it continues to get false-positives even after training for months, since it means you still have to go back and look at all the spam emails in your Junk folder anyway to find the ones that shouldn't be there. And the whole point of spam filtering
 is (or should be) to relieve the user of having to look at a bunch of stupid spam messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As best I can tell, when you mark something as junk or not junk in OWA, it only takes into account a few simple characteristics of the message (I'd guess just the
<em>From</em> address or something) so when for example emails are coming from email lists where the sender name might be different every time, training it just doesn't seem to work. This extends as well to messages generated by my own company's Wordpress forms,
 so some queries from our customers continue to get filtered as junk regardless of how many times I click "not junk" on that type of message. Maybe I could whitelist it somehow but I shouldn't have to -- the messages all have the same format and From: server,
 you'd think the thing could figure it out after a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having to trawl through a load of junk email every day can get long and tedious since I have a lot of spams, having a common name as my email address. So in desperation I tried creating rules to delete messages that come from some of the more prolific common
 spammers hoping that at least some would be filtered from my junk folder; that&nbsp; way at least I'd have less spam to troll through when checking for false-positives. But no such luck -- when I create such rules, the spam filter catches it first and sticks them
 in Junk so I have to through all of them regardless.<br />
</p>
<p>I started using OWA after our division was made to change from Google business email to Outlook (for reasons that aren't relevant here.) Gmail worked very well and trains intelligently, and after a couple of months it would only very rarely get a false-positive
 or negative. The difference is striking after changing to OWA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Postscript: Ha, ha this is hilarious. After signing up to this forum just so I can post, I received a "Welcome to the Microsoft Community" email -- which OWA sent directly to my Junk folder! I love that Microsoft wants to flag its own legitimate emails as
 spam.</p>

            <p>Setting everything to Junk does not help. &nbsp;What happens is all emails, good and bad will go to Junk. &nbsp;Every day, I go through over 100 emails in Junk to look for a good email I may have missed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When everything goes to Junk, my rules do not work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The rules under hotmail used to work pretty good where the rules can filter out emails BEFORE it goes to Junk. &nbsp;Now, every email not in my safe contact list is going to Junk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, please change to allow the rules to process BEFORE the Junk exclusive setting. &nbsp;This used to be the case with the old hotmail. &nbsp; Many of these spam are so obvious, why can you not exclude them? &nbsp;The "Viagra", the email addresses with " @-------"
 , as an IT person - this should not be a big deal to exclude these or allow for folks to exclude them without having everything go to the JUNK.</p>

            <p>Yeah MS your spam filter is appalling. When I have junked and blocked 30+ emails from different but similar senders with exactly the same text and subject line why doesn't your filter realise anymore emails with that format are going to be junk too?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the junk filter so inaccessible on the web version? Its a right hassle to access and instead should be usable from a right click context menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't I use wildcards in the filters ffs?! Not to filter a whole domain, to filter part of a domain or specific words spammers are using in the email addresses they generate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is NOT to only allow saved senders. That is an idiotic suggestion. You need to improve the usability and intelligence of your spam algorithms. Don't ask pointless more information questions, just realise your current filters are a joke and tell
 whoever needs to make the decision you desperately need to improve them.</p>

            Agreed and I would add that the same thing applies to non-junk -- that is, w<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">hen I have marked 100+ emails from different but similar senders with similar text and subject lines why doesn't your filter
 get that those emails are NOT junk. Too many false-positives result from this forcing me to always wade through the cr*p in the junk box anyway to find good emails. We have MS email / junk filtering because of directives "on high" at our company. BAD corporate
 decision, wish I had a say, I would have us go back to gmail for business which has far superior, intelligent spam filtering.</span>

<h2>            How to format several sheets at same time, including changing format&#40;s&#41; after development&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Often, I need to create several sheets in a wokbook with the same format (e.g., column width, fonts, etc.) I know I can 'group' sheets, but I simply cannot determine how to 'apply' formats across all sheets at time of development.</p>
<p>I also need to change formatting once a workbook has been developed. Again, I cannot determine how-to-do. I'm sure there's a way, but many hours of searching Help has been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>FYI - I am a very experienced 1-2-3 user (since 1985); this is very easy in 1-2-3. This is not a slam against Excel, btw. I made the move to Excel full-time ~2-3 years ago. I typically have to use the brute-force method.. I'm looking for a more-efficient
 way.</p>

<p>As you said, you can group the relevant sheets and then apply the changes that you want.</p>
<p>But maybe you are asking how to apply the formatting of one sheet to another specific sheet:</p>
<p>- select the entire sheet whose formatting you want to copy (click the top left button at the junction of the column letters and row numbers).<br />
- copy<br />
- select the entire sheet that you want to reformat<br />
- Paste Special Formats</p>

<h2>            Time zones in Outlook meeting invite</h2>
                    <p>I set up a number of international calendar appointments in Outlook, and all I want to do is have the time zone drop down next to the start and end time to automatically be there instead of having to click the time zone button under Options on the ribbon
 bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible? I feel like there should be a setting where you can select this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However my searching only comes up with things like "how to add a time zone" and "how to display a second time zone"......</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps I'm using Office 2016 and Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be grateful.</p>
<p>
