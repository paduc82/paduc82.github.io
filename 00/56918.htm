<h2>            Taiwan Currency Symbol</h2>
                    In Office 2007 Excel, why is the currency symbol for Taiwan (TWD) not available in format cells?

            <p>I assume you are running the latest Windows 10 mobile release (1.0.10.0), and that you know the difference between "Language" and "Speech Language"; because it seems to me that there's much confusion about which is which!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st... the "Language" option under 'Time &amp; Language' Settings setting, is what appears to be the 'system' language setting. I have found no difficulty in adding/moving up or down (i.e. changing priority of a language)/removing, by pressing and holding on
 a language that's appears in the available languages (i.e. they've been installed already or you've added them!) list and choosing from the options that appear in the flyout menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd... the "Speech" option under 'Time &amp; Language' Settings setting, is where I am experiencing the big bad issues that seem to be giving people much grief.&nbsp; My Lumia 950XL (supposedly unlocked/brand new) purchased in Australia, had/has Italian as the 'default'
 language for speech!!!&nbsp; What THE?!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have adjusted region settings so that the keyboard language and settings match our region's usual settings for desktops/laptops/tablets - and everything else works fine... but Cortana fails to recognise voice commands; giving a "I'm sorry, but I was unable
 to get the speech language pack. Would you like me to try again?" message that's nothing more than an invitation to going around in circles!!&nbsp; Even changing Cortana's default language and language settings from the app itself have zero effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping that MS acknowledges this somewhat annoying behaviour and that they pull their fingers out in sorting this (what appears to be more common than at first appears) Windows 10/Cortana issue, rather than doing an Apple corp. style burying of the head
 in the sand and hoping it all just goes away.</p>

    <title>USB audio capture adaptor &#40;Ezcap&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> soho bakery  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB audio capture adaptor &#40;Ezcap&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to transfer audio from a tape cassette to a cd via my laptop. Initially i tried with a simple 3.5 jack, connecting a tape player and the laptop via the headphone socket on the cassette player and mic socket on the laptop. It worked but the quality
 was very poor. So i got one of these adapters and my laptop recognises it and tells me it's installed the hardware and the light comes on on it - but it's not working - or something isn't working. There's no sound. I tried again with just the simple 3.5 jack
 and that still works (badly) but with the adapter (which i have to connect using the 3.5 lead), no. I've tried with both the audacity software that comes with it and also the basic sound recorder on my windows XP laptop (which is what i used before). any ideas?
 thanks</p>

    <title>sigverif shows most microsoft drivers as being unsigned in XP SP3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> csharpwannabee  say:</h3>
<h2>            sigverif shows most microsoft drivers as being unsigned in XP SP3</h2>
                    I have Windows XP Professional SP3 on a laptop.<br />
<br />
When I run sigverif and use the advanced tab to search for unsigned drivers in c:\windows\system32\drivers it lists most of the drivers as being unsigned. Sigverif.txt&nbsp; shows that of the 363 files only 41 are signed.<br />
E.g. 1394bus.sys is shown as being unsigned.<br />
<br />
If I copy the contents of this folder to another PC running Windows XP SP3 to a temporary folder (e.g. C:\temp\drivers) and run sigverif on those files it show that of the 363 files 327 of them are signed. The 1394bus is shown as signed by Microsoft using catalog
 NT5.cat<br />
<br />
Apart from the drivers apearing to be unsigned the system seems to work okay. However whenever I install a driver I always get a warning message telling me not to proceed.<br />
<br />
The certificates store on both the laptop and the PC are very similar and the cat5.cat file is present on bothe machines.<br />
<br />
Anyone any ideas?<br />

<h2>            Lenovo Flex 2-15 Windows 10.  Stopped detecting second monitor</h2>
                    I updated the graphics video card driver (I actually had Intel do it).&nbsp; That didn't fix it.&nbsp; I've got the my laptop connected to the monitor with an HDMI cable.&nbsp; I'm afraid that in trying to fix the original problem (which was that the touch feature on

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can install free or purchased apps to each account on the same&nbsp;Windows 8&nbsp;device.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The user (your son) has to sign into Windows 8, go to Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Once in Store switch to&nbsp;your Microsoft account by opening the Charms and under Settings select 'Your Account".&nbsp;Store will ask you to login or Change user, change the user to your Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Now simply find the apps you want to install for your son and install them (and of course pay for them). If you have already purchased or installed the app, sweep up slightly&nbsp;from the bottom of the screen, select Your apps from the bar at the top of the
 screen. From the drop down menu select All apps. Find the app you want to install and select it, you should then get an option at the bottom of the screen to Install.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;4. Open the Charms and under Settings select 'Your Account", click sign out,&nbsp;that returns the Store Settings to revert back to the&nbsp;Windows 8&nbsp;user&nbsp;account (your son's). Exit Store.

<p>Unfortunately this did not resolve my problem. I receive the password incorrect message, but without the go to live.com, etc. To reset it.</p>
<p>The new password works to get into Outlooj on my phone, and another pc. &nbsp;Is there any way to just bypass this screen so I can access my files?!</p>

<p>Hello somebodysomewhere,</p>
<p>I would try to see if you can install in Safe Mode. <br />
To get to Safe Mode:<br />
a) Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.<br />
b) Select an option when the Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.<br />
c) When the Boot menu appears again, and the words "Safe Mode" appear in blue at the bottom, select the installation that you want to start, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>Then try again to run the .NET Framework 4 that you have already downloaded.</p>
<p>Please reply back with an update and let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            Hi limmaarr,<br />
<br />
I would need some details about the issue that you’ve posted.<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you record the video using the camcorder? If yes, does your camcorder has an option to transfer the time/date stamp along with the video through firewire?<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you using Windows media player or Windows media center or any other third party players to playback the recorded video?<br />
<br />
Based on my research, you need to use a third party enhanced decoders in order to display the date and time while performing a video playback if your camcorder do not have that option.<br />
<br />
When your camcorder captures a video, it will record the captured time and date. Unless you have the right software on your computer, you won't see the time/date – but it is in the file.<br />
<br />
<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.<br />

    <title>Computer keeps starting in safe mode following a bad virus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shepandmisty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer keeps starting in safe mode following a bad virus</h2>
                    Hi everyone.<br />
My laptop was recently infected with a rather nasty virus that stopped me being able to open my anti-virus software (avast) in order to get rid of it. There were many other programs I couldn't open either including internet explorer. I left my computer off
 for a few days and decided to purchase some system restore software to completely clear my hard drive. I was quoted £50 so I decided to have one last go. I started windows in safe mode and miraculouly managed to open avast this time, i did a full scan and
 deleted 9 infected files. <br />
All of the virus seems to be gone however there are some remaining problems. Now everytime I turn on my computer windows starts in safe mode (even when I select the option to start windows normally). Windows explorer keeps failing to work and closing (such
 as when I try to go to Control Panel) and my laptop won't connect to the broadband internet in my home.
<br />
Is it possible that I have deleted some important system files whilst getting rid of the virus or does anyone recognise this as something else? I'm afraid I am just a normal home user and I don't know too much about computers so please go easy with me.
<br />
I would appreciate any help anyone can offer.<br />
<br />
My operating system is windows vista.<br />
<br />
cheers

            Hi,<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy to
<br />
detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So its better
<br />
to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an extreme overkill
<br />
point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;them in
<br />
regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone. (If Rootkits
<br />
run UnHackMe)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes - free<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />

Run the Microsoft Malicious Removal Tool <br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; MRT&nbsp; find at top of list - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You should be getting this tool and its updates via Windows Updates - if needed you can download it here.<br />

</p><p>To answer your question, you can't use the Recovery Drive created in one laptop in a different laptop (unless it is the exact make and model with exactly the same devices installed). The Recovery Drive might contain drivers that are inappropriate for the

<p>"Recent Places" simply lists all folders that you've opened/copied/moved files to in the past - it's like a recent history. If you want to turn it off (this will also turn off Recent Items):</p>

<p>In the "Guides" section below there is a link on how to remove the Favorites and other folders, if you want to. The guides involve editing the registry - be careful!</p>
<p>If you prefer the XP layout there might be more helpful info below, and many people have found installing&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Classic Shell</a> helps with both Windows Explorer and has the option of the XP style
 start menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately when Microsoft redesigned Windows Explorer they made some pretty horrendous decisions - of which many people have complained about. There are many other file managers available, both free and for a price. One of them might be easier to use
 and have the features you want, here is a list of most that are available:<br />

<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Most important features to fix or return to Windows Explorer:</span></strong>
<p>1) The option to disable Auto Arrange.<br />
<br />
2) Fix The Left Pane Scroll Bug: If you are viewing a folder and expand it in the left pane to show it's subfolders, the folder is annoyingly auto-scrolled to the bottom of the pane causing the subfolders to not be shown, making it difficult to work with. Double
 clicking a folder in the left pane can also cause this problem.&nbsp; <strong><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/621426/bug-when-expanding-folders-in-explorer-server-2008-r2-and-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vote to fix it.</a>
</strong><br />
<br />
3) When multiple files are selected they should stay selected when changing the sorting order (ex: Name to Size). Maintaining selected files when sorting should be a requirement and this feature should not have been removed.<br />
<br />
4) The option to remember each folder's view settings (remembering individual folder window sizes and positions).<br />
<br />
5) The option to remove "Full row selection" for details view. "Full row selection" is very annoying when the folder is full and has no empty space to click on. Also, when dragging/dropping files to a different folder - if you release the file on the row of
 a subfolder or .exe/.zip/.rar file "full row selection" causes the file to be moved into the subfolder or .exe/.zip/.rar file rather the the intended folder.<br />
<br />
6) A search window with all the advanced search options. No syntax required.<br />
<br />
7) The option to always show free disk space and folder size in the status bar and/or details pane. Also always automatically show the size of selected files (when many files are selected it will not show the total size).<br />
<br />
8) The option to scroll the pane your mouse is in with mouse wheel even if that pane is not selected.</p>

<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Let Microsoft know you want Windows Explorers features returned:</span></strong>
<p>Since many people seem to agree that some or all the changes made to Windows Explorer have actually made it less user friendly, you can go to the Windows 7 Feedback page and (politely) let them know your suggestions for improving it:<br />

<p>Note: don't make the message too long, there is a size limit to your message even though the page doesn't tell you about it. Also, don't just copy and paste from the list above - they will think the same person is repeatedly submitting feedback.</p>

<p>Left pane scroll bug (and other fixes):</p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Using Classic Shell To Restore Some Features To Windows Explorer</span></strong>
<p>After installing the free <a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Classic Shell</a> you can customize Windows Explorer closer to how you want it, the quote below is just one way to do so.&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/features.html#explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a> to see some of the options you can
 customize, and here is the&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FAQ page</a> for Classic Shell.</p>
<blockquote>A solution which did work for restoring some features.
<p>1) Install the free&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Classic Shell.</a> &nbsp;This is very customizable, and works as a mod for Windows Explorer rather than a full blown replacement. You didn't need to install the Classic Start Menu
 option, but you can if you want.<br />
2) Reboot the computer.<br />
3) Launch Windows Explorer (Start - Computer) and turn on "Always Show Menus" (Organize - Layout - check Menu Bar). This is just for configuration, you can turn it off again afterwards if you want.<br />
4) Right click on the menu bar and turn on the "Classic Explorer Bar". This adds a series of cut/copy/paste icons to Explorer. Crucially, it also adds the "Configuration" icon.<br />
5) Go into the configuration and from here you can tweak things to your heart's content. To kill the horrible Windows 7 folder-jumping, switch the "Navigation Pane Style" to Vista. You can even knock it back to XP mode if you want (this adds in the lines to
 the folder tree and adds a classic "+" icon for expanding folders). The Windows Vista style folder view looks pretty much the same as the Windows 7 view, but gets rid of the horrible jumping.<br />
6) Tweak any other settings you want.</p>
<p>After this, you can turn the toolbar and menus back off in Explorer if you wish. Windows Explorer looks largely the same, but folders no longer jump around.&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/621426/bug-when-expanding-folders-in-explorer-server-2008-r2-and-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vote
 for Microsoft to fix this bug.</a> </strong></p>
<p>Now, if only MS could code properly so that we don't have to mess with third party apps to get Windows to actually work properly...</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I installed Classic Shell yesterday. It's going to take me a while to make Explorer and Search usable.</p>
<p>I knew it wasn't just me.</p>
<p>What were "they" thinking???&nbsp;<strong> </strong><strong>This OS is a mess!</strong></p>
<p>I was just reading through the fix for the issue I mentioned. I also&nbsp;read posts about other problems I noticed too.<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">They all&nbsp;require&nbsp;me to&nbsp;edit the systems registry.</span></strong>&nbsp; It's possible that editing
 the systems registry incorrectly can cause serious problems. So now I'm left with a choice of either living with the problem of the unusable features built into the OS, risk corrupting the systems registry, or&nbsp;finding third party applications to work around
 the issues.</p>

<p>Unfortunately if Microsoft didn't include the option to make changes through the user interface you must use the registry (or a third party program like Classic Shell). When done correctly editing the registry is relatively safe, just double check what you're
 doing. But yes, there is always the risk of something going wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before making changes, it's best to back up the registry:</p>

live.xbox.com/.../RedeemToken</a> &lt; that way there is less chance of error.</p>
<p>If that still doesnt work then you should post in the rewards section of the forum and a member of the rewards team should be able to help you further

<h2>            English language pack downloads </h2>
                    
<p>I have recently purchased a computer in France with the French language version of Window 7 preinstalled on it. I understand that language packs are available to download in order to change the language, however I cannot find an English language version
 of the download.&nbsp;Does anybody have any suggestions.&nbsp;</p>

            If you are running Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium or Professional, you need to do an Anytime Upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate so that you can access additional Language Packs through Windows 7 Ultimate. That option is only available in that edition.
