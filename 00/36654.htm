                    <span style="color: rgba(29, 33, 41, 1)">Just can't justify buying a surface ever again. Sad... Bought a Surface Pro 3... Lasted for 13 months, then just black screen
 after sleep... tried every fix available... Loved it when it was working and thought must have been a fluke. So bought a Surface Pro 4... Loved it for 13 months, then just black screen after sleep, exactly the same as the Pro 3. Tried every reboot button combo
 I could find online... nothing... even tried CPR remedy that I came across on YouTube. that actually woke up the Pro 3 which hadn't turned on in over a year... thought GREAT!!!! but it too went to sleep again a few minutes later, never to wake... the only
 fix available is a $500 replacement?... I've owned 2 iPads that have worked flawlessly for years!!! Guess my next Surface is an iPad Pro... Sad.</span>

<p>Same here!&nbsp; I have 3 Surface Pro 3's and one Surface Pro 4 (my current machine that just went into the black screen of death yesterday). ALL 4 OF THEM HAVE THE BLACK SCREEN!! (each one just slightly out of warranty when it happened, and on each one. none
 of the fixes work. They all light up the keyboard, and run in the background but the screen will not turn on (external monitors dont work either) The saddest part of it....MicroSoft has no answer other than "If the fixes dont work you have to exchange it for
 another"....they dont even have the guts to say what you really have to do, which is pony up a bucket load of money, AGAIN, for another piece of junk that is not even new! Lesson learned here...if you want a surface, get a cheap used one off of ebay (because
 odds are thats what youre going to end up with anyway.... or in my case 4 12" super expensive bricks).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp; silver lining though is that I was about to buy a few more of the Surface Books, and having this ridiculous problem happen a FOURTH time just saved me thousands of dollars, I'll never buy another PC from microsoft...EVER. And Ive been looking for a
 reason to switch all our computers to Linux, this was it!</p>

<h2>            Couldn&#39;t change windows live ID &#43; xbox support failure &#61; lost microsoft points, games, money</h2>
                    
<p>I posted this on the other forum, but never got a clear answer:&nbsp;</p>

<p>About a month ago, I attempted to change the windows liveID connected to my gamer tag. I tried on my xbox and online, but got error messages. I called xbox support, and went through all the troubleshooting attempts with the associate over the phone, nothing
 worked, so the associate escalated my call and told me that someone would get in contact with me. Nobody ever did. I called back about a week later. I went through all the troubleshooting again. My call was escalated again. I wasn't called back again. A third
 time, I called and spoke to an associate, and we went through the troubleshooting. The associate was very nice and helpful, but he couldn't fix my issue. I was escalated again. I spoke to the team leader, and he could not fix my issue. After approximately
 3 hours on the phone on this particular call (probably close to 6 hours total with xbox live customer support) the team leader decided that we should cancel my account, and start over again. The team leader, Wes, was very nice and knowledgeable, and helped
 me as much as he could. He sent me a pin number so I could keep the remaining time on my gold subscription, and I started a new gamer tag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now have a new windowsliveID and a new gamer tag. However, I spent approximately 5-6 hours on the phone with xbox attempting to rectify a fairly basic problem that was not of my own doing. Further, after spending that huge amount of time on the phone,
 I lost the amount of tokens or microsoft points or whatever on my prior account. Again, I'd like to stress that the xbox live associates were very nice and polite, and did everything they could. They should all be commended. On the other hand, I, as the customer,
 went through a ridiculous ordeal for a basic issue, and lost money to boot. On top of that, I lost all the progress in every single one of the games I've ever played. The icing on the cake: I attempted to play a game that I purchased from xbox live and downloaded
 to my system - the very same system I currently have. However, when I attempt to play the game, it informs me that I cannot. Not only did I lose my microsoft points, but I lost the games that I paid for, downloaded, and are still on the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called xbox support for what seems like the 90th time, and inquired about this issue. Even though none of the issues were my own fault, I was told that there was absolutely nothing I could do, and any money I put into Microsoft Points was essentially forfeited,
 and any games I purchased were gone. I was told I had no recourse other than to post on this forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been an xbox live customer since the original xbox, and all that is gone. It's doubly frustrating because the issue I had with the liveID was never even fixed. Because I was tired of dealing with the process (and who wouldn't be?), I decided it was
 easier to scrap the old name, accomplishments, and everything else, and just start over. Had I not decided to do that, I'd probably still be on the phone with xbox live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I'm willing to give up the accomplishments and progress I made under my old gamertag, I simply cannot and will not believe that xbox and/or microsoft are unwilling or unable to refund to me the money that is rightfully mine and restore the game that
 I rightfully own.</p>

                    I recently renewed my McAfee protection but since I have, every time I turn on my computer, I get an error message that the Windows Defender failed to initialize.&nbsp; How can I either turn off this error message permanently or get both programs to run together?&nbsp;
 It is just&nbsp;a nuisance having to see this error message every time I turn on my computer.&nbsp; It isn't necessary.&nbsp; Can you assist?<br />

            I have been struggling with this issue for three days.&nbsp; In the last three hours, I have come to learn that it is a McAfee issue.&nbsp; Not a big issue, but a McAfee issue none the less.<br />
<br />
If McAfee 2009 is running, it will not permit Windows Defender to run at the same time.&nbsp; If I hadn't had such a hard time logging in to post this answer, I might have been able to point you to a McAfee support sheet that discusses this issue directly on point.&nbsp;
 Logging in to get information is, in fact, a big part of the problem.&nbsp; You won't get the information from McAfee unless you log in.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have multiple complaints about both McAfee and Microsoft for failing to make this information known at least to McAfee users.&nbsp; (By the way, it may affect users of products other than McAfee.&nbsp; I use only McAfee.)&nbsp; I guess they want to know how much of a problem
 it is, plus keep from advertising that there is a problem.&nbsp; My complaint against Microsoft is that:<br />
1).&nbsp; They tell you if you are experiencing this issue, you have a worm.<br />
2).&nbsp; Their software was initially designed only to recognize Norton. (Well, at least that's how it appeared to me.)&nbsp; McAfee fixed that.&nbsp; But,<br />
3).&nbsp; The error code is the same as the error code they used a couple of years ago for a different problem.&nbsp; (Therefore, leading&nbsp;you on the&nbsp;wild goose chase.)&nbsp;&nbsp;(I restored one of my tow computers that was affected&nbsp;by the issue, hoping that would resolve it,
 before I realized that all of the information on the Microsoft site might be too old to identify the issue.&nbsp; It occurred to me that the Microsoft explanation did not explained why it happened to both computers simultaneously.)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The solution that they post is quite effective, (once they explain the problem.)<br />

            <p>Hello KathrynMeyer,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. If I understand your issue correctly, you want to move the photo to the left side within Movie Maker. There are no option to do this in Movie Maker permanently. You can use the
<strong>Pan left</strong> effect (several options for the left pan effect. You can choose what is best for your project) of the program that can be seen on the
<strong>Animations</strong> tab within Movie Maker but, this is just a workaround as the photos that has been given this effect is moving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Pro 64 Sound cuts out at random times - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gulfdiver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Pro 64   Sound cuts out at random times</h2>
                    I've been having some serious problems with my Windows 7 installs on both my main PC and my laptop.&nbsp;It seems that when I use more then 1 application with sound it will cut out eventually..&nbsp; For instance.. I will be listening to Sirius online and be playing
 Lord of the Rings Online.. eventually my sound cuts out and the only way to get it back is to reboot.&nbsp; I noticed that if I use Ventrilo the sound cuts out faster (within 15-30 min) as apposed to an hour or so with other programs.<br />
<br />
I have disabled the onboard sound card which was a Realktek HD.<br />
I&nbsp;use a Jabra GN9350 wireless headset which is Windows 7 compatible.<br />
<br />
The Miscrosoft driver for the GN9350&nbsp;successfuly installed and is version 6.1.7600.16385 dated 7/13/2009<br />
<br />
I have selected "DO NOTHING" on the &lt;COMMUNICATIONS&gt; tab in SOUND Options thinking maybe this might help.. but it does not.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; This is extremely crippling to me.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!<br />

            One solution i found out.&nbsp; I have the same exact issue except i use a logitech headset.&nbsp; Whenever your sound cuts out open task manager by pressing ALT+CTRL+DEL or just right click on the taskbar and press Start Task Manager and find Audiodg.exe&nbsp; If it
 doesnt show up make sure u have show processes for all users on.&nbsp; End process Audiodg.exe and ur sound will work again.&nbsp; For it cutting out faster with ventrilo i started to run ventrilo as administrator and i set the priority of it to high and i havent had
 any issues with it cutting out faster.&nbsp; Really lately i havent had my sound cut out but once in the past 2 weeks when it use to happen in 10-15 minutes..<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any issues

<p>I bought a new type cover, but it won't work on my surface.</p>
<p>I ask for MSFT help, and they told that to remove driver and reinstall driver again.</p>
<p>after that, even my old type cover won't work too.</p>
<p>it should show Surface type cover filter device in Keyboards but I only see surface type cover in other devices.(Device manager)</p>
<p>so I decide to reset my surface and clean all files.</p>
<p>so I met this weird issue.........</p>

    <title>How to Identify the new unknown devices listed in Device manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> catamite1  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Identify the new unknown devices listed in Device manager</h2>
                    I have a list of 6 unknown devices in my device manager that appear in the list between the network adapters and Ports.
<br />
I've searched online and have only found advice for XP or Vista- not 7. <br />
<br />
The first Unknown Device is listed in the Detail tab gives the physical device object name as \Device\0000001a<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? <br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            Go to device manager, right click the unknown device, properties, use the pull down to get hardware ID's, take the short ID and Google it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It should point you towards the mfr.<br />
<br />
You can also take the hardware ID and go here http://www.pcidatabase.com/<br />

    <title>Why am I getting a blue error screen TARGET_MDL_TOO_SMALL and now PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yellowedpages  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why am I getting a blue error screen TARGET_MDL_TOO_SMALL and now PC is slow and shutting down on it&#39;s own, why is this&#63;</h2>
                    I was greeted with a blue screen with the error TARGET_MDL_TOO_SMALL and now my pc is running slow, mainly when opening just basic windows to open files or using my browser. I scanned for viruses multiple times also in safe mode, and it deleted anything
 that could have been a possible issue. No change. <br />
<br />
I uninstalled everything I had that could have caused a problem. Nothing. The only programs that were recently updated were Firefox and Opera. Outside of that it was nothing for a month.
<br />
<br />
I assumed it was a driver, so I checked sound and video as i noticed they skip and cut out when I am playing music files or video files. No change. Today it just shutdown on it's own and when I turned it back on it said windows did not shut down correctly and
 to start in safe mode. So I am in safe mode. Windows is still slow. I removed many programs from the start up file as well. Hasn't changed anything.
<br />
<br />
What do I do, I found a fix for Vista's error screen for the TARGET MDL...this, but not one for Windows.<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to assit me. <br />

            Unfortunately the .txt file doesn't contain the needed sections.&nbsp; That's OK though - as we'll just work the minidumps and see if that fixes things.&nbsp; If not, we'll then work on the MSINFO file(s).<br />
<br />
HotSpotShield has caused a lot of BSOD's recently.&nbsp; Uninstall it.&nbsp; Drivers for your copy date from 2009<br />
If uninstalling it stops the BSOD's, then download a fresh copy of the latest version and see if that works without BSOD's (I haven't seen any of these recently, so I have to wonder if they have a new version out).<br />
<br />
It seems that you have both Norton and McAfee installed (Norton driver dates from 2009).&nbsp; Please uninstall both and try one of these free antivirus':&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.carrona.org/freeav.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.carrona.org/freeav.html</a>&nbsp; If that stops the BSOD's, then feel free to install only 1 antivirus and only one firewall - never install more, this includes Internet Security/Security Center
 apps.<br />
<br />
Intel storage drivers (Intel Rapid Storage Technology (RST)) date from 2009.&nbsp; Please visit
<a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://downloadcenter.intel.com</a> and download/install the latest version of the RST drivers.&nbsp; One of the BSOD's blames these drivers.<br />
<br />
Adobe product (most likely Adobe Reader) dates from 2008.&nbsp; Please uninstall it.&nbsp; Then visit
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/downloads</a> for updated versions of Reader, Flash, Shockwave, and Air.&nbsp; Update all of them.<br />
<br />
pcouffin.sys dates from 2006 and is likely to be a part of your problems.&nbsp; It belongs to an older CD/DVD program on your system.&nbsp; Please uninstall that program (I have no clue which program it might be).&nbsp; Once uninstalled, check in C:\Windows\System32\drivers
 to see if it's been removed (<u><b>DO NOT</b></u> remove it manually as it'll cause booting problems)<br />
<br />
MagicISO drivers date from 2009, please un-iinstall it.<br />
<br />
The NTI CD &amp;DVD-Maker or NTI Backup NOW! or NTI CD-Maker by NewTech Infosystems (usually in Acer Empowering Technology) UBHelper.sys driver dates from 2009.&nbsp; Please uninstall this application from your system.<br />
<br />
Cyberlink CD/DVD program driver (000.fcl) dates from 2008 - please uninstall it.<br />
<br />
Change Monitor Filter Driver (MOBK.sys) dates frome 2009 - please uninstall it.<br />
<br />
Realtek HiDefinition Audio driver (file labelled as Creative Audio Driver) (MBFilt64.sys) dates from 2009, please update this driver from the Realtek Website:&nbsp;

            The NFO file still didn't work - don't worry about it, we can work without it.<br />
<br />
If ti's still having BSOD's - please zip up the latest one's and upload them to your SkyDrive account.&nbsp; Often it takes several tries to isolate the problems.<br />
<br />
In general, we try to fix all 3rd party driver problems.&nbsp; Then, if problems continue, we start to look at either hardware problems or Windows problems.<br />

<p>sad to say you cannot transfer the arcade games to the one, but a little fun fact: If you hook up your Xbox 360 into the hdmi in of your one you can run the live tv app and play your 360 games and use the snap feature or other features of the one ^_^</p>

            If this&nbsp;games don't work in Compatibility &nbsp;mode&nbsp;then I am afraid they not be runnable in Windows *. Your best bet is to replace these games that are made for Windows 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope this helps and if you need any further assistance post and we will be glad to
 help you.

<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 Edition in &#34;Free trial&#34; After buying</h2>
                    I have an issue with Minecraft Windows 10 Edition that I have had for awhile but cannot figure out. About a year back, I bought Windows 10 Minecraft and was playing on servers constantly over the course of about 6 months. I took a break for a few months,
 but when I came back, all the servers I added on were gone, and instead when I went to build stuff, it says on the Windows Store "Free Trial" and "Buy" or something like that, and I bought it already. What happened?

            Hello, from what I've read, you may need to sign in to the Xbox app on your PC before you run Minecraft. Let me know if this doesn't work for you.

            Hi Andrew,
<br />
<br />Is this happening on just one program you are trying to install or all programs?

            Hi Andrew, In that case, from the wording of that error, the Installer seems to be missing some files, try downloading the installer again and it should work as expected . . .
