<h2>            OneDrive for Business needs credentials after password change, but won&#39;t take them.</h2>
                    
<p>I changed my password this week.&nbsp; Outlook, Skype for Business, Word, Excel, all asked for the credentials (or just found them without asking).&nbsp; OneDrive for Business just stopped syncing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had this problem the last time, but I was on Win 7 and Office 365/2013, (deleted credentials back then)&nbsp;now I'm on Win 10, Office 365/2016.&nbsp; I looked at a bunch of solutions.&nbsp; I've rebooted a bunch of times without any success.</p>
<p>Then, something scary/wonderful happened.&nbsp; After the last reboot, OneDrive for Business CRASHED!&nbsp; After it restarted, everything is fine and it starting syncing by itself.</p>
<p>Let's face it.&nbsp; I can't install this on the rest of the company PCs and then try to find a way to crash it (and if you have a way that works on demand, that would at least be a workaround).</p>
<p>There seems to be an issue with password changes and OneDrive for Business not getting the word.&nbsp; This has to be a problem to be addressed by MS.</p>
<p>My immediate problem is resolved, however, I need to hear that there's a solution so that I can deploy this to others in the organization AND not have a recurrence of the problem in a few months when my password needs to be reset.</p>

<p>Hi Pete,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>

If it cannot be reproduced, I suggest you contact us immediately when it happens again. We will then move forward on the escalation process.</p>

<h2>            Uninstalling an MSN Game</h2>
                    <p>I have recently downloaded an MSN Game and MSN Games Manager. There was some problem during installation which I don't understand; it was automatically stopped by MSN Games Manager advising a problem with this game. I tried deleting from MSN Games Manager
 unsuccessfully "File Corrupted, Cannot Read". Also, I tried uninstalling through Settings, Apps unsuccessfully "File does not exist". Obviously, it DOES exist because it's occupying 658 mb of my storage space.
</p>
<p>

<h2>            How to upgrade the microSD card to larger size&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have looked high and low for how to upgrade to a larger capacity sd card. Oddly, I am seeing nothing about this, even on MS sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I </p>
<p>In the past, when sticking in a new sd card, it recognizes it as a new device, and offered no help with an upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even now with Windows 10 Mobile/Phone I keep getting an annoying warning about running out of space, and the only suggestions it gives are to delete files, or move applications back to the main internal storage.</p>
<p>

<p>What Windows 10 device do you have?</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 0">Even now with Windows 10 Mobile/Phone I keep getting an annoying warning about running out of space, and the only suggestions it gives are to delete files, or move applications back to the main internal storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>If you are getting that warning, it is because your built-in internal memory is low.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would use File Explorer and make sure you see the card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, check under Settings: System/Storage. It will show you all of your available memory. This is what mine shows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/32ca7568-a82f-4500-bf49-a043dfe97672?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/32ca7568-a82f-4500-bf49-a043dfe97672?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In theory, if you are getting that message it is because your internal memory is low. Consider moving all Music, pictures etc to the memory card. I generally install my programs to Internal Memory but games and programs I rarely use I install on the memory
 card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I would not move programs to the Memory card. I would uninstall, reboot my device then reinstall to the Memory card. Don't forget to change where it is installed to before you reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, keep in mind that even though you install to Memory Card some of it has to be placed in Main Memory</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, it is easy to replace a memory card. If you get a new SD card, there should be a slot where it is located that allows you to easily slide it out and replace it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To remove your memory card first do this:</p>
<p>Click on Settings/Storage</p>
<p>Double tap on your SD card and it will open</p>
<p>Scroll to the bottom and click on REMOVE</p>
<p>Then you will be able to remove it and insert the new card. I generally power off my device before inserting a new card then power it back on. It should detect your new card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside, this is an OLD article but it is worth reading. Not all will apply but the essentials are there:</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>First, thanks for responding.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the "sd card" is running out of space, not internal storage.</p>
<p>I have nearly all applications and data on the sd card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link you provided is for Windows Phone 8, and not Windows 10 Mobile.</p>
<p>It also covers "Storage Sense" which is not on W10M</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a "backup" option in settings, but that is for restoring the phone back to normal when acquiring a new phone.
</p>
<p>I see no restore function. I am not sure what "genius" could not see there could be an issue from years ago when people start running out of space on their storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went ahead and copied the files over from the old sd card, inserted the new card to be recognized, removed, it, then copied all the data over to the new one.&nbsp; The applications did not show up, so I had to click on each missing&nbsp; application, which took
 me to the MS Store to click on the "Reinstall" button. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this disaster will be fixed with Andromeda.</p>
<p>

 capture shows examples of both problems. I do not know how to fix the problems. Can anyone help?</p>

            <p>Those look like automatic bookmark numbers. How, exactly, did you create the pdf? The navigation pane is not usually a part of a pdf, it is a Word tool. Was this a screenshot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are more likely to get a knowledgeable answer on the Adobe site if you did this through Acrobat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which options did you have checked? I don't get the navigation pane with the following:</p>

<p>

            <p>Hi Charles, thanks for your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screenshot is from the Word document. This is a document that we will continue to update, so I want to get it cleaned up for the future. You are correct that the Nav pane does not show up in the PDF, so at least the customers won't see the weird numbering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked from the Word add-in for Acrobat (Word 2013/Acrobat XI).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all of the settings checked that you have checked. Mine are in tabs though. I may ask the question in an Adobe forum, but I doubt they could get the numbering out of my Word doc.</p>

            If you select a heading and press Ctrl+SpaceBar (to clear direct font formatting), do the mysterious numbers show up at the beginning of the paragraph? This has been reported earlier, but I have forgotten if the underlying cause was ever found.

            <p>Stefan, the strange numbers only show up at the start of each heading listed in the Navigation Pane. They do not show up in the document itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I did as you suggested, and the numbers in the Nav Pane are still there.</p>

            Well, my suggestion was a bit of a long shot. It did help at least once before, though: clearing direct font formatting revealed some hidden content in the heading and that hidden content turned up in the TOC.

            Yes, I'm having the same problem. I've gone thru all of the "check this" suggestions, but all the buttons seem to be properly pushed. The only ones I know about missing have happened on Sunday night local time and I only know about them b/c they're from
 my husband who's seated 15 feet away. He'll resend the same messages multiple times but they never go thru. By Monday am all his emails come thru w/o incident. It's happened on the last 2 Sunday evenings. Strange, no? Not sure if the timing is important or
 just a coincidence. Would love to have the problem fixed.

            <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand how frustrating it is to have to go through this and I regret the inconvenience that it has caused you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than checking your Blocked senders list, there are other settings on your account that you can check that if changed cam cause the issue of the not receiving emails. To know what these settings are, please read the article below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/hotmail-email/im-not-receiving-emails-sent-by-my-family-or/377a9bf3-7975-4d76-a6eb-04dcc6d68097">I'm not receiving emails sent by my family or friends<br />
</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, we'd like to have the following info:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Were there any changes made on your account prior to the issue (like having filters and enabling your email fowarding setting)?</p>
<p>- Did any of your senders mentioned that they are receiving a bounce message when they send emails to your account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please send a test message to your own account to see if you'll be able to receive it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding your question about subtitles.&nbsp; Subtitles are not going to be available for all content on the Store.&nbsp; This is a feature that is provided by the content provider.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a movie has subtitles available you would have the option to turn this on within the movie.&nbsp; If you are using the Xbox Music application on a computer you would find this by right clicking the movie while playing and then going to options within the
 ribbon along the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; This will tell you if closed captioning is available and allow you to set this to ON and may allow you to select from more then one language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a Windows Phone 8 you will also start playing the movie first.&nbsp; tap the screen and then select the gear icon.&nbsp; Within settings you will find the Subtitles ON/OFF option.&nbsp; You will also find the caption options where you can make some further adjustments.&nbsp;
 In some cases I have seen a slight delay before the captions will begin showing up on the screen.&nbsp; With that said, you may want to consider pausing the movie when setting this up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns related to these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>

    <title>N-95 Software Update Frozen on 3&#47;3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ibolmo  say:</h3>
<h2>            N-95 Software Update Frozen on 3&#47;3</h2>
                    Here's the screenshot of the software updater: <a href="http://ibolmo.com/updater.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://ibolmo.com/updater.png</a><br />
<br />
I've had the software running for 5 hrs and there's no change to the phone or the updater.<br />
<br />
Here's more information:<br />
- Currently the phone is still connected to the computer via a USB.<br />
- I removed the microSD before the update began and didn't put it back in the phone.<br />
- The phone has Nokia on the screen.<br />
- The phone backlight is off -- or the screen is in the darkest setting.<br />
<br />
I'm aware of the danger if I do anything wrong, so I am waiting for suggestions on what to do next.

            Once the firmware file downloads (about 2-5mins on fast connection) the update only takes 5 minutes to update. It never takes 5 hours.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it looks like the updater or something else on your system has crashed.<br />
<br />
Sadly your only option is to disconnect the phone, but chances are that it may not be in a usable state when you try to turn it on. Remove the battery for 5mins before trying.<br />
<br />
Try it and let us know what happens.<br />

            Glad to here it's still working! :)<br />
<br />
No, don't try the update again.<br />
<br />
The new version of the NSU has a bug that makes updating nearly impossible on vista. The NSU team are aware of this bug so hopefully a new version will be available soon.<br />
<br />
The updater works ok on windows XP.

I'll keep checking for the update. Do you know if anyone has tried compatibility XP mode?

            Yes, it's purely a little bug in the NSU. They will probably have a new version out next week.<br />
<br />
Luckily this bug doesn't seem to have damaged anybodys phone yet.

            On the right side, just above the clock, you should see it displayed there. You can also right click on the start button, then click on
<em>Run</em> and type in the command <em>Winver </em>which should bring up a little&nbsp;screen telling you which version and build level of windows you are running.

<h2>            Windows Mobile 6 Change to Active Tasks Filter</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I searched posts and it appears there are other threads but no one has found an answer to this problem.&nbsp; Microsoft - if you read these, can you please respond?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running WM6 on a Samsung SCH-i760 (which is a very cool PDA by the way) and I'm quite reliant on the tasks lists on both the PDA and Outlook (which syncs with Microsoft CRM).&nbsp; When I set future tasks, then set the filter for "Active Tasks",
 I get all the future tasks showing up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is horrible, as I have high-priority tasks due in Apr 2008 showing up as things I should be working on now!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried Pocket Informant, but it's way too complex and I only need the tasks fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help/advice!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mitch</p>

<p>I use tasks differently than most so I probably am the wrong guy to give an answer but on the i760&nbsp;( or any other WM device), there are really only two options for tasks; Active and Completed (both are listed at the bottom of the Filter ).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, a future task has not been Cmpleted, would you not expect it to be Active then?</p>

<p>Actually no, it wouldn't become active until the specified start date.&nbsp; I truly think it be a bug since my "Today" page shows "13 Active&nbsp;tasks, 4 High Priority" but when I click on it and go to the app, I have over
 100 tasks and 20 high priority because it is showing all future tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Microsoft is listening, please fix this bug.</p>

This does seem like a bug.&nbsp; Previously, if you applied the "Active" filter it would not show tasks that have a future start date.&nbsp; Now I don't seen any difference between having the&nbsp;"Active" filter on or off.

            <span>That is what you get using proprietary software. Probably one line of code causing all this problem and yet there is NOTHING one can do about it.<br />
<br />
Even paying upfront and high, there are some stupidities on the OS, and there is NO WAY AT ALL to contact the developers, or let they know there there is a HUGE bug in their software.<br />
<br />
I just wasted my money buying a new PDA, because this new one with this "super new feature" is unusable, and not just for me. Now what is the alternative ?
<br />
<br />
Buy YET ANOTHER closed source paid software ??<br />
<br />
No.... I hope linux based PDAs to be out soon .... A big BOOOOOHH to Microsoft, that is just loosing it's user base, ignoring it with uninteligent choices, and let's hope for the better with the new Android OS from Google.<br />

"if [thank you field] = a, then insert text "one";&nbsp;&nbsp; if [thank you field] = b, then insert text "two";&nbsp; if [thank you field] = c, then insert text "three"; if [thank you field] = d, then insert text "four"; etc.

<h2>            Windows 10&#33; Why go backwards to the same old interface&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>After installing the third build of Windows 10 build 9879 and trying really really hard to like it!
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Sorry I have to go back to 8.1 for now.</span></strong> I can not find anything to like about the first three builds at all? Nothing new and it looks like windows is going backwards to the old desktop, why I do
 not know!</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>For myself I really like the metro interface of 8.1 on my desktop computer and windows phone, with the start screen and it's live tiles and the one drive integration the ability to snap apps and screens
 not just desktops is better. Oh I am using the desktop toolbar on my taskbar and can so quickly navigate to any thing on my machine and really don't need the old fashion desktop any more. When 8.1 first came out I was one of the big-time haters and had installed
 all the tricks to make it look and function the same way Windows 7 and all of the ones going back to 95 had. Then I thought about it Microsoft must know what their doing and I gave it a second try taking the two minutes to learn how to get around and now love
 it and don't want to go backwards! It's way too cool!!</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I will try and take a look next year when I here the next changes are coming for the preview but for now I am
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">sticking to 8.1</span></strong> I am pushing sixty but Windows 10 is just too old school for me!!</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Thanks Scott</span></p>

            <p>I have to agree with Scott.</p>
<p>I also adapted to the "Metro" interface, and use it to the fullest extent as my start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the public have been mesmerised by the blurb surrounding Windows 10. Right or wrong, all I see, so far,. is Windows 8.2 with a new name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Windows 8/8.1, is a fine program. The early pundits, hung it out to dry in a supportive fever of reaction. - most of the criticism based on poor judgement, much following a herd mentality.</p>
<p>Between now and the consumer release, Windows 10 is going to need to show me quite a few improvements, in performance and feature, before I will feel confident in recommending the general user to open their wallets and upgrade.&nbsp;</p>

I will never buy another new car / truck etc. if they replace the wheel, pedals and other controls with some useless controllers that are not "Traditional Controls" most of which have been around for over 100 years.

The start panel is not conducive to the desktop workflow it's detrimental.

            <p>Hi Scott</p>
<p>
</p><p>These first few versions of the new Windows 10 have all been narrowly focused on the Desktop components (Start Menu, Windowed Modern UI Apps, Multi-tasking with Virtual Desktops, new Taskbar options, etc, etc). This was done simply because the most negative
 feedback for Windows 8.1 was focused on these components.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Future builds will be focused on the changes in&nbsp;the Modern UI (Metro) components.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you liked Windows 8.1, you are going to love these upcoming builds for the TP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

            <p>Really? "because the old works..." You forgot to include a buggy whip in your old pictures. These same things were said, by the uninformed,&nbsp;about airplanes.</p>

</p><p>But, we are not talking about cars or planes. We are discussing the new OS from Microsoft...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A major issue in the discussion of Windows 10 is the fact that the "desktop workflow" is detrimental to moving the UI forward in support of the work that has to be done today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The movements backward in tying developers down to the desktop really are destructive. While new development can still side step these stumbling blocks, if the trend continues in future builds, this will become a larger problem.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks Ron</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is why I said I will take a look next year and am hopping they bring back the options to use the Metro interface more like you can in 8/8.1. That's what I like! I do know a lot want the old desktop interface! why I don't know I believe it is a lack
 of understanding how easy it is to navigate and too suborn to lean. That's how I was when 8 first came out. So you can be sure I will be checking out the future builds but thaks again!</p>

            I have to agree, if they had given the people that like the desktop some kind of upgrade then ok. What they did was rip out all the good stuff from 8.1 then made the desktop the core.&nbsp;

            <p><span>Gee thanks! but I do know how to access the start screen in 10, But the metro interface is gone, can not use apps in Metro view nor can you snap screens but only apps on the desktops, oh and no IE11 metro. So I will wait and see if they at least bring
 the options to use the metro interface on the next builds, and that is what I am hopping!

    <title>How to stop alert that &#34;the linked file is not available...&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cayce1  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop alert that &#34;the linked file is not available...&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have a 350+ pg Word document containing 32 tables that came from another document. Apparently the author linked those tables from an Excel file. I do not need them to be linked in my case, but the links came along nonetheless when I pasted this content
 into my larger document. Word is&nbsp;giving me an alert for each of the 32 tables that states "The linked file is not available. Use the Edit Links command to find the file."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time I need to update all fields in the draft, I have to click OK to this alert 32 times before Word gets on with updates to fields in this file. I went to Prepare&gt;Edit Links and selected each involved link and chose "Break Link", but I am still getting
 these alerts. What more do I need to do to stop this annoying time-consuming behavior?</p>

            <p>Actually, this won't work as I do have other links I need to maintain. It appears this macro housecleans
<em>any</em> links it encounters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else know how I&nbsp;can force Word to recognize that I have broken the links to the Excel file the tables in my document came from, so I am not propted 32 times whenever I need to updates fields?</p>

<h2>            Nokia i2 eGYPT</h2>
                    
<p>I have a complaint related to my Nokia mobile phone Nokia 96 .I sent this mobile for repair at Nokia i2 Awad Amer service center Egypt&nbsp; they received it on on March,11th 2010 , I was told that the screen is broken and&nbsp; a new one will cost 400 le and the
 mobile will work perfectly after. I was doubtfull that there could be fluid in the mobile as my son used it on a rainy day ,however they assured me that the problem is in the screen,I paid the 400 le . The mobile actually worked for only one day then the same
 problem returned ( a black screen).I gave it back to the on March 13th they told me they will check after a long time they answered that there is fluid in the mobile and I have to sign on approval on mending it,I did sign and after another long time they told
 me I have to pay othe 300 le and no gurantee that it will work properly!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first Invoice number was 91-000059 Name dr Ola Gamal</p>
<p>Work order: EG000008702786</p>
<p>IMEI: 354863025149801</p>
<p>Brach code:4291</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second work order was: EG000005004629&nbsp; Name : abdo abd elmonem</p>
<p>The point is If the fluid was in the mobile from the begining why they let me pay the 400 le,I tried to complai but with nor response .</p>
<p>My complaint is the support engineer should have told me from the begining that there was a fluid so that I shouldn't have paid the 400 le,and this is my claim I need to receive my money back.</p>
<p>I dont know the exact procedure of complaint is it through this site ? if not please indicate the E mail that I should contact to resolve my complaint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ola Gamal</p>

            <p>When you copy something, as long as the area&nbsp;copied&nbsp;continues to have the&nbsp;"marching ants" you can continue to paste the item in other locations without needing to reselect the area and copy.&nbsp; Generally you can continue pasting something that was copied until
 you do some other operation.</p>

<p>Otherwise you can use the clipboard to paste from. Does that answer your question?</p>

<p>If you name your Index A data range as say Index_A, and name the other 2 Index data ranges as Index_B and Index_C, and then use this table layout say in cells O6:Q6 for the column headers, and N7:N9 for the row headers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Index_A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Index_B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Index_C</p>
<p>Index_A</p>
<p>Index_B</p>
<p>Index_C</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you can then use this formula in O7 and fill across and down:</p>
<p>=PEARSON(INDIRECT($N7),INDIRECT(O$6))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Eric,<br />
<br />
When we export a notebook as a PDF file, the attachment in the notebook cant display and we can only get the icon. It is an expected behavior. As a workaround, when we add the attachment, we can add it via Insert Printout.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Word 2016 - printing 4 copies when I only ask for 2</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Word 2016 to print and from around Thursday last week, whenever I ask for 2 copies of a letter or document, it prints 4. &nbsp;If I ask for 3 then I get 9. &nbsp;So it seems to be squaring the amount of copies I ask for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go in through the Printer Properties option and into the Advanced tab and change it that way, it will let me print only 2 copies, but I do a large amount of printing and taking 3 steps to do what only took 1 previously, is causing me a nightmare. &nbsp;Not
 to mention when I forget and print 3 copies of a 10 page document and end up using 90 pieces of paper instead of 30 - it is wasting a lot of paper and ink!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried speaking with Microsoft chat and carried out various tests with them, to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks, Dana</p>

<p>Hi Acelyn</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started around Thursday last week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it seems specific to Word as I have printed from Note and Excel and all pdfs print normally - only Word seems to square the amount you require if you change the number from the Lrint Menu. As mentioned above, if I change it from Printer Properties/Advanced
 tab, it prints the correct amount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not think I made any changes but laptop will auto update, so not sure if it has updated anything. Office 2016 updated yesterday but I was already experiencing the problem them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked printer settings, uninstalled and reinstalled printer and checked with other programs if the problem occurred with them. Not sure what else I could do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks, Dana&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for that information Dana. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to isolate the main issue if this has something to do with the device or with the Office app itself. If an Office application such as Word or Excel isnt working correctly, sometimes restarting it will fix the problem. If that doesnt work, you can
 try repairing it. Follow the steps below on how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Start </strong>button (lower-left corner), and select
<strong>Programs and Features </strong>on the pop-up menu.</li><li>Right-click the Microsoft Office product you want to repair, and select <strong>
Change</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE: </strong><em>If you have a suite such as Office 365 Home or Office Home and Student 2013 or 2016, search for the suite name, even if it's just a particular application you want to repair such as Word or Excel. If you have a standalone application
 such as Word or Excel, search for the application name.<br />
<br />
</em></li><li>From the <strong>How would you like to repair your Office Programs</strong> screen, select
<strong>Online Repair </strong>to make sure everything gets fixed, and then select Repair. The
<strong>Quick Repair </strong>option is also available, which runs faster but only detects and then replaces corrupted files.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong><em> If your copy of Office is MSI-based, select Repair and then click Continue. If you need help figuring out if your Office is Click-to-Run or MSI-based, see below.<br />
<br />
</em></li><li>Follow the instructions on the screen to complete.<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Once done, you need to restart your PC and see if it helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this will help address your concern.<br />

<h2>            Bullet points change when sent</h2>
                    
<p>(I am using Outlook 2010) I have cut and pasted a word document which contains bullet points into and email. The bullet points appear correctly. I have then sent this email to my alternative email address and the bullet points have changed into the form
 of : a 3 dot therefore sign followed by a circle with an "I" through it followed by 3 alpha numeric characters. How can I stop this transition happening ??</p>

            What font are you using for the bullets? Also, check the message source for the font and characters used. It sounds like an issue with the character set and font encoding - you are using a character that is not used in the email.

Hi,</p>

We are having the same issue with one of the users and I haven't found a solution on the Webb that worked.</p>
