<h2>            Home button on future windows phone</h2>
                    There's always an opportunity to improve a product. Phones should be able to do much more than what they do now. Mobile devices can be just as powerful as small PCs without being connected to a docking device. Here is a suggestion I'd like to make that'll
 take us one step closer. Make the home button a multi purpose button. I'd like see the button act as a pointer device plus the left mouse button. Add a new button on the phone where fingers rest naturally, while pressed it'll make the left mouse click work
 as a right click. You can use this new button as a Ctrl or Alt on its own.

            <p>Currently, holding Start invokes the large screen helper (moves the view down for easy access to the top of the screen). Why would this functionality be better? It would be like those nubs on laptops that aren't very popular.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the kinds of questions that will challenge your suggestion. Personally, I can't see my choosing a pointer over moving the view like Start currently does.

            <p>Abdullah, feature requests and suggestions are always warmly welcome. The responsible computer scientist and/or the involved usability specialist (should) love such input because it is easily possible to transform such ideas into working products. Not 1:1,
 but a starting point. Anyway, Microsoft does not leverage its Microsoft Answers as feedback channel. Why ever. Therefore here, your feedback drowns in the Internet swarm. Instead, Microsoft wants you to use the app Windows feedback, which is included since
 Windows 10 Mobile. Did you go for that already?</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, Apple iOS solved this right-click = context-menu issue with a complete new screen: 3D touch. The whole devices vibrates at the beginning of the context selection. Please, go for a telecom shop and give the Apple iPhone 6s a try. An inspiring
 experience. Microsoft Mobile should find a similar solution – for sure – because Windows 10 Mobile uses so many context-menus all around. Nevertheless, that is a real challenge because Microsoft wants to create even cheaper phones, and that new 3D touchscreen
 might be to expensive for them.</p>

            <p><span>I'm, sorry if you thought I suggested doing away with the existing functionality. That is not what I was suggesting. I was suggesting enhancing the existing button to serve
purposes</span>. Make it behave like the touch pad of newer laptops of today as well as keep the existing functionality. I made the suggestion keeping the fact in mind that today’s tablets or smartphones, enabled with touch navigation, hardly a need for a pointer
 for what they’re used for.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My suggestion comes from the vision of&nbsp;being able use a phone (let me call it a small handheld device) to do everything that a desktop computer does. Perhaps, we wouldn’t do it with the same
 ease-of-use, still, we’d perform all our tasks comfortably - without feeling restricted.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is entirely possible that 5 years for now employers would provide small handheld devices to employees. Such devices would replace today’s office Laptops or PCs while connected to a docking
 device, still fully functional when not.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We now have a platform neutral operating system. Even though most software of today are not written that way, but, in future, we are going to write one version of a software. Large or small,
 that will morph itself based on the device it is running on.</span></p>
<p><span>In the near future, however, operating a full version of a software would still require the use of keys such as Crtl,
 Alt, the function keys etc. The left and right clicks also have important functions. Anyone ever constructed a medium size word document on a phone felt the tremendous need of a pointer as well. Until the use of these keys are completely eliminated, we’d either
 have to emulate them in the software or provide them in the hardware. Consumers of today are very unforgiving. Ease-of-use has to be at the forefront in our mind.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand it is hard to get a broader point across with a few sentences. Nevertheless, I’m happy that I was able to start a conversation.</span></p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There might be issue with network driver hence you are facing this issue. Since Windows 10 Technical Preview 2 is still&nbsp;in development&nbsp;stage there might be chances that the computer manufacture has not yet provided the drivers. The drivers available
 by Network card might not be compatible. For additional information, you may refer to section “<strong>What does it work with?”
</strong><span>from this Microsoft article<strong>.</strong></span> </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-faq#faq=tab0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-faq#faq=tab0</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are not able to find Windows 10 Technical Preview drivers, you can try installing the previous Windows version drivers and check if it work. If not install the drivers in compatibility mode and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Windows 8/8.1 drivers from your computer manufacturer website. Refer this article to install the drivers in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p>

            hi<br />
<br />
same situation happened to me on my N80, first retry to update the phone again with the same firmware using the NSU tool, if that doesnt work i'm afraid you need to take it to the nokia service centre like i did and they will reflash the phone for you.<br />
<br />
by the way you need to take some sort of proof of purchase that the phone belongs to you, or else the nokia service centre may not take the phone in to repair.<br />
<br />
hope all goes well.

    <title>Why does IE launch in mobile mode on my laptop&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kissaholic4life  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does IE launch in mobile mode on my laptop&#63;</h2>
                    When I click on the IE button it launches and goes to my homepage which is Yahoo - but instead of going to the regular Yahoo page it goes to the mobile page. My homepage is
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yahoo.com/</a>&nbsp;but it will always take me to
<a href="http://m.www.yahoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://m.www.yahoo.com/</a>&nbsp;instead.&nbsp; If I click on the Home button it will take me to the Yahoo Mobile page instead of the regular Yahoo. How can I change it? I am running Vista Home Premium and using IE7.

<h2>            Microsoft Excel Keeps Printing cells with hashtags</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded a template and have edited it to create a new report and everything looks fine until I go to print. &nbsp;Every time i print the half of the cells are printed as hash tags. &nbsp;However, when I am looking at the worksheet, the numbers in the cells are
 visible. &nbsp;Converting the document to pdf prints everything correctly which is stranger. &nbsp;I've tried adjusting the height of the cells in case the numbers are too big but it doesn't seem to change anything with the hashtag issue. &nbsp;And the numbers in my cell
 are two digit numbers so there's no way that the cell isn't wide enough.</p>
<p>I'm on office 2010. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks-</p>

            Nevermind-Figured it out. &nbsp;I had switched the cell data from number to accounting, but had used the numbers indented far over. &nbsp;I guess when I switched to accounting format, the indentions stayed and even though the numbers were now in the far right side
 of the cell. &nbsp;Fixed it by hitting the opposite indent button until they were visible in the print preview again instead of as hashtags.

    <title>How to RESET FORMAT a picture pasted from clipboard &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zazuak  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to RESET FORMAT a picture pasted from clipboard &#63;</h2>
                    In Windows, a picture pasted from clipboard is usually blurry. This is due to the automatic resizing Word does when a picture is pasted. However, you can press Reset Formatting to discard all the formattings in the pasted picture, and the scale will go
 back to its original value and the picture becomes clear again.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, I cannot do this on Office for Mac 2011. When a Picture is pasted, it remains blurry and clicking the reset format button does not reset the scale ratio of the picture.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can someone please tell me how can I fix this issue ?</div>

            I believe that what you're referring to is a specific <i><b>Reset Picture &amp; Size</b></i> command which was added to the
<b>Reset Picture</b> button in Office 2010. That option isn't conveniently "buttonized" in Office 2011 or other versions of Office.<br />
<br />
<i>Right-click</i> the picture &amp; select <b>Format Picture</b>. On the <b>Size</b> page of the dialog make sure the box is checked for
<i><b>Lock aspect ratio</b></i>, then change either the <b>Height</b> or the <b>Width</b> to 100%.<br />

    <title>Infopath data to Word template form fields. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bill barrows  say:</h3>
<h2>            Infopath data to Word template form fields.</h2>
                    <p>We conduct field investigations and up to now have hand written the data into a 10 page "field notes". When we write the finished report, we then have to re-write specific data into a templated word doc with form fields for the data collected. We waste a
 lot of time hand writing and duplicating data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to simplify the process, most of us type much faster than write and we created an Infopath form to use in our investigations in the field. the next step is to see if we can cut down on the duplication. Once the data is collected in Infopath, we
 would like to be able to merge the collected data into designated form fields in a templated word document that is our finished report. Can this be done? Where would we go (web site or book)&nbsp;to learn how.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, is there an android app that will allow us to use our infopath form on a portable device (tablet or phone) while in the field?</p>

            <p>For your second question, you might consider making your InfoPath form into a web-enabled form that is hosted on a SharePoint site. This will allow you to access it via web browsers. You will want to test against your device browsers for compatibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For converting to Word, so far as my experience has been, you will need to add code to your form to manipulate the data, stuff it into a Word template, and write it out. This is not a simple task, but&nbsp;you should be able to find information online about manipulating
 word via code. Beyond this challenge, it complicates the deploy of your form as a web form, if you decide to go that route.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your response to my question. We will give these suggestions a try. It might be way over our/my abilities or time to figure it out to make it work. Are there any smartphone apps that you are aware of that can utilize infopath?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have attempted using cloud storage for the infopath form but the form is not able to be opened in the "office" compatable apps we have tried.</p>

            I'm not aware of any apps.
<div><br />
<div>Just to clarify, in case I didn't properly explain in my first reply, InfoPath allows you to create forms that open in a web browser--meaning smart phones should be able to use the forms. This is different that storing the form on the cloud, which would
 still require InfoPath to use the form.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To convert an existing "filler" form to a "web" form, on the File tab in InfoPath 2013, click Advanced Form Options. In the Form Options dialog box, in the Compatibility category, choose Web Browser Form from the Form Type drop-down list (see<a href="http://braintrove.com/id/129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;http://braintrove.com/id/129</a>).</div>
<div><br />
<div>There might be some compatibility issues you will need to resolve. Also this will require publishing the web form to SharePoint and making that library accessible to those who will use it.</div>

            AFAIK, emoji is a different story. The emoji font was included by Apple in OS X Lion. Since I don't use that version of OS X I haven't had an opportunity to see how it has been implemented, but the original emoji characters aren't designed for use in documents.
 They essentially are icons intended for use in text messages generated on mobile devices. Historically, they are 12x12 pixel raster-based symbols, not vector shapes. If they can be scaled at all I doubt the result would be acceptable, but if you want more
 authoritative information on the use of one of Apple's latest frills it would be best to go directly to the source:<br />

 WP 10 OS but it is a feature that we should have.

            No. When you MAKE gifs (using specialist software) you can set a flag that determines whether they should loop or not loop and set the frame rate for each frame that determines how fast the animation runs. You cannot do this or alter it in any version
 of PowerPoint.<br />
<br />
Different versions of PowerPoint respond to the loop flag in different ways. In our experience 2007 usually loops whether or not the flag has been set but 2010 usually works as expected.<br />
<br />
If you want to edit the gif you will need a gif editor. Try Google.. If you just have one you can email it here and I'll add a 4 min frame for you to test, after one gif though it won't be free!<br />

<h2>            Cannot Delete Old Contacts</h2>
                    I have upgraded to the latest version of Skype for Mac but there's no option to delete an old contact that appeared automatically. Following previous similar questions, when I click on view profile and scroll down, there's no option to delete contact or
 remove from contacts.

<p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
The Skype version I am using is 8.18.0.6<br />
<br />
I have uploaded a screenshot of the options when I click on "view profile".<br />
<br />
Although it says "add contact, it is showing up on the left panel under "people"<br />
<br />
I must say that this new version is very difficult to negotiate.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to go back to the previous versions?<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks<br />

    <title>Excel VBA to format pre-existing text in headers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hans.pnw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel VBA to format pre-existing text in headers</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to write a macro that will allow me to apply formatting to text in LeftHeaders; the text is already in the header, manually entered by others. In essence, I'm trying to automate the manual process of selecting Page Layout view, clicking into
 the LeftHeader, and applying formatting.<br />
<br />
Note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>text I need to format already exists in the LeftHeaders</strong> -- it is not inserted there programmatically; there's no macro putting it there that I can modify with formatting codes.&nbsp;</li><li>The <strong>text will never be the same from one worksheet to the next</strong>, and I need to use the macro on countless files.</li><li>The <strong>text may have any manner of formatting applied to it before I apply the correct formatting</strong>, or it may have none at all and have the default formatting.</li><li><strong>I need to format all of the text in a given header identically</strong> -- I do not need to selectively format words/phrases or lines</li></ul>
<p>When I try to extract the text via PageSetup.LeftHeader, I get both the text and any formatting coding, of which there are five or six types, making it difficult to strip it all out, leaving just the text.<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Andreas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen those codes, but I don't know how to incorporate them into existing text. The way I've been trying to get at the text is as a string, but when I do this I get not only the text but any formatting attributes that may also be applied, for example,
 this:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">strText = Sheets("Sheet1").PageSetup.LeftHeader</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">...produces this:</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px">&amp;"Arial,Bold Italic"&amp;12Table 00Test Table Title</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because there are five or six types of formatting attributes that may be in the text string, I wasn't able to figure out how to strip them out so that I have just the text, then apply my own string.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            If you don't want to create a formatted string from scratch, here is a simple way to get one. Do as follows:
<br />
<br />Make a new file
<br />Type "x" in A1 (we need something to print)
<br />Setup the page header, use "AAA" as text (this can be found easy later) and format the header as you like
<br />Run this macro:
<br /><pre><code>Sub Test()
  Debug.Print ActiveSheet.PageSetup.LeftHeader
End Sub</code></pre>
<br />
<br />Copy the output from the immediate window into Notepad
<br />Search for " and replace with "" (double each " sign)
<br />Surround the line with " signs
<br />Copy the line into the VBA editor and assign to a string
<br />Create a code that replaces the place holder "AAA" with a string that you like
<br />
<br />Example:
<br /><pre><code>Sub Test2()
  Const MyLeftHeader As String = "&amp;""Arial,Bold Italic""&amp;12Table 00AAA"
  Dim This As String
  'Get the default header
  This = MyLeftHeader
  'Replace the place holder with a new string
  This = Replace(This, "AAA", "Hello World")
  'Create the page setup
  ActiveSheet.PageSetup.LeftHeader = This
End Sub</code></pre>
<br />
<br />Run the macro
<br />Try a print out
<br />
<br />Any questions?
<br />
<br />Andreas.

<p>Hi Andreas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to put together some code and instructions -- I appreciate it. Your macro works perfectly, but here's the thing, as I noted earlier: I don't know what the contents and formatting of each Left Header&nbsp;are going to be from one worksheet
 to the next. I'm going to be using the macro (in a loop) to go through hundreds and hundreds of worksheets, all of which have unique text and formatting from one to the next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I could get *just* the text string&nbsp;-- without any formatting info -- out of the Left Header, then I'd be all set. But I don't know how to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I've got at this point. It seems I'm going to have to devise a search the string to find and remove any formatting attributes, then add my own:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Sub LeftHeaderFormatText()</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strNewFont As String: strNewFont = "&amp;""Segoe UI,Bold""&amp;12"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strNewText As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim regex As Object<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set regex = CreateObject("VBScript.RegExp")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If there were a way to strip out the formatting info I get from the LeftHeader string, then I wouldn'be be trying to use regex.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Earlier I'd figured out a way to search for font name, emphasis formatting, and size, but I did that not realizing that there<br />

<p>Hello Andreas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your efforts to help me -- it looks like you put a lot of time into the code you provided, and I'm grateful for it. I tried the code on a worksheet, and I see that the "Hello World" text makes it into the right header, but the macro doesn't
 appear to format the text I added to the left header. I don't have the skill to figure out why this might be, and I don't wish to take any more of your time. If I've been unclear about what I'm trying to accomplish, I apologize. The macro should simply take
 existing text in the left header and apply some other formatting to it. It's exactly the same thing as if I were to, in Page Layout view, actually click into the header, select all of the existing text there, then, on the Home ribbon, changed the font, size,
 and bold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks for working on this little problem for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Hans</p>

            The routines are a universal parser for the sheet headings without using RegEx.
<br />I would use them as this sample shows:
<br />
<br /><pre><code>Sub Main()
  Dim Wb As Workbook
  Dim Ws As Worksheet
  Dim Header As String
  
  'Refer to any workbook you like
  Set Wb = ActiveWorkbook
  'Visit all worksheets
  For Each Ws In Wb.Worksheets
    'Refer to the page setup
    With Ws.PageSetup
      'Parse the left header
      If Not GetPageSetupHeader(.LeftHeader, Header) Then
        MsgBox "Sorry, can not parse the header. Please contact the developer."
        Exit Sub
      End If
      'Write it back with some formattings
      .LeftHeader = LetPageSetupHeader(Header, _
        Bold:=True, FontName:="Arial", FontSize:=12, Color:=192, Underline:=True)
    End With
  Next
End Sub</code></pre>
<br />
<br />I'm on vacation next week, an answer takes awhile if you have furthermore questions.
<br />

Sorry, I guess I wasn't to plain about this.&nbsp; I want the ones in the right hand side of the page to print, it is the ones on the left hand side that I don't want and don't want to print.&nbsp; When you look at the spreadsheet you don't see these extra buttons, but
 when you go to print pre-view or print the sheet there they are.&nbsp; I have deleted the "extra" buttons but they show back up.&nbsp; The buttons are locked so that they shouldn't float back over to that side of the sheet.&nbsp; I also looked at the sheet under Design Mode
 (thank you for that suggestion by the way) still can't see the little buggers.&nbsp; Any other thoughts?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (and again thank you for your input on this)

            <p>Hi Raymond,<br />
<br />
<br />
i went to the "link" you wrote , and signed in&nbsp;https://www.office.com/myaccount &nbsp;but i got this "<span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">This is the right place to install and re-install Office 2016, Office 2013 and Office 365, or manage your Office 365 subscription, but
 you signed in with an account not associated with any Office products. We can help. "&nbsp;</span>so , i asked "support" since it might help , my question was (out of sudden " my powerpoint product activation failed ) &nbsp;, and &nbsp;virtual agent replied :<br />

            I purchased it from a certified seller, why?<br />
<br />
I Found out &nbsp;the root of the problem and i managed to fix it ; The problem was in the Key Management Service (K.M.S) &nbsp;which has to be contacted &nbsp;, And it wasn't working right , &nbsp;So it affected the activation of both window 8 and office products , Therefore
 &nbsp;i downloaded "KMS server" &nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Odd program installation dates</h2>
                    <p>I noticed that under Control Panel | Programs, 39 of the programs listed had an "Installed on" date of April 30, 2016. I was out of town on that date (the computer was powered up) and I was not installing software. Further, at least 2 of those programs were
 ones I had written myself, and they certainly weren't installed on that date. A number of commercial programs on the list could not have been installed or updated on that date either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partial list of the programs is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notepad ++ </p>
<p>InstallAware 2012</p>
<p>Cyberlink Media Suite Esentials</p>
<p>FileZilla Client 3.14.0</p>
<p>Embarcadero RAD Studeo XE8</p>
<p>Embarcadero Interbase XE7</p>
<p>Canon Utilities EOS Web Utility 3</p>
<p>CollabNet Subversion Client 1.7.5</p>
<p>Vulkan Run Time Libraries 1.0.3</p>

<p>Microsoft Office 365 - 3n - us</p>
<p>Microsoft SQL Server 2014 (640it)</p>

<p>Hi Lbvino,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can create a custom permission level as you like. Since you need to save your contacts in public folder, you may need to create subfolder to do it. For subfolders, if you are the owner, you can follow the
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-or-change-permissions-for-a-public-folder-b2e0440c-7873-48ec-9ff2-b1a20b723005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>to change the permission. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, since Office 2010 is old, it is recommended to upgrade to the latest Office 2016 for a better experience. If your Office 365 subscription include the Office 2016 software, you can download Office 2016 in the Office 365 portal.
 Please see this article for reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Download-and-install-or-reinstall-Office-365-or-Office-2016-on-a-PC-or-Mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-AU&amp;ad=AU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Download and install or reinstall Office 365</a>.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Outlook Contacts Duplicating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ten4tman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Outlook Contacts Duplicating</h2>
                    <p>In December, my contacts in Outlook.Com began a bizarre multiplying effect. Some of the mysteriously added contacts were duplicates of current contacts while the others were previously deleted contacts that reappeared. Of the ones that duplicated (I didn't
 test every one of them as the duplicates ranged from 50 to 600) they were predominately contacts whose details had been previously changed - so they were in effect old versions of current contacts. In the past couple of weeks the multiplying has occurred in
 the 11pm - 12 midnight range while all my devices were turned off. I am running Outlook 2016 locally on Windows 7 Ultimate, 64bit. I also connect to my Outlook.com account via Active Sync on an iPhone 7 and iPad Pro (IOS 10.2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Jeraldine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am encountering this same issue and the following was experimented with and as such determined that this is an issue with Outlook.com and not any client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night, I cleared all contacts from my Outlook.com account and turned off all my systems and mobile devices and confirmed on Outlook.com that my "People" contact list was indeed empty.</p>
<p>This morning I logged into Outlook.com before starting Outlook 2016 and yet again, there were multiple contacts that I had deleted the night before from OWA, not my Outlook 2016 client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this provides some insight as to what to investigate next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>
<p>

            <p>I had a similar problem in June - July last year (2016) which was related to syncing with LinkedIn contacts. Again, Microsoft acknowledged that it was a problem at their end, but it took more than a month to fix. I am experiencing the same / similar issue
 again, however it also appears that I have lost more than 40 contacts in addition to the duplication's. Although MS online help try and provide support, I am sick of having to re-explain myself everytime and then get no real answers or a solution. Extremely
 frustrating.</p>

<p>Hi Jeraldine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has been an additional response to this thread that is outside of your recommendations as a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really becoming annoying; Microsoft people jump on these threads to TELL us to use other links and then get back to them if we need further help and then go silent when we ask for that help.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the support links. I get how to delete duplicate contact so that's not an issue. I also get how to export and import contacts so that's not an issue. What is an issue is the duplications occur while all my ActiveSync devices are turned off
 so it would appear that this is a back-end Microsoft issue.<br />

            <p>The suggestion to delete duplicates manually demonstrates a total lack of understanding of the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "duplicates" appear to be copies of previously deleted versions of Contacts. &nbsp;So anyone who has deleted everything and started again by importing a "clean" csv file is likely, a short time later, to see the superseded versions returning. &nbsp;If you have
 done this a number of times, the number of "duplicates" will merely increase. &nbsp;It is apparent that the deleted entries are sitting somewhere on a Microsoft server (possibly in breach of data protection legislation) and that somehow the process involved in
 synchronisation is dragging these back into the "live" system. &nbsp;I have seen the reappearance of entries that were deleted a &nbsp;few months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do delete the "duplicates", extreme care must be taken. &nbsp;There is a danger that you will delete the latest entries, leaving you with outdated details and failed communications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to emphasise the extent of this major software error that needs urgent attention by Microsoft, most, if not all of the contacts will be stripped of their entries in the "Company" field when the "duplicates" arrive. If you are really lucky you can watch
 this happening on Outlook 2016.</p>

            <p>Malcolm, your description of the issue and the description by all others before you match precisely the experience which I have been having for several weeks.&nbsp; Having burned so much time on this issue, I was so&nbsp;relieved to see people that were having identical
 problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a Surface Pro 3 running Windows 10 and a Nokia (Microsoft) Lumia 930 mobile phone also running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is driving me around the bend having wasted countless hours trying to get this resolved through web-based research,&nbsp;my corporate IT people and Telstra Platinum.&nbsp; Today I had another go a resolving it through Microsoft.&nbsp; I spent virtually 6 hours moving
 from MS phone support to Tier 1 tech to Tier 2 tech.&nbsp; I am advised I will be getting a call from a tier 3 tech, and hopefully chatting by phone rather than by written text (which is very hard work when trying to articulate technical problems with both obvious
 and subtle aspects to them).&nbsp; Apparently I will be getting a call within 3-5 business days, so I hope this leads to a successful outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been able to rule out&nbsp;my mobile phone and my Outlook 2016 client as the source of the problem.&nbsp; The replications are definitely coming from Outlook.live (or Outlook.com as referred to by the MS techs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarities to the symptoms reported by others:-</p>
<p>1. multiplication of contact records are usually&nbsp;represented by earlier versions of the contact record (i.e. records which have been previously changed or added to in some way)</p>
<p>2. the number of replications seems to increase by one each time you retry copying&nbsp;the correct&nbsp;data into the contacts folder and re-syncing</p>
<p>3. The same replication does not necessarily reappear each time</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Not all contact records are replicated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking the accuracy of the synchronisation&nbsp;has been&nbsp;made more difficult because Outlook may choose to&nbsp;automatically link records that have similarities, some association or no obvious association at all.&nbsp; So I have to go through each one to find the "hidden"
 records that are causing difference in numbers of records between Outlook.live and Outlook 2016 client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like you Malcolm, I have said all along that it appears that deleted entries are sitting somewhere on a Microsoft server and being dragged back to the live system during the sync process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To date, it appears that responses by MS&nbsp;to this issue (as evidenced by this forum) have been very poor and demonstrate a lack of understanding of the issue.&nbsp; At best, the responses demonstrate a level of arrogance rather&nbsp;than a genuine desire to understand.&nbsp;
 We are not talking about duplicates.&nbsp; If we were, it would ordinarily be easy to fix - just delete them.&nbsp; But those of us experiencing the problem know that records that are deleted (regardless of where they are deleted from) somehow recreate themselves.&nbsp;
 Linkages that are broken, also like to eventually re-establish themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never experienced anything as bad as this with any piece of software.&nbsp; I am currently not using Contacts currently because I fear my additions, changes and deletions will be clobbered by this bug, whatever it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One interesting observation is that if you create a new Microsoft account, and copy/paste the contact records into the contact folder of the new account, the replication/duplication process does not occur.&nbsp; So&nbsp;the cause is&nbsp;obviously something that is linked
 to the user's account.&nbsp; Having said that, I hope that no one is going to ask me to change my email address.&nbsp; I did that a few months ago, having left my employer, and it is not a fun exercise to feed that through to all parties&nbsp;for which an email address is
 required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Microsoft - try to show this issue some serious attention.&nbsp; I think that we as users have demonstrated amazing loyalty by trying to resolve rather than shopping elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I fail with the Tier 3 tech, then I am going to buy a Teledex.</p>

<h2>            Outlook freezes when searching</h2>
                    Hello Team, <br />
<br />
This is regarding my colleague who is having outlook issue while searching something in
<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">shared mailbox</span>. Outlook just freezes sometimes even when typing in search bar without pressing enter. I have repaired , uninstalled and installed again but no luck. I have found its indexing status with hundreds of results
 decreasing very slowly. and it remains same for several minutes and goes not responding when I click again . Its not just with him but also with other team members while searching in
<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">shared mailbox .</span> <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I am already done with rebuild indexing. They receive hundreds of mails in a day in the folder.<br />
<br />
Please assist.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<p><span>Hi Faizan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, there are hundreds of mails stored in shared mailbox in a day and last for several years. This is the most probable cause, therefore , reinstall, rebuild
 indexing are useless. And users in organization will encounter the issue . If anything is wrong ,please correct me .</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>It is recommend to archive your mail . this may help. &nbsp;Besides ,you can try to use advanced searching. This may be a workaround.
</span></p>
