<h2>            How do I uninstall Programs that refuse to uninstall through the regular uninstall process&#63;</h2>
                    Archicad 17 and Autodesk Revit 2012 were both installed on my&nbsp;laptop (Lenovo Thinkpad W520)&nbsp;when the operating system was Windows 7 Pro. My computer was upgraded to the Windows 10 OS recently through the free Microsoft upgrade program; and since then,
 I'm having a hard time unistalling some programs such as Archipad 17 and Autodesk Revit. If anyone can help, I'd appreciate.

            <p>Thanks Deepak; </p>
<p>
</p><p>But this doesn't help me. </p>
<p>For one thing the method described above does not allow me to boot to safe mode. I was only able to boot to safe mode through msconfig. Then I could not uninstall the programs in safe mode either.</p>
<p>In the past, I resorted to Microsoft Fixit to troubleshoot and fix these types of problems; but Fixit doesn't work with Win 10, so I tried a third party software - Advanced Uninstaller Pro. I downloaded this program for free and I was skeptical and reluctant
 to try it; but I took a chance and so far, it has successfully uninstalled the unwanted programs, removed all traces of those programs and I haven't experienced any negative impacts on my computer yet.</p>

    <title>Disconnects while playing Halo 4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ninjabbehrens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disconnects while playing Halo 4</h2>
                    
<p>I have been playing Halo 4 for three days now and every day I have experienced frequent, bizarre disconnects from Xbox Live. I can play for periods at a time, but I have been disconnected from War Games, Spartan Ops and the main menu.</p>
<p>After I am disconnected from Live, I cannot reconnect from Halo 4. I must go to the dashboard, and I can immediately reconnect to Xbox Live. Then, I can play until I am randomly disconnected again. Rinse and repeat. No error code while in Halo 4, it just
 says that connection was lost and upon attempting to reconnect, it says that it cant connect to xbox live and asks me if I want to test my connection. If I test my connection, it has no trouble connecting to xbox live (as it must exit Halo 4 to test).
</p>
<p>I have tried power-cycling my modem, and I have not had any such network issues with other games during this time period.</p>

<p>Will try reinstalling the Disc two component but nothing else offered helped when tried.</p>
<p>An update also, when I reconnect to live at the dashboard, I sometimes get the message that not all services are available with the status code: 8007274c</p>

<p>Reinstalling Disc two did not work. I am installing the war games and spartan ops from Xbox Live now. Hopefully that works. Definitely not my router or internet. Played some other games again for a while, just to check. No problems as usual.</p>

<p>I am having similar issues to what you are experiencing. I am also being disconnected while playing Halo4, but if I look at my modem when the issue is happening the lights are telling me that I have totally lost connection to the internet all together. It
 only happens with Halo4 and only when I play War Games.I have checked my router settings- my NAT is open and I have UPnP enabled and have performed multiple router and modem resets all to no avail. Short of purchasing a new modem or calling my service provider
 to see if maybe its a problem on their end(which I do not think it is) I am at a loss as to what to do for a solution. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>This continues to happen to me. Double checked that my NAT is in fact open. My router detects that the Xbox is using the UPnP.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player - Internet TV</h2>
                    
<p>I have a COMPAQ Presario CQ56 laptop with Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit.</p>
<p>Windows Media Player will not show the option to setup internet tv.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have done the following:</p>
<p>(1) Tried to setup automatic download with no success. A manual download always ends with an error telling me to right click the tray icon to see the log.&nbsp; There is no error log.</p>
<p>(2) I have followed the advice in forums to check region settings,&nbsp; allow certain programs thru the firewall, manually run mcupdate.exe.&nbsp; Nothing seems to work</p>
<p>(3) Spent over an hour with HP support and remote sessions to try and find the problem.&nbsp; They could not help.</p>
<p>(4) I am out of options.&nbsp; This is important to me.&nbsp; I have a profound hearing loss and have to wear headphones to hear sounds from TV broadcasts.&nbsp; I have a desktop system where the internet tv option works great.&nbsp; I purchased this small laptop specifically
 for portability to be able to watch internet tv from various locations within my house.&nbsp; The most important feature I wanted on this new machine does not work.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Control Center</h2>
                    <p>Here's the problem.&nbsp; I installed to Windows 10 from Windows 7.&nbsp; &nbsp;Every time I turn on my computer I get the message = Control Center not working/all components not installed.&nbsp; Reinstall windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's the question -
<strong>How do I reinstall windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently the calander doesn't work.&nbsp; The email program doesn't work, and who knows what else.&nbsp; So what do I do to reinstall windows 10 so that everything is installed?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To understand the issue better, we will need a screenshot of the issue screen.</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, let's perform a Clean Boot. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135 </p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: Ensure you refer to the section "<em>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</em>" to restart the computer normally.</p>

            <p>I experience the same issue. I did the Microsoft Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 upgrade. Now, every time I reboot, I get following popup:</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>Clicking "OK" closes the window, and I am able to proceed unhindered, but it leaves me wondering what else is missing. I would prefer to not have to reimage the machine.</p>

            The '<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Control Center components not installed'</span>&nbsp;error message went away after I uninstalled the Windows 7 printer drivers, then downloaded and installed the Windows 10 drivers.
 &nbsp;The toughest part was finding out which program that was generating the error message!

<h2>            Excessive Event ID 4673</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hello,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Many of our machines are experiencing&nbsp;</strong><strong>Excessive Event ID 4673 entries. 6 to 11 times each and every second, day after day ... Process Name: C:\program files\Realtek\Audio\HDA\WavesSvc64.exe
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quickest fix found so far is by uninstalling the sound card driver in the Device Manager and to scan for hardware changes.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>There are just too many machines to do this to.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><strong>Why would this be happening and what can be done to stop this event ID from occurring?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not want to go to every machine and re-install sound driver.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Thank you</strong></p>

            <p>Ah, OK. So you just asked for the report so that somebody else could possibly answer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mind you, that could be taken as a sign that you are about to answer yourself. I am usually active on StackExchange Q/A sites and I usually put in a disclaimer that I may not be able to answer myself nowadays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have multiple Dell machines at work running this audio driver and my laptop experienced the same issue. I was able to fix it by installing / uninstalling the audio driver. But I'm also interested in a generic solution to fix this; one log action per second
 doesn't help performance (thankfully all my machines have SSDs - not so for all colleagues).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also wondering how this can happen; I was assuming that the audio component is always running at kernel level.</p>

I think error 0x800C0006 occurs when there is some kind of language mismatch. It seems only to occur when trying to use the smaller, Universal English installer. It's worth trying again, this time&nbsp;using the larger British English installer, which may contain
 the language data not included in the other one.</p>

            Hi WRD313,
<br />
<br />There is a very big mis-understanding with regards to Windows 10 Licencing . . .
<br />
<br />It does not really matter that a Windows 10 Digital licence is attached to your Microsoft account, unless you are running a Retail copy of Windows 10, then it can make activation a bit easier. . . 
<br />
<br />In the normal course of events, that Windows 10 licence is for the lifetime of the PC it is originally installed and activated on - regardless of the user accounts - say if you sell you PC - that licence will go with the PC, not stay with your user account
<br />
<br />When you initially activate Windows 10, a digital signature is generated form your hardware and that is stored on the Microsoft Activation servers in the form of a digital entitlement to run Windows 10
<br />
<br />If you ever need to re-install Windows 10, it will be no problem. Windows will contact the Microsoft Activation servers and automatically re-activate

            <p>So here is the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 10 run the Mobile&nbsp;Device Center&nbsp;manager application. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the settings, check allow connections to DMA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the Device Emulator Manager start up the image that you want to use. Right click on the image and Cradle it. Once this is completed it will allow you to do the networking on the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a couple extra steps and I much preferred the hack on installing the other virtual driver, but at least there is an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work let me know and I'll find the original article.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 won&#39;t open html files on pendrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielstephens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t open html files on pendrive</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to Windows 10 I can't open html files stored on an external pendrive. The files are the originals of a website. Other sorts of files don't seem to be affected</p>
<p>The online versions of the web pages work fine, and copies made from the pendrive to my hard drive will open fine too.&nbsp;<br />
But if I click on the originals on the pendrive I just get a blank browser window (Edge) or my usual homepage (Chrome).<br />
I've tested this with two different pendrives to see if the pendrive could have developed a fault, but with the same result, no webpage, just a blank browser window or my usual homepage.<br />
I've tested the pendrives on a non-windows 10 computer, on which they work fine - clicking the icon opens the file in my usual browser.<br />
Is there something obvious I'm missing? Any suggestions welcome!<br />

<p>Same here i have a Beringher U-Phoria UMC22 driverboard for an akg P120. And its detecting the device output for moniotoring (that function actually works). But its not picking any audio input levels. pd(when i set the device to be listened by my headphones
 through the windows mic properties it actually detects the levels, and you can hear it thoorugh the headphones, but cannot be picked up by any applications). please help i`ve tried windows troubleshooter, different drivers, uninstalling windows updates (wich
 btw the driver broke after one of these), basically everything you could think of i tried.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Felrina,<br />
<br />
There could be an incompatibility issue between the USB Audio Codec and your device. If you have tried all the possible troubleshooting steps as stated on your post, I highly suggest that you contact the device manufacturer or download the latest driver from
 the manufacturer’s website and try installing it in compatibility mode. Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows. You may follow these steps:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Download and install the driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></li><li><span>Press and hold (or right-click) the program, select&nbsp;</span><strong>Properties</strong><span>, and then select the&nbsp;</span><strong>Compatibility</strong><span>&nbsp;tab. (Search for a previous operating system that the driver may both work on previous and
 your current operating system)</span></li><li><span>Restart your computer after doing the said steps.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>You may also refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15078/windows-make-older-programs-compatible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd also like to ask the make and model of your computer as well as the current build so I can identify if there's an ongoing issue or perhaps a related thread regarding this issue. Please press Windows logo + R and then type WINVER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response. I will provide some additional information as I believe my problem has been solved...at least for the last 8 hours.</p>
<p>The initial problem was not the Win32 exception but an infection of "XP Internet Security 2012". I was running Kaspersky AV 2011 with the latest updates and still got infected. I removed the virus/trojan and everything seems ok but the mouse was frozen in
 the middle of the screen. I removed the mouse drivers, re-installed only to get the yellow exclamation on the drivers....mouse still would not work.&nbsp; I did a scanreg /fix, I did a Win XP repair installation and nothing would get the mouse working. I was about
 to re-image with Acronis and&nbsp; as a last resort I un-installed Kasperksy 2011 AV and low and behold my mouse started working. I installed Microsoft Essentials and went back to the same site I thought I picked up the trojan and MS Essentials alerted immediately
 and removed the trojan. </p>
<p>This is when I started experiencing the Win32 exception. I started researching and turned off Just In Time debugging in VS2008. I remember seeing some several posts on registry entries for Just In Time but checking the registry I could not find those entries
 and assumed that since I had turned it off...there would be no entries. That's when I submitted the Question, hoping I wouldn't have to re-imaged. For some reason I reviewed the registry again and found</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug\Debugger</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\DbgManagedDebugger</p>
<p>I deleted both of these entries and have not experienced the Win32 exception since.</p>
<p>I can only blame myself as I must have been looking in the </p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\<u>Windows</u>\CurrentVersion\&nbsp; rather than Windows NT.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your response there is some good information in there and I will save it for future issues.</p>

            Thank you to YoHoser for posting your problem and solution. Several weeks ago, after installing Visual Studio 10 I began receiving the following message each time I booted the computer: AN UNHANDLED WIN32 EXCEPTION OCCURRED IN SVCHOST.EXE. The message
 reappeared when saving a file from several programs. Then it seemed to increase in frequency on a random basis. MS Essentials found nothing. Completely removing Visual Studio did not help. I even ran Malwarebytes, which found nothing. Desperate, and almost
 ready to reformat my HDD, I found YoHoser's message.<br />
<br />
As recommended by Vijin V, I re-registered the nine dll files, no change.<br />
<br />
I created two new profiles and used one to copy all data from the corrupted profile to the new profile. This took most of an evening! Still no fix, the problem continued showing up in all profiles.<br />
<br />
I backed up the registry, found and deleted: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug\Debugger. I did not find the second key YoHoser mentioned. Deleting this one key fixed the problem when using the new profile. Now, if I log
 on with the corrupted profile, I now get the message: "To help protect your computer, Windows has closed this program." three times at startup. The closed program is: Generic Host Process for Win32 Services.<br />
<br />
Using the new profile that works, I re-ran MS Essentials. The full scan found nothing. I may still have a trojan somewhere, but the new profile seems to be healed. Thank you YoHoser again for posting the offending keys.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Since it fell there could be hardware damage or something could have been jarred loose.<br />
Memory and the hard drive are very suspect. Frankly I would back up the data off the<br />
computer and format the hard drive and re-install Windows. See the System Maker's<br />
Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, diagnostics, and ask in their forums<br />
for help.<br />
<br />
You can try these (however best to also re-install Windows).<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power then reseat the memory and check the cable connections that you<br />
can (such as hard drive if possible).<br />
<p>
</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
At the&nbsp;ADMIN Command Prompt&nbsp;type in or copy and paste :<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow /offbootdir=c:\ /offwindir=c:\windows<br />
<br />
=============================================<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;the above&nbsp;fails to complete then there are probably disk corruption issues :<br />
<br />
Disk issues can get serious very quickly so I would thoroughly check the drive now and<br />
be sure to keep redundant backups of your important data (use several methods). Use
<br />
the <strong>Advanced Methods</strong> and the <strong>Manufacturer's Diagnostic Utilities</strong>.<br />
<br />
Inside Windows - Regular or Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot).<br />
<br />
Run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />

For even better and more efficient checking :&nbsp; <strong>&lt;- Advanced Methods.</strong><br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista/Windows<br />
7&nbsp;disk - if you do not have a&nbsp;Vista/Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friend's (it needs to be same<br />
32 or 64 bit and they are not copy protected) or make one. Also your System maker will sell the<br />
physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
Space after k and before /&nbsp; and after f and before /<br />

<br />
Go into Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch screen as you startup. Set the<br />
boot order to CD/DVD to use Windows&nbsp;disks (Vista or Windows 7 whichever you have installed.)<br />
Remember to set back when done.<br />
<br />
<strong>If you need to make repair disks - these help repair Windows not re-install.<br />
</strong>Often a these&nbsp;disks will help when the OEM Recovery Disk does not.<br />

    <title>Can I upgrade to Windows 7 while in safe mode&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alimalik1223  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I upgrade to Windows 7 while in safe mode&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am currently running Windows Vista Home Premium.&nbsp; My computer freezes every time I boot it up normally.&nbsp; I am able to access the internet, and access files from safe mode.&nbsp; So it seems like a software problem, rather than a hardware problem.</p>
<p>My two options are to either buy a new computer, or upgrade to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Will I be able to upgrade to Windows 7 while in safe mode?&nbsp; Will all of my files remain intact, or should I copy as much as I can to a USB drive before upgrading?</p>
<p>Any words of advice would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I am a senior medical student, and I am graduating next month.&nbsp; As you can imagine, I have a lot of loose ends to tie up, and my computer is very important.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Flight Simulator X</h2>
                    Hello, I've recently been informed that there is no longer phone tech support available for Flight Simulator X for Windows 2006.<br />
<br />
Could someone please help me properly download the&nbsp;flight simulator to Windows 10 Home? Can this be done on Windows 10?<br />
The simulator starts up on the first download and seams to be working properly until you shut it down. Then it cannot be restarted.

    <title>Windows 10 Reinstall is Buggy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesharvey99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Reinstall is Buggy</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have a HP Laptop and it has been crashing extensively recently, I'd so simple things like watch videos or open webpages or sometimes it would just crash by itself - all of which give me the Blue Screen with the ":( Your PC Needs to restart.." I
 let it go the first couple of times but it got much more frequent (Once every 5 minutes) so I decided to reinstall windows, the blue screen kept appearing so much with different errors that I didn't bother troubleshooting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used what I think was the HP Recovery system (F11 On startup) and I decided to keep all my files, it had reinstalled Windows 10 and all my programs were gone which was fine, it was generally much quicker and booted up faster. When I got into Windows it
 was so much buggier, my touchpad was different and gestures did not work at all, the Audio was also different and a couple of other bugs, I assumed the drivers had been deleted too so I tried to update them only to none of them to download and windows just
 entirely crashing sometimes, I have to force quit a lot of my programs and frankly, I'd rather have how my laptop was before than it is now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume I just need updates and drivers, is there anything else that I perhaps need to do?</p>

            That should really be about it. &nbsp;After you first login, Windows Update also tries to go find and get all the drivers it can detect that it needs but it's almost always better/faster/easier to just go to the manufacturer's website (hp.com) and find your
 model number and download all the drivers yourself directly. &nbsp;This also usually means you're getting the newer/better version of the drivers versus the old/generic/plain ones that Windows update would find.

<h2>            Steps Recorder does not capture UAC and installation pop up screens. Win10</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to document installation of software for later package creation and distribution within the company, I was told that the built in Step Recorder was the "preferred tool"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So first off, I try to document the installation of Chrome (legacy software requirement, not supported) and download the offline installation package to a local drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I start the Recorder. I go thru the steps, close out a UAC screen, approve defaults, software installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stop the recorder, save the output file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open it, the only thing captured is the intial screen and the Double Click step on the installation executable. Nothing else including approval of the installation on the UAC popup, was captured.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed as a domain level Administrator, on Windows 10. </p>

<p>I am a father of a 12 year old and new to this X box gaming thing.</p>
<p>I noticed we are obtaining G Points when we play the games. &nbsp; What are these? &nbsp;What do you do with them?</p>
<p>I tried looking on this website - but could not find any information about them.</p>
<p>Can anyone advise me please?</p>

<p>Gamerscore. It's a meaningless number attatched to certain feats accomplished in games. Sign up at rewards.xbox.com and it could eventually bring you rebates on purchases made on the Live Marketplace.

<p>Welcome to Xbox..</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>It is called your GAMERSCORE and you get it by getting achievements in games. The value of each achievement varies dependig on what the game makers sets for them.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>There is a maximum you can earn which is usually 1000/1000GS per game although there are a few which lets you get anywhere from between 1250GS to 2000GS for that particular game.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Gamerscore means nothing and you can't do anything with it. It is a bit pointless really.</p>

<p>Welcome to the site and Xbox. Really the Gamesocre is just for each player. Some play games to simply get every achievement they can from a game while others do not. Like the others have said, they really do you know good except track your progress on some
 games.</p>

<p>Gamerscore points and achievements are fun and get very addictive after a while.</p>
<p>Both have had me playing games i normally wouldn`t have given a chance and ended up enjoying.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Gamerscore can also get you a 2% rebate on purchases with xbox rewards,so they are not completely useless.</p>
