<h2>            e72 issues</h2>
                    
<p><font><span>Hi, I've a Nokia E72 and it seems to suffer from lot of&nbsp; issue: the icon of the calls in call log, whatever is the type of the phone that I want to call or that<br />
has called me, is always the same: that one of the mobile phone!<br />
And this is very annoying because when there are contacts with more<br />
than one number type, it's impossibl<span>e (or quite complicated and<br />
frustrating) to identify the correct number to call or that has called<br />
me (if I check the missed calls or recent calls in Call Log).</span></span></font></p>
<p><font><span><span>there are other issues, frequent hang, low ram, . i cant just keep formatting my phone every month. 3.5 mm jack is waste. any speaker plugged in, phone restartes after 5-10 minutes. phone is very sluggish.
 i feel cheated by buying this phone. calendar is one lauging stock. any entry u do in calendar at a particular time, it doesnot show at that time in calendar.<br />
</span></span></font></p>

<p>i tried different themes. if u search the issue between landline icon and mobile icon has been discussed extensively on different forums.</p>
<p>And i tried using calendar without memory card. lot of flaws in symbian os v3. i was using a blackberry previously and i never faced any issues. i really dont understand why dont nokia&nbsp; respond. i believe cheap, launching untested product and then trying
 to fix it thru firmware updates make them loose smartphone market. why dont they fix some basic issue even not found on a cheap model</p>

            exactly!!! I totally agree with you gaurav5001 and Elie7... Nokia is a total disgrace!!!<br />
<br />
I have always been thinking of buying Blackberry 9700 but since i've always trusted Nokia, i had still gone for Nokia which was a terrible mistake! I have e71 but it doesn't have this kind of issue. Nokia should really be ashamed of itself.<br />
<br />
This will be the last purchase from Nokia.<br />
<br />
Nokia will be over soon.<br />
iPhone and Blackberry will rule the market. Nokia will face a total financial fiasco no sooner...<br />
<br />
I know this will happen. You just wait.

            you may want to add android to this list....since it has surpassed ip sales now...but as a dissapearing...you may wish to check the patents websites and see how many patents nokia has and the only reason many if not all of the phones work today...also,
 you are leaving out an entire different market when you only mention the smartphjone/pda market..... just a though...

<p>1) wether u call a mobile or landline, call list always shows mobile as icon.</p>
<p>2) calendar is pathetic. any 'memo' or ''to do' in calendar, saved at a particular time, just vanishes and shows up at different timing and sometimes it vanishes too.</p>
<p>3)pressing key 'j' or 'u' on the main screen shows "#" and "*" respectively.</p>
<p>4)in your song list, u can not search ur songs starting with j</p>
<p>5) closing or exiting an application does not make it exit completely. there is memory leakage.</p>
<p>6)optical trackpad is a joke.</p>
<p>7)whenever you format your phoen, and reconfigure your email address using nokia messaging service, your nokia messaging service subscription gets cancelled.</p>
<p>8)push mail service acts as pull mail service.</p>
<p>9)when a picture is assignrd to a contact, and when it is called or a call recieved from them,after few days, the picture gets smaller. again we have to assign the sam pic, and then again it remains the same for few days and after that it becomes smaller
 once again.</p>
<p>9) video ringtone assignrd plays awfully.</p>

<p>No doubt you can patent as much "invention' as you like but all these patents will not be implemented all into one product. Some patents may not end up in the phone itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia has to admit that it needs to stop being complacent and start listening to people. Its not the technology or bloody platform which attract the market, its product satisfaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia keeps on banking on the fact that it's symbian backed platform is the most used platform in the world but it is only because their phones cater for a variety of market. Eg high end, mid and low end markets. But the fact is, although they have a variety
 of phone models, their market share is still the lowest amongst the other major platforms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They should try concentrate more on customer satisfaction as a mantra to increase their market share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eg: Iphone users are the most satisfied customer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As mush as i hate iphones, their fanboys and steve jobs, the customers are always right.</p>

<p>Does anybody can suggest what should i do with my e72. i feel like cheated.a lot more cheaper blackberry curve is much better in performance. nokia share prices are falling day by day and they are loosing market rapidly. their hardware is amazing, its their
 software which is creating problems. one thing i dont understand, why the hell nokia is not able to sort out their issues. none of their products are worth to buy. latest n8 is a joke.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>now the situation is so bad that i cant even resale it. no body is ready to buy it.</p>

<p>Hi, I am happy to meet you!&nbsp; I have a partial E73 bug list at <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/CB81AC65-18B8-4797-8A03-6F8058AF4B1E">
/t5/Eseries-and-Communicators/Some-E73-044-088-firmware-bugs/td-p/904401</a> and plan to add two more, as discussed in these two threads:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/5C1727F9-D74C-43A0-BA0B-5CC711E76140">
/t5/Eseries-and-Communicators/Deleting-photos-from-Gallery/td-p/907931</a> and <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/6133D4E4-6B48-4E1B-9210-490EC2BC3F43">
/t5/Eseries-and-Communicators/Junk-Contacts-in-E73-Search-plugin/td-p/904407</a> .&nbsp; As for your specific list:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) The E73 is the same, but how recently did S60 3rd Ed. phones behave differently?&nbsp; Can you point to another FP2 phone (or a FP1 phone) that uses different icons?&nbsp; I am just trying to differentiate between a "bug" and a "feature request".</p>
<p>2) I don't currently use the Calendar much, but will test for this.&nbsp; Any more details you have could be helpful.</p>
<p>3) But how else would you type *#0000#, *#06# or the various other star-commands?</p>
<p>4) Wow, you noticed this bug, too! :smileyhappy:</p>
<p>5) Which application(s)?&nbsp; I have not tested for things like this, but if any of these applications are third-party programs, you might want to bring this to their attention.&nbsp; I am not a Symbian programmer and so don't understand the Symbian memory model,
 but it's possible that allocating and freeing memory is a function of the individual application, not the OS.</p>
<p>6) My E73 has a hardware problem where the trackpad will not vibrate, but I generally like the trackpad!&nbsp; Are you comparing it to the optical trackpad on another phone, like a Blackberry?</p>
<p>7) Sorrry, I don't use Nokia Messaging.</p>
<p>8) Not sure I understand.</p>
<p>9) I have never assigned pictures to Contacts, but will test for this.</p>
<p>10) Sorry, I don't use Video Calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps you could test some of my bugs?&nbsp; Let's put out heads together and figure something out.&nbsp; Let me see if I can PM you my personal email address...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to duplicate this on my E73...sort of.&nbsp; If I assign a picture on my memory card to a contact, and then remove the card, what then appears is a thumbnail version of the picture, apparently pulled from the cache in C:\Private.&nbsp; Reinserting the memory
 card allows the full image to appear again.&nbsp; It's possible these are two totally different issues, but if the pictures you see come in just full size and thumbnail size, I am guessing the phone is suddenly unable to find or read the original picture.&nbsp; Why
 this happens, I don't know.&nbsp; If you can't find any errors on the memory card, then maybe the phone's cache is slightly corrupt?&nbsp; I would try moving the picture to the other storage area (card to phone, or phone to card) and see if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was not able to duplicate 2).&nbsp; My calendar entries seem to stay intact.&nbsp; I did notice that unfinished To-Do events will shift days to always appear "today", but I'm sure this is by design.</p>

<h2>            officeC2RClient never runs</h2>
                    <p>I have recently installed Office 2013 on my Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 laptop.&nbsp; It runs fine except that it never updates.&nbsp; My understanding is that updates are automatically done through Click2Run.&nbsp; When I look at the Office Updates section in Outlook,
 it says that "Updates are automatically downloaded and installed." and the current version is 15.0.4433.1508 (which is the version on my installation media).&nbsp; The current version according to the View Updates page is 15.0.4727.1003.&nbsp; There is no Update Now
 option for manual updates.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do an Online Repair of Office.&nbsp; It deleted Office 2013 (without notification).&nbsp; I reinstalled Office, only to see the same behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check in Task Scheduler, it does show that Office Automated Updates is set up as a task to run three times a week or upon logon of any user.&nbsp; It should have run at least four times by now, given those triggers.&nbsp; However, the Last Run Time is noted
 as Never.&nbsp; When I tried to run it manually (as c:\program files\microsoft office 15\clientx64\officec2rclient.exe /update) in a Command Prompt (with Run As Administrator set), nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions as to how I can either start the automatic updates or manually update Office?</p>

            Hi Phil-S[Z],
<br />
<br />I’m a fellow Microsoft customer and also an expert user - happy to help.
<br />
<br />The first thing you sounds like you need to determine here is which of the two Skype accounts you would like to stick with. With this information, sign out of Skype on all the devices using the undesired account and sign back in using the account you would like to stick with.
<br />
<br />Details on signing out and logging into a different account are covered by Van_M in a previous post:

 I'm not sure what the issue is.&nbsp; I've tried the formula with data that is in the YYYY/MM/DD format and the formula works.&nbsp; But it will not work with data in the format of MM/DD/YYYY.</p>

            Hi  flink3
<br />
<br />Close Excel
<br />
<br />Open the old Control panel (click your Start Button, type control and hit Enter)
<br />
<br />Go to Region - click Additional Settings
<br />
<br />Choose the Date Tab
<br />
<br />Is your short date set to the format YYYY/MM/DD
<br />
<br />If not, manually set your date format to that
<br />
<br />Then when you add data in any date format Excel should automatically change that data to that format . . .

            Do not change the regional settings in your control panel! This affects all programs on your whole PC and can have unpredictable effects!
<br />If you did so, open the region settings again and click the Reset button within Additional Settings.
<br />
<br />The problem is that the data from your financial institution did not contain a date, that is text! You need to separate the day month and year numbers of the text, then you can convert them into a values and build the real date.
<br />
<br />See screenshot below.
<br />B1:  =DATE(RIGHT(A1,4),MONTH(MID(A1,4,2)),LEFT(A1,2))

<h2>            Root Certificate Installation &#40; WM 6.5 &#47; HTC HD Mini &#41;. Third party self signed SSL at workplace</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This May be a redundant topic, but i do not see any concrete resolution to this.</p>
<p>Issue: My organization uses a s<strong>elf-signed third-party SSL certificate</strong> . Initially when i tried to connect to the exchange using vodafone mobile connect ( I am based in India ) i got an error
<strong>"the security certificate on the server is invalid" support code: 0x80072f0d.</strong></p>
<p>Then as we all do did some extensive googling and figured out that i needed to download the certificate to my WM 6.5 dev and install the same, I did download the same and install it both .p7k and .cer versions. Exported them form my desktop I.E and happily
 installed them on my PPC.</p>
<p>Even after that i would get the same error <strong>"the security certificate on the server is invalid" support code: 0x80072f0d..</strong></p>
<p>After further research <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>i discovered that the certificates are getting installed under the intermediate tab/folder in my ppc and in-order for this work the certificates need to be installed under the ROOT
 FOLDER. </strong></em></span></p>
<p>I did try tools mentioned in here in this forum like <strong>smartphoneaddcert.exe</strong> it did not work maybe since it is for prev version of WM 6.5.</p>
<p>Now the question is :</p>
<ol>
<li>How do i install the Cert in the Root folder? </li><li>If the above is not an option can i tamper with the registry of my wm device and force it there?
</li><li>Last option can the PPC be fooled in to believing the the certificate is a root certificate?
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I am not the exchange admin hence cant install GOdaddy or any other free certs on the exchange or IIS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MOD: I request you help me with this, a lot of users are facing this iussue. If there is not solution for the same are there III party apps which i can use on my PPC to sync with outlook instead using active sync.</p>
<p>Note: Symbian, Iphone etc do not seem to have this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I use Office 365 2016, but a client wants me to work in Word 2010...</h2>
                    <p>I use Office 365 2016, but a client wants me to work in Word 2010. My problem is that I don't have Word 2010. Is it still possible to download this? It would be ideal if I could use it as part of my Office 365 licence, but I would be willing to pay (not
 too much) for it separately.</p>
<p>

            <p>One thing you could try. Have the client send you a blank document (based on his Normal template) created in Word 2010. On your system,&nbsp;the document will open&nbsp;in Compatibility Mode. You can use this as the basis for the documents you create for the client
 (I'm not sure whether it will work to save it as a template or not). Just make sure that every time you save a document, you check the box for "Maintain compatibility with previous versions of Word." If the issue is that you need to use themes or building
 blocks from Word 2010, then your task will be more complicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strictly speaking, most of the new features in Word 2013 and 2016 were operational features (such as collaborative tools), not content, so you could try creating a document in native Word 2016 format and see whether the client has any trouble opening/using
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another trick that might help is to run a simple macro to set the compatibility of a given document to Word 2010. You then have the full panoply of Word 2010 Layout Options (instead of the restricted selection offered by Word 2013/2016), and presumably you
 will be warned about incompatible features. Unfortunately, I cannot at the moment lay my hands on this one-line macro, but probably someone else will provide it.</p>

<p>(because Word 2010 is version 14.0). After typing or pasting that line into the Immediate window, press Enter. Then you need to go to the Options &gt; Advanced dialog, scroll to the bottom, and set the "Lay out this document as if created in" box to Word 2010,

<h3> andre da costa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Product Review&#58; Windows 10 9926</h2>
                    <p>As we continue to anticipate the release of the next build of Windows 10, I decided to take some time out and write about my experiences with build 9926.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span><em>INTRODUCTION</em></span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em><span>The end of an era! That is how it honestly feels to start this journey writing about Windows 10. It’s no surprise, the 90s and even the 2000s have been filled with reviews of technologies such as operating systems that
 are written in thousands of words; just check out some of our own previous reviews and even those from technology websites that have written about new releases of Windows from an encyclopaedic point of view. I personally looked forward to reading them, but
 looking at the future, this methodology of covering the latest version of a Windows release will eventually become obsolete. Windows 10 is certainly the last major (what they call big bang) release of the company’s popular desktop operating system.</span></em></p>
Details
<div>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><span>A lot has changed since 2006 when Windows Vista came to market, a colossus overhaul of a platform that almost brought down the entire industry with it and at the same time giving rise to old and new players. The Internet certainly
 facilitated the changing landscape of how we use and consume technology. The 80’s and 90’s encouraged the upgrade treadmill which encouraged users and companies to take advantage of the latest advances in computing when they became available, processors, memory,
 graphics, software. In a sense, we are almost going back to those days but in a way that does not present the disruptive painstaking migration that was always a certainty of migrating to newer technologies.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><span>Windows 10 presents a challenge in a market that has pretty much migrated to the Internet. It’s at a cross roads between a world that is old and new. Since I started writing this preview, Microsoft has released four revisions
 of the still in development operating system. Normally I would have jumped on the first build and started preparing content for readers about the new operating system with the first preview build, but I felt a bit reluctant. I think that was within good reason,
 considering that Windows 10 has undergone significant changes since October and the most recent build, 9926 is still a reflection of the platforms infancy.

            <p>A very balanced and thorough mostly positive review that doesn't gloss over build 9926's shortcomings for the desktop user and the challenges remaining for widespread acceptance of Windows 10 for Windows 7 users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where you mention the USB-C connector, you didn't mention USB 3.1, formally announced as supported by Windows 10 and you didn't mention anything about USB Audio Class 2.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bing integration was not mentioned. &nbsp;I find Bing to be an annoyance and in build 9926 I can't seem to turn it off. &nbsp;Might have been able to during install, but I didn't want to limit anything Microsoft had to offer in Windows 10, assuming that I could disable
 any feature later on. &nbsp;Is there a way to remove Bing from Search?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Darrin_736,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you buy an app or a game from Zune software it could take some time to be installed to your Windows Phone 7 (WP7).
</span></p>
<p><span>The app will be installed on your WP7 while is connected to the internet (Wi-Fi connection&nbsp;recommended).</span></p>
<p><span>To successful the app installation to your WP7, make sure that:</span></p>
<p><span>- On your WP7, Settings, System, Email &amp; Account, Windows Live and first position you entered the same Windows Live ID (WLID) as email address used on your Zune software.</span></p>
<p><span>- On your WP7, Settings, Applications, Internet Explorer and tick allow cookies.</span></p>
<p><span>- On your WP7, Marketplace check if there are apps waiting for updates, if this is the case try&nbsp; to update/download or cancel them.&nbsp;if your app is there listed try to update each app one per one.</span></p>
<p><span>Otherwise, browse the marketplace to find out your app and download it.</span></p>
<p><span>If the download app is a game, it will be listed to "Xbox games" hub.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps you.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your post.</span></p>

<p>MSE fails to remove/quarantine the file: C:\windows\System32\drivers\uhsgv.sys</p>
<p>I&nbsp;solved the problem turning off SystemRestore, boot using a CD and moving that file to a temporary folder.</p>
<p>I submitted the file to Microsoft support and i'm waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>The strange thing is that MSE reports the threat but onecare live scanner does not !!!.</p>

<p>MSE run real-time and by default you have engine to show behavioral suspect activties in MSE that if it finds something strange would ask detect it. OneCare safety scanner is now Microsoft Safety Scanner, it is on-demand scanner and won't detect anything
 real-time,it only detect base on signature and some detection mechanism, it is possible that signature engine be older that MSE if you download it earlier than MSE.</p>
<p>In any case, submit all suspected files to above link and record the number and keep in touch with customer service.</p>

                    <p>I saved a document in PDF format on my desktop using my default PDF reader, Nitro. &nbsp;This was at night just before I shut down my computer for the night. &nbsp;This morning, when I logged on, the PDF had been changed to "Edge". &nbsp;Also, this morning I went to a

<p>What could have caused these changes to some of my default apps?</p>

<h2>            e63 battery life</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using e63 with Nokia (!) MU-43 8Gb memory card - during 36 hours with 15 minutes of talk (3G off) - 50% of battery is gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: is this a feature or fault?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>If it is a new phone, it takes a few charge cycles before the battery will reach optimum performance. So the battery life should improve for a bit before stabilising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the battery life figures quoted in the brochures are for optimum controlled conditions and is never achievable in real life. 2-3 days with moderate use seems to be the norm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a look at this <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Wiki/E7AB4F5B-8678-4658-9A8D-C627FB0F8A87">
link</a> for tips to extend your battery life.</p>

<p>Thank you for quick reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phone is 6 month old and operated in accordance with recommendations (as well mentioned with your posted link).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phone firmware is latest (400.xxxxxx) and problem with battery life is with memory card installed only. With no card I have about one week with moderate use (calls and sms).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why memory card (especially NOKIA original) take so much battery (flash cards seems to be power independent)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>The memory card should not make much of a difference unless the phone is contantly accessing it. Do you have any applications running in the background which may be doing this?</p>

<p>No more applications (I hope).</p>
<p>Previously it was SanDisk 4Gb Class 2 memory card with no applications and now is Nokia MU-43 8Gb Class 4 memory card.</p>
<p>All the same even when memory card is just memory card without links for contacts or sms or any info storage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this I must to know is this a problem of particular phone or not.</p>

<p>Seems like you have already covered all the bases and eliminated most of the possibilities, which points towards a fault with the phone as a likely cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an application Nokia Energy Profiler which will log the energy usage of your phone. It won't solve your problem but may give you some clues as to what is causing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download Energy Profiler from<br />

<h2>            I get two of every email</h2>
                    I recently connected my college Outlook 365 with my old Hotmail account and I soon found that I got sent a copy of every email I had ever saved in a folder since I started using Hotmail...thousands of emails... which I finally deleted. However, now I get
 two of every email sent to me. I tried unchecking boxes in the send/receive on my Outlook account but I am still getting double emails. Very frustrating and annoying. Apparently this is a fairly common problem that people are having, but I have tried a few
 of the suggestions and they haven't worked for me.

Thanks for your reply. I use Hotmail and have all other e-mail accounts forwarded there. I sent a message to myself from my Hotmail account and only got the e-mail once. I tried sending an e-mail from my Outlook account, however since I have send/receive unchecked,
 it went to the outbox without sending. All other e-mails come in duplicate regardless of the address. My browser is updated and I use Firefox exclusively.<br />

<p>Does this issue occur with all the files or only with particular files?</p>
<p>Try to create a new docx file. Copy the content from the doc file to the new docx document and see if you face the same issue.</p>

<p>How did you create the numbering? When does it disappear?</p>
<p>Note that the proper way to set up multilevel numbering is explained in the article at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html</a>.</p>
<p>Also, be sure to clear the "Automatically update document styles" option in the Templates and Add-Ins dialog box: Click Office button | Word Options. In the Add-Ins category, choose "Templates" in the "Manage" list, and then click the Go button.</p>

<p>There is definitely something strange going on here... Just to be clear, you are saying that numbering disappears from&nbsp;<strong>existing</strong> text as you open the document? Normally, I'd attribute this to the "Automatically update document styles" option.
 If you don't mind, I'd like to take a look at the document (or relevant portions of the document).</p>

<p>Document created in word 2003 using styles for paragraph numbering. Save as a .docx and the next time the document is opened all numbers have gone. We are about to upgrade to 2007 and have 1000s of documents with numbering created through styles.
</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how to deal with this would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Asharaf,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. Based on my test and research, we can get the Call Analytics as the following article shows. However, the feature getting the data of the top 10 Skype for business users who is in poor call quality is not available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoftteams/set-up-call-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoftteams/set-up-call-analytics</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest that analyze the user who has trouble with high call quality by search it with user name as the article shows to get the information you want. More details, please refer to the link below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/turning-on-and-using-call-quality-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/turning-on-and-using-call-quality-dashboard</a></p>

<p>Hi Asharaf,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>Based on my research, there are many of the dimensions and measures in Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) are labeled as first or second. The following logic determines which endpoint involved in the
 stream or call is labeled as first:</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 28.5pt">
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>First will always be a Server endpoint (AV
 MCU, Mediation Server, etc.) if a Server is involved in the stream/call.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 28.5pt">
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>Second will always be a Client endpoint unless
 the stream is between two Server endpoints.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 28.5pt">
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>If both endpoints are the same type, the
 order for which is first vs. second is based on internal ordering of the user agent category. This ensures the ordering is consistent.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 28.5pt">
</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>server -client&nbsp;</span>means&nbsp;<span>a Server endpoint and a Client
 endpoint.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>As far as I know, it depends on the detailed satiation of the connection between users. Please refer to the following scenarios:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If there are two users within one organization communicate with each other, the flow won’t through the server.</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If there are two users belong to different organization communicate with each other, the flow through the server.</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If more than two users are involved in a meeting or conversation, for the situation, the flow through the server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We don’t need to open any ports or ips, as it is configured automatically.</p>

</p><p>Hi AndyTech21,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned in the article below, Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus (2016 version) uses Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) framework-based authentication and Office uses Web Account Manager (WAM) for sign-in workflows on Windows builds.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-my/help/4025962/cant-sign-in-after-update-to-office-2016-build-16-0-7967-on-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-my/help/4025962/cant-sign-in-after-update-to-office-2016-build-16-0-7967-on-windows-10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can apply the following registry key to disable WAM:</p>
<p>[HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Identity\DisableADALatopWAMOverride] - REG_DWORD "1"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The regkey disables WAM use in Office, which can degrade the auth experience and still maintains ADAL. WAM is a replacement for credential manager in Windows 10. WAM is not re-using refresh tokens correctly. The ultimate fix to WAM will come from a Windows
 update. If you applied this regkey, we recommend deleting the regkey once the fix is out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any further concern about this problem, I ‘d like to collect some detailed information as below for further investigation:</p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What's the version of your Outlook? You can provide us a screenshot about your product information. (File &gt; Office Account &gt; Product Information)</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What’s your current environment, exchange hybrid, on-premises exchange or Office 365 pure cloud?</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Please provide us some screenshots about the authorization failed page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Huni</p>

<p>
</p><p>As mentioned that Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus (2016 version) uses Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) framework-based authentication
</p>
<p>Office uses (office means, Word,Excel,one note, Except outlook 2016) Web Account Manager (WAM) for sign-in workflows on Windows build ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have raised the few MS premier cases for the finding out these issues, Still No resolution.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi AndyTech21,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my knowledge, ADAL provides authenticate mechanisms to Office apps and WAM is a new service in Win10 to help manage tokens for the web apps like Office. And Office means all Office apps including
 Outlook 2016. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given current situation, I'd like to gather following information to better help you.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Since you have opened a ticket with our related team, may I know the number of it so I can help you monitor the progress of it? To protect your privacy, I will send you a
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">PM (private message)</a> to gather it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.If the ticket is already closed, please perform following troubleshooting steps on your side to further investigate it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)May I know where did you configure the MFA? In Office 365 or?
</p>
<p>2)Does the issue happen to all users in your organization?
</p>
<p>3)What is your ADFS version?</p>
<p>4)Please check related Event log and provide to me in PM.</p>
<p>5)To check whether the issue is related to the flow with MFA, could you please try to temporarily disable it for one user and check how it goes?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

<p>Hi AndyTech21,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt update. We noticed this is a third party MFA provider and since each third party MFA providers could have their own configurations when integrating with ADFS server, it's recommended
 to directly contact the third party support to check why the MFA doesn't work. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope the issue can be resolved soon and thank you for your understanding. If you have any other concerns regarding ADAL or WAM, please feel free to let me know.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>Hello Leo,</p>
<p>This issue is not from MFA provider. In my environment 7 out of 10 Machine. I get this above error. Those working system and nonworking system we are unable to find what difference as they are on same build and outlook version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this issue from third party MFA this should have not worked&nbsp;3 M/C also. This&nbsp;is very serious issue in my environment as&nbsp;we have 12K windows 10 M/C. We are unable to rollout this across all M/C due to these issues. Not sure what is happening. We do have
 raised Microsoft case no help yet.</p>

<p>Hi AndyTech21,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for my late response, I was out of office in the last 2 days. I do understand your concern for the symptom of the issue and since you have already opened a ticket with our related team, you
 may provide it to me in PM so we can help you check the latest progress of it and the troubleshooting steps they already done. Also, it’s recommended to contact the third party provider support for the issue simultaneously to troubleshoot it more efficiently.

<h2>            Does word starter 2010 that came on my computer expire&#63;</h2>
                    Does word starter 2010 that came on my computer expire? I have had it less than a year and it's been working fine. I just did a Microsoft update and now when I try to open an existing document it tells me "the Microsoft Office product necessary to open
 this file is not installed on your computer" &nbsp;I can open Word Starter, create and save a new document but when I try to open it again I get the same message.

            Your Office 2010 Starter edition has <i>not</i>&nbsp;expired.&nbsp;Apparently a recent update to the virtualization manager (aka&nbsp;<i>Click-to-Run</i>) has changed some machine configurations so that Office Starter programs are no longer referenced correctly. In most
 cases, this is accompanied by a shift to orange icons representing Word documents.
