<h2>            itunes downloading from OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>I am getting a notification from the notification center on Windows 10 that says "iTunes.exe is downloading from OneDrive" and it seems to be downloading all of the photos I have stored on OneDrive, one at a time, and its up to 700MB and counting.&nbsp; Why is
 this happening?? I didn't change any setting that would authorize this, but I did update iTunes for PC to v. 12.8.0.150 earlier today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, where are these photos being stored?&nbsp; Is it creating another directory of files somewhere on my computer?</p>

<p>I have the same question. I'm not sure the Microsoft Agent/Moderator’s response addresses it.&nbsp; To be clear, this issue is *not* occuring in the OneDrive iOS app -- which is why I don't understand her suggestion to use the in-app help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue occurs when I’m using my PC and open the iTunes desktop app. Windows gives me the same message as the OP, telling me iTunes.exe is downloading photos from OneDrive.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The photos it's downloading are photos that are already on my hard drive (in my OneDrive folder).&nbsp; These are *not* photos from my phone.&nbsp; In fact, they've never been anywhere near my phone, so I don't know why OneDrive is sharing them with iTunes.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Despite this happening on my PC (not on my phone), I check the settings for OneDrive iOS app anyway.&nbsp; Photo sharing is turned off, which is another sign that this has nothing to do with the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are my OneDrive photos downloading and where are they downloading to?&nbsp; Again, these are photos that are already in the OneDrive folder in my hard drive, so they don’t need to/aren’t going there.&nbsp; And why is iTunes doing this?</p>

<p>I have the EXACT same thing happening. Clearly not a particularly helpful answer from the agent...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on Windows 10. I open iTunes, and immediately, I start getting a notification saying OneDrive is downloading photos and videos at the request of iTunes. When I look to what it's doing, it looks like it's downloading all the photos stored in OneDrive
 onto my computer...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I'm writing this out... Maybe I just realized the issue, so @AdamPallotto this might help you too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you set up OneDrive, it asks whether you want to keep your "Libraries" on your computer, on OneDrive, or both. Personally, I set my Photo folder (ie. Windows Photo Library) to be stored on OneDrive so it wouldn't take up space on my laptop. So now,
 one of my windows "Library" folders, (which are special types of folders) is on the OneDrive cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think what's happening is that iTunes plugs in to those "Library" folders (since Music is one of the Library photos that iTunes inhabits). And for some reason it feels like it has to index the Windows Photo Library in order to function - just in case you
 decide to sync your Windows photos to your device. Unfortunately, this triggers OneDrive to start downloading photos stored on the cloud onto your laptop, for no reason. Not sure how to stop it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>I'm having the same issue. I never authorized iTunes to just randomly download things. I even explicitly blocked the app from being able to download from OneDrive and it still allows it to do so.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit; because we clearly aren't getting help and the issue is left unresolved after months now I came up with a minor workaround.</p>
<p>Pause syncing with onedrive before you allow iTunes to run and it cannot start downloading random stuff. Blocking it doesn't work because it just blocks iTunes from downloading that 1 file and then stops.</p>
<p>And don't forget to shut iTunes down with the task manager after you are done. It is hellbent on downloading your pictures for some reason.</p>

<p>Should being the key word. Except when you hit block, it only blocks that ONE FILE from being downloaded, but continues on trying to download the rest. When you go into the automatically download files section of windows, it does have the block or enable
 option, but no listing of what apps to block. This feature is not working properly with itunes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also to provide some detail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From within Itunes, the one drive sync does not start occuring until you click on the icon of your device connected (in my case my iphone). As soon as you click on that icon, the files start downloading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a disconnect between itunes and one drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have on demand enabled in one drive, but I DO NOT have picture syncing enabled. So in theory nothing should be downloaded.</p>

<p>Also, the support feature within the One Drive website, if you do report a problem, eventually, you are prompted to a live chat. but when you click on the link, its broken...... so your own instructions no longer work. Looks like I have to call microsoft
 to report this bug.</p>

<p>I got the chat feature to work, explained the details, they passed me on to email based support, and a ticket number has been opened to attempt to resolve this issue (I think its a bug..... but fingers crossed that something will come of it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>A simple work around though I 've found in the mean time:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you plug your phone into your pc and open Itunes... Just stop one drive. when you are done what you are doing with your phone/itunes. re-open one drive.....</p>

            You can use the media creation tool to do an in-place upgrade repair, this will reinstall Windows while keeping your files &amp; programs.

<p>
</p><p>I'm having problems with Skype's video call option. My webcam is working so its not a hardware issue. The icon to make a video call is faded out compared to the voice call option next to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to have started when I updated Skype recently. I tried uninstalling it and then reinstalling it, but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any info on this would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            I'm having the identical problem with a recently-upgraded Skype for Windows ver. 7.38.0.101.&nbsp; On the "calls" dropdown menu, everything is grayed out but the option to call landlines and cells, and the "audio settings."&nbsp; When I create&nbsp; a new profile, it
 asks for adding a number, but I can't find a mechanism for adding a Skype name.&nbsp; When a person not in my contacts calls in, I can answer and have a fine video/audio connection (usually).<br />

<p>I'm having essentially the same problem.&nbsp; I'm using Skype version 12.1813.286.0 on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I receive a call through my Skype account, I have a not so helpful box which appears in the middle of my screen offering me options of ways I could use Skype.&nbsp; It can't be removed.&nbsp; I can see (around the edges of the advertising box) and hear the in-coming
 call.&nbsp; The caller can hear but not see me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open Skype I have "Welcome, [my name]" in the middle of my screen.&nbsp; In the upper left hand corner I have my photo and next to that are icons for notifications, contacts, calls, and settings.&nbsp; I don't see a connection status icon anywhere except next
 to the names in my contact list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open settings, under video, I find 'No Device found' "Skype can't find a camera attached to your device".&nbsp; However, the camera works fine for all other VoIP on my computer (ZOOM, VSEE, etc.).&nbsp; I've had this problem ever since I upgraded to Office 365.&nbsp;
 How do I get Skype to recognize that there is a functioning camera on my computer?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Canon 5D mk II RAW images are randomly corrupted when importing to hard disc on Windows 7 64 bit</h2>
                    <div>
I'm one more totally frustrated Windows 7 user having exactly same issues as people here.</div>
<div>
Windows 7 64 bit + Canon 5D MkII RAW = corrupted pictures!!!&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I never had any this kind of file corruption issues with Windows XP before (same PC HW)... unfortunately i updated now to Windows 7 and there is no way back anymore :(</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I have run lots of tests to figure out if this corruption is hardware issue, but according to tests results there is nothing wrong with my disks and hardware and everything else works fine.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I have also tested importing RAW images from 5D using USB cable, USB card reader and even my NAS (first loading the images to my Mac and from Mac to NAS) and same corruption occurs randomly only when i copy the files to Windows (originals in Mac are ok)</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I also have Lightroom 3.4.1 on my PC but same corruption occurs also with Picasa for example (so this does not look like Adobe issue).&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
So... Any fixes to this or comments/instructions from Microsoft?</div>
<div>
What should i do???</div>
<div>

<p><span>Download the Canon Codec from the website and see if the issue is resolved or not.

</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Look for a file called <b><span><span>Canon RAW Codec 1.9.0</span></span>
</b>from the Software section. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can also check the images on a different computer which has Windows 7 operating system</span></p>

            I have had the same issue with my Nikon D90 and Nefs.&nbsp; I use Photo Mechanic to ingest the images and have never had a problem before.&nbsp; Now, the thumbnails are corrupted and will not open.&nbsp; If they do, they are very low rez.&nbsp; The NEFs open fine in Nikon's
 Capture NX.&nbsp; This started after I installed Microsoft's RAW codec recently to be able to view thumbnails of NEFs in Windows Explorer.&nbsp; After uninstalling it, the problem persists.<br />

    <title>Loss of internet access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mortybob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Loss of internet access</h2>
                    I have a netbook which came with Windows 7, and stayed connected to the internet by Wi-Fi from my wireless router with no problem. Since upgrading to Windows 10, I will lose internet access every hour or so for no apparent reason. When I run diagnostics,
 I get a message that either "The default gateway is not available" or that there is a&nbsp;"Problem with wireless adapter or access point". The diagnostic program corrects the&nbsp;problem by resetting the Wi-Fi adapter, but 1/2 to 1 hour later the access is lost again,
 with the same result. Any suggestions?

<h2>            How do I install MGI PhotoSuite on Windows 10 from disk&#63;  Compatibility Mode not available.</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Windows 10 on my pc.&nbsp; I tried to install MGI PhotoSuite III SE and it went all the way through Install Shield 100% and then *poof*, it all stopped but it's not in my computer anywhere.&nbsp; I looked all over the internet and there were suggestions
 to run it in Compatibility Mode but that feature isn't available when I click on the .exe file on the disk to install it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to install MGI PhotoSuite III SE on Windows 10 at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose the topic "Windows Settings" because it came the closest to this topic in the drop-down list.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>MGI PhotoSuit is a very old application designed to work with legacy versions of Windows and may not work with newer versions especially Windows 10, however there should be an option to run the application
 in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the steps mentioned in the link to try using the application in compatibility mode.</span></p>

<p>When I tried to Install MGI Photosuite, it says that it has 100% completed "Install Shield."&nbsp; To me, that means that Windows 10 or MGI Photosuite is telling me that it was installed but I can't find it anywhere.&nbsp; It's not listed in Applications, Programs
 or in Program Files or Program Files (x86) on my C drive and there's no icon on my desktop for it.&nbsp; I, therefore, can't try compatibility mode.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the instructions.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the highest compatibility mode is Windows 8 and I have Windows 10.&nbsp; In Windows 8 compatibility mode, MGI installed but when I opened the program and I tried to load a photo, I received about 10 error messages
 that said "the value of properties ****** is null or undefined, not a function object," so the program is unuseable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's too bad because MGI was one of the best picture editing programs available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying.&nbsp; Appreciate it.</p>

<p><span>Hi DeniseJM,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the reply.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It seems that the app is not compatible with Windows 10. However, you may want to search the Microsoft Store for the desired app which suits your needs
 and use them. In this case it would be a picture editing program. The apps in the Microsoft Store are compatible with Windows 10.
</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 comes inbuilt with Photo app, the Photo app will combine both on-device photos as well as those located on a user's OneDrive account, and
 eliminates any duplicate photos. The app will also include some automatic image enhancing, but users can toggle on/off to see the original photo. The enhancements will remove red-eye, balances lighting and more. The Photos app will sync up from a phone, to
 the OneDrive, and down to a PC. It can also create automatic photo albums based on time, location, but users can create albums manually.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if you got the help you needed by clicking ‘Yes’ or ‘No’.</span></p>

<p>MGI Photo Siute 8.06 runs with Win 10-1809 17763-134.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you try to install from start.exe it will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you have the CD go to the PS map at the CD and use the the &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;install. exe file in this map.</p>
<p>It will install and use the Win Xp ( serv pack 2 ) compatebillety mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use it only for print to my Canon Cp1300 postcard printer, it is easy to use so as in the past for my Sony Dpp-sv55.</p>
<p>Sony didn't made drivers for Win 10 so this prt will not work so far i know</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't try to install the Video Wave but may be it will work if you go to the VW map and use there the install.exe file.</p>

            As I and the Error you received have suggested, you need to contact Xbox support so they can view your account to see what's preventing you from the purchase and help fix it. This is the fastest way to resolve this issue.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
BTW, I don't know when you've tried to do this but Xbox Live is currently having problems with purchases:&nbsp;https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status

    <title>Surface Integration Driver Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlie redhead  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Integration Driver Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I look at Device Manager it says that there is an error with the Surface Integration Driver.</p>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
<p>Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing. (Code 39)</p>
<br />
{Unable to Load Device Driver}<br />
%hs device driver could not be loaded.<br />
Error Status was 0x%x<br />
<p>
</p><p>Also my micro sd card reader is not working. I am not sure if that has anything to do with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated! :)</p>

            Hi FreyamMehta7 
<br />
<br />VB Scripting could achieve this, but you would need a good understanding of VB, Macros can only run inside the application they are coded in
<br />
<br />There is a free utility called AutoIt, it can be used to record that chain of events, and then create an executable file you can add to your startup, which would then perform those steps for you
<br />
<br />There is a small learning curve with AutoIt, but the software manufacturer provides great help and lots of scripting examples . . .

<p>Hey!</p>
<p>I tried AutoIT but i am not that satisfied.....</p>
<p>i have a doubt.....is there any way i can know what exactly my exe is doing when i click those buttons....so that i can do that process myself.....i have heard of Resource Tuner...but it didnt show me what exactly the program is doing......(maybe i dont&nbsp;how
 to look properly...i saw some string values and some other stuff...but i didnt&nbsp;understand it).........</p>
<p>
</p><p>if possible, can i send you the exe....its only 2 MB....and can u make the Automated Script or can tell me what exactly the program does.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. i just checked....and i got to know that you tried to assist me in my last question.....</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; so my question is that- how can i decompile an app to its root...and know wht changes it is bringing to my pc when ran.....i also want to change the stuff it does when i click the Save button and want it to be automated....(ie. instead of opening the
 file explorer window to specify location...i want it to save it to the same folder,....)</p>

</span></blockquote>
<br />
Hi<br />
<br />
The Alt+Tab key will allow you to switch between all 'Open' windows, including any applications that are open.<br />
<br />
Press Alt+Tab, hold the Alt key down and each time you tap the Tab key&nbsp;it will&nbsp;move to the next open window. When the window you want to go to is selected, release the Alt key.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
<p><span><span><span>Thank You for using Windows 7</span></span></span></p>

            Hello, you are able to uninstall or delete the Windows store files from the Settings. Go to Windows settings, then click on Applications, then scroll down until you see the app that you wish to delete. Click on it, then hit "uninstall". This will remove all the data and the app itself. If the app does not show up there, you will need to reset the cache. Right click on the bottom left windows icon, then click on "Run". Type in WSReset.exe". Hit enter once done typing it in. Restart and see if your download is able to uninstall. 
<br />Hope this helps, and let me know if you have further questions!

            Hello, sorry to hear that you were still unable to access the app files. You can directly delete the apps through the directory. Here is the directory path:
<br />C:\Program Files\WindowsApps
<br />You will need to change the permissions for accessing this path. To allow access to view the folder, please follow the steps in this web page.

    <title>Skype bot uses wrong language to comunicate with me. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype bot uses wrong language to comunicate with me.</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a Skype user from Serbia. I am very annoyed&nbsp;with the fact that I get all kind of notifications (like from Skype bot etc.) in the Czech language. This is probably because I opened this account in a hotel room during my visit to Prague. Seems very odd
 that the language setting in the application is Srpski (Serbian), country/region&nbsp;in my profile is set to Serbia, but Skype bot overrides all that and still tries to communicate on Chech. Any way to change this behaviour? Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. The Profile page is also a bit odd. The language drop-down&nbsp;seems empty, but if I open it, I can see that the Serbian (Latin) is selected.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52678ae4-371c-4c2a-95e9-ad8f99ebf6da" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52678ae4-371c-4c2a-95e9-ad8f99ebf6da" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>So I guess this is OK too.</p>

<p>On a second glance, you are probably right about this setting, but there seems to be a problem with it. Once I change the language to English and then back to Serbian, the language remained selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f539503f-7d2f-4957-be25-5152b92fae07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f539503f-7d2f-4957-be25-5152b92fae07" /></a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After I logout and login again, it seems unselected again:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b95552d-7948-4104-82a6-11c3000c4679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b95552d-7948-4104-82a6-11c3000c4679" /></a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It looks like the change was not really accepted, though I received&nbsp;"Your profile has been updated." on each change. If my selection is not really stored it is possible that if nothing found in this field, the&nbsp;algorithm uses a language of the location where
 the account was opened.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You see the following error code and message when you try to download content on your Xbox 360 console:</p>
<p><b>Sorry, something went wrong. This isn't available for your region, or the file is corrupted, or we don't recognize the format. Find more info by looking up status code 80150017 at www.xbox.com/errorhelp</b></p>
<p>This may mean one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The content you’re trying to purchase is not available in your region. </li><li>Your billing country or region is different from your physical location. </li></ul>
<div>
Solutions
<div>
<p><b>Solution 1: Check your Xbox Live account country or region</b></p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://account.xbox.com/PaymentAndBilling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Live Payment &amp; Billing</a> and sign in. Select
<b>Billing info</b> and ensure that your billing country is correct and matches your physical location.</p>
<p>If you need to update the region for your account, see <a href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-account/change-region" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Change the region of your Xbox Live account</a>, as there are many portions of the account that will be affected. If you determine that you need to change the region, visit
<a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-US/AccountMigration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Moving? Bring Xbox Live with you!&nbsp;</a>and follow the instructions provided there.</p>
<p><b>Solution 2: Return the console to your home country or region</b></p>
<p>If you’ve taken your console out of your home country or region, you’ll have to wait until you return in order to download the content. If you’ve moved to a new country or region, then you’ll need to
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-account/change-region" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">change the region of your Xbox Live account</a>. [/quote]</p>
<p>Just an FYI don't change your account region to a different region than the one you're in as it can cause more issues and you can only change it once every 6 months. Changing console region does not affect anything.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply and sorry for my late return.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1, I have tried both extended/duplicated - no difference</p>
<p>2, Displayport</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the suggestions in your link, </p>
<p>.....different monitors/cables/adapters etc&nbsp; still no success&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>second screen says: No signal</p>
<p>my surface says: Didn´t detect another display, and shows 1I2 - symbol, not two different screens</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I connect second monitor in displayport, my surface makes a sound "ding/dong"&nbsp;</p>
<p>and if I connect a TV it seems to connect to audio!?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Dell should have the drivers and control software available on their site. Please refresh your<br />
driver if possible and reboot before you load the new driver. <br />
<br />

Generic camera help :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Imaging - write down make and model of camera - double click<br />
on it and on driver's tab get version. Now click Update Drivers (which may not do anything as MS
<br />
is far behind certifying drivers). The RIGHT CLICK on the camera - UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and download the latest camera driver and other related camera<br />
software (if no newer get the same ones).<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to them and RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN - reboot after each driver.<br />
<br />
<span>
<p>Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />

</span></p>
<p><span>Then leave windows updates on however stop it from loading drivers which are often older than the<br />
ones you have installed. If Updates suggests a driver then HIDE it and look manually to see if their<br />
really is a newer one (at both system maker and device maker's sites).<br />

                    Não consigo comprar com o cartao de credito e o suporte não consegue consertar meu problema, detalhe que já fiz compras com ele sem nenhum problema. Depois de quasev1 mês falando com o suporte eles me falaram pra desistir e comprar um cartao com os Microsoft
 points, eu fiz e agora recebo esse código ao tentar comprar. xbox 80153410. Obrigado Microsoft Brasil por ser tão incompetente, a SONY AGRADECE !!! Ps: abri chamado no procom e se ganhar, vão tomar processo até dizer chega.

<p>Um amigo teve problema semelhante e o 0800 realmente não ajudou. Então descobrimos que o enderço do cartão de crédito estava diferente daquele constante no cadastro da Microsoft. E ele arrumou o enderço pelo console e bingo, as compras voltaram a funcionar.

 liberar CC nacional. </p>

<p>Ja conferi mil vezes o endereço, e nao pode ser o endereco do cartao já que eu conseguia fazer compras normalmente. O suporte nao sabe me informar o porque de eu nao conseguir comprar com cartao, eles acham que eh por causa do banco ITAU que tem problemas
 com a LIVE BR. Quanto ao fato de nao conseguir utilizar os Microsoft Points e receber o erro 80153410 , isso é um misterio, ninguem sabe me explicar que erro é esse, meu problema foi enviado para os EUA pra ver se alguem consegue ajudar.</p>

<p>Essa desculpa do endereço é mesmo estranha. Na live eu uso PayPal, mas para fazer compras na internet uso o cartão de crédito mesmo ele está com outro endereço. Desde que mudei de cidade não me preocupei em atualizar o meu endereço já que eu posso ver as
 faturas no site do cartão de crédito - então ele está com endereço errado e nunca tive problema para efetuar compras, nem em lojas online estrangeiras.

<p>Gente, falando sério agora... essa Live é do Brasil ou é do México. Porque M* que temos que ligar pro México. Será que o Brasil tão grande desse jeito com quase 200 Milhões de habitante não interessa para a Microsoft. Se é Live Brasil, poque que fica o México?
 E a Live México fica onde? Na Espanha?</p>
<p>Eu assinei a Live GOLD esse mês mas já vendo uma série de problemas... 1) Me falaram que só vou pagar em Janeiro/2012 mas R$ 15,00 por mês... e eu não contratei nada de R$ 15,00 e sim R$ 7,50 por mês... olha a zica ai.... 2) Mesmo assinando GOLD me falaram
 que eu não sou GOLD e não posso fazer algumas coisas que só a GOLD faz... como não sou? Se eu fiz a assinatura uma semana atrás?.... 3) Agora aprece no XBOX quando vou verificar assinatura que eles vão me cobrar R$ 89,00 e depois a próxima fatura é só em Dezembro....
</p>
<p>Quem é bom de matemática faz as contas ai, não bate os valore e nem mesmo as datas e nem mesmo as informação....</p>
<p>Enquanto isso eu vou muito bem de PSN Sony, obrigado.</p>
<p>Quando invadiram a Sony, recebi um email deles me avisando que minha conta tinha sido hackeada e que era pra eu cancelar todas as compras feitas com meu cartão e ainda baixei um monte de jogo COMPLETO de graça.</p>
<p>Obrigado PSN, obrigado LIVE... to só de olho..... e fando a propaganda de boca em boca...</p>
<p>Valeu galera, um abraço. </p>

<h2>            Windows 7 ultimate upgrade product key</h2>
                    I puurchased a boxed upgrade from vista to windows 7 ultimate and recently needed to re-install it on the computer it was originally installed on. We recently moved and somewhere along the way the product ke got lost. The boxed version is
<strong>absolutely no question genuine Microsoft</strong> but I am getting the message in the lower right corner of the screen that it is not. It is suggested that I BUY a new key even though I have already purchased the boxed version (new, by the way) and
 it is, as stated, <strong>absolutely no question genuine Microsoft</strong>. I don' see why I should have to spend money on a new key. Is there another option?

<p>Hi Sheila,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, you can simply go to the place where you purchased the product key to get it again, since they have a copy of it. However, there are some utilities or tools that you can use to get the product key in Windows 7. If you can still access your Windows
 7 computer, we suggest that you check the answer provided by J W Stuart on January 10, 2011 through this

<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your feedback.</p>
