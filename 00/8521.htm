<h2>            Access 2013 - Select record from listbox selection</h2>
                    I am making a Access form system that will let you pick a user from a list in a listbox, that is populated from a table called "users". When you pick a user from the listbox it will close the "login" form and open a "dashboard" form that will display the
 user info you picked from the "login" screen.<br />
<br />
I have the "login button" onclick set to make a TempVar called "tempEmployeeID" with the expression set to "[listUsers]" (listbox). From what I understand it set the Var to the "ID" of the user selected in the listbox.<br />
<br />
Then on the "dashboard" onload I am having troubles going to the record with the "ID" of "tempEmployeeID".<br />
<br />
What macro command should I use? and how do I call the "tempEmployeeID" Var?<br />

            <blockquote>I looked for the "DoCmd" in the macro's list, but I could not find it. I assume that I would have to use this command is VB?<br />
</blockquote>
<p>VBA (not VB) has methods, macros have actions. So when I referred to the OpenForm method, I was referring to VBA.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Openform Action also has a WHERE clause, so if you insist on using macros, then that is what you would use.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, VBA is much more powerful and flexible than macros. And, using Intellisense, its not greatly different. If you type DoCmd.OpenForm in a code window, Intellisense will prompt for the same list of parameters that you see in a macro. Its just a different
 interface.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Word and Microsoft OneNote keep crashing, perhaps because of invalid AutoRecovery folder location&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have the problem that Microsoft Word, and Onenote (those are the only two programs I use) display a 'This program has stopped responding' error message, after which the program closes and asks if I want to restart.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For Microsoft Word, it only opens to the document that I last saved, anything I did in the document after was not saved.
</p>
<br />
<p><br />
Perhaps this is the issue:<br />
<br />

<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d423d0ce-c983-497e-a6ff-7f91fa7d2085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d423d0ce-c983-497e-a6ff-7f91fa7d2085" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My current location is: (I set this location myself as there was no location previously)<br />
/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Documents/MICROSOFT WORD AUTORECOVERY<br />
</p>
<p><br />
The AutoRecovery folder is however, completely blank, proving that the location is invalid<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ef635df-86cc-4bc7-a4b6-3e6330c23519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ef635df-86cc-4bc7-a4b6-3e6330c23519" /></a><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is this the cause of the constant crashing of microsoft word? Is there any problem as to the current location of the AutoRecovery files?</p>

            <p>Since it affects both It could be an issue&nbsp;with a defective Font.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Font Book and click all fonts.&nbsp;</li><li>Then click on one font.</li><li>Then select all fonts by typing <strong>⌘</strong> key, and the <strong>A</strong> &nbsp;Key.</li><li>Now go to the File menu and choose Validate Fonts.<br />
(Follow directions at this Page : FontBook Lion and above Locate at this <strong>
<a href="http://www.phillipjones-cet.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.)</li></ol>
<p>Remove any defective or duplicate fonts. &nbsp;That should clear up the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that has cropped up recently, is a problem with custom dictionary.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>You could have reference to both Custom Dictionary for 2016 and 2011being installed.<br />
(There should only be one reference.&nbsp;Locate the reference to the 2011 Dictionary and remove.)</li><li>Next the custom dictionary is Corrupt.<br />
Click on Dictionary and choose Edit. When Dictionary opens if all you see is gibberish, the dictionary is corrupt.&nbsp;<br />
To fix. </li><li>Quit edit of custom dictionary.</li><li>Now create a new custom dictionary. </li><li>Delete reference to the corrupt dictionary. </li><li>Quit word Preferences, then quit Word. <br />
(also would not be a bad idea to restart computer.</li></ol>
<p><span>Now open OneNote and try. </span>Then open Word. &nbsp;If neither Crashes then you are okay.</p>

            Thanks for replying Phillip M Jones,<br />
<br />
I tried the font check-up, all fonts were okay&nbsp;CustomDictionary was fine.<br />
<br />
So I decided to turn OFF AutoRecovery in Word Preferences and now they haven't crashed nor pop up an error message :)<br />

<h2>            Outlook for Exchange doesn&#39;t sync when password is changed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am hoping someone can help me with this. I have an iMac on our mainly windows domain connected to our AD servers. When it is time for the user to change their AD account password, outlook is then also looking for the new password. On outlook for windows
 once the password is changed it syncs up with outlook. Maybe it's the way I configured outlook in the first place? Any help would be greatly appreicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hello and thanks for the reply. I actually found my answer by searching the internet. It took me awhile but this is what I change my Outlook for Mac to use. Please read below. Hopefully this will answer anyone else that might be in the same boat.<br />

<div>
<p>Outlook for Mac 2011 supports <span>
Kerberos protocol</span><span>A network authentication protocol that is frequently used to encrypt passwords that are being sent over the Internet.</span> as a method of authentication with Microsoft Exchange Server and standalone
 LDAP accounts. Kerberos protocol uses cryptography to help provide secure mutual authentication for a network connection between a client and a server, or between two servers.</p>
<p>Kerberos protocol is based on ticketing. In this scheme, a client must provide a valid user name and password only once to prove their identity to an authentication server. Then, the authentication server grants the client strongly encrypted tickets that
 include client information and the session key that expires after a specified period of time. The client then attempts to decrypt the ticket by using its password. If the client successfully decrypts the ticket, it keeps the ticket, which is now shared by
 the client and the server. This decrypted ticket indicates the proof of the client's identity and is used to authenticate the client. The timestamp included in the ticket indicates that it's a recently generated ticket and is not a
<span>
replay attack</span><span>A replay attack is a network attack where a valid data transmission is maliciously repeated or delayed.</span>. If an attacker tries to capture and decrypt the information in a ticket, the breach
 will be limited to the current session. The client can use the same ticket on the network to request other network resources. To use this ticketing scheme, both the client and the server must have a trusted connection to the domain
<span>Key Distribution Center (KDC)</span><span>A network service that supplies session tickets and temporary session keys used in the Kerberos V5 authentication protocol. The KDC
 runs as a privileged process on all domain controllers.</span>.</p>
<p>Mac OS X includes built-in support for Microsoft Kerberos authentication and Active Directory authentication policies, such as password changes, expiration and forced password changes, and Active Directory replication and failover. By leveraging the Mac
 OS X Kerberos service, Outlook for Mac uses the single sign-on mechanism to offer better password handling and a cleaner setup experience.</p>
<div>
Benefits of using Kerberos authentication
<p>Kerberos provides a secure, single sign-on, trusted third-party, mutual authentication service.
</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Secure</span><span> </span>Kerberos is secure because it does not transmit passwords over the network in clear text.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Single sign-on</span><span> </span>End users only need to log in once to access all network resources that support Kerberos authentication. After a user is authenticated through Kerberos at the start of a login session,
 their credentials are transparently passed to every resource that they access during the day.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Trusted third-party</span><span> </span>
Kerberos works through a centralized authentication server that all systems on the network inherently trust. All authentication requests are routed through the centralized Kerberos server.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Mutual authentication</span><span> </span>
Protects the confidentiality of sensitive information by verifying a user's identity and the identity of the server that they are communicating with.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure that is the way it is...so to speak. Whenever I change my domain password on my Windows pc, My MAC Outlook will need the new password as well and i manually input the new one.
</p>
<p>I just do not think the password is 'synced' through AD to the Mac like it does on the Windows based computers and apps.</p>
<p>If you need more info, I would check in the Technet forums, best forum may be either

<h2>            WM 6.1 Emulator gets stuck after the invocation of VirtualQuery</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;<br />
I made&nbsp;short codes to check if the Virtualalloc works well.<br />
<br />
I'd like to check the virtual memory status using VirtualQuery,<br />
but just after the invocation of VirtualQuery, the emulator gets stuck and does not respond.<br />
<br />
I use VS2008 and Windows Mobile 6 Professional SDK Refresh, 6.1.4 Professional Emulator,
<br />
and the application type is Windows application.<br />
<br />
Somebody knows why?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
<br />
additional question<br />
1) <br />
Is there any way to&nbsp;monitor the memory usage of a process?<br />
Well,&nbsp;Remote Heap Walker seems that it doesn't show the usage of virtual memory.<br />

    <title>Lumia 820 - Offline Map data on SD card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajd 62  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 820 - Offline Map data on SD card</h2>
                    
<p>I have same problem on my Lumia 820. Other map applications also failed. After trying many quick options i then used Nokia Software Recovery Tool to reinstall the phone software (latest black version). Here Maps and Drive did then work but I found it was
 not accessing map files from the SD drive (settings back to original defaults). I then used Lumia Storage Check app to try and change map storage from phone to SD card. Then when trying to check the maps using the same app I found it would tell me overall
 folder size of map folder but not show me the list of maps stored. &nbsp;I then went back to the Here Maps app and found it was again no longer working. Changing the default storage back to phone using the Storage Check app immediately solved the problem. Therefore
 it looks like the problem is caused by the Lumia Storage Check App and/or the SD card. My next step - and I know almost nothing about the technology here - I tried to clear the map files from the SD card in case they were corrupted. I could not do this as
 the files were write protected. However i was able to delete one subfolder. I then went back to Lumia Storage Check and again set map storage to my SD card and again tried to look at the map files listed using the app. To my surprise it started working and
 the list of country maps on the SD card appeared. Also the Here Maps and Drive+ appsare now working with the storage set to the SD card. Other mapping software eg Run The Map is also now working. &nbsp;Given my explanation above perhaps someone with real technical
 knowledge can provide a proper explanation and solution.</p>

<p>Following up my previous post I still have problems with using maps on the SD card but removing the deletable files from the map folder on the card does seem to help. What is certain is that changing the setting in Lumia Storage Check app to storing maps
 on the phone is 100% successful in getting Here Drive+ to work online (wifi). It would be great if Nokia replied to Lumia users about this problem. However I see that the new WP8.1 software will bring a new Nokia data storage app. Perhaps Nokia have given
 up with the current storage app? I also received an e-mail today from Nokia "learn how to sync". The page
seems" target="_blank"&gt;http://here.com/help/wp8/drive/coverage&nbsp;seems</p> to show that only the following phones get free access to all offline maps -&nbsp;<span>Nokia&nbsp;</span><span>Lumia 1520, 1020, 928, 925, 920,
 822, 829, 810 or 620. Other Lumia phones ie <span>1320, 720, 625, 526, 525, 521 or 520&nbsp;</span>only get home country free (upgrade required for other countries). The Lumia 820 is not listed anywhere - perhaps Nokia could explain why not. This is all new to
 me but perhaps I have misunderstood all along!</span>

<p>Hi &nbsp;, It's only the betalabs version of Lumia&nbsp;Storage Check that allows Here offline maps to be stored on SD cards. It's almost a year old now,&nbsp;and&nbsp;may have new issues&nbsp;with the Lumia "black" firmware update. Even the official version of Lumia Storage Check
 in the store has issues, like displaying&nbsp;a different&nbsp;amount of temporary files than the WP8&nbsp;storage&nbsp;check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I advice to uninstall the beta Storage Check, and store offline maps in phone memory for now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&nbsp;may download maps for any supported country, in countries where Here maps is supported, but navigation&nbsp;is currently restricted to a&nbsp;region or a country on entry-level phones. The WP8.1 is supposed to&nbsp;include a&nbsp;global navigation license for all devices.
 Even if the Lumia 820 is not in the current Nokia portfolio, I'm confident that it will also&nbsp;get the updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The updates are at least 3-6 months into the future, so let's focus on getting your phone up and running with the current firmware and maps version. :)</p>

            it would be useful if, in the next update, that the option to have the option to use either the phone storage, or the SD card to store the off-line maps.

            <p>OK, thanks for responding. sorry for the delay replying - life intervenes ;-)</p>
<p>Additional info:</p>
<p>1. It seems to occur when Outlook initiates a Send and Receive procedure.</p>
<p>2. I d not recall having made any software changes recently</p>
<p>3. I have several email accounts in Outlook which, I think, are all POP3 ones. I don't use Exchange at all and I haven't set any up for IMAP - yet.</p>
<p>I tried Method 1 and disabled all the Add-ins but it still shut down, so I have re-installed them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I try Method 2 I could do with some additional advice: I am a little wary that this might mean that I have to start with new .pst files and will be messing around with where to find existing stuff. Or does this setting up a new profile mean that all
 the other stuff is carried over? I'm sorry if my question is naive.</p>

            <p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/275e36f5-90b8-42c4-ac65-67de0e9979f5" title="ajstan99">

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to us on the community. We understand you have some questions about Weather tile on the band.
<span>Microsoft Band provides you with weather info based on the current location of your phone. The weather info gets updated each time your Microsoft Band syncs.</span>
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First, we would like you to do is make sure you have your Microsoft Health app and Microsoft Band updated.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To check Microsoft Health App update on iphone: <br />
</p>
<p>On the phone, go to <strong>App Store</strong>&gt;Tap <strong>Updates</strong>&gt; if Microsoft Health App shows up, tap
<strong>UPDATE</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To check Microsoft Band update: <br />
</p>
<p><span>When there’s a firmware update for your Microsoft Band, it’s downloaded to your phone first. You’ll get a message in the Microsoft Health app on your phone telling you that the firmware update is available. Tap<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update now</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>to
 send the update to your band.</span><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After the updates, if you still see the discrepancy between your phone's location and location of the weather tile. Please do the following:<br />
On your phone, go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt;Scroll down and Tap Microsoft Health App&gt;Tap
<strong>Location</strong>&gt;Tap <strong>Always</strong>&gt; Tap <strong>Sync</strong> <strong>
with Band</strong> again to update the location.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For more information about the weather tile, please see our support article <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us/support/tiles/weather" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
The Weather Tile</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope this helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards, </p>
<p>

            Unless you have written it down or can guess at it, the only way I know is to do a hard reset.&nbsp; Unfortunately you will lose all that you have added to your device.

<h2>            Mac Outlook 2016- Remove &#34;Contacts&#34; from the recent addresses dropdown</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>A slight change from 2011 to 2016 has become very frustrating. When composing an email and you start typing in a recipient, you now get both "Recent address" and "contacts." I really ONLY want to see the "Recently emailed/addresses" list, not for it to intermingled
 into my recent addresses.</p>
<p>I can't find anywhere where you can make this change and it's driving me nuts!! Please help!!</p>

<p>Hi Jen,</p>
<p>Based on your description, I understand you want to remove the contacts from the
<b>contacts and recent addresses </b>lists when typing email addresses in Outlook for Mac 2016.</p>
<p>Please note that it is not feasible to do that in Outlook for Mac 2016 currently.</p>
<p>I Understand it would be nice if we have this feature in Outlook 2016 for Mac as well. Therefore, I suggest you submit feedback about the feature by clicking the smiley face in the upper right corner of the Outlook client.</p>
<p>Understanding your experience helps us to make our product and service better for you and others.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

            Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br />How to repair instructions -
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Below are general troubleshooting options for Outlook. Try one by one and and check after each step
<br />
<br />1. Create new Outlook profile to rule out corruption in Outlook profile. - <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/create-an-outlook-profile-ha102749460.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Repair your Outlook data files - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-64842a0a-658a-4324-acc6-ef0a6e3567cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />3. Disable Anti-virus temporarily. 
<br />
<br />4. There is a possibility that some Add-in is causing the problem. To rule this out, start Outlook in safe mode. Hold CTRL key and click on Outlook icon. Don't leave CTRL key, till it asks for the confirmation about safe mode. 
<br />
<br />5. Login to Windows with a new profile to rule out problem in Windows profile. 
<br />
<br />6. Right click on Outlook icon and run as Administrator.

<h2>            Is there is a wired headset for Nokia 6267 with advanced remote control&#63;</h2>
                    It's default headset is HS-47, which has only mute\answer button.<br />
<br />
I am searching for a headset (wireless) with the following remote control functions:<br />
<br />
1. Switching radiostations and mp3 tracks, both forward and back directions<br />
2. Pause, stop, playback<br />
3. Volume control<br />
4. Answer button of course<br />
5. Stereo<br />
<br />
<br />
Which one is compatible (supports all 5 functions) and better from:<br />
Nokia HS-43+AD52, HS-44+…?,HS-45+AD-43, HS-45+AD56?<br />
<br />
Can’t find any of these headsets in compatibility list of N6267.

            I have adquired recently 6267 and it's perfect to me, exceptly this thing of remote control. I am decepcioned because the imposibility of remote control with the wired headset. There is no cable for this? I have got so many Nokia mobile's and always with
 remote control... what's happening with 6267???<br />
Thank you!

<ul>
<li>Reset</li><li>Start normally</li></ul>
<p>Being the fool that I am, I clicked reset. Now I HAVE NO NOTEBOOKS. It is literally a blank screen. PLEASE HELP ME, I HAVE 2 YEARS OF NOTES ON ONE NOTE!!!!!</p>

            <p>AFAIK this Reset just deletes the local Onenote cache. This is equivalent to closing all notebooks. Now you have to re-open them.</p>

<h2>            Why No Internet Sharing for Windows Phone 7.5 on Samsung Omnia 7&#63; When Will the Internet Sharing Bug Fix be Available for Omnia 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Omnia 7 is&nbsp;successfully(?)&nbsp;updated to&nbsp;WP 7.5.&nbsp;The Omnia 7&nbsp;is an "internet sharing capable" phone. From day one, I have tested it's USB tethering capabilities. And I have been patiently waiting 1 year to get this feature officially enabled on my phone.</p>
<p>Microsoft&nbsp;delivered Internet Sharing with Mango, but&nbsp;afterwards they&nbsp;announce it is not for existing phone users, that I have to buy a new WP phone??? Why, Microsoft couldn't fix the bug on time? Or is it supposed to be a marketing&nbsp;ploy&nbsp;aimed at&nbsp;making me
 throw away my Omnia 7 to buy an Omnia W? </p>
<p>This is NOT a limitation on my phone hardware and this is&nbsp;NOT a limitation on my carrier Singtel (With a simple hack, I can prove that internet sharing can be enabled for my Omnia 7&nbsp;yet without breaching my Telco contract). So, when will Microsoft deliver&nbsp;the
 fix for this bug in WP 7.5 for Omnia 7?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I seem to remember reading that activation of this feature was up to the cellular providers.&nbsp; It may be that your provider isn't supporting that feature -- but it definitely IS&nbsp; a part of the 7.5 release.

            <p>Hi&nbsp;Don,</p>
<p>I need to correct you here: Internet Sharing IS a part of the 7.5 release FOR NEW PHONES ONLY.
</p>
<p>Please read the official Microsoft Windows&nbsp;Phone Blog: <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_phone/b/windowsphone/archive/2011/09/27/exploring-windows-phone-7-5-s-web-marketplace-and-a-surprise-new-feature.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>where it clearly states "<em>if you update your existing phone to 7.5, it won’t give it the ability to use Internet Sharing"</em></p>
<p>You can read the&nbsp;complete analysis here: <a href="http://www.wpdownunder.com/?p=2682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.wpdownunder.com/?p=2682</a></p>
<p>Again,&nbsp;I have been taken for a ride by Microsoft's "true by omission"&nbsp;marketing campaign. One year ago, Microsoft omitted to tell me that 80% of the features advertised would be unavailable outside US. Now they release Mango and afterwards they&nbsp;qualify that&nbsp;mango
 is not&nbsp;for existing phones, even those with compliant hardware and provider?</p>

<p>I have a subscription to Office 365 and am having a series of issues.&nbsp; In any event here is what should be a simple one.&nbsp; I have Adobe Reader 9 installed.&nbsp; When I Save As in Word 365, and save as a .pdf, it does save but it gives an error "Sorry, we can't
 find a program to open this file." (see pic).&nbsp; This gives the user the impression it did not work, but it did.&nbsp; How do I tell Word where to find Adobe?</p>

<h2>            header text font changes when saving as PDF or printing</h2>
                    I've inserted a cross-reference to the Header number and Header text to generate an automatic Chapter number and name in the header of my document. &nbsp;However, the font keeps changing when I save the document as a PDF or if I try to print it. I've tried
 a number of different ways to get the font I want to remain, but it won't. &nbsp;Even stranger is that the Header text font changes while the Header number font remains as I wish it to be.

            Margins are stored at the section level. In other words, you will have to insert a section break; then you can change the margins for the first section of the document.<br />
<br />
When creating the cover page, be sure to include the section break in the selection. Displaying nonprinting marks, for example by clicking the ¶ button on the Home tab, will make this task easier, because you can see the section breaks in the document.

                    Since this is a winmo app, the app must optimize data transfer by using good compression. I don't want sync my winmo if I have many data (although max 200 MB provided by MyPhone), cause it will take long time.

<p>Out of curiosity, how much data are you actually trying to sync? Are you also trying to sync a ton of photos / videos (which are usually compressed files anyway)? Or are you just talking about contacts etc?</p>
