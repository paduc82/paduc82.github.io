            the E: is the memory card?<br />
<br />
go to Options and select Format memory card.<br />
<br />
it's best to use the device and not the pc.

    <title>Shortcut Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allysonwhitney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shortcut Problem</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday, I installed Internet Explorer on my laptop(it's the only browser that will run certain Java games), and it made changes to my computer. I managed to change everything back, but now I can't make a shortcut through my Steam application. It worked
 fine before I installed IE, but now when I create a shortcut through Steam, it makes a blank icon. When I click on the icon, it asks me what application I would like to use to open this program. I tried to select Steam to open it, but it simply stops and does
 nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can make a shortcut by right-clicking, but I shouldn't have to do it this way. IE should not be altering things. When I installed it, IE changed my default browser and search engine, enabled Cortana, disabled my Steam application from making shortcuts,
 and tried to install third party software. If it were any other program, some might consider it a virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is this: What did Internet Explorer do that suddenly disabled my Steam from creating shortcuts?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>who makes your 'Stream' application? Have you tried asking their support forums? Is their application designed to be used with Windows 10 and IE11?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Please include links to problem websites with your questions.... in this case the website of your stream application and the website of your computer games that are using Java (JRT).</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE11 is pre-installed on Windows 10..... you cannot 'install' it, you can only change your windows 10 default web browser. (<strong>winkey+s&gt;Default Programs&gt;Web Browser</strong>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have already downloaded and installed another web browser (like chrome or firefox) they make changes to your computer that affects how desktop shortcuts work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try restarting your computer for the changes that you have made (with your default web browser settings) to take affect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and or</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Right click on your 'Steam' application desktop shortcut and select 'Open with&gt;Internet Explorer/Edge/Chrome/Firefox</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>aside: Java JRT is being phased out (as you know many web browsers no longer support it.... it has serious security flaws).... Microsoft does not support it in their Edge web browser, chrome and firefox no longer support it.... IE continues to support it
 only for their commercial and government clients. Web sites like facebook that use content from other websites (Pongo) should no longer use it... For home use applications, You should consider uninstalling it completely from your home computer and use another
 gaming website that uses plugin-free technology that will work in all modern web browsers (Edge, chrome, IE).</p>
<p>

    <title>Install Office 2016 OEM without Live account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian d. hart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install Office 2016 OEM without Live account</h2>
                    
<p>I manage IT services for several small businesses and periodically need to purchase new computers with Office. I just purchased a new Dell laptop with the OEM version of Office 2016 Home &amp; Business. It will not let me activate it without adding it to a MS
 account.</p>
<p>I know this is a perennial question, beginning with Office 2013, that is a major headache for independent technical consultants that support small businesses, as I do. I have seen posts in the past that clearly reveal that I am not alone in my pain.&nbsp;But
 I have never seen a solid answer as to how to get this installed on the computer without the MS account--just a lot of "try this link", "try that link". This is NOT Office 365, just Office H &amp; B 2016!
<em><strong>But I already posted this question over in the Office 2016 forum and was directed specifically here by the MS support engineer moderating that forum (an answer would have been more helpful)</strong></em>.</p>
<p>I will not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add it to my MS account, or it will be forever stuck to me-which is inappropriate, since I will not own the computer or software once I am paid for the system by my client.
</li><li>Make my client set up a MS account just for this. </li><li>Pry into my client's information to get his MS account information (if he even has one).
</li></ul>
<p>But I must have Office installed, activated, and updated before I give the system to my client.</p>
<p>At this point, I now have a bigger issue. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to get this done, I finally just backed up the Program Data folder that contains the cached Office installation files, then uninstalled MS Office, hoping that a reinstall would
 give me some option to truly install without being forced to figure out a MS account for my client. The uninstallation removed the original setup folders. Good thing I backed it up, but then when I reinstall from any of those, it installs the French version
 by default! Digging through the folders there, I thought perhaps I could just pick&nbsp;the appropriate setup package, so I ran this one inside the subfolder: \office\date\setuphomebusinessretail.x86.en-us.</p>
<p>That accepts my license key when I click the option to enter a product key; however, it then immediately takes me to a window to "Add this key to an account"&nbsp;with the next step being&nbsp;"Redeem Online". I am about 100% sure that anything I do online will require
 a MS account. Beside that, it now shows Office 2013, not Office 2016.</p>
<p><em>Hello, Microsoft: this issue alone has just eliminated my entire profit from this project, given the time I have already spent trying to get this done, then uninstalling and attempting to reinstall.</em></p>
<p>I know there are versions of Office that can be activated without a MS account, because I have done it several times with Office 2013, but I do not buy VLS, only by ones &amp; twos, and I can never seem to figure out which is which. How do I get this installed
 for my client without being required to use a MS account?</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, and when I try to reinstall from the cached files, it automatically installs not English H&amp;B 2016, but French Pro 2013. Great! (Admittedly, that part could be Dell having left some prior cached files on their disk image, but it still does nothing
 for my confidence in getting through this).</p>
<p>All my users want to do is get work done. All I want to do is enable them to do that. But prostituting oneself to Microsoft in the process as seems to be required is preposterous.</p>
<p>I understand it may work OK for larger corporate accounts, and it may work for individual accounts (at least until a computer is sold or given away and Office needs to be reinstalled), but this is one more example of how Microsoft has entirely forgotten
 the small-business support professional (if not intentionally making it difficult to try to force all its customers into the large corporate fold, or at least force re-purchases of Office at every re-installation because the prior user forgot the MS ID associated
 with the license!).</p>
<p>I just cannot tell whether it is because someone is stupid or because they are arrogant. But I will recant all (or at least most) of this if someone can tell me how to get this done. In this case, I finally went online and bought a retail copy of Office
 2013 that allowed me to activate without a MS account. But I cannot charge my customer for that!</p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>I understand it is causing confusion that there are many different versions of Office applications. However, in order to better suite different requirements, we are providing different subscription type and activation method to give more options to our customers.
 Since the features for different subscription are different, you may need to get the Office Suite specialized for your subscription. I’d like to summarized the subscriptions we use commonly:</p>
<p>Using the following business plans you need to login to the service and activate the software with your School or Organization Account and you can download the Office applications here
<a href="https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx</a>:</p>
<p>Office 365 Business Essentials<br />
Office 365 Business<br />
Office 365 Business Premium<br />
Office 365 Enterprise E1<br />
Office 365 ProPlus<br />
Office 365 Enterprise E3</p>
<p>Using the following consumer plans you need to login to the service and activate the software with a Microsoft account:</p>
<p>Office 365 Home<br />
Office 365 Personal<br />
Office for students<br />
Office Home &amp; Student<br />
Office Home &amp; Business<br />
Office Professional</p>
<p>Therefore, we suggest you remove the current installation and reinstall the specialized Office application of your Office 365 plans. You can use the Office Deployment Tool to deploy the applications for you users. You can refer to the following article for
 more information:</p>

<p>Besides, you are always welcome to submit feedback to us via our <a href="http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/264636-general" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I am sorry. I think this misses the point. Even though I specified in my original post that
<em><strong>my question relates to Office 2016, NOT Office 365</strong></em>, the answer suggests reinstalling the specialized Office application of my Office 365 plans. I have no Office 365 plans, and I have no access to installation media for Office 2016.
 I just had an OEM copy of Office 2016 that came preinstalled on the Dell laptop I purchased for my client, and I needed to activate it for my client, who has no MS account, and without using my personal MS account.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, from the link you provided, I did download the Office 2013 Deployment Tool for Click-to-Run. However, upon extracting the files and running it, it did nothing. I see nothing at either download link indicating how this would help me install Office
 2016 by product key alone, without a MS account.</p>
<p>I feared this would happen when a MS support engineer redirected me here from my question on the Office 2016 forum here, rather than actually answering the question:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016-office_install/install-office-2016-oem-without-live-account/139e1c25-86ae-49de-ab1a-3d8f03218fa9?tm=1444241578012">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016-office_install/install-office-2016-oem-without-live-account/139e1c25-86ae-49de-ab1a-3d8f03218fa9?tm=1444241578012</a></p>
<p>As an independent systems consultant, I do not manage Office <em>en masse</em> on a hundred computers for one client, where a corporate MS account and the Deployment Tool might be feasible. Instead, I manage a few computers for each of many clients, none
 of whom wants subscription-based software, so I avoid Office 365 entirely. The Office Deployment Tool, if it even applies to non-subscription Office products such as Office 2013 or Office 2016, may work for larger organizations, but I purchase Office infrequently,
 one copy at a time, as needed, for many different customers. None of them want subscription-based Office products, which is why I entirely avoid Office 365.</p>
<p>What I need is to know what versions of Office 2016 can be activated with the product key
<em><strong>only</strong> </em>and <em><strong>do not require activation via a MS account (personal OR corporate</strong></em>). There were versions of Office 2013 I could purchase that did not require a MS account and could be activated using just the product
 key.</p>
<p>I cannot use&nbsp; my own MS account to activate Office 2016, or the activation will be tied to my MS account, which is, of course, entirely inappropriate, since I do not own the software on the computer that I purchase for resale to my client. But it is equally
 inappropriate for me to set up a MS account for my client using his e-mail address, to say nothing of the fact that I have to get his birth date and potentially have access to his e-mail account in order to do so. For example, I do much of my work at night,
 and I had to configure that new Dell computer last night. I was not about to call my client at midnight so I can get his birthdate to set up a MS account or ask him for his MS account logon information--just so I can get Office 2016 installed and get his computer
 shipped to him today.</p>
<p>I have now spent several hours on this, where it should have taken about 10 seconds to just enter the product key and have the product auto-activate. In fact, in this case, I lost so much time that I finally removed Office 2016 entirely, then went online
 last night and purchased a downloadable copy of retail Office 2013 that I could activate with a product key only. But I cannot charge my client for that software.</p>
<p>Thanks to Microsoft, any profit I could have made on this computer sale has been eliminated, and I now have a Dell OEM Office 2016 product keycard sitting on my desk that cannot be installed anywhere without a MS account so I can re-download the installation
 package. Can someone please direct me to the OEM and/or retail&nbsp; versions of Office that have none of this account-related activation? I do not want to go through this pain next time!</p>

<p>Eric,</p>
<p>I'm in an internal IT department, rather than being an outside contractor, as Brian is, but this is causing us just as many problems. &nbsp;We buy machines for our users, making sure that all appropriate licenses are purchased with the machine, and then we do
 the activation of products and initial machine configuration before giving them to our users. &nbsp;But we can't simply go online and activate Office anymore, even though we buy it with _every_ machine.</p>
<p>Removing the ability to simply activate a purchased product using a valid activation key is less choice, not more choice. &nbsp;The extra time and hassle to set up a separate account for each machine is considerable and costly, and since we pay for our e-mail
 on a per mailbox basis, this raises our costs on a perpetual basis.</p>
<p>Using volume licensing raises our costs as the VL licenses cost more than the OEM licenses. If I go to KMS, I also get to spend about $1,000 for a Windows server license to host it, not to mention the cost of the hardware and/or hypervisor on which it's
 installed. &nbsp;I need to pay to keep warranties in place for that platform, and I need to pay someone to administer it. &nbsp; We haven't already gone to a KMS model because there was no advantage to us in spending more time and money to get what is ultimately the
 same Office product.</p>
<p>A method of software activation in use for the last 13 years no longer works. &nbsp;From where I stand, this is a forced change of process accompanied by a forced cost increase, not a wider choice.</p>
<p>John </p>

<p>John and Brian,</p>
<p>We are discovering the same issue as well. &nbsp;I have read that there is a limit of 10 activations per MS account. &nbsp;Does Microsoft really believe that this is sustainable? &nbsp;No, of course not. &nbsp;This is how they force our hand and make us purchase VL rather than
 OEM. &nbsp;They know that they have to keep the price point low on the OEM side in order to make the retail price affordable or customers in the stores wont purchase it. &nbsp;But for us as businesses, they dont care. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that I am completely wrong and this whole issue can be avoided by a simple procedure. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I will update this thread if I find a solution/workaround. &nbsp;I hope others will do the same. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Guys,</p>
<p>I ran across this thread today looking for answers. &nbsp;I set up the workstations here at work, and bought a Dell with pre-installed Office Home &amp; Business 2016 (NOT 365). &nbsp;Guess what?! &nbsp;When I attempt to activate Office by creating an account, I get a message
 that Office isn't associated with my account. &nbsp;Help desk says I should create the account with the email on file with Dell. &nbsp;After that didn't work, I was told &nbsp;I need to get the associated account information from Dell. &nbsp;As if that would make any sense for
 this license to be tied to some Dell email address that I can't even access. &nbsp;I have two more laptops in boxes waiting on me that will have this same problem. &nbsp;HELP!

<p>Update: &nbsp;I found out what email address my keys were associated with from MS and contacted Dell. &nbsp;Dell has to request new product keys from MS, and then send to us. &nbsp;However, that still doesn't solve having to create an associated email account tied to them.</p>

<p>LeonhardtPipe,</p>
<p>You've come across what we've been complaining about, above. &nbsp;The 'account' that it's asking you to associate with Office is a Microsoft Live account. &nbsp;You're expected to create one Microsoft account per copy of Office 2016 you need to activate. &nbsp;The copy
 of Office 2016 is thus tied to that account. &nbsp;It seems that the suggested alternative is to put up a KMS (Key Management System) server within your AD environment, at your cost, of course. &nbsp;Doing the online activation of the product, using the product key
 provided with the product, is no longer possible without providing the Microsoft Live account credentials. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have something of a solution. After setting up the PC's, I use the key on the *** Email address is removed for privacy ***/org and then office 2016 will NOT be activated for other users on the PC, don't know how that is supposed to work out, but then you try to activate again,
 and fail enough times that it asks for a phone activation. after you activate over the phone, office will be activated as you would expect.</p>
<p>I share in this pain though. I don't see how I can run an install of office 2013/2016 as a stand alone without Microsoft account. I have situations where the PC's have multiple users, so neither one of them can have the office licence, because if they leave
 the organization, so does our office install? I also cant keep putting these on the administrator account, because there is no detailed information, just when it was claimed. so i set up 10 pc's that day, its a guessing game come reinstall time.</p>
<p>I'm glad I found this thread, because I cant seem to find any information on this.</p>

    <title>How to customize quick access toolbar for single workbook&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to customize quick access toolbar for single workbook&#63;</h2>
                    I customized the Quick Access Toolbar (QAT) with the setting on "For &lt;my workbook name&gt;" instead of "For all documents", and I added some simple tool buttons. Once I saved, closed, and reopened the workbook, the tools are no longer on the QAT. I had the
 impression that I was creating a customization for that particular workbook. Why did the buttons not reappear when I reopened the workbook?

We're sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused. Let me try to help you. I suggest that you should have the latest version of Outlook connector installed to make sure that this is not contributing to the problem. You can also check your internet connection
 status to make sure that this is not also causing the problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Are you getting an error when you try to remove and re-add your account in Outlook.com? If so, it would be better if you could give us the exact error message for investigation.<br />
<br />

<br />
We understand how it feels to be experiencing the same situation. Have you tried removing and adding your account back to Outlook 2010? If not, I suggest that you do so to see if this resolves the problem. Please refer to the steps in this

            Hi - I am having the same issue.&nbsp; Started about 4 days ago.<br />
<br />
Have tried all sorts of other fixes suggested in the post I made a couple of days ago - none of which have worked.<br />
<br />
Today I removed my Outlook Hotmail account from Outlook 2010 and then added the account back in.&nbsp;&nbsp; It synced everything perfectly, but now won't sync again and have the 'limited connectivity' message.<br />
<br />
What is going wrong?&nbsp; How do you get it fixed?&nbsp; This is just not good enough for a company like Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I need an answer.<br />

            <p>I am having the same problem.&nbsp; It just seemed to come out of nowhere a couple of days ago, and appears to be tied to an automatic update that came thru.&nbsp; I am now resorting to Hotmail to read my messages, which is not as elegant.&nbsp; I am also considering NOT
 buying the Slate I have been looking at, given that the other posts related to this issue seem to indicate that Microsoft is not very good at responding clearly to what appears to be more than an isolated issue.&nbsp; Here are the messages I receive when trying
 to execute a receive msgs:</p>
<ul>
<li><br />
Task&nbsp;[my e-mail address]&nbsp;reported error (0x8004102A) : 'Error with Send/Receive.&nbsp; There was an error synchronizing your folder hierarchy. Error : 80041003.'<br />
Task&nbsp;[my e-mail address]&nbsp;reported error (0x80041003) : 'The server reported a temporary error.&nbsp; Error: 5102. Server. Xfs request 'SyncBinary' failed. Response code: 'DbError', server response: '720&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0'<br />
AuxData (Base64): [very long string of characters]</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can Microsoft please provide very clear, step-by-step, instructions, that a computer illiterate can follow,&nbsp;to correct this?&nbsp; Or maybe an update that everyone can use that will run all the necessary steps to ensure clearing this up?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            I posted the exact same issue on another forum two days ago, <strong><em>''I'm not receiving emails to my PC Inbox, though they are received on iPad Inbox''</em></strong> I've also spoken to some tech guys who have suggested that this is not a user issue
 but a MS&nbsp;one and is centred on their servers, only they can put in&nbsp; the remediation, unfortunately I'm unsure how they get to know about these types of issues, it can't be via this forum or they would have got it sorted by now.

<p>I notice that some of the respondents in the threads are identified as Microsoft related individuals..&nbsp; It would be my hope that they know how to get this issue to the right people to get it fixed asap.

    <title>Outlook android app inbox empty - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> perkilicious  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook android app inbox empty</h2>
                    <p>Over the last week the outlook android app on my phone no longer syncs any emails to my inbox. The message is "You have reached inbox zero." &nbsp;if I log in to Outlook.com all my emails are there, add they are when I use Outlook desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling and re-adding my account and the issue remains. I may have to look for another mail app unless this can be fixed as the app is currently useless to me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In that case you should switch to a "bigger hammer":&nbsp; Uninstall and re-install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need the 25 character product key and installation file BEFORE uninstalling! We can provide tips on how to get either one if you need help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First time try uninstalling from the Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features</p>
<p>
</p><p>If after re-installing, it still does not work, uninstall using option 2 on following page, the "Fix It"</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Uninstall from Control Panel</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Uninstall using Fix it<br />

<p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Remove manually</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2 in this tip does a more thorough job that the “normal” uninstall via Programs and Features (aka Method 2 in the tip). The Normal uninstall is designed with the assumption that you will be re-installing Office. It does NOT delete
 everything. It leaves configuration files like NORMAL.DOTM and other templates etc. and it also leaves configuration Registry entries. These “carry-overs” may contain corruption that is causing your problem.</p>

            <p>My preference for doing this in all versions of Word is to use MacroButton NoMacro fields. The instructions at
<a href="http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/TblsFldsFms/UsingMacroButton.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/TblsFldsFms/UsingMacroButton.htm</a>&nbsp;apply generally to all versions. If you want to insert this through the Field dialog,&nbsp; you'll find it at Insert | Text | Quick
 Parts | Field, but it is much more efficient just to type the field syntax, select it, and press Ctrl+F9 to convert it to a field.</p>
<p>So, for example, you'd type:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MacroButton NoMacro [Click here and type name]</p>
<p>Then select that entire string and press Ctrl+F9, which produces:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ MacroButton NoMacro [Click here and type name] }</p>
<p>Click on that and press F9 or Alt+F9 to update/toggle the field, and you'll just see:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Click here and type name]</p>
<p>When you click on that, the entire field is selected, so anything you type there replaces it. This is backward-compatible with all previous versions.</p>

                    Not sure what we did, but highlighted cells that were gray are now green.&nbsp; A chart we made went from basic colors to shades of blue, green and yellow.&nbsp; Tested from Word, and no problem; definitely within Excel.&nbsp; Typed one line, highlighted it red and keep
 printing it after changing different colors schemes, formats, etc.; the red highlight kept printing out yellow.&nbsp; I know it's something simple that we did, but can't seem to find it!&nbsp; Thanks! &nbsp;

    <title>Recover deleted OneNote notebooks with a copy from iPhone&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardwollenbergerstl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recover deleted OneNote notebooks with a copy from iPhone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use&nbsp;OneNote on a desktop, Surface Pro 3, Mac, and iPhone. I have no local backups, only the one copy stored on my OneDrive (yeah, I know), which was synced between phone and computers. I've&nbsp;I accidentally deleted a notebook&nbsp;on OneDrive, with no hope of
 recovery (I've tried every suggestion this forum has to offer on how to find it in various recycle bins or cache files, not much luck since the install is fresh). I can still view the deleted notebooks on my iPhone as if nothing has changed, and I can even
 edit them and add pages etc.&nbsp;When I click the three dots at the top and select sync, I get the error "We cant access this section file or the attached file because the file was moved, the file name is invalid, or the file permissions have been changed." Well
 duh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the why and how to prevent this in the future. I just need to know the answer to this one very specific question:</p>
<p>***How can I&nbsp;copy&nbsp;the contents of the notebook&nbsp;from my iPhone, into a synced notebook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stats if they help:</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>Office 2016 OneNote (fresh install)</p>
<p>iPhone 6 with iOS 10.2</p>
<p>*Everything is up-to-date</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I think I just figured out a solution. I'm using OneNote for iPad, but assume it would work on other devices:</p>
<p>1. Created a new notebook on my iPad.</p>
<p>2. Created new tabs in that notebook with the same names as those in the notebook I'm trying to recover/sync.</p>
<p>3. Go back to the old notebook, select the first tab, then click "Edit." select all pages, and then click the icon to move/copy the pages to the corresponding section in the new notebook (I copied because I was afraid it might not work, but it did). Make
 sure you select the new notebook as a destination each time, because it always defaults to the old.</p>
<p>4. Check the new notebook--everything should be there and syncing to OneDrive. =)</p>

            <p>I have had this issue for the last few days and as such I expect that it is involved with the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have tried to uninstall KB3114409 but a search of Programs and Features did not find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, a check of the Registry using 'regedit' only showed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Outlook\</p>
<p>
</p><p>No Security 'folder'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there seems to be something else going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 7 64 Bit and Office 2010 with Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that Microsoft will do an update to correct this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>

            Experiencing similar situations. Cannot locate KB6114409 and using "regedit" only takes me to Office (can't locate 14.0) and proceed any further. I concur that hopefully Microsoft will do an update to correct this issue since they caused the problem. Sounds
 as if we have similar problems and can't believe there are a slew of others similar to us.

            If a key doesn't exist, you need to add it. Right click on the last key in the path, choose New &gt; Key and work your way down the path.&nbsp; Or use the prepared reg file I have on my site - at the bottom of the page

            I don't know what your links are about, but it's a common scam. Click the OK button at the bottom of the popup. You should then see a box Do not allow this site to create new messages. Check it and then close the window.

<p>I've had these come up before as well...What Bruce said is about all you can do.&nbsp; Just instead of clicking OK, (I've found that's actually pretty risky.) Simply close the pop-up window and then check the "disable further pop-ups" box.&nbsp; It's actually a relatively
 weak scam.&nbsp; The only way you can have any type of damage done is if you are gullible enough to call the number.&nbsp; On that note, I saw a topic about Indian-accented phone scammers (topic is here:
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/mse-protect_scanning/phone-call-scams-claiming-to-be-microsoft/aefc50a4-d7a4-4c79-8db5-2fafcd6ad196">

 out of Texas (The bulk of the phone number will change EVERY TIME THEY CALL YOU, but the area code stays the same.)&nbsp;&nbsp;using some sort of auto-dial system that is actually quite adept at cleaning up after itself.&nbsp; If you try to call the number back or (in law
 enforcement's case) try to trace it, the trail will go dead in seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...However, after being called by them over FIFTY times, I have discovered a VERY BIG SCREW-UP that they make in the beginning of the call.&nbsp; When they attempt to claim they are with
 MS, they have always made the mistake of saying they are with "Windows Technical Support".&nbsp;&nbsp; WINDOWS Tech Support.&nbsp; That's a dead giveaway that it's a scam.&nbsp; No MS employee will call it Windows Tech Support...they will call it by it's actual name, MICROSOFT
 TECH SUPPORT.&nbsp; So hopefully this little tidbit will help anybody that gets called by them.&nbsp; If they say Windows Tech Support, HANG UP.&nbsp; Hope I helped with the original question, and also with the phone scam issue.</p>

            There is no product named "Microsoft." Since you have posted in a Word/Office 2013&nbsp;forum, I assume you installed Microsoft Office or Microsoft Word, presumably Office 2013 or perhaps Office 365. When you activated Office, you would have had to create a
 Microsoft account, so you will need to log into that account and redownload Office. See

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The Google, Yahoo and AOL toolbars have their own popup blockers... you need to turn those popup blockers off too. It sounds like you have the Google toolbar installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally you should leave the builtin IE popup blocker turned on, with a medium level and the popup blockers of your other addons turned off.... as you see they can interfeer with the IE popup blocker and get you confused...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure also that you are using the default security zone settings, as these are used to allow sites in the trusted zone to use some popup windows (that some sites may require)... generally your mail website does not need to be put in the Trusted Sites
 Zone.</p>
<p>go</p>
<p>Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Security tab, click "Reset all zones to default"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

            have you checked that you have plugged the headphones all the way in, if that doesn't work, then try re-insatlling the current firmware thru Nokia Suite on your PC.

    <title>Showing Zero Values in Microsoft Access Reports - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattalt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Showing Zero Values in Microsoft Access Reports</h2>
                    <p>I'm working on a report based off a Query I'm using in an access database. The Query is drawn off of two tables. The first table lists bank accounts. The second table lists payments made out of those accounts. The query calculates the total amounts paid
 out of each account, then calculates the amounts remaining left in the accounts for report purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first account has already had some payments made out of it, so it shows everything perfectly. The second account has money in it, but has had nothing paid, so it is not showing on the report correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example it looks like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account 1&nbsp; $5000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $500 (paid)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$4500 (remaining)</p>
<p>Account 2 $6000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0 (paid)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0 (remaining)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is pretty obvious. Since $0 has been paid out of the second account, it should show that there is $6k remaining. But is does not.&nbsp; Could this potentially be a problem within the query (which is actually just a very simply sum query), or is it
 something I can fix in the report? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />
Matt</p>

            Sounds like your query needs to link the two tables by an OUTER JOIN, as opposed to an INNER JOIN.&nbsp; You should double click on the link between the two tables and then select the option (probably the second one) which says SELECT ALL RECORDS FROM yourAcctsTableNameHere
 AND ONLY THOSE RECORDS IN the PaymentsTableNameHere which match. (something like that).

            You'll probably also need to use the Nz function to return a zero in place of a Null.&nbsp; Null propagates in arithmetical expressions, so Anything - Null = Null.&nbsp; The query would be along these lines:<br />
<br />
SELECT AccountName, OpeningBalance,<br />
NZ(SUM(Payment),0) As TotalPaid,<br />
OpeningBalance - NZ(SUM(Payment),0) As CurrentBalance<br />
FROM Accounts LEFT JOIN Payments<br />
ON Accounts.AccountID = Payments.AccountID<br />
GROUP BY AccountName, OpeningBalance;<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I forgot to add the query the report is drawn off of is actually drawn off another query, as well. Here's the way they are set up:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first query totals the complete amount of Payments made. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SELECT tblAccounts.pkAccountID, Sum(tblPayments.PaymentAmount) AS SumOfPaymentAmount<br />
FROM tblAccounts LEFT JOIN tblPayments ON tblAccounts.pkAccountID=tblPayments.fkAccountID<br />
GROUP BY tblAccounts.pkAccountID;<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That first query, qryPaymentsByAccounts, plays into the second query.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SELECT tblAccounts.pkAccountID, tblAccounts.AccounNo, tblAccounts.AccountDate, tblAccounts.AccountBalance, qryPaymentsByAccount.SumOfPaymentAmount, [AccountBalance]-[sumofpayments] AS [Remaining Balance]<br />
FROM tblAccounts LEFT JOIN qryPaymentsByAccount ON tblAccounts.pkAccountID=qryPaymentsByAccount.pkAccountID<br />
GROUP BY tblAccountss.pkAccountID, tblAccounts.AccountNo, tblAccounts.AlCcountDate, tblAccounts.AccountBalance, qryPaymentsByAccount.SumOfPayments, [accountbalance]-[sumofpayments];</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, will I have to write a new query in order to do what I'm hoping to do, or can I plug the NZ into one of the existing queries somewhere and get the same result?

<br />
Yes, but your first query can be simplified as it only needs the one table:<br />
<br />
SELECT fkAccountID, SUM(PaymentAmount) AS SumOfPaymentAmount<br />
FROM tblPayments <br />
GROUP BY fkAccountID;<br />
<br />
Your second query can then join the tblAccounts table to the first query and call the Nz function to return a zero in place of a Null<br />
<br />
SELECT pkAccountID, AccounNo, AccountDate, AccountBalance, <br />
NZ(SumOfPaymentAmount,0) AS [Sum of Payments],<br />
AccountBalance-Nz(SumOfPaymentAmount,0) AS [Remaining Balance]<br />
FROM tblAccounts LEFT JOIN qryPaymentsByAccount ON tblAccounts.pkAccountID=qryPaymentsByAccount.fkAccountID;<br />

Tried that, but now when I complete the second query, I get a pop up box requesting a parameter value for the fk.AllotID for the SumofPayments query. Could that be some sort of join issue?</p>

            <p>Same problem here with build 10074 on a Surface Pro. Wifi drivers are provided by... Microsoft.. I don't think we're dealing with an outdated driver issue here. It's clearly a bug of the last release since 1 time out of 2, disabling/enabling the device will
 temporarily fix the problem. However, everytime the computer is rebooted the wifi adapter is lot again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
I have no additional antivirus/firewall rather than the stock softwares provided by Microsoft from Windows 10 build 10074. Since I'm on a surface pro I do not have either 3rd party constructor software's or drivers.</p>

            <p>This was posted on another report:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have been running Windows 10 Preview on a secondary, development laptop for several months. When I loaded Build 10074, my USB Ethernet converter stopped working. It worked fine on Windows 8.1 and all
 previous builds of Windows 10. I have verified it works on another PC, unloaded the driver several times, downloaded a new Realtek driver, released and renewed IPconfig. No steps have worked -- I receive Error Code 37 indicating a bad parameter, then Code
 45 indicating no device connected. My install is on a Lenovo Yoga 64-bit, with no built-in Ethernet adapter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">IN SUMMARY: I have determined this has NOTHING to do with my router, or the USB/Ethernet adapter. I disabled all virus checks, unloaded the driver, and tried again -- same result -- Device Manager states
 "no device connected." Other devices are working fine on the network, and the adapter works fine on another PC. This is a BUG in the BUILD 10074. I have had 4-5 previous builds installed on the same laptop, usning the same adapter, attached to the same network.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Same prob here (Build 10074), but my wi-fi has slowed to 1.9 mbps from enjoying 29 mbps (w/ Comcast).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) Why doesn't Microsoft release a network driver update to fix these problems? - I checked my settings
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and my laptop says I have the latest version of everything. - I know MSFT engineers see us as "guinea
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pigs", but I assumed you guys would be more eager to help us as we're your CUSTOMERS as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) When will the next upgrade of 10 be released and will it solve these problems?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Tech Preview Build 10041 Xsplit Issues</h2>
                    I have been using the recording software Xsplit for a while now, and since the Windows 10 update I have been unable to use this software, it keeps saying I require windows 7 or above. Anyone else having this problem or know of a solution?

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.<br />
<br />
The issue could be due to the compatibility of the recording software. <br />
<br />
First, I would suggest you to check if the software is running in compatibility mode. If the software is not running in the compatibility mode, then I would suggest you to run the recording software in compatibility mode for different operating systems.<br />
<br />
Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows<br />
</span></span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</span></span></a></span><span><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
Post us the results after you try the above steps.</span>

            Hey there!<br />
<br />
Clearly I'm not the same guy who asked the question, but I am having the same problem. I went ahead and tried out your suggestion, but it isn't making any difference, I still keep getting the same error message. What's the next step? Is there anything I can
 do, or should I start searching for a new streaming program? <br />
<br />
EDIT: Ok, so, I looked it up, and it seems like Xsplit did release an update that makes it compatible, so I went ahead and downloaded that. I suppose I don't need any help now.

<h2>            How do you export and import autocomplete data so I can reinstall my OS and have it all back&#63;</h2>
                    I have some unknown problems in my OS(Win 7 Ultimate) that would be solved if I reinstalled my OS.&nbsp; However, I have a tremedous amount of autocomplete data that I use for work that I need to retain in my form data.&nbsp; I figure that there has to be a way
 to export this data so I can have it back.&nbsp; I have used Windows Transfer for User names and settings, I have exported the registry, and I have copied my Outlook *.pst files.&nbsp; All that I need is the autocomplere data.

<p>Hi heed1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If in OVI Maps application you go to Options &gt; About - at top of screen what information is there? On my 5800 it is v3.01 09wk44 b01 MW OpenGL LM MN Map version 0.1.22.103 OpenBitLM 6.24.2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has been a new license manager to download in the last day or two without which OVI Maps won't function correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presumably there is no issue downloading map detail either via network or WLAN to show your position?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would install Nokia Maps Updater on your PC available here:<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/explore-services/maps/download-maps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/explore-services/maps/download-maps</a>&nbsp;as this will also remove any obsolete map data
 on your memory card if newer version to be installed.</p>

    <title>Normal Text in Word 2010 has Text Wrapping and Frames - so Table - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Normal Text in Word 2010 has Text Wrapping and Frames - so Table Function Won&#39;t Work Right</h2>
                    <p>Our company forces a global template on people for MS Word 2010 and 2013. I am a technical writer and this global template is making me crazy because clerical people who don't know how to format have added text wrapping and frames to Normal text. My tables
 will not work right because of this. Heading rows won't repeat, cells won't break along pages (when I want them to) and every attempt to remove the wrapping and frames doesn't stick. Is there some other way to remove frames and text wrap from a document?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep trying two things:</p>
<p>1. I switch styles to one of my templates</p>
<p>2. I select what should be Normal text and choose Modify</p>
<p>3. I choose Frames and remove wrapping that is around the text</p>
<p>4. I select Remove Frame</p>
<p>5. Save</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I reopen - same darn text wrapping and frames are around my words.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions?</p>

            <p>You have my sympathy. Whoever decided on that policy needs to go back to school.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About all you can do is to create a separate Normal.dotm template under a different name, and use it to overwrite the company template every time you start to use Word. To do that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shut down Word.</li><li>Go to %appdata%\Microsoft\Templates and rename the company Normal.dotm to something else, or move it to a different folder.</li><li>Restart Word. The new blank document will be based on the program's internal defaults. Make whatever customizations you need, modifying styles and so forth. Use the option in the Modify Style dialog for "New documents based on this template" to have the
 changes applied to the Normal template. If there are styles or macros in the company template that you want in your version, use the
<a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/styles.htm#Organizer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Organizer</a>.</li><li>Close Word, which will cause the new Normal.dotm file to be written.</li><li>Make a copy of this new Normal.dotm and store it in a different folder, where it won't be touched by the company's interference.</li><li>Each time you're about to start a Word session, first copy your private Normal.dotm to the %appdata%\Microsoft\Templates folder, overwriting the file that's there. This can be done with a batch file on your desktop.</li></ul>
