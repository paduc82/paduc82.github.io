            I presume you are want to delete existing coversations. 
<br />
<br />1. Individual delete is possible only for alerts sent by you where you can right click &gt; Remove
<br />
<br />2. If you want to delete the received alerts - It will not be possible to delete received alerts individually through Skype application. But you can delete the entire conversation by right clicking on left pane &gt; Delete conversation.

<h2>            Is Anyone interested in filing a lawsuit against Skype for failures to respond to customer concerns&#47;issues and billing people for services they are not getting because of all these glitches&#63;</h2>
                    I have been having issues with Skype for months, from issues that prevent me from logging in to now being unable to place any calls despite actively paying for an unlimited US and Canada subscription. I look through the help questions here (which are unsearchable
 as far as I can see) and get no real help, only things that make it worse. I followed one set of instructions only to make it so that I can't even log in anymore. I had a login issue with my laptop first, and now I can't use Skype on that even after a technician
 spent over an hour in remote control of my computer trying to fix it. I wasn't too upset because Skype still worked fine on my desktop, but now it's not working at all on there. I see a lot of other disgruntled users in these posts, and I would like to know
 if anyone would be interested in joining a class action lawsuit against Microsoft for their lack of timely fixes and billing for services they aren't actually delivering. I see they've offered apologies on the heartb

<p>I'm in. We purchased $2.99 worth of Skype time and specifically did not agree to auto pay. Guess what, we are being billed $2.99 a month with the account showing that auto pay is not active, and no credit card or billing address information. It is a mystery
 $2.99 for about half a year now. I'm going to contact the bank tomorrow and tell them to deny the charge. It is ridiculous that I can't talk to anyone about this problem.</p>

<p>Auto-Recharge is a service to auto purchase credit when your credit balance reaches a low threshold (~$2). This is unrelated to subscriptions. Generally speaking, all subscriptions auto renew until you cancel.
<strong>You are informed of this at the time of purchase</strong> as seen below. Some third party payment methods may be one time. These are the only instances in which a renewal is impossible/unenforcable, and the screen would probably differ at the time of
 purchase. Since your billing is evidently renewable, this would seem not be that special case. The below is what I see when I attempt to purchase the $2.99 subscription again on my own account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ec9604d-d1ba-4b94-a83d-1236b3796347" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ec9604d-d1ba-4b94-a83d-1236b3796347" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Terms of Use also further inform you that renewals are attempted 3 days prior to the end of each billing cycle. As stated above, you can cancel your subscription at any time. Ideally you would do this prior to that 3 day window to avoid getting billed
 for the next cycle. If you have any issues cancelling your account, or need to request a refund, you would primarily contact Skype over<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/fa10656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> live chat</a>. Taking no action month after
 month would be unwise, as the billing will continue indefinitely. You can take the bank route but that can affect general access to your account since a standard cancellation was not processed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are the screens I see when I sign into my account with my current subscription on the left side.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b1cecfc9-d6aa-4339-a524-fe6476987271" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b1cecfc9-d6aa-4339-a524-fe6476987271" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the subscripton name (in my case, my legacy subscription) "Unlimited US &amp; Canada 12 months", I get the option to Cancel [my] subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c85ee1aa-2a91-4a0f-9602-8ecc457a9476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c85ee1aa-2a91-4a0f-9602-8ecc457a9476" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people have their subscription assigned to a different account than they normally use. If I log into the wrong account then I will see no active subscription,nor get an option to cancel, only a suggestion to buy one,as seen
 below. Just because I do not see a subscription there, does not mean that other Skype accounts I own, are not participating in a subscription. If someone steals/borrows my credit card and uses it under their Skype account, I can get billed for their subscription.
 That would be an example of fradulent use in which I would have to contact my credit card company/billing agent rather than expect Skype to cancel my billing source attached to an account I do not own. If you are able to prove ownership/regain access to a
 different account, you should be able to sign in, and cancel any current subscriptions, should they exist.</p>

<p>We have only one account. We specifically signed up for Skype to make a single international phone call. There was an option for auto renewal when we created the account. We chose not to participate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We receive email confirming our most recent Skype purchase on Dec. 11th. Within that email is a link to go to the history of Skype purchases. When we follow that link the account does not show the purchase made on Dec. 11th. The email also states you can
 cancel the subscription at any time from your Skype account. The Skype account in question has no active subscriptions. There is no third party vendor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fraud from our side is unlikely as&nbsp; the only discrepancy in our bank statements occurs every month on the 13th. We are fortunate that it is 'only' $2.99 meaning that resolving this&nbsp; was low priority. But now that it is on the table it will be resolved.</p>

<p>Join the club! Skype has $10.00 of mine in their "credit" account and when they went with Microsoft, the Skype system went haywire. You can't speak with a human being and the "service" is non existent. I just managed to log back onto the system and then
 received a</p>
<p>robo-call asking me for&nbsp; my ATT billing listing number. I just don't have these things lying around nor would I give a phone robot any personal information. Bottom line is SKYPE is irreparably broken&nbsp; and mismanaged by Microsoft .They are too big to care
 about either you or me.....just walk away and hope some government agency looks into their books some day.</p>
<p>They just got too big to care. Open source computer science like Ubuntu will take over their market without giving them a cent! They have brought their downfall upon themselves and will get no sympathy from us.</p>

    <title>Number Searching Issue in Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steveclarke4806  say:</h3>
<h2>            Number Searching Issue in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    
<p>I have many emails with order reference numbers in them.</p>
<p>In Outlook 2013, I could search for part of that number and find the emails with that part number in them. Outlook 2016 does not have the same functionality.</p>
<p>For instance: Say I have an email with the following line in the body: "Order ref: OAG-000109801"</p>
<p>- In Outlook 2013, I could type in 109801 and the Search function would return the email with that order reference in it.</p>
<p>- In Outlook 2016, if I type 109801 in to the search box, I receive no search results. If I type in 000109801 I receive the email with the order reference in it. If I type in 109 in to the search box I should get all orders with the number 109 in it, i.e.
 109000 through to 109999 and xxx109, xx109x, x109xx, etc. However I receive nothing.</p>
<p>This looks like a repeatable bug. Anyone else experienced this, anyone have a workaround/fix?</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>Steve</p>

Hi Steve,</p>
<p>I understand the email cannot be searched out using part of numbers in Outlook 2016. This is because the search mechanism has been changed. In this situation, you can use the
<strong>Search tool</strong>-&gt; <strong>Advanced find</strong> to search the emails with part of the numbers. If you expect to use the Outlook 2013 part number search feature again, we suggest you click the Smile icon&nbsp;in the upper right corner in Outlook 2016
 to submit your feedback to our relevant team. Many features have been designed and remould based on our customers’ valuable comments.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.<br />

                    <p>I can type over data in a Pivot Table in both the current Monthly Targeted build and the Insider Build, and refreshing the pivot WILL NOT fix it.</p>

<li>Anywhere in that grid, click Insert, Pivot Table.</li><li>Tell it to use the range it selected (prob A1:B4)</li><li>Existing worksheet. Click on G1 for example, then OK.</li><li>Drop the Item field in the Rows.</li><li>Drop the Amount field in the Values.</li><li>Click on the "b" item in your pivot and type "Bogus Data" and press enter. It shouldn't allow this. It should fuss at you about being unable to change pivot table data.</li><li>Refresh your pivot table.</li><li>It will not fix itself.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>This happens in more complex Power Pivots as well, through the data model, regardless of the data source (CSV, SQL Server, etc.)</p>

<h2>            Prompted for credentials when opening a document in Sharepoint</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am prompted for credentials on my Sharepoint Online&nbsp;when I press <em>Edit in Excel
</em>(after I<em> </em>open an Excel document and Select<em> Edit Workbook).</em></p>
<p>Similar happens when opening a Word document.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>How do I turn off this prompting for credentials?</p>
<p>Thanks </p>
<p>Petter</p>

<p>Hi Petter,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>I've done a test&nbsp;with Excel 2010, and I found that if I select <strong>Keep me signed in</strong> when the prompt for credentials pops up, it will not show again.</p>
<p>Please also select keep me signed in when you log in to the sharepoint site.</p>
<p>Would you please check this and let me know the results?</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
James</p>

<h2>            Storage Save Locations in Windows 10 10240 &#40;RTM&#41;</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 10 theres&nbsp;a Storage Setting to change Storage Drive Location for Documents, Music, Pictures and Videos&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf23111d-55bb-4efb-b458-0028af6f6dfd" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing Documents to E: makes a new folder in E: called User (Philip) and a subfolder called Documents as expected.</p>
<p>It does not move items from the original&nbsp;C: location to the new E: location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This setting should link the Documents library&nbsp;to the new location in E:&nbsp;and create a junction between the C: location to the E: location but doesn't seem to perform these operations. The Documents library location within Window's Explorer making the setting
 change only&nbsp;create a folder and addresses nothing to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See here for details (no audio):</p>

<p>
</p><p>Note Downloads and Favourites are missing from the options there should be the option to move these special folders also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was looking forward to this feature in Windows 10 opposed to the convoluted procedure necessary for earlier versions of Windows:</p>

<p>
</p><p>The new location is in fact (or should be) added to your Libraries. However, migration of content or creating directory junctions is not something we have&nbsp;decided to support&nbsp;for this release. While I cannot comment on what is being planned for the future,
 I can tell you that we on the Storage team are working tirelessly to ship functionality that we think users will find useful and delightful.</p>

            <p>Thanks for quickly getting back to me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving data from one drive to another and not adding the new location to libraries and not adding junctions from the old to new location causes quite a bit of problems. I wrote the guide for Windows 8.1/7 and it takes most users out of their comfort zones.
 Once setup it works great however. In my opinion this storage setting should have done that automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell are quite interested in this setting also because the next line up of Desktops are using SSD boot drives and HDDs for data. I suspect it will be useful for other OEMs and end users in general.</p>

<p>I had this same problem; this answer is helpful; thank you. However, as they are at present having the two options (the original folder properties method and the new partially implemented solution) is confusing. I believe the new method should be removed
 until it is fully implemented. The old method is a bit long winded but it does exactly what is required.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You're welcome. As mentioned I thought the new method should&nbsp;automatically apply&nbsp;the changes the old method does. Its possible that issues will be encountered with these workarounds. The previous upgrade from Windows 8 to 8.1 was an example.</p>

            Yes Philip, you and I have exactly the same view... until the new settings approach meets the requirement I guess we are stuck with the old method (so long as they don't remove it!) Also agree&nbsp;that it should include downloads and favourites.

            <p>for years i have installed Programs and kept My Documents folders on a seperate partition from windows partition.</p>
<p>when i found the settings to change the default path&nbsp; to the folders i already created on a different partition i was esstatic. that didnt last long, though, when i found out you could only direct them to a drive and NOT a drive then individual folders!</p>
<p>But then i guess thats how this Win10 journey has been. a whole lotta hype and excitement, only to be instantly pulled back to the bottom feeling let down!!</p>

            <p>Phillip, This is a very good point and an extremely important one for the new crop of SSD / mechanical HD combinations out there now that SSD prices are so reasonable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A sophisticated operating system like Win 10 SHOULD do all this "Automatically" when you ask to move one of the basic data folders that are intrinsic to Windows, so your request is logical and reasonable and should be on the priority list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping that Bahvya's reply about "future plans" hints that this is in development.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, your Windows Guides are awesome and absolutely rock to help us get around numerous oversights like this. THANKS!</p>

<p>It would make the most sense to have an option for an entire user profile and all associated data to be delegated some drive other than the OS drive at the time of profile creation, or better yet during OS install an option to root the USER folder to another
 drive. The latter has been a standard Ubuntu option as far back as I've dabbled in Linux (2005). It's also important to understand why many users choose to do this isn't just to keep from overfilling their primary drive; it's also to keep excessive writes
 from piling up from various app activities like web browsing (one example). <br />
</p>
<p>I setup other Windows users in such a way with a SSD + HDD when I build systems as most users are both lazy and inept in regards to data management. System Builders like Dell need a more streamlined functionality like this for these reasons. It only takes
 an economical sized SSD to considerably boost the performance of any PC and an uneducated user to fill it with cute cat videos or whatever inside six months. Dell/HP/Acer/Lenovo/whoever can't trust their user base with a SSD in their entry line computers,
 and desktop computers that load apps slower than most tablets are a hard sell. </p>
<p>
</p><p>tl;dr It's long past time Windows became aware and able to utilize multiple drives at time of install, not just after.</p>

            <p>Hi there, I got worked up about this problem and took an hour or so trying to figure out why this issue existed, but then it just popped up on my mind. Do the same thing I did on windows 7; It worked!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create the folders you want in your other drive, so I created Documents, Pictures, Downloads, Videos, Music on my D: Drive. Then go to This PC and right click on original folders &gt; Properties &gt; Location and click move, find the new folder you made on your
 other drive. Now all new downloads, should go directly to them folders, and if you navigate to the folder from your This PC it will actually direct you to the other drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Randomly Choose from Non-Sequential Number String</h2>
                    <p>Hi there.&nbsp; I have an Access 2007 AutoNumber/Unique Key field (MEMBER_ID) which uniquely identifies each member of a club (past and present). If their membership is active for the current year, a separate Yes/No field is checked. Therefore a query to select
 all current members will produce a list of MEMBER_ID numbers which will probably not be sequential due to death or members who have not renewed for the current year.</p>
<p>

            Hi Tom, and thanks for the prompt reply. I'll brush up on my SQL and see how I go with it. I haven't fully investigated the links about the same 'random' numbers coming up each time, but I'll get back to you when I have. As you would no doubt agree, having
 the same member win our major raffle prize every week would probably not be A Good Thing!. -Regards, Lewis.<br />

            Waaaaay back when I was programming mainframes here in Australia, our only option when creating a RNG was to use the system clock. This meant, like most other RNGs, it wasn't perfectly random at all. Just in case you're interested, there's a website www.random.org
 which uses 'atmospheric noise' to produce RNGs. I'm going to put my query to them as well.<br />

<h2>            Nokia Internet Radio &#40;v1.16&#41; Crashes When Station Directory Accessed</h2>
                    
<p>The Internet Radio player on my N85 is no longer able to access the station directory.&nbsp; It loads the list of stations (Browse by Language, Genre or Country/Region, or from Search) and a second after the list of stations appears on the screen, Internet Radio
 shuts down (I end up back at the screen that lets me select FM Radio or Internet Radio).&nbsp; This has just started happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried restoring factory settings, uninstalling Internet Radio and downloading and reinstalling it.&nbsp; The problem still occurs.&nbsp; I also tried downloading and going back to a prior version of Internet Radio (v1.12) but the phone won't allow me to install
 it (!Upgrade Error ).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is anybody else having this problem?&nbsp; Any solutions or work arounds?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have had the same problem with my N95 8gb. Formerly, the internet radio worked impeccably, yielding hours and hours and delightful listening. However, when I tried it some two weeks ago, I got exactly the same response as Emacee: "second after the list
 of stations appears on the screen, Internet Radio shuts down (I end up back at the screen that lets me select FM Radio or Internet Radio)".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only stations I can hear are the ones I had made my favorites. I also would be happy to hear any solutions.</p>

<p>No solutions, yet.&nbsp; I am working around the problem.&nbsp; I added a few URLs manually to my favorites so I can listen to those streams again in Nokia Internet Radio.&nbsp; I have started using Mundu Radio Player more (download at mundu.com; free registration required).&nbsp;
 I'd drifted away from it because I was getting a lot of drop-outs and Nokia's player seemed less drop-out prone.&nbsp; Now, Mundu seems more reliable.&nbsp; The big advantage is you can make changes to their station directory (add, edit or delete) from their website
 using your desktop computer.&nbsp; I also have Core Player which is not free but will play all the audio stream formats Nokia and Mundu can't.&nbsp; It is, however, a bit complicated to use, so Nokia Internet Radio was the program I used most.&nbsp; I just wish I could use
 the directory again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems the problem is a bug in version 1.16.&nbsp; I hope Nokia techies follow this board and put a fix in. &nbsp;</p>

<p>For what it's worth, every user of the U.S. version of the N86, who's posted in the following HowardForums thread, is experiencing this bug, which apparently makes the Internet Radio basically unusuable. I hope Nokia gets on this soon. It's changing my mind
 about whether or not to by the N86.</p>

<p>So far, I've seen this bug reported on the N85, N86 and N95.&nbsp; If it's on three models, it's probably on any N-Series phone (and maybe E-Series), too - any phone running this version of Nokia Internet Radio.&nbsp; This is an obvious problem.&nbsp; Doesn't Nokia do
 ANY testing of software before they put it out (especially since the app is updated automatically and they don't seem to allow you to rollback to the prior version).&nbsp; I know Internet radio streams are not a priority feature for many users (you don't even see
 it mentioned much in reviews) but the three phone models are positioned as media phones and the people who buy them (unlocked and therefore at a high price) ARE interested in this capability.&nbsp; Internet radio is why many of us bought a Nokia phone (in my case,
 that and avoiding Steve Jobs' dictatorial practices).&nbsp; Nokia needs to make getting this fixed a priority (at the very least, put a new version number on the old version and push it out to users until this does get fixed).</p>

<p>People at HowardForums also report experiencing the problem on E series phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think it matters whether Internet Radio Streaming is a priority or not. Nokia should not ship phones with applications that simply don't work. This isn't just a little bug. This is complete unusability. Nokia lists internet radio as a feature of
 the N86 (and other phones). How can it say that with a straight face and then ship a broken application? It's unacceptable. It's like introducing a new car model, in which each and every one has a broken dashboard clock. Perhaps not the most important feature,
 but no one would accept that as just a "bug" to be fixed maybe sometime later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've read the discussions on this issue and agree. I have an N95 8gb, NAM, and have just recently experienced this problem. I never had it before. Moreover, I just purchased an N86 8mp, NAM, and was exceedingly dismayed when I discoverd, when trying to launch
<u>its </u>internet radio application, that the same thing occurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be of interest to note that my E71, NAM, does not have this problem. The E71 did not come pre-loaded with internet radio; I downloaded it after purchase. It continues to work perfectly.</p>

            Looks like the problem has been fixed.&nbsp; Now a little ad for Ovi appears at the top of all directory listings and it appears adding that was what caused the crash.&nbsp; In any case. the directory stations list is accessible now.

<h2>            Recoverable error signature becomes invalid after closing and reopening word 2010</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an issue with signing by smart card in Microsoft Word 2010 and Windows 7.</div>
<div>When I sign a word document, the signature panel displays the signature as 'Recoverable error'.</div>
<div>It means OK for me, because no trusted CA root certificate is installed yet.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But the problem arises after closing and reopening the signed document.</div>
<div>Now the signature panel displays the signature as 'Invalid' but neither the certificate is revoked nor the content signed has been altered.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I opened this document with Word 2010 on Windows XP, the signature is displayed as 'Recoverable Error'.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone explain what is the reason of this problem?</div>
                </div>

            I solved the problem.<br />
In the function CardSignData() of smart card minidriver, hash OID must be added to the hash before sending to the card for signing.<br />
It is necessary for Word 2010 but optional for Word 2007. This is the reason why Word 2010 recognizes the signature as Valid at first and then marks the signature as invalid after reopening the file (Word 2010 needs OID to recognize the hash algorithm but it
 does not exist in the signature).<br />
Word 2007 knows the hash algorithm and doesn't expect the OID to be included in the signature.<br />
<br />
After adding OID to the hash, the problem is resolved.<br />
Now Word 2010 verifies the signatures created by Word 2007 but NOT vice versa - probably because of backward compatibility problem!?<br />
<br />

<h2>            How do I specify a custom paper size in the OneNote 2010 printer&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I print a mini version of power point slides into onenote notebooks.</p>
<p>In onenote 2007, I could specify the paper size. In onenote 2010. I am limited to a few options, none of which are really small (except the envelope).</p>
<p>How can I create a custom size and print to that size of page?</p>

<p>I was experiencing the same problem as you, but I found this solution to it.</p>
<p>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/addonenote/thread/684a0e42-04e0-4225-880b-31a4b0c6bc6f</p>
<p>If that link doesn't work, search for the forum called "Imported PowerPoint slides are too big"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The zip file at the bottom of the linked page works great, though I had to fiddle with it for a while before I was able to shrink my slides.</p>
<p>Here is a direct link to the page where the zip file can be found.</p>
<p>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/onenotetips/archive/2008/05/16/insert-or-print-documents-to-onenote.aspx</p>
<p>In the instructions, when it says "3. Run OneNote and click on the following button" That button can be found in your Add-In's tab at the top of one note.</p>
<p>Also, you can add files to OneNote either by Insert &gt; File printout or you can do the same Print &gt; Send to OneNote option. It will give you the same results.</p>

<p>I need to copy the data from the remarks/notes column in sheet #1 over to sheet #2.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each one is saved under a different file name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's better to produce a macro, I'm open to that but I need it to ask the files names to get the data from and where to copy it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm open to anything to help me to automate this process.&nbsp; Currently I'm opening each file, having one open on each of my monitors, copying and pasting the data manually.&nbsp; When you have well over 500 different pieces of information, that is very timeconsuming.</p>

            Use VLOOKUP for this.&nbsp;
<div>You may use any key, which is unique in both sheets to fetch data. If there is no unique key, then there is no unique key then you may make it by concatenate 2 or more cells from different column.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Assuming your data is in column B1:I8 in sheet 1.</div>
<div>Then in helper column A at cell A2 use this formula in both sheets,&nbsp;</div>
<div>=C2&amp;D2&amp;H2 &nbsp;and then drag it down.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now in sheet 2 at I8 give this formula and then drag down.</div>
<div>=VLOOKUP(A2,Sheet1!A:I,9,0) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;it will get you desired result.</div>

            <p>Vijay,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far it's not working but it may be that I'm not entering in the right data.&nbsp; Let me explain what I've done and which data point I'm using which may help some.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's change the names of the Sheets to file names since there are two different files being used for this.&nbsp; Sheet 1 will be named November 1 and Sheet 2 will be named December 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will be using the data from column C (Item 2) as my main data point since this will be found within both files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a side note, my report has 12 different data fields per file.&nbsp; The example only listed 9.&nbsp; Does this make a difference?&nbsp; The data I want to copy from&nbsp;November 1 to December 1 all come from the data listed under the 10th, 11th and 12th column.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what I've typed into colunm J (10th data column).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; =VLOOKUP(c2,"[November 1.xlsx]sheet 1'!A:J, 10, 0)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I do this, it just shows the formula, no data is copied from Nov 1 to Dec 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What am I missing?&nbsp; I thought I had all the fields correctly identified.&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            As you are saying that column C is common in &nbsp;both files, then you should change your formula to this one, your starting column should be from C, not from A.
<div><br />
<div>=VLOOKUP(c2,"[November 1.xlsx]sheet 1'!C:Z, 8, 0)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also feel that your cell where you are giving this formula is formatted as Text. First change it to General and then give above formula. It should work.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=VLOOKUP(C2,'[November 1.xlsx]sheet 1'!C:Z, 8, 0)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you explain what the following means:</p>

<p>!C:Z, 8 and the 0 mean at the end of the string?</p>

</p>
<p>The error #N/A just means that C2 cannot be found in column C of sheet1 of the November.xlsx workbook.&nbsp; The issue could be as simple as an additional space.</p>

            As Ashish told, it means the value of C2 is not available in column C of Sheet1.
<div>You may copy C2 and the go to sheet 1, select column C, Click Ctrl+F, in find box, do the paste and now search it. I am sure it will not find the value in column C.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Just ensure that there is a value existed in column C which matches with C2.</div>
<div>Better if you upload your file on skydrive and share link here.</div>

<h2>            Imported slides do not adopt to master design in powerpoint 2011 &#40;MAC&#41;</h2>
                    I have created a master document in powerpoint 2011 for Mac with 2 different designs (design A and design B). When adding a new slide (insert and select custom layout) and/or introducing a slide from a different presentation, design B of the master should
 be adapted. It does adapt the background but not the bullet points, fonts or sizes of the typeface. I really don´t know why it does not work.

            <p>Putting 2 different designs in 1 presentation seems cumbersome and error-prone, especially when you're just getting the hang of it. Why not just 2 separate templates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention 2 ways of creating the slides. For the first "insert and select custom layout", I imagine you're using the
<strong>Home&gt;New Slide</strong> command and selecting the <strong>Slide Layout</strong>. This approach should be dead simple, so if you're not getting the bullets, fonts or typesizes you expect, you haven't formatted the Slide Master or the Slide Layouts correctly.
 First set up the Slide Master (the larger slide at the top of the list in Slide Master view) with all formatting that is common to most or all slides. This is the parent, the slide layouts are children: the master formatting ripples through automatically to
 the layouts. Then format the variations in the slide layouts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you're bringing in slides from another source, then you really give up any control over choosing whether Master A or Master B should apply. Separate files for each design will make this a workable scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When importing from another presentation, you might be using <strong>Insert&gt;Slides From&gt;Other Presentation</strong> (uncheck keep design of original slide), or you might be pasting the slides (click on clipboard icon in lower right after pasting and choose
 Use Designation Theme. If you're already doing that and the formatting is still off, it points again to problems with your Master/Slide Layout setup.</p>

            Text boxes were never supported on windows mobile devices either.&nbsp; I think if Microsoft has any plans to support this on a windows phone, it's probably pretty low on the priority list.

<br />
<br />In the Control Panel
<br />User account.
<br />Manage credentials (Appears in the left menu)
<br />Windows credentials
<br />Select all the credentials that say something about Office and delete them.
<br />
<br />Log in again and check if it asks for the credentials again.

<br />If it does not work, update Office.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>It's both Office 365 and On-Premises Exchange where we have this problems that Outlook keeps asking for password.</p>
<p>Both Outlook 2013-2016-2019</p>
<p>Its not all users having this problem, but 2-3 of 20, its not only one customer/location</p>
<p>Almost every day a new customer calls and asking me what they can do to stop entering password for Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleared Cached Passwords in windows</li><li>New Outlook-profile</li><li>Updated office to latest updates</li><li>Repaired Office</li><li>Uninstalled/installed Office</li><li><strong>Created following registry keys:</strong></li><li>DisableADALatopWAMOverride = 1</li><li>ExcludeHttpsRootDomain = 1</li><li>ExcludeExplicitO365Endpoint = 1</li><li>Checked that Required Authentication Settings for outgoing server and incoming server is not on<br />
</li><li>Checked Outlook Anywhere is not configured to use NTLM Authentication</li><li>Checked Slow or unstable network connection<br />
</li><li>Uninstalled Antivirus programs</li><li>Checked Shared calendars</li><li>Updated Exchange On-Premises to latest SP/CU</li><li>Checked connection to Exchange whit https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing of above seems to help and i cant find out whats wrong!</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried every release in the Fast Ring since 14342 but have had to revert back as I cannot connect to the Internet after upgrade.&nbsp; I receive the error that my Broadcom 802.11abgn wireless adapter is "experiencing driver- or hardware-related problems".&nbsp;
 I have tried reinstalling the older driver but this results in reported connection to the network but no Internet connectivity.&nbsp; I've tried using a USB dongle for an Internet connection; alas, this does not appear to work for me, either.&nbsp; After this last time
 of reverting back to Build 14342,&nbsp;I am receiving notices that this build will expire on 7/15.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss as to what I can do to resolve this issue.&nbsp; Help?</p>

            <p>I used to use that same abgn Broadcom, then switched the card to AC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't recall any problems installing the drivers other than you have to find them somewhere other than on the&nbsp;Broadcom site.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Your laptop maker site ,, win8 or even win7 driver should work fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I buy the little mini half Wi-Fi cards off amazon... they can be&nbsp;quite inexpensive and simple to change usually.&nbsp;Often shipped postal&nbsp;from various Asian countries.</p>

<p>No, I don't think it's a bug in the build, because I haven't seen it happen at all with any of the machines that I'm running it on. Edit ... my machines are all running either 16241 or 15063.xxx, not 16232.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you have any 3rd party security program installed, it should be cleanly uninstalled using the uninstaller provided by its maker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would then try a clean boot in order to rule out issues with non-Microsoft programs. If that doesn't stop the reboots, I would next be suspicious of the graphics adapter and its driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't see any information about your hardware, but we are coming to the time when there will be more hardware and driver issues for hardware manufactured not many years ago.</p>

<p>That is one of the reasons that I always urge everyone to use a 3rd party disk imaging program to make a backup image of their OS partition for the latest public release, and save it on a separate drive. One can quickly and easily restore the image when
 needed/desired, without having to rely on any OS to do so, and stay on it for as long as desired without getting new preview builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, in case of hard drive failure, or if the point is reached at which the hardware can't handle the later preview builds, one can go back to the publicly released build without having to reinstall all the software.<br />

<h2>            forwarding attachments--why won&#39;t pictures show up when forwarding, all I get is a blank window with an x in one corner&#63;</h2>
                    when I get emails with pictures--any type from Christian to comic--and I try to forward them, all I get is a box where the picture belongs and an x in one of the corners.&nbsp; if I copy and paste to a new message window, it won't show up after saving in drafts
 and then coming back to finish email.

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>4. Under <font><b>Reading email</b>, choose

            thanks for your assistance.&nbsp; I tried everything as per your suggestions and nothing changed.&nbsp; this desktop was originally Vista and I recently upgraded it to Windows 8 with IE 10.&nbsp; I have a laptop with Vista and I tried to view/forward message from that
 and still the same.&nbsp; I tried sending to my Gmail and Yahoo mail accounts and got the same results.&nbsp; The original message, which I was able to view pictures when I first opened, will not display any pictures now.&nbsp; I put it in a saved email folder and tried
 to open from there and still no pictures.&nbsp; I put it back in the inbox and still no pictures.&nbsp; strange to me as well.&nbsp; once I hit the refresh button and the pictures appeared but now that doesn't help.&nbsp; appreciate your time.

    <title>Automatic notification of new builds via a Systray icon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatic notification of new builds via a Systray icon</h2>
                    <p>Could the Windows 10 developers add an icon in the Systray that automatically pops up when new Windows Updates are available please, or at least for new builds, as used to be seen in Windows 7 I seem to remember ? It's a pain in the butt to go looking for
 new build updates via WU. This request is&nbsp;not dissimilar to the current Get Windows 10 App for Win7/8 users seen in their Systray, so if that is possible, why not what I suggest above ? A third party&nbsp;download I used for Windows 8 is available here, it works
 in Windows 10 too:-</p>
