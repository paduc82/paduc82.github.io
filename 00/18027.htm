<h2>            SCAM from &#42;&#42;&#42; Email address is removed for privacy &#42;&#42;&#42;</h2>
                    Hi guys.&nbsp; &nbsp; Recently I received an email on July 13 from "Outlook.com Team" &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; saying that my account is suspended and asked me sign in again.&nbsp; &nbsp;I worked oversea quite often so I received instructions from Hotmail in asking me
 to re-verify several time when I tried to login to my Hotmail oversea.&nbsp; Therefore, I did not aware that was a SCAM and I actually sign in again using the link provided in that SCAM email, and it sent the verification code to my cell phone, and I entered the
 code to sign in.&nbsp; &nbsp;I realized that was a SCAM couple hours later by googling the "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***". Then I changed my Hotmail password immediately.<br />
&nbsp; Since I used OneDrive to store my work document and most of them are confidential, I am not sure if the scammer downloaded anything from my OneDrive.&nbsp; Is there a way for you guys to track my account activity on July 13?&nbsp; Also, do you know what are the SCAMMERs
 after?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the email:&nbsp; (copy and pasted.&nbsp; &nbsp;Please let me know if you need me to forward the email to you if you want to follow up my case)<br />

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Saw your problem listed in my listing of messages&nbsp;for Lostintrama.</p>
<p>Many have the same Problem.</p>
<p>BETA:&nbsp; Outlook.com Mail.</p>
<p>I call "Junk/Spam" Garbage.</p>
<p>Most do land in Junk mail. Who wants 5-150 Junk emails?</p>
<p>I had that many 5-31-16 Flagged, Wow, Microsoft Calls Flagged Emails "Important" . I sent most of them to Microsoft.
</p>
<p>You can Block Domains,. Not that Good as Garbage Senders use different Domains,. Blocking Email address Does&nbsp; No Good.
</p>
<p>They do go to Microsoft and add to your Blocked Mailing List.</p>
<p>Hit the "Gear" you will see it is way different that Outlook or Hotmail before BETA Outlook.com at bottom of Listing the is See More listings.</p>
<p>Junk mail will show on the Left click that and Blocked and Saved Domains and address will show up. Look over the Names in all 4 boxes.
</p>
<p>See what you have listed in each box. </p>
<p>You can add names Domains to the Block Domains</p>
<p>I Block Domains when I get 2 or more Garbage&nbsp;Sender Domains. </p>
<p>I have Blocked Same email address. Same Sender Domain and still get emails from the Same Sender.
</p>
<p>Another thing is to report all the Junk as "Phishing". </p>
<p>You probably don't know how to send Junk emails to&nbsp;Microsoft.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.abuse.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">www.abuse.net</span></a> for reporting.
</p>
<p>I send about all I get to Microsoft, </p>
<p>I sent 30 Emails to Outlook.com support couple days ago about Problems</p>
<p>That is the Question ? mark in top Right hand Corner to Inbox page.</p>
<p>Many have asked similar Questions. </p>
<p>My email account has been Blocked 9 times in 2018.</p>
<p>You should have 2 email address for Hotmail/Ourlook. So when your account is Blocked there is a place to send codes to you. Phone #s will work.</p>
<p>Check your photo at top right of Home page/Inbox or the Gear or someplace top right of page about adding info to your account etc. Its Complicated.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span>You've obviously been very astute and tried a number of solutions to address your problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>But let's look at this generic fix for MSE Install/Update issues one more time in case something might have been missed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>MSE requires XP (32 bit version only) with
<strong>SP3</strong> installed, </span><span>Vista</span><span> or Win 7…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Prior Security Software?&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;</span>What about a trial version of an antivirus program that was pre-installed when the computer was purchased? McAfee, Norton, Trend Micro?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>NOTE:&nbsp; If you reinstalled your operating system with a disc furnished by the computer manufacturer you may have also reinstalled a trial version of an antimalware
 program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sometimes remnants of prior security software will suddenly cause issues with your current antimalware program.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>A
<b>possible</b> reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Be sure you have removed <span>&nbsp;</span>all other security software from the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software - see the following list:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re not sure which security apps may have been on your computer try a scan with this security application detection/removal tool:
</span><span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></a>.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>When running Appremover:</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span>First, run the Remove Security Applications scan and then run the Clean Up A Failed Installation Scan.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Recommend you
<strong><span>thoroughly</span></strong> review 
<a href="http://experts.windows.com/w/experts_wiki/89.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Microsoft Security Essentials – Installation Checklist and Frequently Asked Questions
</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You
<b>may</b> need to uninstall/reinstall MSE.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>You should be able to remove MSE from Control Panel.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Any problems uninstalling see: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Recommend you reboot the computer to ensure the uninstall is complete.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>You can download&nbsp;a new&nbsp;MSE Installation File from
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/security-essentials-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/security-essentials-download</span></span></a></span></p>

<h2>            Lumia Replacement Batter for Lumis 435</h2>
                    <p>I'd like to buy a spare battery for my new phone.&nbsp; When I asked Nokia where to purchase one I was referred to Amazon or Best Buy - neither of them had it available.&nbsp; A general web search yielded one for about $50 available from the UK (I live in the US)
 - way to expensive.&nbsp; The model is <span>BV-5J (1560mAh 3.7V 5.8Wh).&nbsp; Any suggestions on how to buy this spare battery?&nbsp; Thank you.</span></p>

            The $14.82 price seems out of stock.&nbsp; It may be more effective to buy another lumia 435 ($38?) to get the battery than having to pay 20.50 EUR + shipping and have the delivery delay.&nbsp; Don't know.

    <title>Wrong conversion of &#34;&#91;&#34; and &#34;&#93;&#34; in an Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> srick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong conversion of &#34;&#91;&#34; and &#34;&#93;&#34; in an Excel for Mac hyperlink URL on Mac OS X web browsers</h2>
                    For example, if a cell has =hyperlink("http://www.company.com/index?term=example[test]"), when this cell is clicked, a web browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.) is opened but the URL on the web browser is "http://www.company.com/index?term=example%255Btest%255D",
 which is incorrect. The correct one is "http://www.company.com/index?term=example%5Btest%5D" because "%5B" is "[" and "%5D" is "]". What is happening is that "%" in front of "5B" and "5D" is once more converted to "%25" which is "%". This does not happen when
 the same spreadsheet is opened in a Windows or Linux machine. How can I make this hyperlink that contains "[" and "]" work in Mac?<br />
<br />
The machine has Mac OS X Mountain Lion and Office for Mac 2011.<br />
<br />
An example spreadsheet is at https://www.dropbox.com/s/tl53rh1iuqxx9ln/hyperlink.xlsx.<br />

            <p>This problem seems to be a limitation of either Excel or Mac OS X. It's not easy to determine which because Excel hands the URL over to Mac OS X to complete your requested action.</p>

    <title>Emails won&#39;t display images in Outlook 2010---Square with the red - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cowboyjake  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails won&#39;t display images in Outlook 2010---Square with the red &#34;X&#34; appears instead</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Office 2010 on my new laptop.&nbsp; I set up my email accounts which Outlook seemed to do automatically.&nbsp; I use a Gmail account as well as a Hotmail account.&nbsp; I find that when I receive emails from any&nbsp; company where the graphics (logo, photos,
 etc) should display, or at least ask me if I want to download the graphics, they don't.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on the bar that allows me to download the pictures and authorize the download, I get a square with a red X in it.&nbsp; If I click on add the sender to my safe sender's list, I get a square with a red X in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I researched the problem both in this community and on the Internet and none of the solutions I found worked for me.&nbsp; The one thing I do find interesting,&nbsp; which might have something to do with my problem is that I cannot find a "temporary internet files"
 folder.&nbsp; I also could not find the "Secure Temp Folder".&nbsp; I followed all of the various instructions in locating both folders including a search of my computer, but they were nowhere to be found.&nbsp; I'm guessing that they are not being created when they should
 be and possibly that is my problem.&nbsp; I just don't know.&nbsp; I also downloaded the Microsoft Hot Fix for this issue and when I ran it, it said something like "There are no programs to which this fix applies".&nbsp; I thought that was strange since I am running Outlook
 2010 and the fix was for outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 7 Professional, 64 bit.&nbsp; My version of Office is the standard edition of Office Home and Business 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am about to go back to Office 2007 where I never had these issues before.</p>

<h2>            How to reduce Windows 10 Mobile Mail and Calendar app size</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Window 10 Mobile (Nokia Lumia 730) and on my mobile I see Mail and Calendar app is eating up 1.08 GB space even after I had removed the configured mail account. I'm unable to install any updates as mobile is running on very low space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I didn't find any option to uninstall Outlook Mail and Outlook Calendar apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Software: Windows 10 Mobile</p>
<p>Version: 1607</p>
<p>OS build: 10.0.14393.1593</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly let me know how can I reduce the Mobile Mail and Calendar app size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Shailendra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Mobile mail and Calendar apps that are pre-installed on your mobile phone, are designed to run with compatibility with the phone's existing OS version. There are few things you can try to free up more space on your mobile phone.
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can back up files such as photos, videos etc. to OneDrive.</li><li>You can clear both the browsing history and cache of Edge browser.</li><li>You can delete for the meantime apps such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint if not being used frequently.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it works.</p>

<p>Hello Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the photos and videos on my phone are on SD card. Also I cleared the Edge browser cache and history along with uninstallation of word and powerpoint apps. But these steps don't create much space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My bigger problem is Outlook mail and calendar app is occupying 1.08 GB of space even though I had configured single mail account with a week's email to sync. Kindly let me know how can I bring down the size of Outlook mail and calendar app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: Even if I remove the configured mail account, the size of the app is not coming down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why Microsoft don't provide the option to uninstall and install the app again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

            Hi....in case you still need an answer...I noticed my mail &amp; calendar were over 1GB &amp; I couldn't reduce that by deleting old mails, installing &amp; using cache cleaner. I had to do a hard reset to try to get some Apps to work &amp; that&nbsp; reduced size...it has
 since crept up slightly to 111MB. Can't&nbsp; answer why you have to do a hard reset...presumably bad design? Seem to remember the option of just resetting that app was greyed out.

            Hi, I am having the same problem with the new update. On the last one (probably the one that started this thread) I ended up having to delete everything possible (despite having the requested free space--1.1 GB or something--it actually needed about 1.8
 GB). Unfortunately, everything possible is not enough this time. Ridiculous. My mail and calendar takes up 250 MB, OneDrive 250 MB, and Groove 450 MB. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to reduce them. I understand that Microsoft has given up on the
 mobile platform, but for some reason they're still rolling out large updates, so if someone from MS could please tell us how to clear whatever data is piling up on these apps, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.

<p>I am facing the same problem too. My Windows Lumia 550 phone came with 8 GB of memory and it is full now. The Mail and Calendar Apps take about 1.5 GB storage and I am unable to reduce its size. There is no way to reset it as the button is greyed out. Looks
 like Microsoft has really given up on Windows 10 mobile. I like my Windows Lumia 550 phone but might have to buy an Android phone soon.</p>

<p>If there are updates for the device it would be good to know. I believe there is (assuming he is not on the Insider builds) and he should be on 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are I would suggest performing a hard reset and set it back up NOT USING A BACKUP but rather just do a fresh install. Then he should check for updates and install. There may well be more than one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then and only then would I set up my email and make sure it works then slowly add back important programs.</p>

<p>Yes there are updates. But I am left with only a few megabytes of internal storage space so I am unable to install those updates. Hard reset seems to be the solution but that would be my last resort. I am hoping there would be some other solutions.</p>

    <title>How to give parental permission for Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> catherinestoneman  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to give parental permission for Skype</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; My 14 year old has been using Skype for years on her iPad.&nbsp; She was asked last week to enter her date of birth, and is now told she needs parental permission to use Skype.&nbsp; Where do I give her parental permission?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a microsoft account, and I've added my daughter to my "Family".&nbsp; But from there, I'm stuck.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent 1/2 hour googling for a solution and nothing works.&nbsp; e.g., when I go to&nbsp;https://account.microsoft.com/family/?lang=en-us and click on "Manage my child's profile info", it takes me to https://account.live.com/mykids.aspx?mkt=en-US, where the
 only option is to go back to https://account.microsoft.com/family/?lang=en-us ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for your response. However, I must be missing something.&nbsp; I still don't know what I have to do, concretely, to give her permission to use Skype.&nbsp; The page you referred me to gives links to the microsoft family page<span>,
 and I can't find anything useful here.&nbsp; My child already has a Microsoft account, and I can already see her in our "Family".&nbsp; But I cannot see anywhere how to give her permission to use Skype.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

            Thank you for your help.&nbsp; But, unfortunately,&nbsp; no, it hasn't worked.&nbsp; Because my daughter had changed her date of birth to look like she was an adult, in an attempt to get access to Skype ....&nbsp; So according to her Microsoft account, she is 49.&nbsp; (Not that
 this gave her access to Skype.)&nbsp; And now it will not let me change her birth date back again ("Your birth date cannot be changed at this time").&nbsp; So I'm stuck with a child who is not a child, but who cannot get onto Skype anyway ...

    <title>Microsoft Access 2010 - Text &#47; Number Conversion bug when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marvvram  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Access 2010 - Text &#47; Number Conversion bug when importing Text Files into existing Tables</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched up and down google but I did not come across this topic anywhere.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is the following - which is also reproducable.</p>
<p>I have a a table in MS Access with 63 columns - all are set to text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i Import a ~80 MB Text File (with column headings) which should go into that pre-defined table.</p>
<p>That text file is a semicolon seperated file econded in UTF8 without BOM</p>
<p>In that text file, containing roughly 200.000 rows is a column that contains values such as:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p>When I Import that file into that table, Access give me an import error on that column:<strong> Type Conversion Failure</strong></p>
<p>Already quite strange. Access seems to try to force a number onto "A" which results into that error.</p>
<p>But why does it do that? All is text. Target Table is set to text etc..</p>
<p>Seems like access tries to be smarter than the user and force number on him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even stranger is the following:</p>
<p>When I keep repeating the exact same import steps during the import and do it like 3-4 times, then sunddenly Access imports all as text and i get no errors.</p>
<p>It seems that Access has some sort of "Try to detect values types" but just randomly chooses 1000 rows or whatever and sometimes decides A and sometimes B.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be greatful for any support on this - because it is really annoying having to import files 5 times each time.</p>
<p>Maybe you have encountered the same or you know a workaround?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>
<p>Best regards!</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Well the linking would be kind of an option - except that then I have to review the data type of all 63 fields to set whether it should be Long Integer, Text or whatever.</p>
<p>That is also a little annoying seeing that I already have the target table set up as text.</p>
<p>
Then I could also just import normally, set all to text, and then just append to the existing.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<blockquote><br />
<p>Btw, a table with 63 text fields is almost certainly a database design error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Well, its not really a database but an Interface which exports data from system A to B (normally fully automatic)
</p>
<p>I am the middle man and check sometimes if sometimes went wrong and hence look quickly in the data.</p>
<p>And most of those fields are actual text or numbers with leading zeros. (like Cost Centers etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>--&gt; Also I came across this recommendation in the meantime:</p>
<p><a href="http://jamelcato.com/68/microsoft-access-import-errors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://jamelcato.com/68/microsoft-access-import-errors/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The registry is locked for me on my work computer so I cannot edit [HKEY LOCAL MACHINE / SOFTWARE / Wow6432Node / Microsoft / Jet / 4.0 / Engines / Text] and change the key [MaxScanRows] which seems to be the culprit. (I have 19 set there)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i guess the only workaround for me is to create a schema.ini as suggested in the link. A little annoying seeing that the name of the table would change every day.

            You can probably edit the similar key under HKEY CURRENT USER.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have acquired a Lumia 720 in Mauritius and discovered that HERE MAPS and HERE Navigation arent available.When will this feature be available, else users like me will have to use&nbsp;Google maps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be fair, Google Navigation isnt available in Mauritius, however full maps are available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Site Owner unable to add users in SharePoint 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nellie nobody  say:</h3>
<h2>            Site Owner unable to add users in SharePoint 2010</h2>
                    <p>I submitted an incident request on this, but&nbsp;am getting the run-around from our SharePoint support analysts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a site owner with a jumble of bizarre groups and permissions that somebody else set up. Some are just for my site, others apparently are for the site collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am unable to view or add users to my site's member group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the support analysts blamed me for the issue and&nbsp;closed my ticket, citing "user error". He explained that, when I created a test&nbsp;group to figure out what the issue was, the permissions I gave myself in that group over-rode all my other permissions.
 But I was having these issues before I ever created the test group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His manager explained that being a "site owner" was different from being a "group owner" and that I would need to contact the "group owner" and request the permissions to add users. I can't even see the members, so I am unable to determine who the "group
 owner" is. Why the SharePoint support analysts can't do that for me, I am unable to fathom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Is it true that any group I create could over-ride my site owner permissions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Is it true that not even a site owner can view or add members to a group if he or she is not the owner of the group, unless the group owner grants the permissions to do so?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have many years of experience in Unix and Windows environments and none of this makes sense to me.</p>

<h3> crazykats  say:</h3>
<h2>            After upgrading to Windows 10, desktop icons are replaced on different places and there&#39;s no taskbar</h2>
                    <p>I have an Intel Graphics display.</p>
<p>I had this happen several builds ago where</p>
<p>during the end of the upgrade process the</p>
<p>screen resolution is changed.</p>
<p>When it goes to the desktop, the icons on the right</p>
<p>are moved left and there's no Taskbar.</p>
<p>It's easy to fix, but very annoying.</p>
<p>Anyone else seeing this issue?</p>

<p>No, I'm not.</p>
<p>It did it for a couple of builds back awhile ago&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just put it back to where I think it should be, we</p>

            Have you installed 14905 already? If not, I suggest you change the resolution to the monitors native res. just before installing it and see if that helps. I do agree with you that this should not happen even if you choose a non-native res. Maybe a Feedback

            <p>Nope never after a new install or update,... I use AMD Radion 5000 series....however my lone 10586 occasionally pushes the desktop icons to one side on it's own...like yesterday...so I checked event viewer @ that time period and it led me to to the '<strong>Groove
 tube</strong>'&nbsp;&nbsp; so I un-installed it thru a '<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Power Shell'</span> command...but I have no idea if this fixed it...only time will tell.</p>
<p>The error was '<strong>Zunemusic</strong>'.</p>

            The term <i>Bing</i>&nbsp;can apply to many facets and off-shoots of the Bing search engine. I would guess that you are referring to the Bing Side-bar. If your Bing account has been affiliated with your Facebook account, you need to go to your Facebook account
 and remove it from there.
