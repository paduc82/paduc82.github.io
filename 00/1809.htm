<h2>            Help with page numbering in Windows 10, and formatting CD&#47;DVD</h2>
                    <p>Before Windows 10, I was used to Windows 7 which helped me a lot in my work.</p>
<p>As usual, I am now preparing a book to be sent to my publisher, but, unfortunately, I am at present facing difficulties in Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't "add different page numbers or number formats to different sections" - 3 different sections in my book.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com</a> has a very simple and clearly explained way to do the job, and I followed it faithfully, but to no avail. All I get is a number on page 1, in each of the
 three sections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will welcome, with thanks, any tried and workable solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHILE AT IT, I also have trouble with FORMATTING a CD-RW/DVD-RW in Windows 10. Any help will be much appreciated.</p>

    <title>Pop Port Ignition sense pin - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wired---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pop Port Ignition sense pin</h2>
                    I have a BMW installed car kit for a Nokia 6230i, however I cannot get the ignition sense to work. I have enabled this in the nokia menu.<br />
when I look at the carkit the only pins connected to the pop port are;<br />
<br />
1- Vin<br />
2 - Gnd<br />
<br />
9 - mic-<br />
10 - mic+<br />
<br />
Please can someone explain what pin should be connected to enable ignition sense and what voltage should be applied Vcc or GND? If I can find out I will be able to modify the BMW part.<br />
<br />
I have looked up the pin out of the pop port but can't tell how the ignition sense works.<br />
<br />
1 - Vin - Charger input<br />
2- GND - Charger output<br />
3 - ACI - Auto-connect Ignition<br />
4 - Vout -<br />
5 - USB Vbus - Also act as USB power detection?<br />
6 - Fbus Rx/USB D+<br />
8 - GND - Data GND (Logic)<br />
9 - VMic- - Audio IN - Ext. Mic input negative<br />
10 - VMic+ - Audio IN - Ext. Mic input positive<br />
11 - Hs Ear L- - Audio Out - Ext. audio out: left-negative<br />
12 - Hs Ear L+ - Audio Out - Ext. audio out: left-positive<br />
13 - Hs Ear R- - Audio Out - Ext. audio out: right-negative<br />
14 - Hs Ear R+ - Audio Out - Ext. audio out: right-positive<br />
* - GND - Shield GND in cavities<br />

Thanks for your help..

            ACI dosen't stand for auto connect ignition. Its detects the presence of an accesory, headset, car kit etc, DO NOT put a voltage on it. The line is then used to communicate with the accesory as to what it is so that the appropriate functionality can be
 enabled on the phone. The ignition sense for the Nokia car kit just sets the mode for the car kit itself, not sure what it does for the BMW car kit. Surely there must be a connection for a speaker as well? Vin is for charging.

            It helps to understand the whole IGNS system.<br />
If you set the ignition on in the phone´s menu it only means that the phone will sense the ignition status of the carkit and act accordingly, e.g. automatically switch off if the carkit feels ignition off and phone in idle etc.<br />
So far so good.<br />
The phone knows the ignition status of the carkit over ACI message. So this to connet is a must.<br />
But - big question is what kind of BMW carkit you have and if this one is able to read and interprete ACI messages as this ACI is a proprietary interface and only Nokia carkits use it as far as I know.<br />
Any more information available ?

            Thanks to all for the input.<br />
<br />
It's seems that the BMW kit is basically a dumb adapter (only charges the phone and in the event of bluetooth failure will use the connected mic to make emergency calls) and to have the ignition turn the phone on and off requires the propriatary Nokia kit.<br />
<br />
Looks like I'll have to turn the phone off and on manually each time I get in the car. This is a big oversight by BMW... unless Nokia will not release the license to use the ACI protocols..<br />
<br />
Thanks to all for the help..<br />

<h2>            Issue with Skype for business</h2>
                    
<p>I have been having issues trying to get Skype for business to work. I cannot find a way to get Skype to actually connect business to business.</p>
<p>After talking to a colleague he informed me that Skype for businesses is just for internal people in the same business to gab, it is more of a fun item and not for businesses to connect to other businesses and customers to have actual business meetings.</p>
<p>Right now we use MX meeting. Setup meeting, send out emails to any business or individual in the world and have a meeting. Is this possible or is Skype for business truly just for internal conversations?</p>

<p>Seems like a lot of hoops to jump through (you even need to create a SRV record). I am looking for a real business application that is built for business and not just internal social use of a company.
</p>
<p>Microsoft should think of rebuilding Skype so it has the power of business communication, one that fosters communication of business to business and of course, the main reason we are all in business and that is business to customer.</p>
<p>Internal yip yap does not make money, communication with the customer does and I think Microsoft should start following the idea of business and stop chasing Apple for a piece of the internal toys pie.</p>

            Hello AshleyDel, <br />
<br />
I understand that you are having an issue with forwarding emails from Microsoft Outlook as it strips the message body.
<br />
<br />
I find this article may be relevant to you: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_other-mso_2007/body-of-email-messages-are-missing-when-you/dafb0cf8-5f53-461a-98c3-4e1c6a931636">
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/fo...</a> <br />
<br />
In order for me to effectively troubleshoot this with you, please revert back additional information about the issue:
<br />
<br />
1. Just to confirm, are you using Outlook.com or Microsoft Outlook? (This is Outlook.com forum, the correct forum is
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice">
Office</a> &gt; <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook">
Outlook</a>) <br />
2. If you use Microsoft Outlook, does it happen on Outlook on the Web (OWA)? <br />
3. Does it happen to other users as well? <br />
<br />
If you are using Microsoft Outlook, may I suggest you to try turning on and off the cache mode?
<br />
<br />
Let me know. <br />

<p>Hi - I had tried that solution but I select 16 (not 15) as I have Word 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I select 15 I didn't have a data file only an options file.&nbsp; I have a data and options file if I selected 16 instead.&nbsp; Anyway the point is, renaming these two files (16)&nbsp;didn't
 work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But reading the thread that was attached to your link told me the following:</p>
<p><em>I had the same problem in Word 2010 and found it was related to file trust settings.&nbsp; File, Options, Trust Center, Trust Center Setting, File Block Settings, Web Pages had to be unselected, meaning not block.&nbsp; This setting also stopped the Mail Merge
 feature from working. </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked !!&nbsp; I can go mad creating citations now!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>

<h2>            Outlook inbox very slow to download inbox</h2>
                    After updating to Office 14.3.7 Outlook is very slow to bring emails to inbox. &nbsp;We use GoDaddy for email server (IMAP NOT EXCHANGE) and contacted them but they reported no errors with GoDaddy server. &nbsp;I have 3 email accounts on this Outlook but it is only
 my default (main) email account that is having this issue. I created an alternate identity with no luck. &nbsp;i deleted the plist with no luck. &nbsp;please advise...

            thanks for the reply, corentin. &nbsp;not a godaddy issue as i they tested their server with no errors to report. i have not due to the fact that this is business and not personal email. i had tech support on the phone and they remoted in to my pc, attempted
 to add their gmail account with no luck. we uninstalled, reinstalled, updated, rebuilt the identity, all with no luck. &nbsp;it has been escalated and a level 2 tech will be calling tomorrow. &nbsp;fingers crossed

            I'm not saying there's &nbsp;a bug in their setup, but it could be slow or unresponsive at times.
<div>I personally never had any responsiveness issue with either Gmail or 1and1 (one of my e-mail providers). I don't remember reading other posts complaining about that here either, though I have heard people complaining that GoDaddy wasn't always the "snappiest".
 Hence the test I suggested.</div>

            Since Hotmail is the same thing as Outlook.com, you'll have to explain where you see multiple Junk Email folders. Each mailbox will have one Junk Email folder. Mailboxes are separate from each other.

<p>hi ed,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we can check the un-synced files in onedrive for business or sharepoint synced folder directly.</p>
<p>under your favorites-&gt; click onedrive for business folder/sharepoint folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=5dc4022d-90b3-468d-844c-486d5580d8ec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d5dc4022d-90b3-468d-844c-486d5580d8ec" /></a></p>
<p>if that is hard to find all un-synced files, for the issue, i'd suggest you try the following troubleshooting steps:</p>

<p>I could not find the file where you suggested. &nbsp;I called support and despite asking not to resync my files before I could make a backup, the person gave me direction that did. &nbsp;Within a day I started to have files not resync and not show as problem files.
 &nbsp;Since I will have to resync again anyway, I decided to try the new client and see if it resolves my issue. &nbsp;I have had to run through this a number of times and it is very frustrating. &nbsp;I have been trying to move to using my ipad more for travel but this
 makes it difficult to rely on the data being up to date. &nbsp;I will let you know if the update to the new client works. &nbsp;Ed</p>

                    In column A (sheet 1) there are list of names (which have duplicates). In column B there are list of unique ID. For say there are 15 names as John. But they are 15 different people having 15 different unique IDs. In sheet 2, I want to use vlookup such
 as that it will look up the value using both the name and unique ID. If one John has ID as 222 and another John has ID as 225 then it will lookup for the John who has ID as 225. How can I do this?

            <p>Hi, consider that below is your data table in sheet1:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f33a8f4b-5c31-4b1e-961a-84a13d5ed233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f33a8f4b-5c31-4b1e-961a-84a13d5ed233" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And in Sheet2, You have below format to return the value:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c0f0471-fd86-4f75-ac94-84e2058cae03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c0f0471-fd86-4f75-ac94-84e2058cae03" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to show you 2 different ways of returning the lookup value as you have requested:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Way #1: In B6 Cell: </p>
<p>Use the below formula and press Ctrl+Shift+Enter at once due to it is an array formula:</p>
<p>=INDEX(Sheet1!$C$2:$C$15,MATCH($A$2&amp;$B$2,Sheet1!$A$2:$A$15&amp;Sheet1!$B$2:$B$15,0))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Way #2: In B9 Cell: </p>
<p>This is also an array formula, and need to press again Ctrl+Shift+Enter:</p>
<p>=INDEX(Sheet1!$C$2:$C$15,MAX(IF(Sheet2!$A$2=Sheet1!$A$2:$A$15,ROW(Sheet1!$A$2:$A$15)-MIN(ROW(Sheet1!$A$2:$A$15))+1,""),ROW($A1)))</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result will be as below:<br />
</p>

<p>Hi Ginny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you can start administering a client's account, the client must authorize you as a delegated administrator.&nbsp;To get client approval, you first send them an offer for delegated administration, which you can include with a trial invitation or purchase
 offer. You can also offer delegated administration to your client at a later time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An article for your reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Partners-Offer-delegated-administration-26530dc0-ebba-415b-86b1-b55bc06b073e?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Partners: Offer delegated administration</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As our forum mainly focuses on Office 365 Business services, about this kind of partner issue, please contact the partner support directly for dedicated help.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Word, Document Connection, Sharepoint Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johngase  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Word, Document Connection, Sharepoint Problem</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a problem using Microsoft Word and Document Connection to access Word documents. &nbsp;The problem occurs as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I open a Word document from a Sharepoint site on my company's server through Document Connection. &nbsp;When I click on the document in Document Connection, the Word program automatically starts,
 the document downloads and opens, and I can edit and upload the changes - no problems. &nbsp;But, if I keep that same Word document open for a few minutes, then try to upload changes, it prompts me for credentials (password/user) and goes into an endless loop in
 which the credential window keeps opening. &nbsp;It doesn't accept or reject the credentials - the same window just keeps popping up endlessly. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once the problem begins, I can no longer open any other Word documents through document connection - any word document I click on prompts the endless loop of credential windows. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problem ceases if I completely close Word. &nbsp;If I close Word, then click on a document in Document Connection, I'm prompted once for credentials which are accepted and I can open and edit
 the document. &nbsp;However, if I keep that Word document open for several minutes, the problem starts again. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is a huge problem when you are trying to edit and upload changes to a sharepoint document because it forces you to save a local copy and then upload as a second copy of the document on Sharepoint.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any help appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            Hi John:
<div><br />
<div>I have had a response from Microsoft, but they really can't add anything because they have never seen this exact set of circumstances, either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My contact (the lead programer in charge of Word's Document Connection code) says they have not changed that code in quite a while, so it's not that. &nbsp;He says the problem is very likely to be a configuration issue on the Sharepoint Server (but he does
 not know what...)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am wondering whether it might help to turn off preview pictures. &nbsp;Go to Word&gt;Preferences&gt;Save and turn off "Save preview pictures with new documents." &nbsp;That's just a wild guess, but turning it off solves a range of infuriating "deadlock" network problems.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sorry to be no use at all.</div>

    <title>Word won&#39;t let me format a grouped object - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hmm1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word won&#39;t let me format a grouped object</h2>
                    
<p>Here's what I did.&nbsp; In Word 2007, I inserted a picture and a shape in a blank file.&nbsp; I was unable in W-2007 to group the two as one object — to group them I had to save it as a Word 2003 file (as I understood from another post, some graphics are incompatible
 and cannot be grouped in 2007).&nbsp; Afterwards I grouped the two objects as one, and wrapped it in line with text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, Word won't let me crop the object — nor&nbsp;can&nbsp;&nbsp;I ungroup it to try cropping the picture alone.</p>
<p>Granted, I could start over; but what gives here?&nbsp; Can anyone familiar with this problem explain it to me?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><span><span>To Group the picture and the shape in Word you should have the Wrap style of each to “Tight” or “Square” before Grouping. Another way to Group them is to insert
 a Drawing Canvas and then Group by holding down shift key (ctrl key may also work) and selecting each one and then Group. You should also be able to select the Grouped picture and shape and Ungroup it. To crop an object, I believe you would have to Ungroup
 the object first.</span></span></p>

            <p>Do you know what version of Exchange you are&nbsp;connecting to? On 1st boot of Outlook after upgrading to 2016, Outlook needs to wait for AutoDiscover to run to get the Exchange mailbox connectivity settings. If AutoDiscover fails for any reason (e.g. no network
 connection, AutoDiscover not configured correctly) then Outlook 2016 may hang on the very 1st boot after upgrade.
</p>
<p>In Outlook 2013 and earlier, AutoDiscover is a requirement for the following&nbsp;features to work: setting out of office messages, MailTips, seeing people's free/busy info when scheduling meetings. If these features were working as expected before the upgrade,
 then that would indicate that it's not an AutoDiscover configuration issue.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I had the same issue running Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>I debugged this a little and saw that MSPST32.dll was doing a good amount of work while it said "Loading Profile".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remembered that there was a tool called SCANPST that used to be used to fix PST/OST issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a quick scan and found SCANPST.EXE on my local computer in the </p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16 dir.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I closed Outlook and all programs that may be using my profile and OST and ran SCANPST.EXE</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a scan and it found errors.</p>
<p>I made a backup and then asked SCANPST.EXE to fix the problem.</p>
<p>Once finished Outlook started right up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanx for your reply and suggestion. </p>
<p>According to my exchange host there is a important servicepack missing on the server and he's trying to find time to install it. That would fix the problem. I am waiting impatiently for that now. (And looking for an other provider in the meantime).</p>
<p>

<h2>            Unable to sync sharepoint document library</h2>
                    <p>I am having trouble getting the sync application to work properly. Browsing to my sharepoint site then documents, I click the sync button. The following box pops up as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd644e6c-7621-4c7b-abfc-5a8f4c975416" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd644e6c-7621-4c7b-abfc-5a8f4c975416" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After clicking the "Sync now" button, the following box as seen below is displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6736239-9bb5-4364-8d31-ca420c93200d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6736239-9bb5-4364-8d31-ca420c93200d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking "Sync Now" displays the following popup.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/212f9c64-9153-409d-982a-acc026429c3e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/212f9c64-9153-409d-982a-acc026429c3e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks good so far. Then finally, I am prompted for my password as seen below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ee1aaa0-f489-4bdf-9391-2429a9a18fd0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ee1aaa0-f489-4bdf-9391-2429a9a18fd0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where I am stuck. Clicking "Sign in" changes color as I click it, but does nothing. Click "back" does nothing as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to sync to my personal area of this sharepoint site without any issues. This is the main sharepoint site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this is something simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi ,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
We understand that you are unable to install the latest <strong>Windows build 10581</strong>. We’ll certainly help you with this.
<div>When you update your phone, it might need to restart more than once to complete the installation.
<strong>You might need to wait up to 60 minutes for an automatic restart </strong>
to happen before your phone gets the final update. So, I suggest that you try to install the build again and wait for some time to install it completely.</div>
<div><br />
If the issue still persist, I would suggest that you reset or roll back to Windows Phone 8.1 using Windows Phone Recovery Tool from the following link and then install build 10581 through Windows 10 mobile insider preview.</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987</span></a>
<div><br />
For more information on the new build, refer the following link.<br />

<div><br />
Hope this will help you. Keep us posted with the status of the issue. We’ll be glad to assist if you need further assistance.</div>

            <p>But it's not even downloading.</p>
<p>it is not increasing from 0%. And rolling back is not an option for me.i know installation takes time as in 10536. But first it should be downloaded.which is Main problem.</p>

<p>Hi MUHAMMADFARHAN3,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, if it works well before but not now, I suggest you can try to create a new retention tag which applied automatically to a default folder for the default inbox in Exchange admin center, then add this tag to the retention policy
 you have assigned to that user and check whether it helps, the detailed steps you can refer to the following link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/security-and-compliance/messaging-records-management/create-a-retention-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/security-and-compliance/messaging-records-management/create-a-retention-policy</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the change for retention policy may need to spend some time to take effect, You can also use the&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/75d840ea-5abc-44bb-b361-e81561fa1b04.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Start
 ManagedFolderAssistant</span></span></a>&nbsp;cmdlet in Poweshell to manually trigger the assistant to process a specified mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If it doesn't work, I need to check more information for further investigation, please</span><span> kindly answer the questions below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Will this issue only occur to the specific user or all users in your organization?</span></li><li><span>Will all emails </span><span>or just part of emails</span><span> will not move to online archive folder?
</span></li><li><span>Please carefully check if<span>&nbsp; </span>that user's retention policy contains that specific retention tag.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Bryan</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Excel VBA - Find Cell Address of Index Match with Multiple Criteria</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a huge table that looks like this (only 1 row is shown):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0412c9bb-617c-412c-987c-01cd55cf4bb4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0412c9bb-617c-412c-987c-01cd55cf4bb4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to find the calculated area (6th column) from this table using 2 CRITERIA: device and wafer size. I want the CELL ADDRESS of this return value to replace it with something else.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if device = "Pressure Sensors" and waferSize = "300", then I want to find the cell address of 2.00 (return value) and replace it with 6.00 for example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this code, but I keep getting Type Mismatch error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">' Get die size cell address of the device &amp; wafer size user selected<br />

' DieSizeApproxTbl.ListColumns(6) is Calculated Area column 6<br />
' DieSizeApproxTbl.ListColumns(1) is Device column 1<br />

</p><p>Any help would be great!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Note that the Evaluate method has a 255 character limit.&nbsp; So you'll get an error if the number of characters in the string exceeds it.&nbsp; If this is the case, a workaround method will be needed.</p>

<h2>            Behavior of WIndows Defender After Windows 10 Version 1709 Upgrade ...</h2>
                    I am experiencing something strange with Windows Defender (WD) after having<br />
the upgrade from 1703 to 1709.&nbsp; If I go to:<br />
<br />
WD Security Center ==&gt; Virus &amp; Threat Protection ==&gt; Virus &amp; Threat Protection Settings<br />
<br />
Right under Virus &amp; Threat Protection Settings it says " No Action Needed" and when<br />
you left click on the phrase Virus &amp; Threat Protection Settings,&nbsp; the hour glass comes<br />
up and it looks like it is thinking about showing setting options but then the whole window<br />
goes away.&nbsp; In other words, no setting options appear.&nbsp; I was expecting to see an option<br />
to turn on or off real time protection.&nbsp; Is this a new feature of the 1709 upgrade for<br />
those of us who use WD or is it some bug?&nbsp; I have done a reinstall of Windows 10<br />
but it did not fix the issue.<br />
                </div>

<p>Eureka!&nbsp; The answer is a bug with my High Contrast display</p>
<p>and the new 1709 version.&nbsp; In the non-high contrast display</p>
<p>my Windows Defender has no problem showing the Virus &amp;</p>
<p>Threat Protection Settings.&nbsp; Here is where someone else had</p>
<p>a similar problem:</p>
