<h2>            Where does the Windows 10 UI fit into the Intelligent Systems being adopted by so many businesses and industries today&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>This forum and the Feedback app seems to include a great deal of interest and questions concerning the end user interface to be included with Windows 10, yet the real world usage of the latest OS offerings from Microsoft has so little to do with any interface
 included with the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So many here point to OS sales figures concerning only the few SKUs related to OEM PC inventory and boxed sales from store shelves and websites. Totally ignoring the multiple millions of new Microsoft OS installations in devices that do not resemble PCs
 in any way or those that are not accessed by people at all. Painting a false picture of the true success of the latest OS releases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the latest retail and insurance industry attacks well underscore the need for upgrading current business intelligence systems and the growing need for efficiency in the IT world is accounting for installation of new and different systems in
 existing enterprises and startups alike. These things are being done at a record pace today and the trend seems to show no slowing in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Traditional data entry terminals and those used for report, presentation, general content creation, etc... are going away in record numbers as are the users seated at them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the power of today's and future PCs will be consumed by background and communication operations. With the human interface needs being reduced to an app or two required to view or lightly interact with what is being produced by the machine driven
 Intelligent Systems and communication with others in the growing enterprise landscape.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Peruse the scenario below and reply with what you feel would be the best interface features you see necessary for out of box interaction, using Windows 10 at the few required traditional terminals in the enterprise.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 930 double tap unlock issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had my lumia 930 for a few days, awesome phone! &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However the double tap unlock feature has stopped working. &nbsp;It became intermitant when on charge initially, now it has stopped working completely.</p>
<p>Anyone else have this issue? &nbsp;It is turned on it tne settings etc., and I have tried re-setting the phone numurous time with no improvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a real problem as I had become really attached to using the excellent double tap feature. &nbsp;Anyone know if this is a known issue or is it just my phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

                </div>

<p>Strange that it would suddenly 'stop' working... do you have a screen protector on?&nbsp; (sometimes this will interfere with responsiveness to touch).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How well does the screen respond to other touch commands?</p>

<p>I have tried everything, soft reset, hard reset, and even re-installing using the Nokia software recovery tool to re-install everything. &nbsp;But nothing made any difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has now developed another fault, if you dial out on a call, the screen goes totally blank, none of the buttons function, and the only way of ending the call is to hold down the power button to reset the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sending it back for replacement as it is obviously faulty.</p>

<p>Having the same issue but I guess I found the problem.<br />
Check the upper right corner of your display, hold the phone sideways and look if the screen comes out from the frame, that's the case for me. The upper right corner of my display sticks about 0.8mm out of my frame, this somehow f*cks up the proximity sensor.<br />
If I press down the corner it works for a moment but the display slowly pops out again.<br />
Didn't find a solution yet. I tried to glue it carefully with loctite, but after a day the screen is sticking out again. I don't know if this could be solved with a software update by decreasing the proximity sensors sensibility. Two other options I see are
 that Nokia let us disable the proximity sensor or let us recalibrate it with the faulty display.</p>

<p>It would, but I already had to claim warranty twice since I got my Lumia 930 and I just don't want to wait once more for a new or repaired phone. And I risk getting another broken phone and the same starts over again. Plus the first two times I wasn't really
 happy with the warranty, the support didn't make a competent impression(that's the reason I had to claim it twice, first time they said they repaired it but have just sent me back my broken phone, and that took nearly two weeks..), I don't have nerves for
 this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: In my opinion Nokia/MS should provide a solution for all Lumia 930 owners, even those who can't clain any warranty anmore (e.g. you drop your phone and it now has scratches, they wont repair or replace the phone for free in this case). I also guess
 this is a widespread issue as I read often about proximity sensor issues with the Lumia 930. I think this could be sloved by sensor tweaks in a software update but I am not really getting my hopes up that MS/Nokia will do anything in this direction..</p>

            DDDee is right! LOL. I have the double tab issue for two weeks now and nothing helped:<br />
Hard Reset, Soft Reset, Update..<br />
<br />
BUT when I squeezed the center of the Phone with one finger on the front and one finger on the bag, I noticed some clearance. After this, the Double Tap is working again..<br />
<br />
In my oppinion there is a quality issue with the Lumia 930, because I already noticed the clearance when I unpacked the Phone one month ago. It would be very helpful if there would be more feedback of other users with the same issue. Maybe they could also fix
 it by squeezing the phone..

<p>Hi Max,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried the solution provided by elbab’s reply? May I know if you have fixed the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to save as AutoCAD Drawing and AutoCAD Interchange from Visio, and I can’t reproduce this issue. In this case, if the 126 error persists, I’d suggest that you go to File &gt; Account &gt; Office
 Updates to update your Visio to the latest version to fix this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue couldn’t be solved by Online Repair, please provide the following information and let us further investigate it for you:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>A screenshot of the error message;</span></li><li><span>A screenshot of the version information of your Visio. You may check it from File &gt; Account &gt; About Visio.
</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan Li</p>

<h2>            Account Linked to Old Email ID - Unable to Login</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very recently skype logged me out of old Skype account (on both my phone and work computer) and forced me to try and log back in, which it no longer lets me do.</p>
<p>I know the password but for some reason must also now receive a confirmation email due to some automated security having been triggered complaining about someone else (also me) already being logged in.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Now when i attempt to log back in i realize the account was setup on an a very old hotmail email address (more than 10 years out of use). As such i can no longer log into the account as i cannot receive the confirmation email or remember any of the details
 of the old account to fill in the form to change the email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do travel a lot and work across a number of VPN's based in different countries so I can see why the automated security would trigger, however need a way around this to access my old account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know how i can access my other account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/6000fc67-9e95-4865-9ec7-33eedac56272" title="Fabian Fabio">
<p>
</p><p>Since you no longer have access to the email address associated with your account, your&nbsp;best option to recover it is by filling out the
<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Account Recovery form</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the form, you will be ask to enter&nbsp;an email address that is different to the email address associated with the account you are trying to recover. This is to ensure that you will be able to receive&nbsp;the code or notification Skype will send to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me give you some tips to help you&nbsp;pass the verification:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fill out the form from a computer that was previously used to sign in to that account, and was successful. Also, it is much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred.</li><li>Be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally, even if there were recent changes. The 4 basic information (First Name, Last Name, Birthdate and Current/Old Passwords are the best and easiest way to prove your Online Identity)</li><li>Fill out only information that you are just 100% sure and in the best of your knowledge. You don't need to fill out everything but make sure that you have provided enough for you to pass this validation. The 4 basic information is more than enough to prove
 your identity - as long as it matches the system's record.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post.
<br />
Thank you!<br />

    <title>E90 - charging problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deepakalur  say:</h3>
<h2>            E90 - charging problem</h2>
                    Hello:<br />
<br />
I have an E90 which I was pretty happy, before until it started malfunctioning.<br />
<br />
If I put it on charge, the screen says it is charging but never gets charged. On giving this to a Nokia care center in Bangalore, they flashed it twice thinking software problem but problem persisted.<br />
<br />
Last week, I gave it to another Nokia care center for the same problem. Now they have come back saying they cannot repair it!<br />
They have no idea as to how it can be repaired.<br />
<br />
I got a new battery and a charger but still the same problem persists.<br />
<br />
Any inputs/comments?

            I find it hard to believe that a genuine Nokia care centre are unable to repair a Nokia phone.<br />
Or if they consider it beyond economic repair and it is under warranty they should replace it.

            That doesn't surprise me from a developing country, where it's difficult to get competent personelle.<br />
I don't have a charging problem myself, my handset usually takes a couple of hours or so to get a full charge &amp; it should be good for 3 days of use.

<h2>            ActiveX controls are not displaying in Excel 2016 vba user forms</h2>
                    <p>Good morning</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Excel 2016 ActiveX controls are not available to add to vba user forms (Other Form Controls are OK). The issue seems to have arisen since an upgrade by Microsoft and has not effected ActiveX controls in a worksheet. The proble also seems to exist in
 Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any quick fix to the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>Unlike Worksheets, I cannot recall there ever being 2 sets of&nbsp;controls for use on a Userform. See the&nbsp;link below for more information.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work through these procedures. Check after each.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. With the warning that a reset will delete AutoComplete data, such as passwords (do you have those backed up?) and you will have to reinstall or re-enable browser add-ons, use the Reset IE Settings button in Internet Options&gt; Advanced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a reset of IE settings will do:<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. See Dissed's answer here:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie9-windows_7/i-keep-getting-an-error-from-webpage-saying-object/66192f78-4d5b-4000-b0f5-8e91bf481f53">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie9-windows_7/i-keep-getting-an-error-from-webpage-saying-object/66192f78-4d5b-4000-b0f5-8e91bf481f53</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. See if a browser add-on is causing the problem. <br />
Start Internet Explorer without add-ons by right-clicking the IE icon on the desktop. Choose Start without add-ons.<br />
or<br />
from Start&gt; Programs&gt; Accessories&gt; System tools&gt; Internet Explorer (no add-ons)<br />
If the problem goes away,&nbsp;an add-on is causing it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It should; again, I do not have Windows Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the computer, the classic FileNew gives you a dialog box with a display of templates. The templates shown are those in the User Templates folder, which by default is the personal templates folder in Word 2013. This is not a Windows window, but a dialog
 box. Nevertheless, if you right-click on one of those templates in this dialog, you can delete one. This deletes it from the computer, not just from this dialog box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, I do not know the equivalent of right-click on a touch interface. </p>

<p>I had a default template in the "personal templates" folder in MS Word that I had created and
</p>
<p>eventually didn't want. Could not seem to get rid of it, and it was bugging me how to delete it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cick the properties link on the template file. Find the computer path to the template file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time it will be in computer/user/name/appdata/roaming/Microsoft/Templates&nbsp; folder.</p>
<p>If there is only one template listed, you might have to close the word program to delete it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I had to do to delete the template file and it worked for me. </p>

 buttons, nor contacts. Nothing at all. I closed it and tried to open it again, but the error window showed up and that I should contact the support and that Skype may need to be downloaded once again. I thought maybe it's because I hadn't upgraded my laptop's
 operating system, so I did it. Then (after upgrade) Skype wouldn't work either. I deleted it completely from my device and wanted to download it again, but the file I downloaded from Skype site doesn't want to open. I can click on it thousand times and nothing
 is happening. I tried downloading it multiple times, but it does nothing. I don't know what to do, I'm only using Skype to talk with my friends. People, please help :(

            Okay, my&nbsp;computer just didn't restart after the update so it wasn't fully done. Now Skype should work ;)

<h2>            Outlook 2016 &#40;on Premise&#41; keeps asking for credentials</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past few days all our PC have the same problem. constant prompts for credentials. I've carried out all of the proposed 'fixes' in this forum, none work. I have even tried formatting the HD and done a complete reinstall of the whole OS and MS Office
 on 1 PC, the same problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are currently on version 1711 build 8730.2175 click to run.</p>
<p>Exchange server is off premise being hosted by Intermedia I believe</p>
<p>running on 5 Windows 7 pro 64 bit, 1 Windows 10 pro 64 bit and 1 Windows 10 home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 pro 64 bit PC also doesn't display pictures in emails, the links work, but no pic. And yes it's not the security settings turned off. For this problem adding the registry key worked for a few hours, but now it's back again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There also seems to be a sync issue as different PC's show different unread emails, but could just be being delayed whilst waiting for credentials.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Barry</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to contact Intermedia who host our Exchange. They've dealt with a lot of people with this issue since the recent Office update to Build 1711. They suggested reverting back to a previous version to see if it fixed the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reverted back to&nbsp;Office 2016 to Version 1709 (build 8528.2147) from October 25, 2017 all of my issues have disappeared. These are the steps I took</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open CMD prompt as admin</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Run: cd %programfiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\ClickToRun</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Then run: officec2rclient.exe /update user updatetoversion=16.0.8528.2147</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Let it do its thing.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Turn off auto update in Office/ Account</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>All done</span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You might want to pass that information on to others in your office. <br />

<h2>            Samsung Propel and Windows 7 connectivity issue</h2>
                    I recently bought a laptop with Windows 7 and when I connect my Samsung Propel SGH-A767 to it, I get a message that it can't find the drivers for it. I had no problems with my old laptop with XP. I have looked and can't find any drivers that indicate it
 would solve this issue. Any ideas would be appreciated.

<p>Assuming each chapter has 1 section break separating it from the others:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click in each section of your document and choose <strong>Insert&gt;Footnote...</strong></li><li>Under the <em>Format</em> section, change the <em>Numbering</em> dropdown from
<em>Continuous</em> to <strong>Restart each section</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Changing the numbering between the 2 values can sometimes change the numbers displayed. If so, use the same dialog to set the

<p>I have section breaks. Other clues to the issue. This is a large 250 page manuscript, so I have copied a couple of sections to a new file and on one occasion the footnote numbering ignored the section breaks (I had not changed then to endnotes) and on another
 occasion the same chapters half converted to roman numerals.</p>
<p>This is a massive body of work with 500+ notes and I am struggling as to what to do next.</p>
<p>

            Thanks. Please see the other thread comments. As this is such a large body of work and not published yet I am a bit reluctant to release it into the public domain. Do I have a corrupted file perhaps and how do I resolve that. This is not looking good!!

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No updated information. I have learnt that it is NOT possible in Word to put endnotes at the end of a document with the section breaks maintained. So this is not possible: Chapter 1 notes 1-15, Chapter 2 notes 1-25 etc etc. This replicates the footnotes
 shown by section.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Software Installation Issues</h2>
                    I've installed Windows 10 Technical Preview. &nbsp;And most of my software installed fine. &nbsp;Avast! antivirus had a compatibility issue, but I'm not surprised some things would with a beta operating system. &nbsp;What does surprise me is that files downloaded yesterday
 and today will not install. &nbsp;The system says I don't have administrator rights. &nbsp;Right clicking the file and telling it to run as administrator still won't let me install them. &nbsp;Other earlier downloads from the same source install fine. &nbsp;And all of them install
 without issue on my Win 8.1 laptop. &nbsp;These are items from several different download sources. &nbsp;I'm not sure What changed from when I installed Win 10 and when it decided to get picky. &nbsp;Any thoughts or ideas?

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. You have reached the right place and I will try my best to assist you with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to ask few questions regarding this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1) Are you logged in as an administrator on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>2) Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>3) What is the name of the software that you are trying to install on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Method 1: Create a new Administrator Account and check if the issue persists in the new Account</span></em></strong></p>

<span>
<p><span>If the issue persists in the new account as well, then try installing the software in the compatibility mode and check the status.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Method 2: Install the Software in Windows 8/8.1 Compatibility Mode</span></em></strong></p>

            <p>I downloaded the 32 bit ISO and successfully created a bootable DVD. However, when I went to boot the disk, I discovered that although I had a CD Drive and a DVD drive, that my computer would only boot from the CD, USB or Drive 0, the internal hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No problem, I'll just burn the ISO to a USB Memory Stick. I grabbed a 4 GB stick, reformated it and generated the new ISO to the USB. However this didn't work either. The computer simply ignores the memory stick even though you see the led blinking. In any
 event, no go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that is somewhat unusual about my installation is that I have a dual booted computer. I normally boot into Windows 7, but I was planning to put Windows 10 Preview on the XP partition. I can't see where this would be a problem, but as of this
 moment, it's a no go with with the Technical Preview.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Sorry for the delay in responding. &nbsp;Things have been busy. &nbsp;And I had one whole answer that disappeared because Win10 periodically decides to lose connectivity. &nbsp;Anyway....</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I have only one login and it doesn't seem to offer a separate admin login option. &nbsp;I'll check out the article on that you referenced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) A definite yes to security software. &nbsp;AVG antivirus, Comodo firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Most of the files are third party add-ons for e-Sword Bible software, one is Bible Analyzer. &nbsp;I'll check out the article on installing in compatibility mode. &nbsp;But I should note that sticking them in dropbox and accessing them from my Win8.1 laptop, they
 install just fine there. &nbsp;So, I'm not sure there's a compatibility issue. &nbsp;I also tried wiping them out, downloading from my 8.1 laptop, then transferring via dropbox. &nbsp;Still no love from Win 10.</p>

<h2>            206 update problem - cannot update from 3.58 to 4.51</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all, hope someone can help with my Nokia 206 problem. I'm in the UK on the O2 network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My 206 has software version 3.58. Having read on the Nokia website that the latest version is 4.51 and this would deliver many benefits, I decided to TRY to upgrade to 4.51.</p>
<p>My first attempt was to try OTA updating, but this and every repeated attempt has failed saying that there was no update available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I decided to install Nokia Suite. After installing the latest version (3.8) I found that this version of Nokia Suite does not support the 206. So I have now installed version 3.6.36 which DOES support the 206 (via Bluetooth) and enables me to backup /
 sync contacts, messages etc, but then tells me that my 206 software is V 03.58 and is "up to date". Also says my phone memory is 12.0 MB of 27.5 MB free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice please on how I could upgrade to 4.51?</p>

            You need to talk to 02 about the update as they will push it out

O2 is a UK mobile network operator. I have already contacted them, as suggested by jimmyireland, but no solution so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have since ordered a 32GB micoSD card for the 206 so as to eliminate any memory-related problems which could affect the downloading of v4.51. As soon as I have this installed I will repeat my attempts at updating to v4.51 by OTA and also by Nokia Suite
 3.6.36 (via Bluetooth).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will post again as soon as I have any news which may be of interest to others.</p>

<p>Updates seems to not be available in all countries all time of one reason or an other. Here in Sweden its the same situation. I have 2 Nokia 206 and one of them i could update successfully i november but the other one was not possible to update last weekend.
 Maybe it is a new update coming soon, later version then 4.51. Nokia have released updates for several Asha devices recently.<br />
<br />
Nokia 206 can only be updated by FOTA. If you have a Nokia Care service point where you are you can get help with updating your device there.</p>

            Thanks for the replies.<br />
I will try to go to a care center to see if they can do the upgrade.<br />
I will comment on the progress.<br />

<p>O2 (my UK mobile network operator)&nbsp;is&nbsp;offering&nbsp;no OTA software update for the 206. So I'm stuck with v3.58 - unfortunately I have no Nokia Care Centre within a reasonable travelling distance.</p>

            Exactly the same problems with me.. No updates available &amp; no Nokia service centre within 90 miles. Maybe I should have bought the dual sim version?..

<p>&nbsp;please, have a look at the label on your phone. T<span>here, what is your 7-letter code (product code)? That code determines your firmware variant which determines your current version. Then we can check together if you have the latest version.</span></p>

<p>sorry to say, but If your phone has not received the v. 4.51 update by now, there is a very high probability that it won't receive it at all. SW update availability always depends to certain extend on local country/operator approvals.</p>

<p>I just have done the update</p>
<p>I was expecting more new functions, particularly about setting the 2 sim cards</p>
<p>bit disapointed ...</p>
