<h2>            Volume hotkeys</h2>
                    So I wanted to activate my debug screen in java edition mc, but when I press F3 it increases the volume. Can I change the volume hotkey in win. 10 to something else? (pause, end, etc.)

            hi Underpika,
<br />often the f keys have a dual function look for a fn key (often near the space bar)
<br />hold the fn key then press f3
<br />
<br />also look at the keyboard settings, your driver may include an option to change the default function (ie hold fn to change the volume)
<br />click start, type settings and select mouse and keyboard settings, look for "swap f keys" or something similar
<br />
<br />if you can give us the make and model of the device (or keyboard) we might be able to give more precise instructions.

    <title>Windows 8.1 update and unable to print - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johncleverdon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 update and unable to print</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an Asus X750JN laptop with win 8.1 Pro 64-bit preinstalled.</p>
<p>Everything was running pretty smoothly until I installed a number of windows updates on May 16.</p>
<p>On that day, I could print using a Samsung CLP-365 colour laser printer; after the updates, I couldn't print at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I though the problme might be the followoing update:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3876f00-8dfe-4ed9-9eb1-b93296dd06ad" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalling &amp; reinstalling didn't work, and I got error messages like this when trying a different samsung printer installation (after installation - in Devices and Printers):</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2bcd29f6-2534-4221-b350-341993d387ae" /></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05d584ac-7187-4bc6-833d-487055a52381" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, trying other printers (eg a Lexmark B&amp;W laser at home, and an HP B&amp;W laser at work) gives similar error messages once installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only printer that does work is an older HP Deskjet (multi-function- F2100).</p>
<p>Apart from this, the laptop is running fine.</p>
<p>I'm careful with security when online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of searching suggests one of the updates on the 16th is the cause of the trouble.</p>
<p>On the laptpo, there is a subdirectory within C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\ created on the 16th May (cause of these problems??).<br />
It has a long gibberish name, but even when running ‘cmd’ as Administrator, I still can’t access/delete these files.<br />
<br />
Another issue could be in ‘services.msc’.<br />
Name - ’Printer Extensions’ has a description of ‘&lt;Failed to read description error code S&gt;’</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm relucant to try System Restore as I don't know how much it will delete. I can do it to 16th (before above problem updates) but this would see deleting of MS Office and other software.</p>
<p>Although I've got a partitioned HDD, I don't kow how many docs/photos/emails/etc in a seprate partition to that for Windows would be removed as well with System Restore - it seems too risky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got the IT support company at work to check this out using remote access software and even they are stumped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm the only user and have adminstrative rights for the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just about pulling my hair out with this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>John</p>
<p>

            I am also having a problem the same as you but my printer is an Epson.&nbsp; I even went and bought a new printer and the same thing is happening all since the update on 16th May 15.&nbsp; I have tried system recovery and that did not work either the only thing
 left now is to factory settings and they are from 2012.&nbsp; Not sure what to do now.

            <p>Helli Lillian,</p>
<p>Interesting to see someone else has the same problem - thankfully I'm not on my own.</p>
<p>It seems to be a case of "Earth calling Microsoft - is there anyone at Microsoft listening, let alone willing to help out users of their products?"</p>
<p>I rang Microsoft's (Australian) support line on 132 058 last weekend, but after explaining the problem, was told that I would need to pay $80 before any assistance was provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very frustrating and stressful, espeically as Win8.1 is running OK <em>apart
</em>from the printers, and the programs on the laptop are running fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, some more screen dumps for thise who may be able to help out:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Proof that the problem is with Windows 8.1, not other Windows versions:</strong></p>
<p>The following screen dumps are from my wokr win7 desktop, after a Samsung SLC410 was installed (with no actual printer attached).</p>
<p>Devices and Printers - 'Printer Preferences' and 'Printer Properties'.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Notes:</p>
<p>This is how things looked on the Win 8.1 laptop at home with the Samsung CLP365
<em>before </em>the Windows Updates on the 16th May.</p>
<p>After these Windows Updates, I got the error messages above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jus to make it even more puzzling, I tried the above procedure with the Samung SLC410 on the windows 8.1 laptop, and got the following under Devices and Printers - Print Server Properties:</p>

            <p>Sorry, I hit the wrong button. Here is the rest:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to make it even more puzzling, I tried the above procedure with the Samung SLC410 on the windows 8.1 laptop, and got the following under Devices and Printers - Print Server Properties:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6833fa7b-eeb3-4d37-ada5-3e358db796b4" /></p>
<p>So, it seems that the drivers are installed, its just that the Windows Updates won't let anything be printed due to some glitch in them (or otherwise the corrupt Windows Update is preventing access to them ...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following updates are those from the 16th May, it is obvious that one of these is 'cancerous' towards printers:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01440b13-60ec-4b3c-bc79-464cabbc1fc6" /></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/093eaa6d-c352-4e81-8bb0-386e6dab3287" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the 'servivces.msc' error message I mentioned yesterday:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0af6a0f7-f08b-40b0-a41c-423abcfc3f0d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the C:/Windows/System32/spool/drivers/X64 directory I mentione dyesterday with the 'dubious' (?) subdirectories:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e0ff822d-d44e-43f8-af15-1e0a68b95737" /></p>
<p>The subdirectory dated '12/07/2014' I can access (as this would have been created when installing the printers soon after I bought the laptop, IIRC).</p>
<p>However, I can't access the other two subdirectories, but instead get this error message:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e8d72721-2f38-425c-8c90-30e878288d29" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just FYI, here is Powershell for the Lexmark printer:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/650c525b-7d8b-46b7-a68d-4cdc36a50f32" /></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9dadb4d-5e2b-4eb8-b617-283d6d364121" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone out there who can help please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lillian, your comments about System Recovery suggest it's not worth trying System Restore or anything similar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to have to go back to 'Sqaure 1' and reinstall everything or even buy a new PC ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>John</p>

            <p>Hello Lillian,</p>
<p>Can you please email me direct at: jac at watsons dot net dot au and provide more details with your situation where the printers haven't worked?
</p>
<p>It may be an opportunity to see if there is something in common causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Friday, I uninstalled all Windows updates 16 May onwards (except for KB3021910, which can't be uninstalled), but still had no luck with installing printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least I'm still able to print to the HP DeskJet F2120, as that isn't normally connected to the PC and wasn't when the 16 May updates were done.&nbsp; However, I can't understand why nothing new can be installed - I've tried HP, Lexmark and Brother printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rang Microsoft again, this time they suggested it wasn't their problem/fault and run System Restore to prove this (which in my case there is no need to do).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>John</p>

    <title>How do I reactivate WinX after installing it on a new hard drive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shojo dagger  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I reactivate WinX after installing it on a new hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop that had a small SSD for the OS &amp; a larger HDD.</p>
<p>The SSD went kaput on me. (the laptop is still functional however, it seems like the OS files were also installed to the HDD or something, I don't know, I didn't set up the OS &amp; storage options, it came that way when I bought it)</p>
<p>So when I buy a new SSD I'll need to clean install Windows to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I bought the laptop used from a dealer, it had originally had Win 7 on it &amp; had been upgraded to WinX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the "add account" option in the activation folder to get a product key, but that just brings up a blank white box with nowhere to sign into! Even if I could sign into a microsoft account from the activation section, there is something confusing
 me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at a "help" page about this &amp; it says <span>that I should "enter the password for your local account if the Microsoft account you entered isn’t a connected account". What is that supposed to mean? What do they mean by "local account"? Do they mean
 they want my windows login password? Why would Microsoft want/need the password for my computer? That seems like A) none of their business &amp; B) a security risk to give them.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>How do I get a key to re-activate WinX after I reinstall it? I read an article that I could use my Win 7 key (my pc has still has the CoA for win 7), is that method still available?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I bought this laptop with a legitimate copy of WinX on it, the OS was included in the price of the PC, therefore I bought this copy of WinX legitimately, I don't see why I can't get the key for it, or why I should be forced to re-buy an new copy of
 Windows, just because Microsoft doesn't want to give pc owners the keys to prove they have legitimate copies of the OS.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to be able to re-activate the OS which I already have, without buying an expensive new "license" for the OS, which I have already bought with my laptop and am evidently licensed to use as it is already activated &amp; working on my pc.&nbsp; I'm pretty
 frustrated trying to find answers about this, every article I've read about this says to use the "add account" option to get a product key, but as I said that is not working for me! How do I add an account to get a product key if I can't sign in from the "add
 account" button?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also where can I get installation files for version 1607? I've seen nothing but problems reported with version 1703 &amp; it doesn't have any features I want/need/would use either.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just one thing I would like clarified: </p>
<p>Should I install/activate Win 7 first, then "upgrade install" WinX over it. Or do I just install WinX to the empty drive &amp; enter my Win 7 key to activate it? ( I do still have a Win 7 installation disc I can use)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I found the CD burning instructions a little lacking. </p>
<p>Can I just burn the ISO to a cd with IMG burn? I think my system has a UEFI (and a regular BIOS screen), do I have to use a USB just because of the UEFI, or can I burn it to a CD &amp; install it with the UEFI?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the extra questions, but this is just frustrating. </p>
<p>
</p><p><del>Also I have tried downloading the ISOs but the download gets to around 4 GB of the 4.1 GB and then "fails" to finish the download. (I'm trying yet again as I type this)</del></p>
<p><del>If I download the .exe can I mount that onto a bootable CD with IMG burn?</del></p>
<p>Edit: nevermind the struckthrough part. Turns out the 4.1GB file is "too large" for the empty 32GB usb drive I'm trying to put it on...(?) I'm downloading at my local library right now (my laptop is now giving me problems starting up &amp; not really
 usable) and the file problem seems to be with the library pc that I'm using. bleg &gt;(</p>

<p>Hi Marco,</p>
<p>You can contact the manufacturer to see if they might be albe to find some distinction on the cam, or you might try one of the drivers on the website Ajay linked above.</p>
<p>I think there may only be two cams like the one you own.</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>How long have you had the computer?</p>
<p>What is the computer make and model? What is the motherboard make and model?</p>
<p>Is the system error free?</p>
<p>Event Viewer Reports</p>
<p>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution. Most system related errors are logged
 and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</p>
<p>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes System is by far the most important.</p>
<p>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows Logs and System.
 Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to click a second time to see the latest Report
 at the top. </p>
<p>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Click on the Copy button to place a copy on your Clipboard
 and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</p>
<p>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports that offer the best information but occasionally
 Warning Reports provide useful clues. </p>
<p>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports. Study reports since the point when the computer
 was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session. If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</p>
<p>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on the internet. The description is equally important
 and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting better results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</p>

<h2>            xbox games on the surface rt</h2>
                    <p>we are trying to play xbox 'hidden treasures' on our new surface rt but we can't get past the kettle in the first game. I&nbsp;am not sure if the problem is with the game or the tablet as it can be unresponsive or slow on other apps. Yesterday the game froze
 altogether and appeared covered in tiny lines but it's fine today apart from we can't 'try out the kettle' or by pass it as the touch screen isn't compatible with the move.</p>

<p>The 2015 and 2016(latest version) versions of rtwlanu.sys were giving the same errors.</p>
<p>So i searched online and got a 2013 version 1026.4.1023.2013 of the rtwlanu.sys file and replaced it. And in the windows update I used windows hide/show updates to prevent the file from being automatically updated. It has now solved my problem.</p>

            Hi Jack, my name is Andrew and I'm an Independent advisor here to help you.
<br />
<br />I can recommend Math Input Panel, it is the only built-in Microsoft tool for Windows. This tool allows for automatic expansion when the input text reaches the right corner of the panel. In case the above level of expansion is limited, you can increase the resolution to expand it even more.
<br />You can also use the search engine to search for any third party app with that function.
<br />
<br />Thanks, 
<br />Andrew N.
<br />
<br />Note: Using Third Party Software or Link, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software or Link can be solved. Using Third Party Software or Link is at your own risk.

    <title>How do I search for parenthesis&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I search for parenthesis&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>How do I search for a file that includes parenthesis? I need to search for files that include the following three characters: "(2)". But the search ignores my parenthesis and returns everthing with a "2" in it. I've tried putting my search in quotes, but
 it didn't help.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Shane.</p>

            <blockquote>...Also, the quotes are extraneous and can be left off.<br />
~ is the literal string indicator and what follows has to match the entire file name that's why the asterisks were included. You can also do the following:<br />
~*(2)*<br />
~*(2).doc<br />
~this_is_my(2).doc<br />
~th?s*(2).???<br />

I have just moved over to a new laptop and ended up duplicating a load of pdf files that ended up with (2).pdf at the end.I wanted to select them all and delete easily and am glad I found this thread. I would like to clarify that the parenthises are required.<br />
<br />
I tried searching for ~*(2).pdf but this did not bring up the desired results. The search brought up everything I was looking for, but it also included many more results I did not expect to appear. Namely those with 2 anywhere in the file name. Examples that
 were shown in the results included files ending in such things as:<br />
<br />
2-RD30.pdf<br />
issue 2.pdf<br />
volume 2 issue 5.pdf<br />
<br />
Using quotation marks around the search term ie. ~"*(2).pdf" worked in the way I wanted and only brought up the duplicated files I was searching for.<br />

<p>I was having a serious problem with this, too, and found the following from another forum:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>name:~"*(2)*"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>which in my case finds any files with a (2) in the name.&nbsp; Totally 'tarded, and there should be an intuitive way for searching on parenthesis.&nbsp; It is the worst!&nbsp; I think this is emblematic of why Microsoft will not win in the long haul.&nbsp; They think like techies
 for interface design, and they're too set to change.</p>

    <title>Deletion of legitimate programs by Windows 10 automatic updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicksteinitz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deletion of legitimate programs by Windows 10 automatic updates</h2>
                    <p>Earlier this year we bought a computer with Windows 7 Professional as the operating system. Around July Microsoft upgraded the operating system to Windows 10 (without prior warning or consent), and it now runs under Windows 10.&nbsp; We don't like recent Microsoft
 email clients so for emails we have been using Outlook Express, in a version adapted for Windows 7, 8 and 10 by RunAsXp.com, and available from them to download online for a small donation.&nbsp; It is an excellent program, just like the old XP version, and ran
 perfectly under Windows 7 without any problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the Windows 10 upgrade procedure totally deleted it, along with all the email content, address book and account data etc.&nbsp; We managed to re-install the program with advice from RunAsXp.com and had
 fortunately backed up most of the emails and address book which we re-imported.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It then ran perfectly under Windows 10 until the first Windows 10 automatic update, two days ago, which again totally deleted the program along with the content.&nbsp; We have once more re-installed the program, but this time have so far been unable to recover
 the emails it contained.&nbsp; Moreover, we learn from RunAsXp's website that Windows 10 automatic updates will always delete it, every time it runs, the only apparent fix being to disable automatic updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why should Microsoft need to do this to a perfectly sound and legitimate piece of software, just because it is not official and Microsoft approved? &nbsp; It performs perfectly, is just what we want, and does not appear to create any operating problems for Windows
 10.&nbsp; The problem does not arise under Windows 7, where updates leave the program unscathed.&nbsp; This conduct by Microsoft is surely indefensible and anti-competitive.&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) How can we prevent this happening again?&nbsp; (2) How do we recover our lost emails?&nbsp; (3)
 If we have to disable automatic updates what is the downside, and how can we be sure of getting the updates we need without again deleting Outlook Express?</p>

            <p>Microsoft totality ended Outlook Express years ago as outdated and insecure. You found a company that made it work with Windows 7 but now are having problems in Windows 10. This is not Microsoft problem, it is not their responsibility to make a discontinued
 program work in their Operating System. It is up to the other company to make any changes if it is to be useable. There are many other good&nbsp;email programs available that work as they should in Windows 10 all versions.</p>
<p>

            <p>Windows Photo viewer is not an application that comes separately, there won’t be any site in Microsoft that you can help you re-download it. As a replacement or tool that
 Microsoft has created for (Windows Live Users) Photographic Gallery included in the kit of Windows Live Essentials, it works pretty much the same as Windows Photo Viewer.
</p>
<p>Windows Live Essentials –</p>

<p>Windows Restore –</p>
<p>As you know System Restore is a tool that allows you to go back in time undoing changes that the operating system has done (Only System wise – Files will not be affected).
 On the steps that will appear below you will see that in Step 2 after opening the tool (System Restore) where you can see the dates and times of the possible restore points, there is a check box that appears at the bottom left (Show more restore points). After
 clicking in this check box, more restore points will appear.</p>
<p>For more information about System Restore, check Microsoft link:</p>

            <p>Dear <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/9890031a-00f0-4ae6-a144-93df6b8ae8fe">
Sudarshan</a>:</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your guidance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allow me to follow you questions with corresponded answers:</p>
<p>1.I didn't make any changes to the system but the changes occured of course and what is the reason I don't know;</p>
<p>2.When inserting the SD cart or connecting the camera to USB port happens absolutely nothing - the AutoPlay doesn't work. I can still see the SD cart in My Computer window and able to copy files from or to SD cart manually. Before the Windoows Phto Viewer
 took the lead and downloaded the files automaticaly after I have instructed it in the first time.</p>
<p>3. No error message at all.</p>
<p>4. Yest and the reaction is the same - no AutoPlay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now it is tiime to follow your Methids.</p>
<p>Method 1. The recommendation at Microsoft site is: </p>
<p>=====================</p>
<p>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click<strong> Start</strong>, click
<strong>All Programs</strong>, click <strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>
Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>.</li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<div><span>sfc /scannow</span></div>
The <b>sfc /scannow</b> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.
</li></ol>
<p>=====================</p>
<p>In reality when cliking on Command Promt you are coming directly to DOS screen without any options like "<strong>Run as administrator</strong>". And of course when typing "sfc/scannow" you are being rejected by the system in the following way"you must be
 an administrator running a console session in order to use the sfc utility".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know any other way how to ruun the SFC?</p>
<p>2. Method 2 is too complicated for me, sorry for that. It is easier to restore the factory settings in my opinion (adding after all existing apps)</p>
<p>3. Method 3 - I have already went through Troubleshooter and AutoPlay problems page before - didn't work for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually I may use any of the Photo editing programs installed on my PC in order to download pics from SD card automaticaly, but the issue is that the system became corrupted and I'dв like to find the reason or, at list, to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any other helpful suggestions please help.</p>

DarkDante</a>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are absolutely right - thre is an option&nbsp;"Show more restore points". Without this option I can jump back in 2 days, with it I have 3 days. Maximum.</p>
<p>On XP I was able to go back months ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know a real remedy?</p>

            Hi Michael,
<br />
<br />If you can not power down from explorer and you wish to power down safely, do the below.
<br />
<br />Press the Windows Key + R to open the Run prompt
<br />Type CMD and press Enter
<br />In the Command Prompt window that opens type
<br />
<br />Shutdown -f -t 00
<br />
<br />This will force your PC to shutdown cleanly, straight away.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards,
<br />Ryan       
        </p>

<p>Thanks Ryan, I was able to pull up the windows system 32 code, however my computer did not immediately restart and offers several reasons why i might want to shut down. &nbsp;There are several that apply, would it matter which i chose? &nbsp;Sorry for the late reply,
 i just returned from work.</p>

            That's odd - it should just shutdown straight away with that input.
<br />But no it does not matter which one you choose.
