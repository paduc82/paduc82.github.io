                    Have changed the sleep and screen time out settings numerous times and even restart after changes. Restarting only results in a temporary fix not longer than 2hours and sometimes doesn't work.

            Hi Kay.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Has the screen saver possibly been invoked, which can happen if some Themes are loaded which have a screen saver timeout?  Check at Settings-&gt; Personalization-&gt; Lock Screen, scroll down to Screen Saver settings.  
<br />
<br />To be sure of Power Options, I would set a Balanced Plan, then Change Plan Setttings, then choose the link to Reset Plan to Defaults.  
<br />
<br />Sleep issues can go to Display adapter.  Update your Display driver from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.  If no newer driver then right click Start button to open Device Manager, choose Display adapter, on Driver tab choose Roll Back Driver, restart PC.  If this doesn't help, choose Update driver Automatically.  If that doesn't help then choose Uninstall Driver, restart PC to reinstall the driver.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can roll back Fall Creators Update Version 1709 to the older version until it matures:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstall-windows-10-creators-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstal...</a>
<br />
<br />Then hide the Update using the Hide Update Tool so it doesn't try to force itself:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Where do I find w7 64 bit driver for NetGear FA310TX Ethernet Adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve_b1966  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where do I find w7 64 bit driver for NetGear FA310TX Ethernet Adapter</h2>
                    <p>Ok, a few Answers for Windows&nbsp;7- 32 bit versions,<u> but none for the Windows7-64 bit versions</u>.....<u> (I had to use Windows 2000 to connect to the internet to post this, because The Drivers&nbsp;DO NOT seem&nbsp;exist for my Network Adapter(s) and No
<strong>Windows 7 Couldn't find the Onboard Motherboard NIC either</strong>. The Motherboard is NEW, Asus AMD Socket 3+, AMD Athlon Dual Core 3 Ghz, with 16 MB of ram and a 1 TB Hard Drive.)&nbsp; and Yes it was a clean install on a brand new SATAII Hard Drive!<br />
</u></p>
<p>This site claims that Windows 7 will install a NetGear FA310TX Ethernet Adapter Automatically,&nbsp;
<u>No Drivers at all for the 64 bit versions!!</u> &nbsp;All of my Previous O.S. (Except 3.1 and 95) loaded this ethernet adapter without any problems, and the ethernet adapter was working well before Windows 7 was installed.<br />
<br />
<u>Windows 7 reminds me of Windows 3.1, almost nothing works on it, serious lack of compatability with anything, including Games, hardware, Word Processing Programs, ect.
<br />
<br />
</u>Also No outlook express, for e-mail!!!??&nbsp; What Gives here?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing Windows 7 seems to be good for is hogging up memory and hard drive space&nbsp;(and I thought XP was bad) and maybe browsing the internet, and listening to music! &nbsp;Windows 7 appears to
 have been designed to not work with anything, or do anything, anyone wants to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>How about some backwards compatability?</strong>&nbsp; <strong>P.C. Hard Ware Manufacturers have to do it!!
</strong>(Guess I better hold on to my Windows ME/2K and Xp Machines so I can keep doing what I need to Do!)<br />
<br />
I was an OEM System Builder 13 years ago, so I will state this, I have had Windows ME and Windows 2000 running stable and crash free since I got them. I even had Windows 98 1st Edition running stable, after I fixed the DOS Problems. (if I want to show my age
 I still have a machine Running DOS 2.11 that works!) I have had nothing but problems with all of the versions of windows SINCE Windows 2000 and ME! XP and Vista locked up and wanted more Virtual memory no matter what! &nbsp;(1 TB Hard Drive, 3.0 Ghz Dual Core Processor,
 and 16 GB of DDR3 wasn't enough for them and no, there were no virus issues) but at least I could run everything I wanted to on them, and they had outlook express, and I could customize them to look like what I was used to making it more comfortable to use.<br />
<br />
<u>All versions of Windows 7 (Home, Pro, adn Ultimate) Fail in their&nbsp;lack compatability with hardware that's been around for a long time, that worked with all previous O.S.s&nbsp;With Windows 7&nbsp;you can't do anything with it.
<strong>&nbsp;Windows 7 was a compete waste of my Time and&nbsp;money</strong>...since it seems to be the only solution is to BUY add on Software and Hardware to make anything work!</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Now&nbsp;They're getting ready to&nbsp;Release Windows 8?&nbsp; maybe&nbsp;Windows 8&nbsp;should be FREE to those of us that were dumb enough to buy Windows 7?</u></strong></p>

            <p>Why didn't you use your Windows 2000 machine to download the Asus NIC driver? I have installed Windows 7 on a few computers, 32 and 64-bit, and have had no problem with it picking up on network cards. Maybe your onboard NIC is faulty or disabled in BIOS..
</p>
<p>The Netgear card would work ok with XP and its predecessors because Netgear supplied a driver for it, most likely a 32-bit only driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a few software and hardware incompatibilities whe switching from Win 9x/ME to XP. It was no better then than now.</p>
<p>And the only old piece of hardware&nbsp;I have that isn't supported is a Canon Lide 30 scanner from the early XP days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do you expect Microsoft to support all hardware when the hardware manufacturers CLEARLY do not want to support it or particularly have it supported by anybody else?</p>
<p>Can you give Microsoft the right and assurance that if they choose to take up where the hardware manufacturers left off, they will not end up in court?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quote " PC Hard Ware Manufacturers have to do it".. but they clearly haven't in the case fo the Netgear FA310TX.

                    I'm trying to fix a friend's computer and can't figure it out.&nbsp; Wireless network is fine (full bars, other computers connect to net), Windows Update connects and is running, but none of the browsers are able to open a web page.&nbsp; I get Error 10, unavailable

I've tried turning off Norton, turning off Windows firewall, reinstalling Chrome and Firefox... can anyone help?&nbsp; Thanks, hope I'm not being obtuse and missing something obvious...<br />

            <span>If you have forgotten your password, if you have another user account with administrative privileges you can log into that account and change your original user account's password from the User Accounts applet in Control Panel.
 If you don't have another account like this set up or don't have the password to it, you'll need to log into the built-in Administrator account. In XP Home, boot the computer into Safe Mode. Do this by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting
 up. This will get you to the right menu. Navigate using your Up arrow key; the mouse will not work here. Once in Safe Mode, you will see the normally hidden Administrator account. The default password is a blank.<br />
<br />
In XP Pro, you do not need to go into Safe Mode. At the Welcome Screen, do Ctrl-Alt-Del twice to get the classic Windows logon box. Type in "Administrator" and whatever password you assigned when you set up Windows.<br />
<br />
If you reset the built-in Administrator account's password in Home or have Pro and don't remember the password, use NTpasswd to change the built-in Administrator account's password to a blank. Download the bootable CD .iso, burn with third-party burning software
 such as Roxio, Nero, or the free <a href="http://www.imgburn.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ImgBurn</a> . Burn&nbsp;as an image, not as data. Boot with the media you created. You may need to change the boot order in the BIOS or get a temporary boot order menu with a special keypress. NTpasswd
 will run. Follow the instructions carefully.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://home.eunet.no/~pnordahl/ntpasswd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.eunet.no/~pnordahl/ntpasswd/</a>
<br />
<br />
Then go to the User Accounts applet in Control Panel and set passwords that you will remember and make other desired changes. WRITE THE PASSWORDS DOWN AND PUT THEM SOMEWHERE YOU WON'T LOSE THEM.<br />

<h3> paul959  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I connect a wireless printer to my XP laptop, The wizard does not allow wireless connections</h2>
                    I have a Brother MFC-5895CW printer connected to my BT home hub and use it successfully from other laptops using either windows 7 of Mac operating systems.<br />
<br />
However I am struggling to connect my XP home edition Lap top to it.<br />
<br />
When I try to "add a printer" I only get the option to install plug and play printers and therefore cannot search for the wireless printer that is already successfully installed on my network.<br />
<br />
Can anyone please help.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

            Hi KseniaLugovsky, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. 
<br /> 
<br />Did the BIOS update complete? You downloaded it from Watcom and applied as their docs specified?
<br />
<br />So you are at the usual login screen for Windows?
<br />
<br />You definitely need to check with Watcom Support as anything you do might make it worse if they need to fix something.
<br />
<br />Watcom - Support
<br /><a href="http://www.wacom.com/en-us/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wacom.com/en-us/support</a>
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />Since you can't log in the only options are to do a Factory Reset - check with Watcom Support and docs - or a Clean Install.
<br />
<br />If Watcom has no solutions (they really should) you can try these.
<br />
<br />When it starts to boot hold the power button down until it shuts off all the way. Do that 3 times. On the 3rd it will boot to System Recovery - Click see advanced options - Troubleshoot - Reset.
<br />
<br />Or Create Installation Media and do a Clean Install. Be sure to download and drivers and tools you need from Watcom afterward.
<br />
<br />A Clean Install then it would be activated with the Digital Entitlement.

</p><p><span>Did the BIOS update complete? You downloaded it from Watcom and applied as their docs specified?&nbsp;</span></p>

            Very good. Please let me know what you end up doing and if I can help further.
<br />
<br />BTW you can try the 3 Power OFF boot method above - then Troubleshoot - Advanced options - StartUp Repair.
<br />
<br />Options 6 here

<p>USB/DVD</p>
<p>USB/FDD</p>
<p>the 2 automated reboot options</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>USB/HDD</p>
<p>(seems to really like the usb but won't boot from it!)</p>
<p>Last reboot windows said the HDD was fatally damaged .</p>
<p>I connected the HDD to my eMachine desktop running win7pro and scanned it results said no errors, no bad sectors.</p>
<p>Tried to use it as the boot disc on emachine but it said widows is corrupted, tried using the rescue disc while connected to emachine but wouldn't try to repair drive G, the name emachine gave the usb drive case.</p>
<p>I tried contacting Acer support but after 4 days of no answer the finally said my laptop is out of warranty and they were no longer offering support for it!</p>
<p>That is when I decided to wipe the harddrive and try a clean install. emachine successfully reformatted it but when put back into acer I still get a message that looks like a windows message saying it cannot auto repair the drive. I also tried installing
 2 other HDD's but they are smaller and the laptop just doesn't even acknowledge them, saying no bot device found. That is where I am today. I no longer store files on &nbsp;laptop hardrives so so I have only lost windows, Adobe acrobat, and office 2010, which I
 have the original discs for, not windows just acrobat and office.</p>
<p>I would buy a new HDD if I was confident that would fix it but I don't feel sure with the conflicting data I am getting from the 2 computers. How can I try to reinstall windows? I have the repair disc for windows 8, a full set of acer restore discs for widows
 7 and original install discs for windowsXP but Acer won't read any from any drive.</p>

</p><p>I would suggest you to <em><strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/re-download-windows-8-from-a-vista-upgrade/2a370d6b-ff98-41ed-b701-2c12b041d02b">create&nbsp;installation media for Windows 8</a></strong></em>

<h2>            Windows 10 wont boot, blue screen, Stop code&#58; PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA. What failed&#58; Ntfs.sys</h2>
                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping to keep my old Acer Aspire Z3605 going. It was fully up to date with all the win 10 updates but i hadn't used it for a week or so, turned it on, it booted then restarted as it does when updating but just continued to hang. Eventually i shut it
 off by holding power button down, now usually when i restart it will restore to previous version, but this didn't happen. Now when i try to start it just comes up the Acer splash screen with the waiting circle, if i restart it, it will eventually&nbsp; "Automatic
 repair..." but then just goes to a black screen in which the mouse works&nbsp; but nothing else. Ive tried the windows 10 repair media but when i boot to USB the light on it flashes, but then goes to a black screen with no writing or options for repair. And then
 i eventually get the blue screen again showing the above mentioned fault. Ive looked through previous postings but nothing much helped so far. Any help would be gladly appreciated.</p>

            Thanks for the reply, unfortunately none of that works. When I choose to boot The USB flash drive it works, (light flashing on USB flash drive) but then just get a black screen then goes to a blue screen after a short time. The automatic repair tries to
 work also but hangs then goes to blue screen eventually. I'm going to try another scan and repair tool.&nbsp;

            I created a reanimator USB flash drive to boot into Winpe. From there i was able to check memory, scan HDD for errors. and pretty much look at everything. It appeared that the wifi controller had a problem and also noticed system battery may be flat. So
 i replaced the battery then powered up the PC, this time it booted nicely and did the automatic repair and i am now writing this email on it. Cheers for all the help, maybe replacing battery helped or just removing the battery to reset cmos.

            <p>I FINALLY found a fix for my alarm sound problem, so I thought I would share what I found. I hope this might help others with the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>I am running Windows 10 Anniversary Edition Pro 64-bit. My alarms and timers in the "Alarms &amp; Clock" app had stopped playing sounds a few days ago. Microsoft Support was unable to find a cause or a fix for the problem. I have a case # if any Microsoft Support
 folks would like that info... just ask. All other audio, sounds, apps, etc. were working just fine. System Restore wasn't working right, so I had to find a fix. Somehow, in my "Alarms &amp; Clock" app, all the sound files associated with the alarms had been blanked
 out (no way to see this outside of viewing the Windows Registry [regedit.exe]). If I create or edit an alarm, then try to preview the alarm sound (like Chimes, Xylophone, Chords, etc), no sound is heard when I click the triangle play button beside each alarm
 sound. Also, Timers no not play any sounds when completed. I do get notifications for my Alarms and Timers, I just don't hear any sounds. This caused me to wake up late a couple times before I found a fix.&nbsp; If you experience this same behavior, this fix may
 work for you. However, directly editing the Windows Registry can be dangerous to your system. Incorrect registry settings can have drastic and undesirable effects, possibility even making your system completel unusable (possible, but worst case). You are welcome
 to try the steps that I used to fix my particular problem, but please be careful. It would be a wise idea to back up your system before trying these steps, just in case.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open registry editor -&gt; Press WindowsKey + R, type "regedit", click "OK" or press ENTER. Accept the UAC warning when prompted by clicking "Yes"</li><li>Double click on the navigation tree and navigate to go to: HKEY_CURRENT_USER -&gt; App Events -&gt; EventLabels</li><li>Scroll down to the "Notification.Looping.Alarm1" through "Notification.Looping.Alarm10". All 10 of these will need the same value changed.<br />
You will also need to make this change for "Notification.Looping.Call1" through "Notification.Looping.Call10". So, when done, you will have made the same change to all 20 registry keys.</li><li>Select the first one (Notification.Looping.Alarm1), double click on "ExcludeFromCPL"<br />
Change the value of "1" to "0". By doing this, you are making these alarms visible in the "Sounds" or "Change System Sounds" Control Panel applet used in later steps. Now, make the same change for the other 19 keys until each has the "ExcludeFromCPL" value
 set to "0".</li><li>Search for the "Change System&nbsp;Sounds" Control Panel applet by typing "change system sounds" into the Cortana search box on your task bar at the bottom-left of your screen.&nbsp; Click the "Change System Sounds" result to launch the "Sound" applet, which should
 already have the "Sound" tab selected.&nbsp; *** You can press WindowsKey + S to search for it, if Cortana has been removed from your task bar.</li><li>Now, there will be new entries in the "Program Event" section (added by the previous steps), located under the Windows heading. They will be "Alarm 1" through "Alarm 10" and "Incoming Call Notification 1" through "Incoming Call Notification 10".</li><li>In the "Program Event" section, select "Alarm 1" then for the "Sounds" option below, select "Alarm1.wav". Repeat this for all 10 Alarms. For "Alarm 2", select "Alarm2.wav", for "Alarm 3", select "Alarm3.wav", and so on through "Alarm 10".</li><li>Do the same thing for "Incoming Call Notification 1" through "Incoming Call Notification 10" by selecting the "Program Event" named "Incoming Call Notification 1" and setting the "Sounds" option to "Call1.wav". Repeat this for the rest of the Incoming Call
 Notifications, setting the sound "Call2.wav" for "Incoming Call Notification 2", "Call3.wav" for "Incoming Call Notification 3", and so on through "Incoming Call Notification 10".</li></ol>
<div>
<p>Now, if this fix works for you, and you noticed the sound for Timers in the Alarms &amp; Clock app had stopped working as well, this workaround should fix that, too. It seems that the sound used for Timers is whatever is set for "Alarm 9" in the "Change System
 Sounds" Control Panel applet. Just set the "Sounds" option for "Alarm 9" to whatever sound you want to use for timers. This will also change the "Echo" alarm sound to whatever sound file you choose for "Alarm 9".</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>You could now use the "Change System Sounds" applet to further customize the Alarm sounds used by the "Alarms &amp; Clock" app, but all the Alarm sounds should be back to the default sounds after completing this fix. For the "Alarms &amp; Clock" app, "Alarm 1"
 corresponds to the "Chimes" alarm sound, "Alarm 2" is the "Xylophone" alarm sound, "Alarm 3" is the "Chords" alarm sound, and so forth.</div>
<div>
<p>If someone has a more proper fix, or an automated version of this fix, it would be greatly appreciated if you could post it here.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>This frustrated me for weeks, but went to Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications &amp; Actions &gt; and then turned on the three options in the middle of the five listed: Show app notifications; Show notifications on the lock screen; Show alarms reminders... on the
 lock screen. I don't know if only one of them did the trick, but my alarm sounds now work!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>SIMPLE! </p>

    <title>computer enters into sleep&#47;hibernate mode and I&#39;m unable to - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            computer enters into sleep&#47;hibernate mode and I&#39;m unable to wake it after the latest Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>I have Lenovo IdeaPad Y500 and I am running Windows 8.1 with ALL the latest updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since the recent patch released to address the 19 vulnerability in Microsoft Windows (the same one that has existed undetected since Win 95 until now) I have been having problems with my computer as it enters sleep mode. This problem also relates to
 hibernate mode as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is that when I close my laptop lid (or press the power button or sleep button) the computer enters into sleep/hibernate mode and I'm unable to wake it. Eventually it just turns off. When I turn it back on from this inappropriate shut down Windows
 balks at me by taking a very long time (5 min?) to load. Then when I get to my picture sign-in it takes an additional long time (5 min?) for the computer to recognize that I put in my gestures. It doesn't even have the spinning wheel as it is still showing
 me my options of using my PW or redoing it. After a while my display times out and in fact goes back to the lock screen. Then when it finally registers I put in my gestures suddenly I am facing my desktop as if it was a normal sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I thought there was a hangup so I had selected to restart my computer before it logged me in as I saw the problem. But it persisted so I just decided to see what it would do. Eventually it would log me in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this problem first appeared I ran numerous scans from my anti-virus (Avast!), Malwarebytes, CC Cleaner, disk cleaning, disk defragging etc to see if I had any problems. I restarted my computer afterwards and it was a fast and clean start up with zero
 problems. Not even with my signing in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, anytime it comes back from sleep I go through the same process all over again. Slow start up first time again and if I restart it is clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried numerous suggestions after searching for the answer online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/windows-81-sleep-mode/041f01a3-26b8-45aa-8123-d5b7ca4128c8</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I tried to mess with my power management settings. Switching sleep for hibernate. Changing times it will activate sleep/hibernate. I even ran troubleshooting on power management and there was at first one issue which had to do with the brightness but
 that didn't fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I use the f.lux program to moderate my screen brightness. More info here: https://justgetflux.com/)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then defaulted the settings. No changes. The sleep problem persisted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I then created a custom power management plan. The custom plan settings are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Battery:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn off the display at 5 min.</p>
<p>Put computer to sleep at 15 min.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plugged In:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn off the display at 10 min.</p>
<p>Put computer to sleep at 30 min.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The advance settings are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Require PW on wakeup for both battery &amp; plugged in.</p>
<p>Turn off hard disk after 10 min (battery) and 20 min (plugged in).</p>
<p>Maximum power savings (battery); Maximum performance (plugged in) for JavaScript Timer Frequency on Internet Explorer [which I never use].</p>
<p>Desktop bg settings for slideshow are paused (battery) and available (plugged in).</p>
<p>Medium power saving (battery) and Maximum performance (plugged in) for the wireless adapter settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sleep</p>
<p>Sleep after is set for 15 min (battery) and 30 min (plugged in)</p>
<p>Allow hybrid sleep off (battery) and on (plugged in)</p>
<p>Hibernate after 180 min (battery &amp; plugged in)</p>
<p>Allow wake timers disable (battery) and enable (plugged in)</p>
<p>
</p><p>USB settings are both enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power buttons and lid</p>
<p>Lid close action has sleep for both</p>
<p>Power button action has sleep for both</p>
<p>Sleep button action has sleep for both</p>
<p>
</p><p>PCI Express has Maximum power savings (battery) and Moderate power savings (plugged in)</p>
<p>Minimum processor state power management has 5% for both</p>
<p>System cooling policy is passive (battery) and active (plugged in)</p>
<p>Maximum processor state is 100% for both</p>
<p>
</p><p>Display</p>
<p>Turn off display after 5 min (battery) 10 min (plugged in)</p>
<p>Display brightness 40% (battery) 100% (plugged in)</p>
<p>Dimmed display brightness 50% for both</p>
<p>Enable adaptive brightness is on for both</p>
<p>
</p><p>When sharing media it is set to have the computer to sleep (battery) and prevent idling to sleep (plugged in)</p>
<p>When playing media it is set to balanced (battery) and optimize video quality (plugged in)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Battery</p>
<p>Critical battery action is hibernate for both</p>
<p>Low battery level is 10% for both</p>
<p>Critical battery level is 5% for both</p>
<p>Low battery notification is on for both</p>
<p>Low batter action is do nothing for both</p>
<p>Reserve battery level is 7% for both</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tested this to see if there was any changes by lowering my lid to close for less than 2 seconds. I just closed it and opened it. I was unable to wake it even when I hit the power button. So in effect, there was no changes. The problem persisted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I found another suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/windows-81-shut-down-and-sleep-issues/4a9f9cf2-f2cf-43ce-9b44-18f35d55767c</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started to think that maybe it did have to do with my bluetooth driver because I remember some error message about it a week back. I went to the device management and checked to see if there was a new update for the driver. There wasn't. I did install
 a new one on 11-22-2014 which is right around when I got the patch and when trouble started.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the bluetooth driver button are the following:</p>
<p>Intel(R) Centrino(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R) 4.0 High Speed Adapter</p>
<p>Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator</p>
<p>Microsoft Bluetooth LE Enumerator </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried one more thing which was that I went into the properties of the Intel bluetooth driver and I found out something odd. I have never checked before as I have never had any reason to check so I don't know if this is standard or not. But under the Power
 Management settings it had selected "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I unclicked it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried something else that was listed in the above link and that was doing an energy report through the admin command prompt. I did so and listed several errors and said for me to check out the report at C:\\windows\System32\energy-report.html
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I can't read the actual report. I went through explorer found the report and tired to open it and said for it open with my FireFox browser and it wouldn't work nor could I could open it with my writer program. So I just gave up. Closed it all off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to hell with it and closed my lid to test if the driver thing worked. Then I noticed something odd. I opened my lid back up and I still couldn't wake it up like I normally did. However I noticed after about 30 seconds it went to a resting state
 and my power button flashed and I could press it and wake up my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is because of the custom power management plan (hybrid sleep?) but I'm a little wary of messing with things when I finally have something working for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The thing I want to know is why the patch and/or driver update has made it that if my computer tries to enter sleep with the box checked to turn off the bluetooth device to save power that it somehow makes me unable to wake my computer from sleep mode and
 within 10 minutes it turns off my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way that I can fix this problem while still allowing my computer to turn off the device? Or do I just have to deal with it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to avoid from having to reset or restart my computer but am I going to have to do it anyway? Or because this seems to be a conflict with the driver and Windows 8.1 (with the patch) that this problem will just happen again when I update my computer
 and its drivers again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a tech expert but I'm not a complete novice and I would just like some advice on how to fix my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank you for any help you can give me.</p>

            <p>Update: </p>
<p>After I posted this I tested a couple of things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I changed my power plan to my usual one which is the Balanced one that is recommended. The sleep problem persisted with this plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once my computer timed out, shut down, then spent the 10 minutes loading and logging me in I changed back to my custom plan. I had no problems. I changed one setting, the hybrid sleep and I turned it off for the plugging in mode. Still no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea why but somehow a conflict is happening between my default power plans, Windows 8.1, AND my Bluetooth driver. It has to be all three because I had to create a custom plan and then change my bluetooth driver setting in order for things for
 my computer to wake up from sleep and not shut off abruptly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I did try to edit my post but it just sat there after I hit submit. So I just decided to reply to my own post.</p>

            <p>Replying to myself again to update situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I close the lid for an extended period of time the problem pops up again. However if my lid is open and the display dims as if in sleep mode it will wake up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I changed my custom power plan to have it that when the lid is closed 'do nothing' is selected. It seems to be the only way to get around this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to reset/restart? Should I ignore the driver update? What if it is the patch update that is causing the issue?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So won't I just be back to square 1 with the same issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or can the reset/restart actually prevent the problem from popping up?</p>

            <p>The problem was the computer unable to enter sleep or hibernate it just shut off.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I had a work around but then other issues started to pop up such as extremely long load times and it got me worried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I Refreshed everything. I installed all my updates and Windows 8.1 and it took me 2 days. Then when I re-installed this one optional Win 8.1 update (KB3000850 723.9MB) it did something to my computer. I recalled installing it on my computer before it
 started having the sleep problems and it did something my computer then too. Messed with the graphics and zoom. I have a 1080p laptop with NVIDIA GeForce graphics card and it made it look like my cheap Asus laptop's graphics.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to Restore to a point before I installed it but it didn't work. It actually crashed while doing the restore and my computer was completely unresponsive. I had to Refresh again. This time it took 3 days to get everything installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far everything is working fine. My sleep issue is fixed. But now I'm paranoid about what other issues might pop up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On all my computers in the house (mine and others) which run 8.1 I refuse to install that update. There is something wrong with it.</p>

            <p>Damnit. The problem is back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first use it from booting up it can enter sleep mode perfectly fine. But once I start to use it for a while then while I wait for it to enter sleep mode it takes a really long time then the motor revs up and it just shuts off. Then boot up takes a
 long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the hell. How do I fix this? Is this a software or hardware issue?</p>

    <title>Bluetooth dropping connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth dropping connection</h2>
                    <p>My Microsoft Bluetooth mouse periodically stops working. The pen still works. I go to the Bluetooth devices settings and it shows it as connected (interestingly it shows the pen as not connected). I try to turn off the Bluetooth with the on-screen slider
 switch and it tries to turn off, but goes back on immediately (I have to do this twice). I do the same thing again an it turns off the Bluetooth usually. After I turn Bluetooth back on it finds the mouse and works again. Sometimes it loses the connection and
 reconnects on its own, but I have to go through the above process about once a&nbsp;day. Is there a fix for this?</p>
<p>I have the Microsoft bluetooth mouse with the blue windows 8 start button on the thumb side if that makes a difference.

            <p>Hi RonBisbee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Surface Community.&nbsp; I understand that you are experiencing a connectivity issue with your Microsoft Bluetooth Mouse.&nbsp; I'm happy to help you troubleshoot this further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, please manually check that all <strong>Windows Updates</strong> have been installed on your Surface Pro 3 with the
<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong> swipe in from right for<strong> Charms Bar</strong><br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> select <strong>Settings</strong><br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong> select <strong>Control Panel</strong><br />
<strong>Step 4:</strong> select <strong>Windows Update</strong><br />
<strong>Step 5:</strong> select <strong>Check for Updates</strong><br />
<strong>Step 6:</strong> select <strong>Install</strong><br />
<br />
Be sure to restart after each <strong>Windows Update</strong> layer.&nbsp; After the last
<strong>Windows Update</strong> has completed, <strong>Check for Updates</strong> again to ensure there are no remaining
<strong>Windows Update</strong> layers that have not been downloaded. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, please review the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- What model of Microsoft Bluetooth Mouse you are using?&nbsp; Have you checked and installed the latest drivers from the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Hardware Support</a> page?</p>
<p>- Did you experience Bluetooth connectivity issues with your Microsoft Bluetooth mouse, out of the box?</p>
<p>- Can you correlate the events to any new applications installed or system settings changes?&nbsp; What applications or processes were running at the time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some other troubleshooting steps to consider:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Disable other Bluetooth devices that are connected to your Surface Pro 3 or within range, such as wireless speakers, headsets, remotes etc.</p>
<p>- Reproducing the issue with the SP3 and BT mouse in a different environment, such as a different room or location<br />
</p>
<p>- Are you connected to a Wi-Fi network on a 2.4GHz (801.11b/g/n) or 5GHz (801.11a/n/ac) frequency band?&nbsp; Have you tried connecting to a different Wi-Fi frequency band?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try each of the troubleshooting suggestions above and see if they improve your Bluetooth connectivity experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>WalterW288</p>

            <p>I have the same issue that my Bluetooth mouse is disconnecting at some moment.</p>
<p>The difference is that I don't need to disable and re-enable the Bluetooth I just need to wait a few seconds and then I can continue again with using the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all the latest updated loaded and I checked the link that Barb provided and manually installed the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this is happening the following is written to the event log.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9052b7ba-c712-4d43-8391-0678d8b63092" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a bit annoying and I hope that microsoft will fix this with a driver update sometime soon.</p>
<p>

<p>Peter</p>

            <p>Hi Mar T.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indeed I have tried these steps and they did not make any difference.</p>
<p>It does not matter which application that is running it happens on random occasions.</p>
<p>Sometimes I don't have an issue for an hour or 2 and after that I can have the problem a few times within a time frame of 10 minutes as you can make out from the picture that I have attached into my previous reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only devices connected via bluetooth are my mouse and the surface pen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have the problem that my wifi goes into limited mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss here on how to solve this issue and it's annoying when this is happening.</p>
<p>Besides this I'm at present very satisfied with the surface pro 3 so if the issue with bluetooth and wifi can be fixed then for me this is the perfect device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Peter</p>

    <title>Corrupt Master File Table on spare HDD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> isa_k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupt Master File Table on spare HDD</h2>
                    Whenever I try adding my spare sata HDD and boot up, I am asked to perform CHKDSK. It tries automatically (I just don't press any key to abort), and CHKDSK fails.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Whilst I have the offending HDD attached to the system, I am unable to fully boot up Windows 7.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried swapping another working HDD's data and power cables, to no avail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I try to plug it in externally, and access explorer, explorer freezes!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Once it is unplugged, all is back to normal!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone help me rectify the issue please?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><em>Warm Regards,</em></div>

            Hi,
<div>OS 7 ultimate 64bits 2 hdd each 500gb first Seagate second Western Digital, both sata, no raid</div>
<div>a week ago the Seagate which didn't hold the OS simply dissapeared and in BIOS the location appeared blank, and I don't mean NO HDD PRESENT, my MB senses that the sata port is linked to something it cannot identify!!!</div>
<div>I thought it was a HDD failure, returned the HDD, it came back with the response NO HW FAILURE, OS RELATED. Formating drive resolved the issue everything ok.</div>
<div>Two days ago while booting got some message gen NO OPERATING SISTEM DISK, PRESS ANY KEY</div>
<div>if I pressed a key it booted ok.</div>
<div>Yesterday my pc showed that BOOTMGR MISSING PRESS CTRL+ALT+DEL TO REBOOT</div>
<div>I tried evrithing from your site, from dvd repair, rebuild bcd, copy bootmgr, etc, really all links show the same solutions!</div>
<div>also some stupid errors like NO RESTORE POINT, but I just made one 3 days ago as the first "defective" HDD came back so I turned into a security freak.</div>
<div>at ScanOs result operating Sistem=0</div>
<div>My post here comes because both drives showed in the day before the crush the same CHKDSK fail.</div>
<div>HOPE THIS IS A TOUGH ONE FOR YOU! I am amused by this error, I am personally somehow a IT savy(hope that's the right word) :-)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Have a nice day,</div>
<div><br />

Now, in my case it was something so stupid and simple!<br />
I had to set the partition as active and my solution was to acces command prompt during the attempt to repair bootmgr and follow this steps<br />
<br />
diskpart<br />
select disk 0<br />
list volume<br />
select partition 1<br />
active<br />
exit<br />
<br />
I might be wrong but my solution does not apply to Isa! I hope my problems won`t repeat in your case!<br />
So if your 7 fails like mine maybe this will help you.<br />

Have a nice day you all!</div>

<blockquote>What happens when you press a key so that chkdsk does not run?<br />
</blockquote>
It doesn't run, and tries to boot up, unsuccessfully.
<div><br />
<div>Somehow, I got to boot up, after arduously waiting for it to do so, and used GetDataBack to see what was on the HDD to see if it was worth salvaging.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Nothing that I already did not have, so I formatted it, and everything seems fine now.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But, a solution to the initial problem would be mighty appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sorry for the late response... However, as I said in my initial post, I would prefer if I could get a response to my gmail email address, as I never check my Hotmail... only for forums like this and MSN usage, if that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your time :D<br />

<h3> cuartetto  say:</h3>
<h2>            Groove fails to play mp3 files from online OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>When I attempt to play an mp3 file from OneDrive on line I get the following message.</p>
<p>Sorry, we can't play this song </p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Make sure the song you're trying to play is in your OneDrive Music folder and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OneDrive folder on my hard drive contains the files I'm trying to play from online. The files play properly from the hard drive using Groove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Win 10 on my desktop. Edge is my browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same files will play on my laptop, also Win 10 and Groove.</p>

<p>I can't exactly say when this problem began. It was at least after I upgraded to Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over time several changes have taken place on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried.</p>
<p>Ran with administrator user</p>
<p>Turned off malware bytes and windows defender</p>
<p>I don't have any other antivirus&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turned off Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Checked to make sure that I also have the files on my hard drive in the OneDrive folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>The online files try to open using Groove music. That's when I get the message.</p>
<p>The same files on the hard drive work fine using Groove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a month ago, for no apparent reason, the online started working. They worked for about a week and then, for no apparent reason, they failed again.</p>

            Hi Shavee, your version of Windows 10 is a year out of date, you need version 1809 of Windows 10 for the dark theme in Explorer
<br />
<br />Click the link below, then click 'Update Now' on that page to immediately get 1809 and bring your PC right up to date

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Try updating to 1809 using Media Creation tool and if it fails let us know.
<br />
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

<br />All steps, including upgrading using ISO file and Media creation tool, are covered here:

            Hi Shavee
<br />
<br />All I can tell you is that your version is 2 major versions behind, you are missing version 1803 (which you can skip) and version 1809 that has the dark theme for Fie Explorer and in a couple of weeks version 1903 will be released

<h2>            Brightness control after Windows 10 Update &#40;June 2018&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Re Windows 10 Update of June 2018:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems as though that with every (almost) Windows 10 update my computer gets messed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After an update the first thing I do is check to see if any of my games are left.&nbsp; This time they were eliminated.&nbsp; Again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most bothersome thing this time is that <strong>I can no longer control the brightness of my screen</strong>.&nbsp; The controls show that things are changing but it remains at full brightness.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is there a fix for this?</strong></p>
<p>
