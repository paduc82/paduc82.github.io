<h2>            How to kill build 15007</h2>
                    <p>HI</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had to roll back from the badly broken build 15007 to 14986 so that I can print, but this awfully broken and untested build is simply trying to download again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now disabled the update service, but it is now trying to "prepare to install" . How can I kill off this build and download?</p>
<p>

            <p>So when you Disabled Windows Update In 14986 It still is doing a Update.</p>
<p>Or did it started the Update before you Disabled it.</p>

            The only other thing I can think of is when you reinstall 14986 is to keep you computer unplugged from the internet or turn off your router until you can Disable Windows Updates then it should be safe to restart you network system.<br />

<p>I also have no issues with build 15007.</p>
<p>And if you are having issues installing it like</p>
<p>many of us did, then you can't actually say the</p>
<p>build is broken if you don't have it.</p>
<p>As to installing the build, the operative word is patience.</p>
<p>My laptop took 3 hrs. and my PC 4 hrs.</p>

<p>I don't have MB installed ... and admit I haven't tried anything extraordinary to make it work. I hadn't expected to bother with it before two years of development, but, a couple of builds ago, decided to give it a little tryout, and was pleasantly surprised
 at how well it was coming along, then; however, seeing that it's messed up again, I decided to ignore it for a while longer. &nbsp;

<p>"trying to install it" is not the build, it's the installation process ... the build is after it is installed, and it works very well. The new UUP method of providing the build is very slow and awkward, but please bear in mind that it's new, and needs further
 development ... after all, they told us (for those of us who read) that the intention is to have it reasonably squared away in time for the public release in March; however, we are the ones upon whom it is being tried during said development.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's indeed slow, so one needs a little (perhaps, even, a lot) of patience ... and, a little technical knowledge might help, too ... but numerous ones of the "thousands" you mentioned seem somewhat short on that commodity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, personally, haven't seen any indication of "thousands" having trouble, but, I'll take your word for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stand by my statement that it's good build, if one ignores edge.</p>

<h2>            Macros not showing up in Project 2010</h2>
                    One of our project managers is not able to see macros after invoking Project 2010.&nbsp; It's as if it is not picking up the global.mpt or is getting a global.mpt with no macros.&nbsp; He is invoking project by double-clicking on the .mpp in the same directory we
 all use that also contains our global.mpt.&nbsp; We've made sure Project is not already open when he does this.

<p>Hi,&nbsp;<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/11F7A882-742F-4382-B5E9-C520CE9E0B98">shibsankar</a>. Welcome to our community. What do you mean by
 can't load any apps? Are those apps won't open or it just crashes when trying to open it? Let's troubleshoot the issue by doing a&nbsp;reboot. Press and hold both the volume down and the power buttons for 10-15 seconds and then check it again if you will encounter
 the same error message. Another option is to update the system apps, go to Store &gt; (...) &gt; settings &gt; check for updates. BTW, may we know the OS version and the Firmware revision no.? We look forward to your response.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Jio has to develop the app for their network. They have to do this, submit it to the store, then it can be downloaded.

<p>Hope you have reported that specific error message in feedback. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to be a few different network issues already reported today on forum for build 14915. If &nbsp;we have specific detail than Microsoft might be able to find the core problem if there is one.</p>

<h2>            Intermittent Three and four finger swipe does not work on Outlook for Mac using spaces on Mac</h2>
                    <p>Three or four finger swipe doesn't not work on Outlook for Mac using spaces on Mac (Multiple desktop on Mission control). I need to quit the app and re open it again to switch between spaces and after a minute the issue will happened again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting that I conducted:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Update to the latest Office for Mac version - didn't solve the issue</p>
<p>2. Update the Office for Mac using the Insider Program (Insider Fast) with a version 16.24 - didn't solve the issue</p>
<p>3. Outlook - Preferences - Reading - Swipe Gesture - I both <strong>turn off</strong> the swipe left on the message list and swipe right on the message list. - didn't solve the issue</p>
<p>4. Create a new Profile on <strong>Outlook Profile Manager -&nbsp;</strong>didn't solve the issue</p>
<p>5. Reinstall the Outlook for Mac - didn't solve the issue</p>
<p>6. Reinstall Mac OS High Sierra 10.13.6 - didn't solve the issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I seek for help regarding this issue or do you have any other troubleshooting that i missed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<h3> arizona willie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook email not working on Lumia 640 XL under W10</h2>
                    <p>My phone is updated to the latest version of W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook email app does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My email provider is Cox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a 24 character long complicated password and I put it in very carefully many times in Outlook email app.</p>
<p>Kept telling me my settings for Cox were out of date and when I said " fix them " it would just want me to input my password AGAIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, in desperation, I changed the password on my email account to something very simple and impossible to put in wrong ( why won't they let you see the characters when you put them in in order to be sure you got it right? ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changed the password in Outlook on this Desktop and my Surface Pro tablet and email worked just perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back to the phone and put in the new simple password --- NO JOY-- same thing over and over and over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how to get the Outlook email app to work on Cox.com under Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app seems to be very poorly written. There is no place to change the port numbers that it should use for pop or smtp.</p>

            <p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have discovered that the Outlook email app on my Lumia 640 XL under W10 &lt; is &gt; sending messages even though it looks like it fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was even able to email a picture to myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it doesn't receive messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just sits there with a spinning graphic saying ' it's working ' but nothing ever shows up but the pop up telling me my Settings are out of date which they are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But being able to send email -- especially pictures was my main concern for the email program. Don't really NEED to receive email when away from home ... at least usually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully they will fix it with the next update to the OS.</p>

<br />Did you Grant Send As permission to the user for the shared mailbox?
<br />
<br />For information about how to do this in the EAC or by using PowerShell:
<br />
<br />Mailbox Permissions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/Exchange/recipients/mailbox-permissions?view=exchserver-2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/Exchange/recip...</a>
<br />
<br />Note:
<br />
<br />You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform the procedures in this topic. To see what permissions you need, see the "Recipient provisioning permissions" entry in the Recipients Permissions topic.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/Exchange/permissions/feature-permissions/recipient-permissions?view=exchserver-2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/Exchange/permi...</a>
<br />
<br />Use the EAC to assign permissions to individual mailboxes:
<br />
<br />In the EAC, click Recipients in the feature pane. Depending on the type of mailbox that you want to assign permissions for, click on one of the following tabs:
<br />
<br />Mailboxes: User or linked mailboxes.
<br />
<br />Resources: Room or equipment mailboxes.
<br />
<br />Shared: Shared mailboxes.
<br />
<br />In the list of mailboxes, select the mailbox that you want to assign permissions for, and then click Edit Edit icon.
<br />
<br />On the mailbox properties page that opens, click Mailbox delegation and configure one or more of the following permissions:
<br />
<br />Send As: Messages sent by a delegate appear to come from the mailbox.
<br />
<br />Send on Behalf: Messages sent by a delegate have " &lt;Delegate&gt; on behalf of &lt;Mailbox&gt;" in the From address. Note that this permission isn't available in the EAC for shared mailboxes.
<br />
<br />Full Access: The delegate can open the mailbox and do anything except send messages.
<br />
<br />To assign permissions to delegates, click Add Add icon under the appropriate permission. A dialog box appears that lists the users or groups that can have the permission assigned to them. Select the user or group from the list, and then click Add. Repeat this process as many times as necessary. You can also search for users or groups in the search box by typing all or part of the name, and then clicking Search Search icon. When you're finished selecting delegates, click OK.
<br />
<br />To remove a permission from a delegate, select the delegate in the list under the appropriate permission, and then click Remove Remove icon.
<br />
<br />When you're finished, click Save.
<br />
<br />Use the Exchange Management Shell to assign the Full Access permission to mailboxes:
<br />
<br />You use the Add-MailboxPermission and Remove-MailboxPermission cmdlets to manage the Full Access permission for mailboxes. These cmdlets use the same basic syntax:
<br />
<br />Add-MailboxPermission -Identity &lt;MailboxIdentity&gt; -User &lt;DelegateIdentity&gt; -AccessRights FullAccess -InheritanceType All [-AutoMapping $false]
<br />
<br />To verify that you've successfully assigned or removed the Full Access permission for a delegate on a mailbox, use either of the following procedures:
<br />
<br />In the properties of the mailbox in the EAC, verify the delegate is or isn't listed in Mailbox delegation &gt; Full Access.
<br />
<br />Replace &lt;MailboxIdentity&gt; with the identity of the mailbox and run the following command in the Exchange Management Shell to verify that the delegate is or isn't listed..
<br />
<br />Get-MailboxPermission &lt;MailboxIdentity&gt; | where {$_.AccessRights -like 'Full*'} | Format-Table -Auto User,Deny,IsInherited,AccessRights
<br />
<br />Examples
<br />-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
<br />Add-MailboxPermission -Identity "Terry Adams" -User "Kevin Kelly" -AccessRights FullAccess -InheritanceType All
<br />
<br />This example assigns the user Kevin Kelly Full Access permission to Terry Adams's mailbox.
<br />
<br />------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
<br />Add-MailboxPermission -Identity "Jeroen Cool" -User "Mark Steele" -AccessRights FullAccess -InheritanceType All -AutoMapping $false
<br />
<br />This example assigns the user Mark Steele Full Access permission to Jeroen Cool's mailbox, prevents Outlook from opening Jeroen Cool's mailbox when Mark Steele opens Outlook.
<br />
<br />
<br />Regards,

<p>Yes, I have granted permission in the EAC ('Admin' &gt; 'Groups' &gt; 'Shared mailboxes' &gt; mailbox in question &gt; 'Edit Exchange settings'. The correct users are appearing under 'mailbox delegation' &gt; 'Send As'. Yet when I try to send an email as the shared alias,
 it comes back undeliverable.</p>

            <p>Hi Henok Girma,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you received an error code&nbsp;801882d1 when trying to update your Nokia Lumia 920.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This error code indicates that there was an error installing the update. You could try downloading the update again, by going to Settings &gt; Phone update &gt; Check for updates. Please see the following article regarding update errors on Windows Phone 8:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2793339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2793339</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, make sure you have enough free space on your phone for the update, your phone is charged and you have a good data connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Johanna P.</p>

                    I have over 18,000 emails in my deleted folder that I want to move back to my inbox. Is there a way to do a mass move of all the emails from deleted to inbox. It is extremely tedious to only do 22 at a time. These emails have not been permanently deleted
 so they don't need to be restored. I just want to simply move them all at once to my inbox.

            This is because Microsoft does not believe they would sell enough copies of Microsoft Office in Hungary to pay for the cost of developing the product in Hungarian.

<p>1. Right click the Word icon in the app list&gt;More&gt;Open file location. After that, right click Word icon from app list&gt;Unpin from Start.</p>
<p>2. Select Shortcut of Word&gt;Right click&gt;Open file location.</p>
<p>3. Right click WINWORD.EXE&gt;Send to desktop(Create shortcut).</p>
<p>4. Back to the shortcuts folder and move the shortcut you create in step 3 into this folder, then change the shortcut name become Word(Click it twice slowly&nbsp;and then type Word).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't launch your Word normally, please share with me more info as below:</p>
<p>1. The version number of your OS(Win+R&gt;type CMD&gt;OK) and Office(File&gt;Account&gt;Product Information).</p>
<p>2. What have you changed before this issue happens?</p>
<p>3. Can you launch Word normally in <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thank you for the prompt reply, Neo.&nbsp; The shortcut still doesn't work.&nbsp; I'm using Windows version 10.0.16299.309.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't change anything before the issue started.&nbsp; I had the icon in my tray. First the icon lost the "W," then stopped working altogether.&nbsp; Now I notice the "X" is no longer in the Excel icon on my desktop, but Excel still works.&nbsp; It's as if I'm slowly
 losing the Office apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know how to start Word in safe mode.&nbsp; Since I can't open Word directly, I start it in Total Commander.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've deleted and recreated the icons, but neither they nor the icon on the start menu works.&nbsp; I've attached a picture of my start menu.&nbsp; The Word icon there is also missing the W, and I cannot open Word from there.&nbsp; That tells me the problem is on the start
 menu application.&nbsp; Word still works when I open it in Total Commander, but neither the start menu application nor icons work.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30e40967-39b6-4df3-baa1-691547837292?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30e40967-39b6-4df3-baa1-691547837292?upload=true" /></a></p>

    <title>Aerial view in Bing Maps Preview for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cornelius middelhoff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Aerial view in Bing Maps Preview for Windows 10</h2>
                    In the online Bing maps there is a feature wich allows you to switch to bird's-eye view. It lets you view something from three different angles, wich is, in my opinion, something that lets Bing maps stand out against google maps. I would like to see this
 feature in the Windows 10 desktop app and also on mobile if possible.

<h2>            Access 2010&#58; checkbox to remove record from form</h2>
                    I have a form that I created with the record source coming from a table.&nbsp; Each time a new entry is made, a new record is created.&nbsp; I would like to use a checkbox that when checked, will remove that record from the form (while still remaining in the table).&nbsp;
 The checkbox field is also located in the table.&nbsp; I'm not sure what code I should use to make this happen.

<p>You have two options here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Use a filter</p>
<p>Set the Filter property of the form to:</p>
<p>Fieldname = False</p>
<p>
</p><p>where fieldname is the name of the Yes/No field. I would suggest naming the field something like Archived.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set the Filter On Load to True and whenever you load the form it will only show records where the checkbox is unchecked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Use a query</p>
<p>instead of basing the form&nbsp; directly on the table use a query. Set the criteria for the Yes/No field to False. The form will only display records that are unchecked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 1 has an advantage in that you can turn off the filter to see all records. with Option 2 you would need another form based on the table or a query set to show only True values.</p>

            You might like to take a look at DeleteDemo.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file first select <em>'Delete Single Record'.</em>&nbsp; In the ensuing form you'll see there is an option to
<em>'Mark as Deleted'.</em>&nbsp; This sets the value of a Boolean column in the table to True and assigns values to other columns in the table to record the user name of the user deleting the record, and the date of deletion.<br />
<br />
The marked record will not be shown in the form.&nbsp; Records can be unmarked and shown again in the form by selecting
<em>'Restore Marked Records'.</em>&nbsp; This opens an unbound dialogue form in which one or more marked records can be selected in a multi-select list box.&nbsp; The records selected will ne unmarked and shown again in the bound form.<br />

<p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; When I followed these steps, the record did remove from the "active" records of form when checking the box.&nbsp; However, it also removed all the other records in the form.&nbsp; I only want to remove the one record that is checked - not
 the others.&nbsp; Only once I have completed my review of the record do I want to check the box.&nbsp; Is there a command that will only remove the one record that I check and not the others?</p>

            Scott and I have given you solutions for this.&nbsp; The check box must be bound to the Boolean (Yes/No) column in the table, and the form should be based on a query which returns only those rows where the Boolean column is FALSE.&nbsp; In the checkbox's AfterUpdate
 event procedure requery the form with:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Requery<br />
<br />
If you are unfamiliar with entering code into a form's, report's, report section's&nbsp; or control's event procedures, this is how it's done in form or report design view:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Select the form, report, section or control as appropriate and open its properties sheet if it's not already open.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Select the relevant event property and select the 'build' button (the one on the right with 3 dots).<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Select Code Builder in the dialogue and click OK.&nbsp; This step won't be necessary if you've set up Access to use event procedures by default.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; The VBA editor window will open at the event procedure with the first and last lines already in place.&nbsp; Enter or paste in the code as new line(s) between these.<br />

<p>Al's response was incorrect in this instance. I think he may have misunderstood the question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting the DataEntry property to Yes forces the form to only allow entering new records and does not allow viewing existing records. The answer as we have given is to use a filter, either on the form level or the Recordsource level.</p>

<p>I would like to use option 1 but I need a little clarification.&nbsp; Is it the Form Propert Sheet where I set the filter?&nbsp; If so, is it both the Filter field and Filter On Load fields under the Data tab?&nbsp; Is the Filter field looking for some VBA code?&nbsp; And the
 Filter On Load gives me a choice of No/Yes.</p>

</p><p>1) set the control source of your check box to a checkbox field in your underlying table</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) when you check said textbox on your form, put in the following 2 lines of code:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Me.Refresh<br />
Forms![frmYourForm].Recordsource = "SELECT [tblTable1].* FROM tblTable1 WHERE [tblTable1].[fldX] =&nbsp; 0;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
3) When you close your form, make sure to change this field back to 0 (ie unchecked).</p>

<h2>            extract data from excel spreadsheet into an access query</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I need to extract data from an excel spreadsheet into an access query.&nbsp; I can't use the "import" function under "External Data" as this will create a new table and I don't want to do that.&nbsp; I need to extract data from an excel spreadsheet into a query in my
 database as the data from the spreadsheet needs to be appended to two different tables in my database and I'm doing this through the query by bringing the two tables together in the query.<br />
<br />
the other way of doing it would be to allow the database to create the table and then append the records to the related tables but I thought that there may be an easier and quicker way to do this.&nbsp; I am hoping that what I described above is possible.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

            You really need to do three queries, and believe it or not, they need to be UPDATE queries, not INSERT.
<div><br />
<div>First query:</div>
<div>UPDATE tblLinkedDrawingData LEFT JOIN tblProjects</div>
<div>ON tblLinkedDrawingData.[Project No] = tblProjects.proProjectNo</div>
<div>SET tblProjects.proProjectNo = tblLinkedDrawingData.[Project No];</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the row exists in tblProjects, it will just update it. &nbsp;If it doesn't exist, a new row will be added. &nbsp;If there are other required fields in tblProjects besides Project No, then they'll have to be in tblLinkedDrawingData and included in the SET clause.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Second query:</div>
<div>UPDATE tblLinkedDrawingData LEFT JOIN tblDocuments</div>
<div>ON tblLinkedDrawingData.[Document No] = tblDocuments.docDocNo</div>
<div>SET tblDocuments.docDocNo = tblLinkedDrawingData.[Document No],</div>
<div>tblDocuments.docProjectNo = tblLinkedDrawingData.[Project No],</div>
<div>tblDocuments.docTitle = tblLinkedDrawingData.[Doc Title]</div>
<div><br />
<div>And finally:</div>
<div>UPDATE tblLinkedDrawingData LEFT JOIN tblTracking</div>
<div>ON tblLinkedDrawingData.[Document No] = tblTracking.traDocNo AND</div>
<div>&nbsp;tblLinkedDrawingData.[Rev No] = tblTracking.traRevNo</div>
<div>SET tblTracking.traDocNo = tblLinkedDrawingData.[Document No],&nbsp;</div>
<div>tblTracking.traRevNo = tblLinkedDrawingData.[Rev No]</div>
<div><br />
<div>Make sense?</div>

                    I have looked in C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources and can find no Install.ESD file for 14971. I installed the previous version on another HHD to try and upgrade my Raid 0 ssd array by extracting the ESD from the HHD install. 14971 just installed on it but the elusive

<h2>            Username on-prem doesn&#39;t match email address in O365 - AD Connect</h2>
                    <p>I'm configuring AD Connect. The mailboxes have been provisioned in O365 and I've migrated data to them already, and am now trying to set up password sync. The local usernames are firstname.lastname, and the email addresses (both on prem and in O365) are
 firstinitiallastname. I'm unsure if AD Connect will work with this - I've read I can change the AD Connect tool to sync using the mail attribute, but will this cause problems? Is this the best way to do it? Updating the upn in the on-prem directory to the
 email address seems incredibly invasive and I expect will cause more problems than simply leaving the two environments unsynced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts? </p>

            <p>Hi JeremyOlmen9357,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AAD Connect will work with this. You can leave them to be different. The local usernames can sign in to local system such as domain joined workstation. And for Office 365 mailbox, you can use the email address to sign in. There is no conflict.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You neednâ€™t to change them.</p>

<h2>            Is there any way to keep destination&#47;source formatting when dragging and dropping text into Word rather than copying and pasting&#63;</h2>
                    Hello all,<br />
<br />
I add text from my web browser to a Word documant and have discovered that while I can set formatting options for Cut, Copy, and Paste in "Word Options" this doesn't seem to affect dragging and dropping text (which is much faster for me).<br />
<br />
I want to be able to drag and drop text into a document so that it changes to my Normal style immediately (rather than selecting all and doing it all together at the end), is there any setting that I can alter for this?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

I did not find any relevant information on this.<br />
The best would be to create a new style and use that style for these instances.<br />

            Hi there,<br />
<br />
the problem is that text dragged across often brings it's own style with it from whatever web page it was on, so as it is I am already constantly changing text back to 'normal' style, which is all I want to use.<br />
<br />
This is problematic as the language in my 'normal' is default set to US English, but this issue keeps switching the style back to one with UK English, and theby US/UK spelling differences don't get flagged by the spellcheck.<br />
<br />
<br />

            As far as I know, you can't specify any paste options when you use drag and drop for pasting. Applying Normal style manually, the way you do it, seems efficient enough. Note that you can use the built-in shortcut Ctrl+Shift+N to apply the style more quickly.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+C (for copy) and Ctrl+V (for paste); this will display the paste options button.

            Thanks for the reply Stefan, but if it was efficient enough I wouldn't be asking... ;)<br />
<br />
But in all seriousness, it is an annoying niggle that I can't specify the style of my document and have it remain in that style when I drag and drop into it. Especially when, as I do, you are dragging and dropping, adding more text, then dragging and dropping,
 then adding more text - not only do you have to manually re-style your document on each occasion if you need your style-dependent language to remain unchanged (see US/UK English issue above), you can't even 'select all' to do so, as some dropped text will
 retain its different style through this, and have to be selected manually and then re-styled.<br />
<br />
I have no idea why some text should be functionally immune to 'select all', at least in terms of applying styles, but it often is.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            Language formatting is especially tricky in Word; I'm aware of that. If you want to force plain text formatting, you can use the macro below. (You can add it to a button on the Quick Access Toolbar, or you can assign a keyboard shorcut.)<br />
<br />
Sub PasteInPlainTextFormat()<br />
On Error Resume Next<br />
Selection.PasteSpecial DataType:=wdPasteText<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />

            Hi Stefan,<br />
<br />
Thanks for that, forced plain text is a bit much though - I also need to have hyperlinks active on the page.<br />
<br />
I basically need a way that will keep all text in Normal format to maintain language, font, and text size uniformly without constantly having to select and reselect text every time I drag new text onto the document, expecially given that 'select all' doesn't
 even always work for that as some lines of text can only be resyled if you select the line/words manually rather than as part of a 'select all' restyle. Styles are pretty inconsistent in this way in Word it seems, maybe I'd be better off just using Wordpad
 and cutting them out entirely? Although it would be pretty irriating to pay out for Office and use Wordpad for word processing...<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

            When you apply a paragraph style, direct formatting is preserved, unless the formatting&nbsp;extends to&nbsp;more than 50% of the paragraph, in which case it will be cleared. However, as you have noticed, you have less control when dragging and dropping text.<br />
<br />
What you could do is&nbsp;"Limit formatting to a selection of styles" (in the Restrict Formatting and Editing pane), but this would prevent any direct formatting from being preserved, which is probably not what you want.

<h2>            SearchIndexer CPU Utilization at 100&#37; without any search results &#40;Office 2010, Windows 7 Ultimate - 64bit&#41;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Before you try to answer this question, please note the versions I'm using (don't waste my time (&amp; yours) with random babble):</strong></p>
<p>Office 2010, Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit, Outlook 2010 (Mailbox on Exchange 2010)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>What I have tried:</strong></span></p>
<p>1) From 'Programs and Features' disabled Windows Search, rebooted, re-enabled Windows Search and rebooted. &nbsp;Did not work.</p>
<p>2) Rebuilt the index. &nbsp;Did not work</p>
<p>3) Removed Outlook from the 'Indexed Locations' and re-added it. &nbsp;Again, to no avail.</p>
<p>4) Outlook is the only thing that is being indexed. &nbsp;This also did not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
<p>Outlook 2010 search does not work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Signs:</strong></p>
<p>Indexing is always stuck at 129 items even though there are 700+ emails. &nbsp; I've left my laptop on for a day without using it and this did not change anything.</p>
<p>Items that are clearly in the Inbox do not show when searched for.</p>
<p>Searchindexer is always using 100% of the CPU.</p>
<p>ProcessExplorer shows that one thread has 100% CPU utilization. &nbsp;Here is the call stack for that thread:</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but how is this an outlook on exchange issue? &nbsp;This is an issue of search service not working as it should for Outlook. &nbsp;I'd think that would be an Office installation related issue.</p>
<p>Is there a Win7 forum that deals with Search related questions?</p>
