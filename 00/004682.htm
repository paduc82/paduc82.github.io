<h2>            Extremely slow response Office 2007 Word &#38; Excel -</h2>
                    When typing in Word &amp; Excel in Office 2007 each key stroke takes 5 - 10 seconds to complete and the mouse pointer icon keeps turning as if a background operation is occurring. Saving a document takes several minutes to complete. This is now happening on
 two different computers running Office 2007 and Windows 7.

<p>My printer stopped working in the middle of some work I was doing. Only then did&nbsp;Microsoft Solutions came up on the screen&nbsp;and inform me&nbsp;that I was missing a printer driver for my HP 1020 printer. When I&nbsp;installed Windows 7 I had reloaded the driver from
 HP but obviously&nbsp;something went wrong.&nbsp;Word is now working properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will now look to reload the driver for my Lifecam 3000 video camera as it is not recognised by my computer. Windows 7 does appear to have some bugs when it comes to drivers</p>

            <p>Hi Sophie,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Although categories are not meant to be shared, you might encounter situations in which an administrator for a shared mailbox would like to have the color categories visible for all the other users who access the shared mailbox. The expected behavior is
 to only see the categories but not the colors. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you want to make also the colors visible for other users there are two methods to achieve this:
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Add the shared mailbox as an additional mailbox and provide Reviewer permissions on the Calendar. This is required as the Category list is stored on the Calendar.</li><li>Add the shared mailbox as an additional Exchange Account.<br />
In this way you will have two category lists, one for each Exchange Account.<br />
For this you need to know the credentials of the shared mailbox (unless you have Full Mailbox Access) and have at least Reviewer Permissions on the Calendar, like in method 1.</li></ol>

    <title>Printing Conditional Formatting with Indirect References - Excel 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom_bpc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing Conditional Formatting with Indirect References - Excel 2013 vs. Excel 2010</h2>
                    <p>I've used conditional formatting in Excel pretty consistently for 10 or 15 years, but I'm afraid I've run into a limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a worksheet containing a number of cells with computed dates and conditional formatting that modifies the cell shading (within a base color range) based on some formulas checking against some reference values - all pretty typical. &nbsp;In response to
 some added complexity, we added Indirect() functions to some of the conditional formatting statements. &nbsp;Now the cells display correctly on the screen (Office 2013 Pro 32b CTR in W7 64b machine)&nbsp;but the formatting rules with Indirect functions are ignored when
 printing. &nbsp;(The result is very faintly-shaded cells - representing the last rule, and the only one with no Indirect function, for each cell.) &nbsp;The same worksheet displays and prints correctly in Excel 2010 (Office 2010 Pro 32b in W7 64b machine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, pdf/xpf printing gets the same result - this appears to be inside Excel 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyone have a clue what's going on? &nbsp;Suggested workarounds? (My workaround right now is to generate pdfs from the backup machine running old software. &nbsp;That won't last.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, tom</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an illustration of the issue:</p>

            <p>Sagnik,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>1) The issue is faced with all files. &nbsp;Here is another, simpler example:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6391f54c-fbf3-4e53-8264-b79bf71705ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6391f54c-fbf3-4e53-8264-b79bf71705ea" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Print preview presents identically to the printed version (pdf/xps), except at lower resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) All files are saved locally on the machine.</p>

<p>I'm trying to personalise my shiny new HTC Touch phone...&nbsp; I've downloaded some themes and ringtones from the windows mobile website, opened active sync 4.5, entered the explorer window and tried to both

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ah ha!! Yes it will.&nbsp; I have highlighted the magic phrase that seems to make the difference.&nbsp; I hang my head in shame that the answer is so simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I use drag &amp; drop or copy and paste on my PC I can drop/paste as soon as the cursor highlights the relevant folder (ie I do not have to click on it first).&nbsp; Obviously a windows mobile device is different.&nbsp; I notice that if I highlight
 'my windows mobile device', right click and go to properties, the device is classed as a 'systems folder' rather than a drive with an allocated letter.&nbsp; Maybe that has something to do with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for helping me sort this out.&nbsp; I am very grateful.&nbsp; I now have the ringtones and themes I wanted and also some pictures of my family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Lorice,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While McAfee support may indeed be the way to go and&nbsp;is certainly worth a try, since it either came from Qwest (or was lost after installing Qwest), another option is to contact Qwest technical support
<a href="http://qwest.highspeed.com/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://qwest.highspeed.com/support/</a>&nbsp;for assistance (and which I tried first would depend on which of the above alternative interpretations is the correct one).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Word Mobile stopped allowing me to create and edit documents</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Word Mobile on an Asus Transformer Tablet with a 10-inch screen. Today the app says I have to upgrade to Office 365 to edit or create new documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried such fixes as restarting the app, restarting my tablet, and resetting the app.&nbsp; None of these have helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The software came installed with the tablet.</p>

            Word mobile is supposed to be for 10.1 inches tablets and lesser. What you can do is to sign out and sign in again. If this doesn't work, then uninstall Word mobile and reinstall it.

<p>Need to alternate the name on the button each time code is called. The actual code depends on whether you are using ActiveX Command Button or a Forms Control Button. Code examples for both types below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that you can&nbsp;initially insert&nbsp;a caption on the button but if you leave as default caption then the first time the code runs it will call Macro2 (which is the Else part) and then change the caption to Macro1 and after that they should be correct after
 each run.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Code for ActiveX Command Button. Assumes running Macro1 and Macro2. Example uses Macro names for the button caption but you may use whatever names you like for both the Macros and the Button Captions.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can edit "Macro1" to any name you like<br />

            If you wait a month or so, it will upgrade to the next public release (due September 2017) and you can then stop running Insider builds without needing to reinstall Windows 10.

            <p>In IE10 Modern (start) ActiveX can't be enabled by design.&nbsp;In IE10 Desktop&nbsp;click on the cog in the upper right&nbsp; hand corner. Safety, un check ActiveX filtering. This will turn off All ActiveX filtering. You can enable single by changing the setting in address
 bar-blue circle with line through it. Hope this helps and if you need any further assistance post and I will be glad to help you.</p>

</p><p><span>I‚Äôd like to confirm do you want to purchase an Office 365 for Business subscription. If possible, could you provide the web page where you tried to purchase the subscription?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If it‚Äôs an Office 365 for Business subscription, the currency as well as the taxes are determined by the selected country or region when you sign up for the subscription. Once the country or region is selected, it cannot be changed. If you want to
 change the selection, you need to cancel your subscription and sign up again. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If not, you can refer to the following articles for detail information about Office 365 for Business plans. Office ProPlus or Office 365 Business which includes Office suit. Office 365 Business Premium plan or Office 365 E3 /E5 plan also includes business-class
 email and many other features. You can choose based on your requirement. For you reference:</span></p>

            <p>Thanks Chris.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay in replying - I have been in a training course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give you some background: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, I could use my local currency debit card to pay for products in foreign exchange. My bank simply did the conversion and debited my account for the local currency equivalent. That meant I could use my local currency debit card to register my Office
 365 Home Premium. So when the subscription comes up for renewal, Microsoft could automatically debit me and receive their subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, regulations changed and I could no longer use a local currency debit card for dollar purchases. When this happened, my local currency debit card was longer valid for dollar payments. Microsoft then started pestering me with a start up warning telling
 me my card was no longer valid every time I started an Office application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My options were to get a new dollar debit card or buy a new Office 365 product locally using my local currency. The dollar card had charges and extra requirements that were tedious. So yesterday I bought a new Office 365 Home Premium and today I plan to
 register the new product - I hope I won't have problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel Microsoft should have arranged for local currency subscriptions once the regulations changed. Microsoft has a local company. They also sell their products locally in local currency. They should have arranged for subscribers to pay annual fees locally,
 possibly at the same place they bought their original product. This is much better than the nagging request to update billing information I get each time I open a Microsoft application. I seriously considered switching to one of the free, Office-like applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this explanation helps you understand my position. I feel the same problem confronts thousands of others. I hope someone comes up with a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tony</p>
<p>

<p><span>Based on your description, I found you</span><span>'</span><span>d like to purchase Office 365 Home subscriptions in local currency.
</span></p>

<p><span>Since you had posted to the "Office 365 for business" category, I am going to move this thread to Office -&gt; Office 365 Home, Personal and University -&gt; My account, billing and sign-in -&gt; Other / unknown category for proper handling.</span></p>

</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since purchased Office 365 in local currency from the same place I bought the original and I have renewed my subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should state this option when it starts to nag for updating the credit card.</p>

 Hide.&nbsp; I don't know what the hide is all about.&nbsp; My only choice on the blue line at the top is New and I can't check any boxes of the new emails coming in to my Inbox.&nbsp; It happened overnight a couple days ago and I haven't figured out what to do about it.&nbsp;
 None of the Outlook Help includes this problem.&nbsp; What do I do?

<p>Hi Simeon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the root cause is that you don't have the Exchange Online plan, If you want it, you can contact admin to purchase the Exchange Online plan. Go to admin center &gt; Billing &gt; Purchase Services, then you should be able to find the Exchange Online plan there.
 You can follow the link below to know more details about Exchange Online plan. For your reference:</p>

<h3> crockyrocks  say:</h3>
<h2>            mailto link handled incorrectly on all versions of WP8 &#38; 7</h2>
                    <p>My company use an automated approval&nbsp; system for change requests which contain a mailto link for approve and decline. My iOS devices handle it ok and so do native Windows apps but Windows phone fails to interpret it correctly. It deems pipe '|' to be the
 end of the link. If you want to see for yourself email the text below to your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sample</p>
<p><font color="#0563c1">mailto:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***?subject=ApproveApproval|12345|&amp;body=Please%20enter%20your%20information%20below</font></p>

<p>How do you go about logging a call with the developers to get this bug fixed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS. It happens on Nokia and HTC, Windows phone 8.x and 7.x</p>

<p>Hi Casper,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concerns here. As far as I know, it has been changed since Outlook version 1805. If you change the permission of others to access your calendar, Office 365 will now automatically send notifications to these people. It'll help inform
 these people and they can just open your calendar in this invite email.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b39d9fbc-8608-442e-9ee5-7895d9397e33?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b39d9fbc-8608-442e-9ee5-7895d9397e33?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For your reference,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/calendar-sharing-in-office-365-b576ecc3-0945-4d75-85f1-5efafb8a37b4#bkmk_acceptsharedcalendar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/calendar-sharing-in-office-365-b576ecc3-0945-4d75-85f1-5efafb8a37b4#bkmk_acceptsharedcalendar</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, since it's a new feature on Office 365 and the shared invitation email is sent from Office 365 automatically, it's not available to disable it right now. And I understand it would be nice if there's an option to disable it. Hence I suggest you submit
 your advises and ideas to our&nbsp;<a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">UserVoice feedback website</a>. With the effort of customers like you, Office 365 will be better to serve our customers. Your time and understanding are
 highly appreciated.</p>

                    <p><span>Good day,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have deleted my birthday calendar to stop emails and calendar notifications on my phone. Instead I have created a new birthday
 calendar with no notifications at all.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The emails have stopped, however I now receive 2 notifications on my phone calendar (one from current birthday calendar and one
 from the deleted calendar).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is there any way to disable both notifications?</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Sandbox</h2>
                    Hello, I just recently joined Windows Insider. I did this because I heard about Windows Sandbox as I am afraid of viruses. When I updated to Windows 18305.1003, I didn't receive Windows Sandbox. I have everything required including the Virtualization setting
 turned on. Is there an option to manually install? I would love the option to test viruses. (Yes I have Windows 10 pro).
