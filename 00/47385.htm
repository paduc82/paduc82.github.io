            Hi Abd_El_Rahman
<br />
<br />Thanks for that - good skills with the screenshots !
<br />
<br />
<br />Okay, that is definitely all caused by your AV deleting that fder.dll file
<br />
<br />I can find absolutely no reference anywhere to fder.dll being a legitimate process
<br />
<br />You should run a scan with the free version of MalwareBytes to see if it can remove this annoyance . . . 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />When the scan completed, restart your PC and you can then remove MalwareBytes if you wish
<br />
<br />If this annoyance is not gone, you need to search your startup processes for the file that is trying to load that dll and remove it:
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />With that utility, you can right click and delete any startup item in Windows 
<br />
<br />Just be careful not to delete any required process . . .

            Hi Abd_El_Rahman
<br />
<br />Typically the issue is with the application that threw the DotNet Framwork exception rather than the DotNet Framewrk itself . .. 
<br />
<br />Do you know which version of the DotNet Framework you need to remove?
<br />
<br />If it is 3.5, 2 or 1
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel, go to Programs and Featues
<br />
<br />On the left, click 'Turn Windows Features on or off'
<br />
<br />At the top, you will see DotNet Framework 3.5, untick that
<br />
<br />Apply that change and restart your PC
<br />
<br />Then go back in and turn that feature back on to re-install the DotNet Framework . . .

I uninstalled it, and mosst of the negative effects went away, but in sound there are a number of non-existent devices.

            How many times did your AMD(ATi) video card show up in Device Manager?<br />
<br />
You seem to have a AMD (formerly ATi) Raedon video.&nbsp; They recently have included a HD to HDMI sound module so as to have audio be sent to HD TVs via a HDMI ports.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You might need to uninstall your Catalyst Control Center and the Raedon Catalyst drivers in
 order to clean up.<br />

            Everything that I could&nbsp;uninstall&nbsp;with Add/Remove Programs in Control&nbsp;panel&nbsp;has been uninstalled.
<div><br />
<div>Prior to that, there were for some reason 6 instances of the ATI graphics device.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can't find anything else in the Control Panel to uninstall. I'd rather not do a system restore, since a lot of stuff has happened since then and I find that I can never adequately determine the state of my system after a Restore.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To summarize: Catalyst&nbsp;Control&nbsp;Center (CCC) has been uninstalled. So has the MSI Afterburner software and the update manager that they installed from their CD.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hence my question on how to complete the cleanup.</div>

            You might need more advanced help with the Ati graphics card.&nbsp; Check with<br />
<br />
www.guru3d.com<br />
<br />
They have&nbsp; Driver Sweeper software that usually "clears out" left-overs from the ATi / nVidia driver uninstall.&nbsp; However, I am not sure if it would run on Windows 7.<br />

            Device manager shows no warnings. Sorry should have mentioned that I've taken a sojourn through device manager to try and figure it out before I came here.
<div><br />
<div>Here is a screen capture of device manager and on the right the Sound window, showing the existing devices in Device manager (with "Show hidden Devices" selected), and the non-existing devices in the Sound &nbsp;window.&nbsp;<a href="http://i45.tinypic.com/291gsd2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i45.tinypic.com/291gsd2.jpg</a></div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>When I enable the environment variable to show non-present devices (I believe there are also at least one utility to do that, but this was a nice trick), I get this:&nbsp;<a href="http://i49.tinypic.com/29asb2o.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i49.tinypic.com/29asb2o.jpg</a>. Still
 no devices.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The likely unit in this charade is probably the AMD High Definition device. I'm not sure if that is part of the graphics card or if I can safely uninstall it without making the card&nbsp;inoperable&nbsp;in some manner or other.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Device description:</div>
<div>
<div>AMD High Definition Audio Device</div>

<h2>            Help reporting offensive&#47;vulgar Gamertag&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, both me and my wife have several times reported a Gamertag that is very offensive and vulgar via the the console, but months have passed and no action has been taken. This is probably due to it being in Swedish, and moderators not being able to understand.
 The same person also has illegal substance/drug released stuff in his profile, but the Gamertag itself is the worst part. Is there another way to get help with this? I don't want to post the Gamertag here, but I'm getting prey sick of no action taken against
 this, since we both have filed complaints several times and I have even called Xbox Support here in Sweden 3 times and they said they can't do anything and just referred me to use the report function on the console - which obviously don't work/gets looked
 at. Thank you
                </div>

<p>The paragraphing on the forum is broken. To space them out you either need to add a '-' or other symbol in order for it to work or go into rich formatting and hold down the Shift key when you press Enter. This has been an issue since the forum launched two
 years ago, the web-team don't find it important enough to fix.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>As to your issue, you've done all you can. Support are right in this case, as they don't handle enforcement action of this kind, the only thing you can do is report the people via your console. The Enforcement Team are all based in the USA though and the
 likelihood of them having a Swedish speaker on the team is slim, so all you can do is wait until one of them can be bothered to fire up google translate.</p>

<p>Maybe he/she choose a GT and didnt know the meaning of &nbsp;?</p>
<p>Or on Swedish it means the genitals and on Russian language "Friend" ? who knows....</p>
<p>And at the end of the day i dont care how people name themselves as long as they dont get racist stuff.</p>

<p>Remember, you need file only once. &nbsp;Multiple filings do not increase the likelihood of action being taken, nor does each successive report deliver a poke to the ribs of a Policy Enforcer to get them to take action. &nbsp;Cases are handled in the order that each
 agent receives them. &nbsp;They're quite capable of determining if gamertags are in violation of the ToU or not, regardless of language. &nbsp;They'll take what actions need to be taken. &nbsp;If it takes a while because they're investigating other things that came to light,
 we as the public will not be informed. &nbsp;We must be satisfied with having reported the individual. &nbsp;Block communications with them, and put them behind you. &nbsp;There is no need for that person to exist any longer in your gaming experience. &nbsp;On behalf of the gaming
 community, Shiro, thank you for taking a stance against the reprobates that attempt to contaminate our collective LIVE experience.</p>

<p>It's not about M rated games. &nbsp;Gamertags and bio content are viewable by anyone, and therefore need to be considered "Rated E for Everyone". &nbsp;No matter who you game with, which games you play, what your interests are, gamertags and bio content must always
 be maintained with the assumption kids will be viewing it. &nbsp;That's why Policy Enforcement takes these things seriously.</p>

<h2>            Desktop and taskbar regularly flashing after cloning to SSD</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I just installed a Samsung 840 Pro SSD and now my desktop and taskbar flash blank every ~90 seconds, any windows up are not
 affected. The icons are the only things that seem to flash, my background stays. I'm also getting a strange error about SkyDrive every 5-10 minutes that goes away too quickly to read. AVG did not find any viruses. I'm pretty new with this kind of thing so
 I'm pretty sure I broke it.</span><br />

                    <p>I need help with the unresponsive DNS issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 10 stops recognizing the DNS server even after a few seconds of having it corrected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ´ve noticed that it happens after every major update. It is unbearable! It´s been disrupting badly my working routine... I´ve read almost&nbsp;every article that has been written about solving the unresponsive DNS issue including the suggestions that Microsoft
 gives. I´ve followed very suggested steps... but the issue continues... Is there any chance of giving it a permanent solution?</p>

            Windows 10 has a known issue with the DNS Caching service being faulty. Disabling it fixed the issues. Unfortunately, it seems like you can't disable it in the latest build of Windows 10, though you could in previous builds.&nbsp;

<p>As I saw the Microsoft identification under your name and in hopes that you may have more information than the general user, I am taking the chance to ask one more time in case that you have knowledge if there is any possibility to get a patch for this issue
 soon. I have to apply the corrections several times a day and restart. It is seriously disrupting my working routine...</p>
<p>Of course, I know that this is not a one-man job... However, it doesn´t hurt to try!</p>
<p>Thank you again&nbsp;for your time and assistance!</p>
        </p>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I no longer appear to have the problem.&nbsp; After logging back in today all the unknown names but one have gone. I experimented with the one remaining name by blocking the person (as I did with the other) but it would only disappear after logging out
 and back in on Skype.&nbsp; I can't say that I am overly impressed with the updated version and wish I had never downloaded it.&nbsp;

<p>*) wireshark stated that sometimes there is a 2 second delay.</p>
<p>still this better than the Drive letter workaround i used in windows XP. Because office was not aware it was sharepoint all the time.&nbsp; (checkin/checkout sometimes was lacking)</p>

<h2>            Can&#8217;t open folders after update.</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing the Update for W10, Version 1511, x64 (KB3124262), left-clicking on folders does not work any more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the following error:&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Uninstalling the update does not solve the problem (only restoring a point before the update works). &nbsp;</p>

<p><span>This issue could have occurred due to these reasons:</span></p>

</p><p>I followed your instructions. Unfortunately, neither method has solved the issue (SFC: 'Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations.')

</p><p>
</p><p>Also, I should add that 2 months ago I had another issue (probably again after a W update?), that might be relevant:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'New folder' option disappeared from the Right-click menu and the File explorer. I solved that problem by applying a Registry fix ('Add_New_context_menu.reg').&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Scanning multiple page document with Windows Fax and Scan</h2>
                    I can't figure out how to scan multiple pages into a document&nbsp;on Windows 7 using Windows Fax and Scan program. Using the same printer, (Canon MX300), I can scan in multiple pages to a single file&nbsp;on my old XP using Windows Office&nbsp; Document Imaging. It
 works great. I tried downloading that program to my Windows 7 machine and I can scan, but the pages come up blank! Can anybody help me get this figured out?

<p>Hi Jilamen,</p>
<p>If you're using a scanner with a document feeder and Windows Fax and Scan, you can scan multiple pages to a single file by scanning to the TIFF (.tif) file format. For more information, see:</p>
<p><strong>Scan a document or photo with Windows Fax and Scan: </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Scan-a-document-or-photo-with-Windows-Fax-and-Scan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Scan-a-document-or-photo-with-Windows-Fax-and-Scan</strong></a></p>
<p>If you use Windows Fax and Scan and a flatbed scanner, you can likely scan multiple images to separate files. Not all flatbed scanners have this ability, so you might need to contact the scanner manufacturer to obtain a driver so that your flatbed scanner
 can provide this option.</p>
<p>Refer:</p>

<p>I would also suggest that you update the latest drivers for the printer from the link below:</p>

            <p>Thanks for the quick reply. Two more questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where can I sign in to local account ?<br />
</li><li>The first time I go into the E-mail app on a new PC with Win8, can I then choose a non-Microsoft e-mail account ?</li></ul>
<p>In Belgium everybody gets a mail account from the local provider and most people (especially the less experienced on pc) prefer to stay with one mail account.</p>

<div>When you initially sign in to your Windows 8 PC, you will be signed in as a local account.</div>

<div>Yes. You can choose a non-Microsoft email account to sign in. However, there are known issues at the current release which affects the use of other email account when signing in to Windows 8 PC.</div>

            <p>Hello Ali,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your device?</p>
<p>Is it really going to Shutdown state?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening a Lid will make PC to wake it from Sleep Mode. I guess the same is happening in your situation. It might be going to sleep mode and opening Lid brings it back from the sleep. Why because, when system goes to complete shutdown, then it won't turn
 on automatically when you open the Lid, until unless you press Power button. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you to cross the same with the Power options. To go to power options, press Start, type
<strong>Power Options </strong>into the search space and select the same from the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</p>

                    Since installing Windows 10 on my laptop, my battery will not charge. &nbsp;Only operates while plugged in. &nbsp;Is my problem a hardware problem, a driver problem or something in the settings? &nbsp;Had the laptop for 2 years running 8.1 at conversion to 10. &nbsp;Bought
 a new battery. &nbsp;Installed 10 2 weeks ago. &nbsp;Should I go back to 8.1?

            <p>Hello Amit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many people, including myself, have been having the same issue after upgrading to Windows 10. The issue spans many different kinds of laptops, including Lenovos, Dells, HPs, and more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two major threads going on about this issue, this <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/plugged-in-not-charging-windows-10/fb60e17f-26e2-4882-a269-43576699a506">
thread</a>&nbsp;and this <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/windows-10-battery-plugged-in-not-charging-on/69e45ee7-2810-4697-9c28-8145063f9df4?auth=1">
thread</a>. The first was started on July 31st 2015 and the latest comment is on November 1st 2015. A lot of the people there have been trying to troubleshoot the issue, but the fixes only work for a few. I'm sure most of us have tried disabling the battery
 driver, disconnecting the battery itself (if possible) and flashing the BIOS as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as with JohnWheeler176, some have even purchased brand new batteries but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft pursue this issue and continue to update those threads as well as this one because we'd all like to continue using our laptops as we have been before, just with the new and improved OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Sometimes, the battery of the laptop drains out to 0% from a certain percentage after having used the laptop for a considerable time or doesn't charge at all. This generally
 happens if the battery is recharged frequently without even draining it once per week.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another cause of the issue could be the overheating of the motherboard in the system. The laptop likely gets overheated when
 the air ducts are clogged or if the chipset fan (chassis) is not working to cool down the heat sink of the motherboard's chipset.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You may try changing the
<strong>power plan</strong> of the Windows settings </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">to use minimum processor state</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">,
 which may help in lesser power dissipation than usual. </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Reducing the maximum processor state for your laptop (both when it is on battery or when the power cable is plugged
 in), reduces the processor’s performance a notch (depending on your settings) and prevents it from being used at optimum potential by an application or game, which will reduce thermal heating.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For example,&nbsp;when you are playing a game that is consuming 100% of your processor’s capacity, then it may also result in heating
 up your system, whereas reducing the battery power state to, say 80%, can resolve this problem, and also result in battery power conservation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Refer to&nbsp;the following steps to do so:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a) Press
<strong>Windows and X</strong> key together and select <strong>Power options</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b) Click on
<strong>Change plan settings</strong> for the power plan that you have set on the laptop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c) Click
<strong>Change advanced power settings</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d) Go to
<strong>Processor power management</strong>. Expand the icon and expand <strong>maximum processor state.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">e) Reduce the processor state (for both
<strong>Plugged-in</strong> as well as <strong>On battery</strong>) to a certain level to verify if it makes any difference.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">f) Click on
<strong>Apply</strong> and then <strong>OK.</strong></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>With respect, this problem has been caused by Windows 10 update and is not an issue with my battery. I have bought a new battery to check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a mass-reported issue with Windows 10 so when will Microsoft stop treating us like idiots and admit that there shoddy software has caused this fault?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I certainly understand your concern. However, even if it is a mass-reported issue, it might still be specific to certain systems as it is not happening with every Windows 10 machine that installs the update. We need to narrow down the root cause if it is
 specific to certain OEM machines&nbsp;in which the issue is&nbsp;occurring.</p>
<p>

    <title>Cannot Change Lock Screen in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot Change Lock Screen in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot change my lock screen in Windows 10. I have updated my Windows 8 to windows 10. The lock screen was working fine before, but since the last month, I am not able to change it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I try to set a new picture, I just get a gray screen and loading dots. I also tried to open the photo app and then set as a lock screen a photo directly from there but it always tells me that it cannot set that photo as lock screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried renaming my SystemData folder. Before doing this, I would always get the same picture loaded in the lock screen, now it's only a blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried turning off syncing but still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to play with the key registries that everyone talks of about but still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now out of all hope! I searched over all the web and I have not even yet found anything that worked for me! Please, give me instructions that actually works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have the latest windows 10 version (OS Build 10586.218).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
                </div>

            <div>Hi John,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We understand how you feel, when you are unable to change the Lock screen on your computer. We're sorry for the trouble this has caused. We will assist you to fix the issue.</div>
<p>
</p><p>If your Windows copy is not activated, you can’t change Lock Screen, Start Screen, User Account Picture. But, sometimes you may receive the error while setting Lock Screen even if your Windows is activated.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>First delete the folder “C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Systemdata” restart the computer and check. You might need to take ownership of the folder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If issue persist, follow these steps and check if it helps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;
<p>1.Press Windows key + R and type regedit in Run dialog box to open Registry Editor Click OK.<br />
2.Navigate here: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Personalization<br />
3.In the right pane of this location, you’ll see the LockScreenImage named string. This string is the root cause of the error you’re facing while setting Lock Screen. Double click on string to modify:<br />
4.In order to fix the issue, remove all the Value data you see and click OK. You can also delete the LockScreenImage if you like. Deleting it will be a good idea since there may be the possibility of restoring Value data by the system upon reboot, if the string
 is not set to read-only permission for everyone. Close the Registry Editor and reboot to get the issue fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><div>Registry disclaimer:<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried both what you suggested and it is still not working. I deleted the SystemData folder and still no luck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my Windows 10 is upgraded from Windows 8 so I was not able to find this in my Registry Editor<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Personalization</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I try to set a new picture as the screen lock &nbsp;only get a gray image and loading dots... Also, if I try this from the app directly, it tells me it cannot set the photo as screen lock. I've tried with multiple different photos which where jpg and
 they all give the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have enabled all permissions on the folder security with inheritance enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read about these everywhere but they do not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, give me working instructions for my case!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks !</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting back.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue might also be caused due to corruption in system files on the computer. Try running a System file checker scan.
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I suggest you to

<p>
</p><p><span>System file check is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted, changed, or damaged versions with the correct versions where possible.</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Deleting the system data folder and restarting the computer. Then:</p>
<p>- I tried opening multiple images in Photos app and clicking "set as lock screen" but got this error message, "Try a different photo. We can't set this one as the lock screen."</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89ec9e48-a83c-45b8-9476-d9085bc72377" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89ec9e48-a83c-45b8-9476-d9085bc72377" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have also tried changing the lock screen via Personalization settings but I got the same gray loading screen. However, I can use Windows spotlight to set as a lock screen, but cannot choose one of my own pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eed01d27-a741-49ad-b63d-7298673a3073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eed01d27-a741-49ad-b63d-7298673a3073" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Afterwards I tried:</p>
<p>2. Running "sfc /scannow" and "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth&nbsp;</span><strong>&amp;&amp;</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;DISM.exe
 /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth"&nbsp;</span>- that was successful and no files were corrupted.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e52d563-4a15-4a65-a252-26fc8e138c68" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e52d563-4a15-4a65-a252-26fc8e138c68" /></a></p>

</p><p>Please help, I still cannot change my lock screen :(</p>

            <p>You can choose to 'Keep existing files'...it will not delete everything but keep your files intact and leave a 'Windows.OLD folder with all your programs and downloads.</p>
<p>But still and <em>always keep your files and programs on a USB disk or external drive for safe keeping.</em></p>
<p>Another way is to do an '<a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html?filter[2]=Installation%20and%20Setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">In-place /Repair-Upgrade'</a> which will preserve all your files
 and programs.</p>

<h2>            Wedge mobile keyboard -requesting working drivers for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I really don't understand why there isn't a Windows 10 driver for the Wedge bluetooth keyboard. &nbsp;Microsoft currently isn't offering a similar product. &nbsp;So, why aren't they updating the driver? &nbsp;I can get the keyboard to work fine on Windows 10, but I can't
 get the keyboard to show up in the Microsoft mouse &amp; keyboard center. &nbsp;This is important to me, because if I understand correctly, I can change some functionality of the keyboard. &nbsp;I need to be able to make the F keys work without having to press the Fn key
 first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume there will never be a solution to me, but hopefully a better keyboard will come out soon. &nbsp;It's so hard to find good products lately, and the Wedge keyboard was so close.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center drops support for Wheel Mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david ziffer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center drops support for Wheel Mouse Optical</h2>
                    <p>So Microsoft changed over from its older&nbsp;"Intellimouse" driver to the "Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center", which I had installed in late 2015 on my new Windows 10 machines&nbsp;and was working with my "Wheel Mouse Optical", which is the mouse I have for all
 my machines. So lately I noticed that my wheel button assignment was not working properly. I tried to open&nbsp;the "Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center", which had worked just fine before some recent update (apparently) now gave me an error saying that some resource
 it was trying to access no longer existed (which was apparently on the "f" drive, which is not a permanent drive on my machine). So I downloaded the latest version of "Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center" hoping to fix this. So the app installed and then came
 up saying there is no supported device on this machine. So I looked at the list of supported devices and guess what? "Wheel Mouse Optical", my favorite mouse ever, is not supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add this to my seemingly endless list of problems with Windows 10. And add my Wheel Mouse Opticals to the list of disposable hardware, which includes my Surface RT and my Zune HD. Oh well, I guess I should be happy for the years that I got out of them.</p>

                    <p>Is there a keyboard shortcut for getting umlauts (ä, ö, ü) or an Eszett/beta (ß) when writing on Windows 10? I know you can insert a special character manually, but is there any shortcut available so you can just use your keyboard? On my laptop my default
 language is English, but I have German as a language. My laptop was purchased in an English speaking country so the physical keyboard on my laptop is in English, so there's no buttons for umlauts etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(On an Apple laptop you press "option" then click "u" and it will give you an umlaut- so I'm looking for a similar option to this)</p>
<p>

            Hola Mrf0852
<br />
<br />Soy Asesor Independiente
<br />
<br />Para resolver tu problema de caracteres especiales hay una opción.
<br />
<br />En la opción Buscar dentro de computadora busca "Mapa de Caracteres", ahí encontrarás los caracteres que necesitas copiarlos desde ahí.
<br />
<br />La otra opción es que puedas insertarlos con su código ascii, te anexo un link con la tabla ascii, para pone el código ascii tienes que mantener la tecla de alt + num. (ej. alt + 64 = @)
<br />
<br />Espero esto te ayude a obtener lo que necesitas
<br />
<br />Saludos

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />There are no Keyboard shortcut for getting umlauts (ä, ö, ü) or an Eszett/beta (ß) when writing on Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Windows does not have option like mac.
<br />You have to use ASCII characters combinations 
<br />
<br />Kindly follow these steps: 
<br />1. EnableNumber Lock 
<br />2. Press hold ALT key and type a number on the number pad (ALT + 0228 = ä) 
<br />
<br />ALT 0223  	=  ß
<br />ALT 0228  	=  ä
<br />ALT 0246  	=  ö
<br />ALT 0252  	=  ü
<br />ALT 0196  	=  Ä
<br />ALT 0214  	=  Ö
<br />ALT 0220  	=  Ü
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi Mrf0852 
<br />I'm an Independent Advisor
<br />
<br />There is an option to solve your special characters problem.
<br />
<br />In the Search within the computer search for "Character Map", there you will find the characters you need to copy from there.
<br />
<br />The other option is that you can insert them with your ascii code, I attach a link with the ascii table, to put the ascii code you have to keep the alt + num key. (eg alt + 64 = @)
<br /><a href="http://www.asciitable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.asciitable.com/</a>

<p>I see that others have recommended Character Map and alt-key combinations. I recommend against both, since they are clumsy and awkward to use There is also the international keyboard layout, which I recommend against for the same reasons.</p>
