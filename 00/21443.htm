    <title>O365 1811 &#40;build 11029.2&#41; &#38; Win10 18272 scaling issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            O365 1811 &#40;build 11029.2&#41; &#38; Win10 18272 scaling issue</h2>
                    <p>When using a Visual Studio VSTO addin Ribbon for the latest insider preview of Word on the latest insider preview of Windows 10, the display scaling and text scaling has an unusual effect:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14542b53-cbb7-423b-b383-cef9f5f5af0b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14542b53-cbb7-423b-b383-cef9f5f5af0b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The 9 compressed groups used to fit on this screen at 125% display scaling, but with this preview release of Windows 1, they do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get them to fit if I change to 100% display scaling and 120% text scaling in the Ease of Access settings page:</p>

<p>This may be due to some change made to the way scaling is handled in Windows 10 in the latest Insider build. We will look into it on our end as well, but if you could report this to Windows Insider as well since it seems to have started when you updated
 your Windows build that will cover all of the bases.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get into my Hotmail account, blocked for security reasons</h2>
                    <p>My account has been hacked, I assume, Microsoft kept asking me to do a security update, I contacted them and they told me, wrongly it turns out, that this would not block my account, did the update and it did block my account. You'd think an IT company wold
 realise how busy, relied upon and critical these things are now and give you someone to talk to!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My linked email address is wrong so when I got a security block it can't use it. I have done everything asked of me by MS, tried a verification code to another email address, re-set the password, gone through the verification process, with correct security
 question answer and put in all the stuff about headers of recent email, contacts, folder names, it's all there and correct, you've sent me an account verification email to another address but it still says the same thing when I try to log in :-</p>
<p>I have already been locked out for 12 days and I need this back, my business and everything is in this account.
</p>
<p>I need someone to either make all that verification work or do something else to get back into my account. Online chat support is rubbish, they can't help and can't seem to pass me on either.

            <p>Well if you go changing your security settings you can lock yourself out.</p>
<p>This has happened to a LOT of people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would never use Outage look for business, just chat rooms and junk mail only.</p>
<p>Then when Outage look quits, no problem, you just make a new account and continue on.</p>
<p>If you are using it for business and it quits its OH %^&amp;*^%$&amp;*!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you had your work backed up.</p>

            <p>I did NOT change my security settings, I was forced into it by MS who said I couldn't get into my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I don't have EMAILS backed up, but that's not the point, I need to access what's coming in and out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this account for 16 years with no problem and it's not outage, it's outlook and it's not even that cos it's a Hotmail account to me!</p>

            <p>Yeah I had my Paid MSN/&nbsp;Hotmail account since 2002 with no problem until the FORCED&nbsp;switch over to Outage look.</p>
<p>Then everything went to #%^&amp;%^#$$^!!</p>

</p><p>Your address may still&nbsp;be Hotmail, but it is now Outage look.</p>
<p>The old Hotmail is gone.</p>
<p>There is NO Hotmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALL&nbsp;MSN/Hotmail accounts have been switched over to Outage look.</p>
<p>Just read through these posts and see why it is called Outage look.</p>

            <p>I'm also a Microsoft user and all of a sudden 10 maybe 12 days ago I could not access my Hotmail account. I did all the usual changes etc., etc., to no avail. I too use my Hotmail for&nbsp;a Real Estate business and have been hitting a stone wall.</p>
<p>I have since opened a live.mail site but have mastered my old Hotmail site and would like to get back into it. I believe there are quite a few disgruntled users&nbsp;at this point. Can't we get some simple answers on how to correct this fiasco.</p>

<h2>            N95 Calendar and Outlook Appointments</h2>
                    Anybody help? If I e-mail an Outlook appointment to my N95 e-mail account, whilst I can open the e-mail, when I come to open the attachment (the calendar appointment details) to store in my N95 calendar, I get a message pop-up that says "Unable to open.
 Object type not supported". This is such a problem for me that I am thinking of ditching the N95 and going back to a Windows device...although I don't really want to!

            Thats because N95 doesn't have outlook. You should be able to sinc through nokia suite.

            I confirm that Nokia PC Suite will sync a desk/laptop Outlook with the N95 or N73 calendar either via bluetooth or USB or Infrared, and it can work both ways - ie N95 updates PC and vice versa, and if there is a conflict, you can say which overrides in
 the setup. I've never had a problem with it. Oh, it also syncs everything else too, not just appointments, it does contacts etc.

            If you want to wirelessly keep appointments synchronized then you can use Mail For Exchange (M4E) or RoadSync.<br />
<br />
M4E was too unreliable, and I can say that RoadSync is pretty bulletproof. Uses ActiveSync to push the Outlook calender, emails &amp; contacts to synchronize.<br />
<br />
Emailing appointments is just a redundant way of doing things.

            I know this isnt a simple method to do but give this a try.<br />
<br />
Use google calendar...it can import appointments from outlook and then use emoze its works with google online apps (ie gmail calendar etc) I have just installed it today so i cant give you a complete review.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.emoze.com/en/whatIs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.emoze.com/en/whatIs/index.html</a><br />
<br />
looks promising, It was recommended by someone from this forum.<br />
<br />
hope it helps....plus its free<br />
<br />
Also couldn't you email the appointment to yourself @ home and use nokia suite to update your phone?<br />
<br />
That is if you use outlook at home...<br />

            Taken sometime to com back on this but Emoze just didn't work for either!<br />
<br />
I now have a Google Calendar but still have the same problems to the point where I ended up selling the N95 ... real shame too!<br />
<br />
Like the looks of the N96 though now and would still like to find an answer to this question...appears straight-forward and simple but clearly a real problem that has not been solved.<br />
<br />
Simple, all I'd like to find is a Widget or 3rd party application or Nokia solution that allows .iCal or .vCal attachments in e-mail to be opened on the Nokia phone and accepted straight into the calendar - not too much to ask is it?? Somebody please put me
 out of my misery!!!!

                    <p>I've been able to use Focused Inbox on Outlook.com on the desktop browser and the Outlook Android app (using the same Outlook.com account) but for some reason, it does not work on the Mail app for Windows 10 , Outlook Mail app for Windows 10 Mobile, and

</p><p>Now, I understand that it probably hasn't rolled out to all users yet but what I don't understand is how I'm able to use it on Outlook.com on the browser but not on the Windows 10 mail apps and Outlook 2016 desktop. Please help. Thanks!</p>

            Hi James,<br />
<br />
The Focused Inbox feature is available for all versions of Outlook that applied the latest feature update. This feature is not available for Mail app in Windows 10. Regarding your concern, you need to check first if your Office 2016 on your computer is updated.
 You may refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to know how to check Office updates and how to install it to your
 computer.<br />
<br />
Once you have validated that you're using the latest Office update, you can check the steps on how to enable focused inbox on Outlook 2016 on this

<p>Thanks for the response, Ariel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to use Focused Inbox in my Windows 10 Mail app today. After I added my other Outlook.com account, Focused Inbox showed up automatically for both accounts. So, that effectively contradicts your statement:&nbsp;“This feature is not available for Mail
 app in Windows 10.” Unless you were referring to the Outlook mail app for Windows 10 Mobile because I'm close to giving up hope that Focused Inbox will ever work there. Also, in the 2nd link you provided, it clearly states the steps for using Focused Inbox
 in the mail app:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02c13369-8f73-47fc-84e7-5ada90388fa0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02c13369-8f73-47fc-84e7-5ada90388fa0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding Outlook 2016, I can confirm that it's up-to-date or at least that's what it's telling me when I try to check for an update. Below are the details:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Microsoft Office 365</strong><br />
<strong>Version 1705 (Build 8201.2102 Click-to-Run)</strong><br />
<strong>Microsoft® Outlook® 2016 MSO (16.0.8201.2102)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After researching, I found other users with the same problem and they found the Focused Inbox option is showing up in the Customize the Ribbon options under the View menu and when they try to add it to the Ribbon, it shows up but it's all grayed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried doing the same thing and received the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was also able to confirm through an Office Support Agent that it's not an issue with my account being an Outlook.com since I was concerned that it was the reason it may not be activated in Outlook 2016 yet.</p>

            Thank you so much for getting back to us. We're glad that the Focused Inbox is now working on your Mail app in Windows 10. Regarding on Outlook 2016, the Focused Inbox feature is actually available already. However, it is released to members of the Insiders
 Program first before its release as an update to your Office programs. Expect that it will be available to your Outlook 2016 by installing future Office updates. You may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-off-Focused-Inbox-f714d94d-9e63-4217-9ccb-6cb2986aa1b2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> that discuss about Focused Inbox where there's a note indicated under Outlook 2016.<br />
<br />
We look forward to your reply.

<h2>            HOW to restore WIndows 7 using USB REcovery</h2>
                    <p>I want to restore Windows 7 - I am currently on Technical Preview 10130 - I have a Toshiba P855-S5200 lap top.&nbsp;The instructions that came with the USB Drive tell me to boot from the USB in order to re-install and go back to factory condition with windows
 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to find how to do this. The instructions say to press F12 when the Toshiba logo appears on boot&nbsp;- nothing happens - I have tried to press F2 on boot to change the bios so I can boot from USB -but nothing happens when I press F2</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do this from the System Recovery area in Settings&nbsp;- Advanced Options - but nothing worked there either.</p>
<p>I just need to know how to boot from the USB so the recovery process can begin -
</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help would be appreciated - if any one can suggest anything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(the main reason I am doing this is that I have Limited WIFI connectivity and no Ethernet Capability - I have tried installing Drivers from Toshiba - but it doesn't help - It appears lilke several of the drivers are not compatible with WIndows 10 because
 when I start to install them -it looks like the installation is starting - but then nothing happens - no options..so I thought it best to go back to win.7 on that computer</p>

            Mac Office doesn't support image file types embedded as Objects. Your best bet is to contact the sender to have them forward copies of the actual JPEG files.<br />

<h3> tonystewart6241  say:</h3>
<h2>            I have users in the onsite Active Directory and mailboxes in O365.  How do I install Azure AD Connect.</h2>
                    
<p><span>At the moment I have no synchronisation set up for user passwords. O365 is not aware of my internal Active Directory. I would like users to be able to take advantage of the Single
 Sign On feature and believe that Azure AD Connect is the way to set it up.</span></p>
<p><span>My question is when I run through the setup will I be given the opportunity to match existing Active Directory users with the O365 identities? Am I risking wiping out the mailboxes
 that already exist in O365?</span></p>
<p><span>Any advice would be appreciated.</span></p>

<p>Yes, you will be giving the option to select which attribute to use for the mapping between on-prem and O365 accounts. No, you don't risk deleting anything in O365, at least not until after you have matched them :)</p>
<p>In the majority of cases, the default mapping will do just fine and you don't need to change a thing. In case you have some reason to choose a different sourceanchor, make sure to review the documentation here:

    <title>lower volume on sound file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jack-c  say:</h3>
<h2>            lower volume on sound file</h2>
                    I narrated a powerpoint 2010 presentation. No problem doing that and converting it to video.<br />
But the first slide has no narration. Instead, it has an audio, music clip, which plays during the first slide's time in the presentation, before the second and subsequent slides appear with the narration.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the sound/audio music clip plays much louder than the narration. This makes for an unpleasant change after the first slide.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to reduce the volume on the sound file for the first slide? Or increase the volume for all of the narration sound files for the rest of the presentation?<br />
<br />
Many thanks.<br />
<br />
Jack<br />

            Hi Jack,
<div><br />
<div>If the sound file is either set to play automatically or as part of click sequence. ie you dont need to click the icon, then simply move it off the edge of the slide. It then will not be visible but still works the same during the presentation.</div>

<h2>            Banned xbox 360 account &#40;need a moderator to help&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So about a year and a half ago my account xXMsMuffinXx got banned for apparent account modification, i believe it was because my friend was playing BO2 zombies- origins and earnt an achievement called little lost girl, when he earned this achievement he
 had an older version of my account (ValidBasalisk8) since his xbox 360 wasnt connected to the internet when he got this and later he came over to my house and put the account on my xbox but deleted the newer version of the account first then connecting to
 xbox live through the version of the account he had, when it was updated it didnt update the achievement counter or gamer score but it did show the achievement has been completed, about a day later it actually updated and i got banned. i contacted someone
 who had the ability to lift my suspension (12/31/9999) and i explained everything and he said he would lift the ban.... a year and half (give or take) later it still hasnt been unbanned. Im hoping someone else who has the ability to help will come across this
 and help resolve my issue.</p>
<p>Account name- xXMsMuffinsXx</p>
<p>before i changed it- ValidBasalisk8</p>

<h2>            Help&#58;  Converting from Windows 10 to 7&#63;  Terrible issues since upgraded to Windows 10.</h2>
                    I have had more problems than wonderful experiences when I upgraded from Windows 7 to 10. So may be best to just go back to Windows 7?&nbsp; I've been trying to but do not want to pay any extras.&nbsp; Please advise.&nbsp; Thank you so much!!!!

<h2>            installing shared office 365 on Mac issue</h2>
                    <p>I understood that after my husband purchase Office 365 Home, he could share it with me on my Mac. He has shared it and I clicked on the accept button, was sent to my Microsoft Account, signed in. I have used Microsoft on my still working PC, but want to
 put Office 365 on my Macbook Air. After I clicked on "accept", and was logged into my Microsoft account it gave me a message to manage my account and wanted me to go to "the store". What do I need to do to install Office 365...there is no 25 digit keycode
 that I can find.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Nokia 2730 Won&#39;t Turn On - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markenduser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 2730 Won&#39;t Turn On</h2>
                    
<p>This afternoon, I came home with the 2730 and started entering my first contact.&nbsp; Half way through the process, the phone turned off.&nbsp; Wasn't the screensaver or anything as I was currently typing when it happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I figured the battery was dead, so I allowed it to charge for 5 hours.&nbsp; During that time, all the phone did was show a white screen for 5 seconds, then go back to black for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried turning it on when it was disconnected from the adapter, when it was connected, after an hour of charging, and after 5 hours of charging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a known issue or am I going to have to go back to the store and claim it was faulty? The phone only worked for about 7 minutes.</p>

<p>Perhaps, you have have charged the phone before using it for the first time. Try removing the battery and leaving it out for at least 15 minutes. If that does not bring back the phone then bring it back to the store.</p>

<h3> leoniec  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail account - lost all emails, folders and contacts</h2>
                    I have had my Hotmail account for 11 years but have not used it as frequently recently due to Hotmail being banned where I work. I logged into my account yesterday and found that all of my emails, folders and contacts had been deleted. I understand from
 the Terms that this has probably occurred due to me not accessing my account for 270 days. I did not realise that there was this condition or that it had been that long since I last logged in. Is it possible for my emails, folders and contacts to be restored
 ?&nbsp;I would really appreciate it, I feel quite upset that I have lost all of my historical emails. I have used my Hotmail account all over the world. I will ensure in the future to log into my account more frequently, now that I know that this can happen. Please
 help.

                    This has been for five days now and I cannot work out why. The person has no idea I am emailing so it is important they get through. The email is registered as delivered. Can you try and email this person for me to see if the problem is at their end. They
 are currently in France. I have received emails from them but my replies are not being seen

First, since Hotmail/Outlook.com dont support delivery notification or read receipt we (you) have no way of knowing if the were.<br />
<br />
Did your receive an error message?<br />
<br />
Hotmail/Outlook have no facility for emailing someone as it is a free service.<br />
<br />
Can you give us more information on the domain of the person you are sending email to?&nbsp; any further information on when it started, did anything happen to your computer then (like a windows update), or anything else that may have occured around the same time.<br />

<h2>            Saved equations keep getting deleted</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been getting very frustrated with the equation editor lately. I have a lot of equations that I save by creating a new category and saving as building blocks en.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Every now and then (seems to be random), when I open Word up, all of my previously saved equations apart from one or two of the very first ones are all missing and I have to start again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I lost 35 equations last time this happened.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please, does anyone know of a way to fix this?</div>
                </div>

            This might happen if the Building Blocks.dotx file gets corrupted. <br />
<br />
Make a periodic back up of this file and check if the equations come back if you replace the new one with the backed up file.
<br />
<br />
Also provide the size of the file. <br />
<br />

    <title>Outlook Mailbox missing a months worth of emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> asdavies  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Mailbox missing a months worth of emails</h2>
                    <p>When logging onto my Hotmail account on a computer and through my phone, it only shows emails from last Sunday 6th December onwards, and emails from before the 4th November. Essentially there is a months worth of emails missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I have not deleted these emails, and some contain very important information, bookings, etc, that I need access to. After searching through the forums I am completely in the dark about where they have gone, but will note my inbox has 'Outlook Mail
 (Preview)' and wonder if the 'Preview' has something to do with this???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you check if your emails are available in the <strong>deleted items&nbsp;</strong>or
<strong>archived</strong>&nbsp;folder?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you&nbsp;login to Hotmail account&nbsp;through a web browser and it displays Outlook.com (Preview) as the interface,&nbsp;meaning that you have been upgraded to the latest version of Outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I cannot certainly tell you if the issue&nbsp;is due to the new interface but I would suggest you to login to your Hotmail.com account and try&nbsp;recovering the deleted emails by following the steps below.</p>
<p>1. Login to <a href="https://outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.com/</a>&nbsp;and login&nbsp;using your Hotmail account.</p>
<p>2. On the left pane, click on <strong>Deleted items</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Click on&nbsp;<strong>Retrieve messages that were recently deleted or emptied from this folder.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to us if you still cannot find the emails.</p>
<p>Awaiting your response.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t sync Outlook 2007 calendar with WM6 &#38; ActiveSync 4.5</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm using a Samsung i600 running Windows Mobile 6. When I try to sync my Outlook 2007 calendar with the device using ActiveSync 4.5, it only seems to work in one direction, from the device to Outlook. I really want to sync from Outlook to the device but can't
 work out why this isn't working!<br />
<br />
I've tried hard resetting the smartphone and creating a new ActiveSync profile with no success.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

<p>Activesync should sync both ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you delete the partnership in Activesync onthe PC and reboot? Of no, do that and make sure there is no partnership on the device either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you've done that, connect again. Activesync should ask you if you want to keep items on the device or PC or combine both. Choose to combine.</p>
