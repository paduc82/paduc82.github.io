<p>I put some pictures on my pc from my sd card. I opened one to edit the red eye, when I clicked for the next photo, the one I had just edited disppeared.&nbsp; It is not in the file and I have searched the whole computer and cannot find it anywhere. I tried to
 edit another picture to see if it came up that it was saving to another place but that one disappeared too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I had only just put them on, they are not yet backed up so dare not open any more of them in case they go too!!&nbsp; I am using windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            I've seen many reports that rotating/editing can result in<br />
photos becoming hidden. There's a possibility that the<br />
issue may be related to a McAfee update.<br />
<br />
*Update*...see the following thread...specifically the post<br />
from.....Sebastien D.<br />
<br />
photos disapear after rotating, what can I do to stop this<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-pictures/photos-disapear-after-rotating-what-can-i-do-to/a2358d63-0c95-4d93-81e0-eb0a003fc532">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-pictures/photos-disapear-after-rotating-what-can-i-do-to/a2358d63-0c95-4d93-81e0-eb0a003fc532</a><br />
<br />
Might be worth a try to change the following setting and<br />
maybe the photos will re-appear.<br />
<br />
Windows Vista - Show hidden Files<br />

<br />
If the photo thumbs reappear...they may look washed out...<br />
to clear that up...right click one photo or a selected group<br />
or a folder and choose...Properties...uncheck the box.....<br />
"Hidden" / Apply / OK.<br />

            It's hard to tell if it's a hardware or software issue (or both).&nbsp; We'll deal with the software issues since we can much easier.<br />
<br />
<span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device
 for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; You should check for the make and model of the monitor and the video
 card and update those drivers.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers, do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span><span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Go to Start / Control Panel / Color Management and check to see if the device is the same one that you updated the drivers for - if not, change it to the right device.&nbsp; Go to Advanced and check the top entry and open the drop down box and make sure it isn't
 set for black and white.&nbsp; If not, then that's not the problem.<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesnâ€™t work.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking â€“ or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<span><br />
If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning video (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer â€“ or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.
<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, it almost certainly is a hardware problem.&nbsp; You will either need to return it to the computer manufacturer or take it to a professional computer technician (NOT Geek Squad or any of those big store centers) for diagnosis and repair.&nbsp; This
 could be costly depending on what is wrong.&nbsp; Be sure to backup your system before you send it off or take it in since they may do things that could cause you to need to re-install the OS and wipe out everything on the hard drive (they shouldn't - but they
 might).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem and you won't need a repair shop.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></span>

<h2>            Making CD Covers and inserts for jewel cases </h2>
                    Hi<br />
I want to make a CD cover and insert for a jewel case. I have the images and text ready, currently in a mixture of PowerPoint and Word. What is the best way to create something which looks good and which is the right size please? My band has just finished recording
 a CD and we want to give something suitable to the company which will press the CDs.<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
size, date and time of last modification, and attributes (Read-Only, Hidden, System and Archive)! And

now, the list of files can be sorted by name, size, date created, date last modified, or date of last access.<br />

            Hi KirtRicks
<br />
<br />That sounds like your PC has Direct Desktop connection capability
<br />
<br />Some PC's have a network card that allows for devices to connect to each other even if your home does not have a WiFi connection,
<br />
<br />It will appear separate to your network connection and is nothing to worry about . . .

    <title>Hosts file does not work on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beihangfaxueyuan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hosts file does not work on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have the newest version of Windows 8.1, just updated it earlier today (09/24/2018) My internet provider is AT&amp;T. I live in Northern California near Sacramento.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to manually block websites using the "hosts" file, I am able to edit and change the file perfectly, but for some reason the changes do absolutely nothing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc/hosts</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my current "hosts" file:</p>
<p>
</p><p># Copyright (c) 1993-2009 Microsoft Corp.<br />
#<br />
# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.<br />
#<br />
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each<br />
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should<br />
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.<br />
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one<br />
# space.<br />
#<br />
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual<br />
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.<br />
#<br />
# For example:<br />
#<br />
#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;102.54.94.97&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;rhino.acme.com&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # source server<br />
#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;38.25.63.10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x.acme.com&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # x client host<br />
<br />
# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.<br />
#<span> </span>127.0.0.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;localhost<br />
#::1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; localhost12</p>
<p>127.0.0.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;localhost<br />
127.0.0.1<span> </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;youtube.com<br />
127.0.0.1<span> </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;www.youtube.com<br />
127.0.0.1<span> </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;https://www.youtube.com<br />
127.0.0.1<span> </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/<br />
127.0.0.1<span> </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;https://youtube.com<br />
127.0.0.1<span> </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;https://youtube.com/</p>
<p>
</p><p>(All of this just to ban YouTube)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting steps that I'm done:</p>
<p>1 - Disabled any proxy servers</p>
<p>2 - Completed the ipconfig&nbsp;/flushdns</p>
<p>3 - Reset the nbtstat&nbsp;-R</p>
<p>4 - Switched to Google's public DNS</p>
<p>5 - Pinged the website I wanted to block (such as youtube) the ping showed that the website was perfectly normal</p>
<p>6 - Contacted both Microsoft and AT&amp;T Customer support (They had absolutely no idea what to do either, didn't even offer suggestions)</p>
<p>7 - Disabled all my antiviruses and excluded the "hosts" file with Windows Defender</p>
<p>8 - Turned on and off IPv6 and IPv4</p>
<p>9 - Turned on and off my DNS Service</p>
<p>10 - Turned on and off my computer</p>
<p>11 - Turned on and off my internet router</p>
<p>12 - Made sure that the host file was saved, in the correct folder, and had the correct extensive, and made sure that it was ANSI encoded</p>
<p>13 - Removing and adding the "127.0.0.1 localhost" at the beginning of the file</p>

<p>You need to update it in two places. You have the one folder correct but on boot up windows is replacing the modified one with one from it's backup location, on my machine its in a folder:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; "C:\Windows\WinSxS\amd64_microsoft-windows-w..ucture-other-minwin_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.17763.1_none_2605875bbd3b5e2e" &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do a search for it in the WinSxS folder. And mark it read only when done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>HELP!</p>
<p>I've got exactly the same problem as well...</p>
<p>Has been working OK for a few days, but today when I try and start it - it kicks me back to the Xbox one home-screen rather than completing the loading sequence (the whirly thing in the bottom right freezes after a while, and the it returns to the home screen).
 Trying to restart it just does the same thing.</p>
<p>I've tried hard reboot (power cord out as well). Made no difference.</p>
<p>I've tried uninstall / reinstall. Made no difference.</p>
<p>I've tried uninstall / hard reboot / reinstall. &nbsp;Made no difference.</p>
<p>Now have no idea what to do... it was working fine, and now isn't. &nbsp;FH2 still loads and plays fine.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>This may sound stupid, but make sure your Xbox One is connected directly to the wallsocket for power as a surge protector or extension cord might cause it to malfunction.</p>

<p>I've tried all of the above - and none work.</p>
<p>However, I've now fixed it... and I've done so by deleting all of the game-save data - so I can only assume that it's corrupt game-save data that's causing this.</p>
<p>It didn't work when I just deleted the local (hard disk) game data - as the next time the game started it simply re-syncyed from Xbox Live. &nbsp;I had to delete all game data "Everywhere" - and then the game started afresh, I'd obviously lost all progress and
 achievements - but at least it's working again.</p>
<p>The detail for how to do this is quite easy, and I found it after a quick Google:</p>
<p>You can manage your data for individual games through My games &amp; apps on your Home screen. Hereâ€™s how you do a "Delete everywhere":</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;From the Home screen, select My games &amp; apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Highlight the game, press the Menu button on your controller, and then select Manage game.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Scroll to the right, highlight the saved data for your gamertag under Saved Data, and then press A on your controller.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Youâ€™ll be prompted to confirm deletion of this game save data:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Delete from console will remove the local copy of this save. You can retrieve it from the cloud the next time you play.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Delete everywhere will remove your saved data from this console, the cloud, and all other consoles you play on.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cancel will leave your data intact.</p>

<p>The ability to transfer will depend on how Windows 10 was setup on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>OEM license&nbsp;</strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license.&nbsp;<strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong>&nbsp;If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgraded from a retail license, you can try chat support to reactivate:</p>

<h2>            Skype with Monitor in portrait orientation</h2>
                    <p>Skype (12.1803.279.0 Â©2018).&nbsp; Logitech Webcam C615. Windows 10 Pro v.1709 build 16299.192.&nbsp; Monitor ViewSonic VP2365wb&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If my monitor is in portrait orientation, Skype video looks good to me, but my video is not being received; not by another WIN10, nor by WIN8, not even by an iPhone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Switch my monitor to landscape orientation and all is received&nbsp;well&nbsp;by all&nbsp;platforms.&nbsp;
 If I initiate the call in portrait, other party gets no video from me; if I change orientation to portrait mid-call, video received by other party is frozen.</p>
<p>Why should the orientation of my monitor affect video being sent?&nbsp; Is there a solution to this?</p>

<p>Thanks, Karen_E ....</p>
<p>Please, take a look at my original entry, again.&nbsp; Skype operates flawlessly when my monitor IS in landscape orientation.&nbsp; I primarily use my monitor in portrait mode,&nbsp;however,&nbsp;for processing documents, etc.&nbsp; My video does not reach the other party when my
 monitor is in portrait mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, I followed your instructions, and found:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Going through Settings/Apps, clicking on Skype and selecting "Uninstall" renders an error, essentially, "Can't do it.&nbsp; Error code 0x80073cfa"</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Going through Control Panel/Programs and Settings, Skype does not appear in the list.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Going to the menu, right clicking on Skype, and selecting "Uninstall" .... nothing happens.</p>

<p>
</p><p>How about the classic Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried to install it and check if using the portrait orientation on a call works?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you cannot uninstall the Skype and getting an error message, try restarting your pc then try to uninstall it again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, I highly suggest to contact the Microsoft support for further assistance. That error code may indicate that there are incorrect settings or connections on your Windows&nbsp;10 device,&nbsp;it's best to have that checked first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you were able to uninstall and reinstall the Skype, please post back and let me know if the issue persists.</p>

<p>Thanks, Karen!</p>
<p>Well .... I rebooted and still unable to uninstall Skype 12.1803.279.0 from WIN10Pro.&nbsp; Will have to resolve the error message somehow.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Loaded "Classic" Skype (7.40.0.104).&nbsp; With the monitor in portrait orientation, my video IS now being transmitted ... however ....&nbsp;video on my local preview screen and&nbsp; the&nbsp;distant receiving monitor is in landscape mode, i.e.&nbsp; "on its ear."&nbsp; In order for
 me to appear upright on the local&nbsp;picture-in-picture and at the other end, I have to tape the camera to the&nbsp;vertical edge&nbsp;of the monitor; the camera is&nbsp;not designed to sit comfortably on its side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, strange how the orientation of my monitor affects the orientation of the video&nbsp;from the camera.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should anything care which way my monitor is pointing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>
<p>Paul</p>

<p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One possible reason is because Skype for Windows 10 (UWP) adapts your computer's native settings, however, if the classic Skype works, you can use that for the meantime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll make sure to take note of this and endorse it to our development team as feedback.</p>

<h2>            certain keys on my keyboard have stopped working after a windows 7 update</h2>
                    
<p>My keyboard was working fine with windows 7, but then after an automatic update certain keys stopped working.&nbsp; I have tried several recoveries back to when it was working, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;keys&nbsp;worked for a short time, but then stopped again.&nbsp; Now, none of the recoveries
 make them work.&nbsp; I am now having to use a combination of the actual keyboard and the onscreen keyboard to type this - not the best solution!</p>
<p>Keys that aren't working include:</p>
<p>g, h, backspace, '@</p>
<p>The weird thing is, some of the above keys have suddenly started working again while typing this, but not all of them... what is going on?&nbsp; Please help!!</p>

    <title>Xbox one unresponsive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n0 time  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one unresponsive</h2>
                    
<p>It keeps happening more and more often: Xbox one just stops responding to controller/media remote/smart glass app input. Unplugging it fixes it for a few hours to a few days lately. This is ridiculous for a 6 month old console. This happens at random, but
 I notice it happening more when I've been trying to troubleshoot my chat problems while playing COD:AW or at the home screen.</p>
<p>I would understand if I was a beta tester, but I've paid a lot of money to "upgrade" from my 360. This problem, along with several others (posted in their correct forums), is just stupid.</p>

 the app does not activate and this happens at random i have tried completely restarting the console and that works sometimes... but the issue eventually comes back i tried restarting this time to no avail i have two controllers and this happens with both</p>

<p>Bought my Xbox One a month ago and its doing the same thing. Freezes in the home screen. Then I have to manually shut down, still freezes, manually shut down again. After two or three attempts it finally works again. I thought waiting at least this long
 to upgrade my console the bugs would have been fixed. Guess I was wrong. </p>

<p>Hi there guys! This issue is usually caused by a glitch when your console is in standby mode and some download occurs on your Xbox One. Just try to hard reset it by turning it off and removing all the cords from the back. Wait 1 minute and restart the console.</p>
<p>That should do it guys! :)</p>

<p>All I can warn you is go through their support asap because once you are past the one year warranty I guess you are no longer valued as a customer by Microsoft. &nbsp;But from what I've seen and heard from other is it doesn't matter, all the consoles are going
 to have controller connection issues (their patch didn't help at all) and disk reading issues along with all the other issues &nbsp;Its just a poorly built system. Good luck.</p>
