            Hello RobTJoneS,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try performing Startup Repair:
<br />
<br />1. Start your Windows 10 machine, and quickly shut it down before it reaches or if it is at boot screen. Do this two times repeatedly.
<br />
<br />2. On the third time, Windows 10 will automatically display 'Your PC couldn't start properly' message. Now press Esc key for recovery options.
<br />
<br />3. Then under Choose an option screen, click Troubleshoot option and now click Advanced options option.
<br />
<br />4. Under Advanced options screen, click Startup Repair.
<br />

            Hi Rob.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1809 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi. RobTJoneS
<br />My name is Ben
<br />Independent Advisor
<br />I hope to help.
<br />
<br />	To solve this error, restore the system, for this, it is necessary to resort to the recovery options of Windows 10. Do the following and in this order:
<br />
<br />1. Turn off the computer completely
<br />
<br />2. Turn it on again and wait until you see the swirling points circling the screen
<br />
<br />3. At that time, press and hold the power button for approximately 6-8 seconds until the computer turns off
<br />
<br />4. Repeat points 2 and 3 as many times as necessary (usually 3 or 4 times) until it appears on the Preparing Auto Repair screen and then Diagnosing your PC
<br />
<br />5. The Auto Repair screen appears. Choose Advanced Options
<br />
<br />6. On the next screen choose Troubleshooting
<br />
<br />7. Choose System Restore

<p>I have had my own computer not boot up 2 days ago&nbsp; and a client of mines yesterday. Both all of a sudden requiring a Bitlocker key because the drive is encrypted which it never was. If this update did this to me and a client its done to to thousands others.
 In my estimation its one of the biggest issues Microsoft will have and their worst messup in&nbsp; the last 20 years. I was lucky and had an image backup of the machine loads of others will not be so lucky . Windows 10 updates have been the biggest nightmare for
 any sysadmin out there and at this rate its only getting worse. </p>

            <p>Hey Luiz,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE error usually occurs if there are any faulty drivers installed on the computer or if there are hard drive errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One more cause behind this could be computer viruses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please go through <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj569891.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj569891.aspx</a>&nbsp;for more info.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the computer is brand new (within the warranty period), I would suggest you to get in touch with the Computer manufacturer and install the latest drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know how it goes.</p>

<div>My problem is that my laptop don't turn on. I'll not be able to install o run anything. To get things better I bought this computer on Miami and I lie in Brazil, probably the warranty will not cover.</div>

    <title>Unexpected Kernel mode trap - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chciken12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unexpected Kernel mode trap</h2>
                    <p>We own a windows 8.1 desktop PC and when we log in to some users it comes up with an error of UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP and a blue screen. It has happened lots of times, but sometimes it has a crash and other times it doesn't at all. It is very annoying
 and it would be nice if someone could tell us what has happened to the computer to make it do that!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

Be sure to check with the System Maker's Support (Motherboard Maker for custom<br />
systems), their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums (if any)<br />
about any known issues. Be sure to update the<strong> BIOS, low level chipset drivers,
<br />
and the other major on-board and separate device drivers</strong>. Those alone may
<br />
resolve some or all of these issues.<br />
<br />
Note&nbsp;using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run, and Settings<br />
as needed). <strong>Win Key + D</strong> calls the desktop and the using <strong>
Win Key</strong> toggles Desktop <br />

=======================================================</p>
<p><strong>BCCode: 7f&nbsp;0x0000007f&nbsp;with the 00000008 parameter usually means a hardware issue.<br />
<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Have you added hardware or updated drivers recently? Check Control Panel - Windows<br />
Updates to see if any drivers have been updated there just before this started happening.</p>
<p>For 7f - this could be a hardware issue such as poorly seated cards or memory, though there are other causes. Weak powersupply could also lead to this. Use the troubleshooters above and below and when you get to the&nbsp; drivers and memory sections refer to
 the below and then return to the troubleshooters if needed.<br />
<br />
If a PC remove ALL power. Open case, remove and reseat ALL cards, memory chips, and ALL cables (do not just try to snug) on both ends if they can be reached and on the device ends if not (removing the cables and reseating them helps to eliminate minor corrosion).&nbsp;On
 a&nbsp;laptop about all that can be done is to reseat the memory.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Notice the 08 (double fault) as 1st parameter</strong> means there are likely two causes. Be sure to update your drivers manually as using Windows Updates only finds certified drivers and Microsoft and the Device makers are far behind in that process.
 Update NIC, WiFi, BIOS and Video/Display and other major drivers. <br />
<br />
If a Laptop or a PC you might have to take to a shop (not BestBuy or other BigBox Stores) or your System maker's Support.
<br />

<br />
=======================================================</p>
<p>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView -&nbsp;set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names (and BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created
 the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers)
 - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure
 it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p>Hello Julie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that Skype with Facebook login is not available in Skype for Desktop. But I'm not able to understand if it's the same case with Skype for Web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm asking this as I'm not seeing any Login with Facebook option in Skype for Web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you clarify?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Minecraft Beta Program issues and a possible solution - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sammaelcelt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minecraft Beta Program issues and a possible solution</h2>
                    I have noticed that some people who have the Minecraft Beta are unable to play on the worlds of friends that do not have the Beta. A possible solution to this would be to have two separate apps instead of the Beta version replacing the main game. Also
 I have noticed some people who did not opt in to the Beta build have been getting access to the build and believing there is something wrong with the game itself when they try to join their friends. What are your thoughts on the matter?

            <div>Hi, <br />
<br />
<br />
1. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue? </div>
<div>2. What is the complete error message you receive during start up? </div>
<div>3. Which is the version of Windows that you are using? <br />
<br />
<br />
Svchost.exe is a process on your computer that hosts, or contains, other individual services that Windows uses to perform various functions. For example, Windows Defender uses a service that is hosted by a svchost.exe process.<br />
Refer this link: </div>
<ul>
<li>What is svchost.exe?<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows7/What-is-svchost-exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows7/What-is-svchost-exe</a><br />
<br />
<br />
csrss.exe is the client/server runtime subsystem and is a necessary Windows process.
</li></ul>
<div>Since the computer is not behaving properly as expected, I would suggest you to run a virus scan to check for the infections.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong></div>
<div>Run a virus scan on your computer.</div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/security/scanner</a>
<div>Note: If any infections are detected during the scan, there might be a chance of data loss as the infected files will be deleted.<br />
<div><strong>Method 2: <br />
</strong></div>
<div>If you are using Windows vista or 7, I would suggest to refer the below document and perform the steps provided.
<br />
<div><strong>Error message when you start a Windows Vista-based computer: "Windows has blocked some startup programs"</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/930367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/930367</a></div>
<div>This document applies to Windows7 too. </div>

Hope this helps. </div>

I get the same error when upgrading to win10, however, I have no FSX or ORBX s/w. Can you tell me if there was anything peculiar about the TODO file. I think I read somewhere else it was a zero byte file. If it was in the start menu folder, it was a shortcut?
 What did it point at and was that still installed on your machine. Thx for any help.

            Update: Success. Searched my user folder (and subfolders) for zero byte files. Found a bunch and deleted them. Retried the upgrade and it worked. For the sake of completeness, I also disabled my Kaspersky while I did the upgrade.

<p>
</p><p>If you navigate to your user folder and then in the search field in the top right corner, type size:empty, you should get a list of zero byte files if any are found. I was using Win7, I'm assuming this would work the same on Win8.</p>

            Last night I tried the hack 7 fix on adding channels and it worked. This is what I did to correct my problem with the Hauppauge 950q not working:<br />
<br />
Uninstalled the Hauppauge 950q tuner application<br />
Rebooted<br />
Setup WMC 8 per the directions you provided <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuner recognized - no channels however<br />
Used the hack 7 link directions to add channels to WMC 8<br />
All channels I added now work :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

<h2>            IE can see the net but Chrome, Firefox and Outlook can&#39;t</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on Windows 10 and I've just uninstalled all the apple products from my pc as iTunes was playing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've rebooted and now the only browser that can see the net is IE. Outlook is also showing me an 'Unknown Error 0x800408FF' error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, I've uninstalled Chrome and Firefox. When I now try to install Chrome I get 'Unable to connect to the internet. If you use a firewall, please whitelist GoogleUpdate.exe'. I've disabled my firewall and still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's obviously an issue with the uninstalls I've performed rather than an issue with any of the individual programmes on my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks James</p>

<p>A fresh install is exactly what I am trying to avoid. It is a lot of work for something that is probably a driver issue or a setting the needs to be tweaked. I did look a buying a new hard drive to install a fresh
 os incase the fresh install didn't work but decided to wait.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The update feature of the os should work without having to do a fresh install or any of the other things I have tried.&nbsp;The error codes should be more precise so I could identify the problem and fix it without having to resort
 to a fresh install.&nbsp;I don't want to do a fresh install only to find out I didn't have to and it is not right that I would have to because the update process has consistently failed for over a year now I think.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just inherited my mothers computer and she was the only one who knew the password and I need to figure out how to log into computer, I have type of boot disks or anything all I have to work with is the computer which I can't sign into. Would like to not
 have to send the money to buy a windows password reset software. So what steps would I have to take to be able to log onto the computer, thank you. Also it is a e-machine desktop if that helps.</p>

            You can reset a password by going through the steps outlined below. The process is involved and requires some careful typing. Ask a computer-savvy friend to assist you if you lack experience in this area.<br />
&nbsp;1. Set your BIOS to use the DVD drive as the primary boot device.<br />
&nbsp;2. Boot with a Windows Repair CD. <br />
&nbsp;3. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …" appears.<br />
&nbsp;4. Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and then click Next. You are now in Repair Mode.<br />
&nbsp;5. Select an Operating System, then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;6. Select the Command Prompt.<br />
&nbsp;7. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".<br />
&nbsp;8. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; move&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; \&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy&nbsp; cmd.exe&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;9. Reboot normally but hold down the Shift key permanently.<br />
10. When challenged for a password, tape the Shift key five time. You will see a small black screen.<br />
11. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see a list of all accounts that exist on your machine)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see if the Administrator account is active)<br />
12. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user "xxx" ppp&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Replace xxx with the account for which you wish to set a new password, and ppp with the new password)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator /active:yes {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To activate the Administrator account if desired)<br />
13. Log on under this account, using the new password.<br />
14. Reboot the machine into Repair Mode as per Steps 1..6 above.<br />
15. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy \sethc.exe {Enter}<br />
16. Reboot into Windows.<br />
Instead using a Windows Repair CD in Step 2, you can use your Windows 7 Installation DVD. The steps are similar to the ones above.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Sorry I was thinking your were using File Explorer. You can't do that with-in Edge<br />
at this time.<br />
<br />
Open File Explorer to use those methods.<br />
<br />
Of course Quick Access is in the upper part of the left panel.<br />
<br />
IE Favorites are located :<br />
<br />
C:\Users\"Your User Name"\Favorites<br />
<br />
Edge Favorites are located :<br />
<br />
New Edge<br />
C:\Users\"Your User Name"\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\AC\MicrosoftEdge\User\Default\DataStore\Data\nouser1\120712-0049\DBStore<br />
<br />
Older versions of Edge<br />
C:\Users\"Your user name"\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\AC\MicrosoftEdge\User\Default\Favorites<br />
<br />
(For Older Versions of Edge - If you want to Import IE Favorites into Edge or Vice Versa you can just copy and paste the contents of one to the other."<br />
<br />
OR in New Edge click the 3 little dots on the upper right of page - Settings -&nbsp;"Transfer Favorites and other info" - Import or Export.<br />

<h3> brucehooper  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re&#58; Copying Backup Sets for the same computer from multiple drives to a new plus MediaID.bin questions related to that</h2>
                    <p>I have backup sets from the<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> same computer
</span>stored on more than one drive as well as WindowsImageBackup files on those drives.&nbsp; The idea was to have some help in the event any of the drives crashed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to reduce the space being used on two of my drives for this purpose and decided to
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">copy</span> the backups onto a new drive.&nbsp; If all went well, then I would&nbsp;delete the Backup Sets from the original drive they were on.&nbsp;&nbsp;The computer is named Bruce-PC.&nbsp; Each of the current drives have&nbsp;two files&nbsp;that are&nbsp;entitled
 MediaID.bin, one is located within the&nbsp;Bruce-PC folder and the other located separately from that folder on the drive.&nbsp; On some drives they both have the same date and time modified and are the same size, on others they don't.&nbsp; I'm not sure what to make of
 this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, is it alright to&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">copy</span>, as opposed to
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">move</span>,&nbsp;backup sets from different drives into the Bruce-PC folder on&nbsp;a new drive?&nbsp; I'm not even sure if I should create that folder or copy it from one of the drives where it was created by the backup process.&nbsp;
 Also, I've noticed that if I do&nbsp;copy each of the backup sets on a given drive to another drive I'm asked if I want to create another MediaID.bin for each backup set which would then have a MediaID.bin(1) and MediaID.bin(2) etc., apparently the original and
 a new one perhaps representing the drive onto which I making the&nbsp;copy. &nbsp;I'm not sure what to do about all this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please help.

            <p>I've been asked to reply if I've not resolved issues with copying/moving backup sets from one drive to another.&nbsp; I'm convinced some of my problem is that when I have moved some of my backup sets I have not included the system generated computer name that
 is created when I made the original backup set/sets.&nbsp; I also didn't move or copy the MediaId.bin file that was included in the original backup set location.&nbsp; I've not been able to restore to alternate locations because I get errors indicating that Restore
 encountered a problem while verifying the backup device.</p>
<p>After various attempts it seems like trying to restore from my moved or copied backup sets will not work for me unless I can come up with a way to handled the MediaId.bin issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A typical message I receive is:</p>
<p>&nbsp; Restore encountered a problem while verifying the backup device</p>
<p>
</p><p>I:\&nbsp; (This is the drive to which&nbsp;I moved or copied the backup set/sets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following&nbsp;information might help you resolve the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Backup encountered invalid MediaID.bin file on the drive where the backup is save.&nbsp; Restore from a different backup or delete the MediaId.bin file and try to create another backup.&nbsp; The MediaId.bin file can be found under &lt;backup location&gt;\MediaId.Bin
 &lt;backup location&gt;\machine-name-folder&gt;\MediaID.bin. (0x81000035).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is I&nbsp;probably have 50 backup sets and wanted to restore them to&nbsp;an alternate location and cull through them for duplicates that I can delete to reduce the storage space being used.&nbsp; By creating&nbsp;original backups on various drives and compounding
 the issue by moving or copy them to other drives I've created a real hornets nest.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I can create a valid MediaId.bin file for the backup sets I've moved from one drive to another, although I've generally included the original drive name&nbsp;as part of the folder name on the receiving drive.&nbsp; If anyone&nbsp;wants to
</p>
<p>enlighten me on these matters I'd certainly appreciate it.&nbsp; Is it correct to assume that within a given backup set that the backup files following the original are incremental to the original?&nbsp; If I start putting&nbsp;new backup sets on a different drive,&nbsp;what
 is the relationship if any to the backup sets on the previous drive, etc.&nbsp; I'm discovering how very ignorant I am in these areas.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows Phone drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dibyajitchakraborty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Phone drivers</h2>
                    I own a Nokia Lumia 620 device with Windows Phone OS version 8.0.10328.78. It connected easily to my HP ProBook 4440s laptop while it had WIndows 7&nbsp;and Windows 8 OS. However, since upgrading to Windows 8.1, It seems to be unable to connect to my phone
 through the Windows Phone app on my laptop. The data cable is fine as my phone keeps charging while it is connected. On the "devices and printers" window, it displays the message that my windows phone device has some driver problem and it asks me to re-install
 the driver for windows phone. However, I am unable to find any suitable driver and troubleshooting does not seem to work. Any solution to this problem would be of great help.
