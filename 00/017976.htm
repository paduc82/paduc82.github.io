                    <p>No message saying error, just a white box where the export menu should be and then crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated to the latest patch for PS 16 (16.1.115)*I think it's called. And still the same. It just did this recently and I'm assuming it has something to do with the latest windows update. Looking to build a new pc but just finishing up projects relating
 to this dated software.</p>

            Updated to 17134.81 and the result is still the same. I've also tried running as administrator but not sure if I did it correct. Corel/Avid has kind of stopped supporting ps 16 as they are now up to 21 if I'm not mistaken. But I'm certainly not staying
 with their software because their instability.

<p>As silverpulser said it is a video editing software. Other than buying the newer version, support has mainly been coming from community. I'm moving on from pinnacle studio to a more professional movie editing software. And as I said I just want to finish
 up the last remaining projects with this software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what exactly happens. That White box appears where the export menu should be and then program crash and no message.</p>

    <title>One note glitching on window pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jorowe  say:</h3>
<h2>            One note glitching on window pro</h2>
                    So I am a student and use onenote for all my studies including taking notes directly on my powerpoints. Over the semester it has started randomly freezing and shutting down, not allowing me to scroll with touch or the mouse pad without a long long pause
 and when it randomly shuts down it doesn't always save what I had written or added. It also takes a good 2-5 minutes to upload most powerpoints. It has gotten worse and worse and is affecting my study habits. I really do not want to switch to notability because
 I do not like using ipads and love my surface pro. Anyone have any suggestions?&nbsp;

    <title>Word 2010 template custom tabs order - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darkclouds  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 template custom tabs order</h2>
                    <p>My company has multiple templates listed in multiple folders in the Workgroup templates location. The problem is, because&nbsp;we have so many some are more important than others. So for example, I click on File&gt;New&gt;My Templates and it displays the templates
 location. All the TABs are filled with the names of the folders however as we have so many there is a tab&nbsp;saying "More..." From there I can choose a different folder and select the template I require to make into a document. Following so far?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is, I need to organise these tabs as some&nbsp;we use more frequent than others but no matter what i do, I cannot change the order. It doesnt seem to be based off date created of the folder or alphabetically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to change the order of the custom tabs in the templates?</p>

            I would create and Add-in that customized the ribbon with a button that would bring up a user form that contained a series of tabs that represented each of your custom folders and when you clicked on each one, it would display the templates that were in
 that folder and when you click on the one that you wanted to use, it would create a new document from that template.

            While it was possible in Office 2003 to remove tabs from the New dialog, which would make space available for your own tabs, that is not the case in Office 2007 or 2010.

            <p>But i dont want to remove them? I just want to reorder them.</p>
<p><br />
So for example when I go into File&gt;New&gt;My Templates&nbsp; it shows all my templates listed in there. Now because&nbsp;I have several folders in the location of "Workgroup templates" containing other templates , each folder becomes a new custom TAB. Correct? So what if
 Ive got more custom tabs that it can fit? It creates a "More..." TAB. If I want to reorder these tabs, there MUST be a way of doing so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating add-ins and customised ribbons is impractical as we are finding it hard enough to get the users to click on "More..." to find their templates! *sigh* Tryung to get them to do something different will be near impossible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I need to do is re-order the tabs in the My Templates box, surely thats not impossible. How does Word choose which folders to display as tabs and in which order?</p>

            <p>It's a moot point because it was only in versions before 2007 that you could remove tabs.&nbsp; The point however was that if you removed some of the standard ones then there would be room for your own tabs.</p>
<p>I have searched through the Registry for a Template Sub-Folder that exists on my system to see if I could find anywhere in the Registry that it might appear (so that I could perhaps change the order in which it appears as a tab in the New dialog), but without
 success.</p>
<p>As a result, I do not know of any way to re-order the tabs.</p>
<p>The Add-in containing the ribbon customization only has to be created once and rolled out to each of the users.&nbsp; It would be possible to create it so that it was completly dynamic - It would automatically create the tabs for each folder (so that it would
 deal with a folder being added\deleted) and it would automatically list all of the templates in each folder so that it would always show the current list of templates in the folder.</p>

            So how does Word choose which TABs to display? As I said earlier, it doesnt seem to be aphabetical or date related. There must be something within Word that chooses some folders to be a TAB over others?

<br />
Sorry, I have no idea (and that after doing a very thorough search of the Registry).&nbsp; Also a quite extensive search using Google turned up a number of people wanting to change the order of the tabs but no responses indicating how it could be done.

<p>Yesterday I was using outook 2007. I exported my email by backing it up to C:\users\office\desktop\email-backup.pst</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file properties&nbsp;say that it is an outlook data file. Please help. </p>

            <p>Why did you export, and then why did you import?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you uninstalled Office 2007 then installed Office 2013 by default it would have used the origonal outlook profile, including the accounts &amp; data files.</p>
<p>If for any reason it didnt use the origonal outlook Profile its a relatively simple matter to reconnect the origonal outlook data file</p>

I have been trying to add an image to my Word Art text (as a text fill) for a client's book cover art; but, of course, Microsoft seems to have removed this feature from the new Word version. &nbsp;I tried following the steps on Lunapic, but it still didn't change
 the font fill. &nbsp;Any other suggestions?</p>

            <p>Yes, it appears that this is yet another amputation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PowerPoint still supports the Picture Fill option, so you can do your thing there, then copy &amp; paste to your Word document. However, since Word no longer supports it you can't simply use the default paste option for a Microsoft Office Graphic Object... If
 you do it loses the fill &amp; converts it to Black. You'll need to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>use <strong>Edit&gt; Paste Special</strong> to paste as either PDF or TIFF, or</li><li>Save the Word Art from PowerPoint as a Picture, then insert the picture into your Word document. One advantage to this method is that it offers more image file types, such as PNG &amp; JPEG</li></ul>
<p>With both options, of course, the result no longer is editable eve if copied back to PowerPoint. You might want to consider saving a presentation file containing your Word Art creations so you can revise the original and/or create new copies when needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't hesitate to use the ☺︎ at the right end of the Word Ribbon to let Microsoft know how you feel about the crippling regressions. It's best to submit an individual message for each one you want to address.</p>

            Not surprised...Welcome to the club! Not Nokia club but bugs problems and rare solutions...I have the 5.43 software and it says that your code is: 0537451 05.43 RM-145 6233 EURO-C CTV GERMANY BLACK. So I am not sure about arabic language. If you have warranty
 you should go to service. If not I am sure you can find someone that reinstalls software. The problem with the web updater is that it does not work right. When they do it in the service or people with the right tools they do not update with the CA53 cable
 but with a different cable that really erases everything. This is the code that has arabic: 0535967 05.43 RM-145 6233 EURO-G CTV ME ARABIC BLACK. Hope it helps!

<p>Re: Win10 - FWIW, use it on all my production systems any never had any problems whether a new install or upgrade but not going to argue that some people have had issues after upgrading so not going to try and make a case as to whether you should or shouldn't.
 One rule I always follow on any system upgrade is to make/have an image backup of the system before doing anything else so &lt;IF&gt;things go south - I can return to normal in very short order.</p>

</p><p>Now for your Outlook questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - &lt;Q&gt; Type of account? &lt;A&gt; POP3, IMAP, Exchange etc. The "type" of account also determines where/how Outlook data is stored on your computer</p>

<p>
</p><p>#3 - &lt;Q&gt; Available format? &lt;A&gt; which file type is selected for storing data you decide to &lt;export&gt; from Outlook. In '2007 that could include .csv, Excel, Access, or PST whereas in '2013 and above, your only options are .csv and .PST. A CSV file is a purely
 a ,text file&gt; whereas the other types are native file formats for their respective programs. In the case of a PST file - you'll need Outlook to access/read the data.</p>

If that's the case, you will have to export (or save) your contact info to a new PST file and open that file in Outlook anytime you want to access your "backed up" contact data. However, a little unclear as to what you're actual objective is vis-a-vis - (1)
 are you looking to have a "backup" of your contacts or (2) keep your day-to-day contacts on an external drive separate from your email data or (3) think you can access your Outlook contacts from any program without using Outlook? or or or&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p>#1 - For your case, makes no difference whether you select CSV or Excel - a csv file can be opened to Excel. Process is the same for both as are the fields that can be exported. For your purposes, you're going to need to "read" the contact data in Excel
 regardless of whether or not you exported it as csv data. Nothing to setup "beforehand"<br />
&nbsp;</p>
How to Export Your Outlook Contacts to a CSV File<br />
<a href="http://email.about.com/od/outlooktips/ss/Export_Outlook_Contacts_to_CSV.htm#step1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://email.about.com/od/outlooktips/ss/Export_Outlook_Contacts_to_CSV.htm#step1</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(in the above video, as is the case with most instructions related to importing/exporting I've seen, the important step left out is to manually map the fields you want to export to ensure you get what you want at the end of the day but beyond that everything
 else is fairly self-explanatory)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - The link of mine that you referenced from in reply has nothing to do with your question. If you want to see what fields you can export, simply run through &lt;Export&gt; process for a non-pst export making sure you map the desired fields via the &lt;Map Custom
 Fields&gt; button when the process presents itself. How to export a csv/Excel file etc - just select it as the output file type and follow the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - There is no export to MS Word - everything that is available is exactly as you see it going through the import or export process. As for programs like Outlook just disappearing and then "re-appearing" - something like that simply doesn't happen on its
 own - it's either installed or it's not and then it's just a question of where it "disappeared from" but not a question related to this post so not attempting or have any desire to deal with that in this thread.&nbsp;</p>

            Yes I have the same really annoying issue - In Windows 8.1 you position the File Explorer window exactly where you want it and this is remembered. Since the 9926 build this functionality seems to have disappeared - with the File Explorer window opening
 in a new position every time!

                    <p>I've used Skype many times in the past on my creaking old windows desktop. Now it won't work on my brand new Windows 10 laptop. I tried using the pre-installed Skype, and when I tried to video call someone, it said another application was using my camera
 (incorrect).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling and re-installing Skype - I tried to re-install from the Skype website, and Windows insisted that I install the app from the official app store.</p>
<p>I tried to do a test call, it seems to connect but I hear nothing, but get no error message either.</p>
<p>I checked my settings etc - can't see what the problem is.</p>
<p>Why doesn't it work?</p>

            Hi AnnetteSo, your best option is to try installing the Classic Skype Application form the link below
<br />
<br />Skype classic 7.4 offline installer: 
<br /><a href="http://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a> 
<br />
<br />When that downloads, run the installer and that should be more reliable than the new App . . .

            I have no idea what you mean by "Word e-mail" -- Word is a word processing program, not an e-mail client. Documents produced in Word can be sent by e-mail in several different ways.<br />
<br />
If you send a Word document as an attachment or as content in an HTML e-mail message all formatting should be retained. For the latter, it may depend on your e-mail client's support of HTML.<br />
<br />
If you provide a complete &amp; accurate description of what steps you're taking, what e-mail software you're using, what you expect &amp; what happens instead we may be able to provide suggestions. Please be sure to indicate present version info of the software you're
 using.<br />

            <p>You can use Word as your email composing program. On the View menu of Word choose Web Layout. This view will give you the most accurate rendition of what your recipient will see.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You should be able to use Word's keyboard shortcuts, font formatting, and Ribbon commands to superscript characters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Use File &gt; Share &gt; Send as</p>
<p>and choose either HTML or Attachment. Either way the superscripts should be preserved on the recipient's end.</p>

            <p>Another thing you can try is to delete the Registry key at:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsSelfHost\Applicability ← delete the Applicability key. If you want to, you can first export it to a file, but Windows will replace it with the correct info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you use the Settings App&nbsp;to check your Windows Insider Program Settings, it will properly recreate this key for you. Just check that you are set to Fast Ring and check Regedit again to see that the above key has been replaced.</p>

            <p>I'm using Office 365 personal. At this point, I don't care if it's POP or &nbsp;IMAP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't provide me another link on how to set it up, I've been using Office since 1998.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact is, that the email password keeps changing to something it is not no matter what I do. This is coming on the heals of the recent Windows 10 upgrade because there is another issue. Windows keeps taking my files and moving them to the Recycle Bin,
 which is really beginning to **** me off. However, that issue is for another string.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help me get the email issue resolved first and I'll post my other issue in another post.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Uploaded two minidumps from C:\Windows\Minidump: http://1drv.ms/1GpBydr<br />
<br />
It happend right out of nowhere. I didnt change anything. I even reinstalled Windows...<br />
<br />

</p><p>There is a known problem with Synaptics drivers and your is the cuase of the crashes.&nbsp; I would go into device manager and revert back to a previous driver.&nbsp; That will fix it until Windows update re-downloads the synaptics driver&nbsp; I am sure MS is aware of
 this and thing Synaptics is probably working on a fix</p>

            Follow the directions here:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.officeformachelp.com/2011/07/install-office-2008-on-lion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Install Office 2008 on Lion</a><br />
<br />
Run these two steps first.<br />
<br />
1) If you installed Lion over your previous install, download and run the Lion combo over your install.<br />
2) After running combo, in Applications/Utilities open Disk Utility and run Repair Permissions.<br />
<br />
OS X Lion Update 10.7.4 (Client Combo) 1.4 GB<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1524<br />
</a><br />
<br />
MORE INFO ON WHY RUNNING COMBO FIXES ISSUES<br />
<br />
Apple updates available from the Software Update application are incremental updates. Delta updates are also incremental updates and are available from Apple Downloads (software updates are generally smaller than delta updates). The Combo updates contain all
 incremental updates and will update files that could have become corrupted.<br />
<br />
Combo updaters will install on the same version as they're applying--no need to roll back or do a clean install. So if you think you've got a borked 10.6.6 install from a regular update, just run the 10.6.6 Combo Updater on that system.<br />
<br />
"Delta" updaters can only take you from one version to the next. For example: 10.7.2 to 10.7.3. If somehow the 10.7.2 is missing something it should have, and that something isn't changed between 10.7.2 and 10.7.3 it will still be stale after the delta update.<br />

            Running the combo never hurts but if Lion was installed on your computer you might not need to run over your install. Of course, you never know what has happened since you got your new computer. :-)
<br />
<br />
You should be able to install using the instructions Install on this post. <a href="http://www.officeformachelp.com/2011/07/install-office-2008-on-lion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>As to your issue, please open Windows Explorer and, at the top of window, copy\paste the path to confirm it is correct.&nbsp; In Windows 7 the Path is different and can be confusing if not familar with it.&nbsp; For example, unless you added a *Test* folder to C"\,
 it is most likely under *C:\Users\...*.</p>
