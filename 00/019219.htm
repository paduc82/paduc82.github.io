    <title>Search for Paragraph Markers that have the Font attribute&#58; Hidden - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maebabcock  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search for Paragraph Markers that have the Font attribute&#58; Hidden</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to search for hidden paragraph marks in Word?<br />
<br />
Not show/hide Paragraph marks, but finding any paragraph markers that have the "Hidden" font feature.<br />
<br />
I frequently assist with formatting legal documents, and sometimes numbering and formatting can be screwed up because a paragraph marker has accidentally been given the "Hidden" font attribute. The documents often look fine on the computer they are typed on,
 and the issues only exist after printing or sending outside of the firm. Since the formatting is often required to be precise, we cannot send out documents without being sure the formatting is correct.&nbsp;These documents are often over 100 pages long, so going
 over the full document, highlighting every paragraph marker, and hitting the font dropdown to see if it is hidden would take forever, as would printing out the document and checking every paragraph to ensure it is the same on paper as it is on screen.<br />
<br />
If I could find and replace from paragraph markers that are hidden to paragraph markers that not hidden, that would be best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is not currently a feature to search for this, so I would like to request one.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2015 MSFT ended special product keys for Insider builds and began requiring that all copies of Windows be normally licensed.&nbsp; Preview builds, like all beta software, have expiration dates after which the build stops working.&nbsp; Activation
 relies on an underlying license assigned to the device, not the build. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enterprise and Education editions are Volume License products, unlike Home, Pro, and Pro for Workstations which are digitally licensed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSFT will not sell you a stand-alone license for Enterprise.&nbsp; A Volume License Key (VLK) needs to be obtained from an owning enterprise or organization and activation is maintained by being connected to the org's activation server periodically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can obtain a six-month trial of Enterprise but it cannot be activated unless you obtain a VLK from an org. and maintain activation by connection to the server at least once in a six-month period.</p>

<p>If your device does have a license for Windows 10 Pro, you can easily toggle to the Pro edition instead, using the generic Product Key for Pro, that is found on the official Windows 10 install media in
<strong>\Sources\product.ini</strong>. You can open the file in Notepad to read the list of generic Product Keys.&nbsp; If your device has no existing Windows 10 license, none of these keys will activate any Edition of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if your license is for Home edition, you will need to do a clean install of Home, as you cannot toggle editions from a professional edition to the Core/Home edition.</p>

<p>
why, if sp1 is installed,&nbsp; would you get a message that it's NOT installed. that doen't make sense. i never received an answer to my question about the new msn requiring ie11. is it not compatable with ie9? all the message says , you should upgrade to get the
 best msn experience( whatever that means).&nbsp;i think you should realize that most of microsoft's customers are NOT computer wizards but rather just ordinary people trying to get stuff done on-line with a simple tool that allows them to do it. do i need 11 to
 customize my screens because my screens don't show anything for customization. by the way, if sp1 was insalle shouldn't it show when i look at system properties..&nbsp; i need to find another tool that let's me monitor my stock portfolio an get current info on
 those stocks. i can't go another week with msn as it is now.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1) Just from what is written in your initial post, I understand that you are told to upgrade but you cannot because SP1 is not installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) When asked which version to download, you will need (x86) version for a 32-bit Windows and (x64) version for a 64-bit Windows.&nbsp; System Properties will show you whether you have 32 o 64 bit version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) If SP1 is installed, yes, it will show in System Properties</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Do you have Windows set to Automatically Update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Internet Explorer 9 is compatible with the New MSN</p>

            <p>Hello Aaron,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)For exporting list of groups that have been created you should be an verified network admin</p>
<p>In gear box icon in network admin there is an option of Export data.</p>
<p>In that you will find groups which are created</p>
<p>Link For exporting data</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Monitoring-your-Yammer-data-Yammer-admin-guide-8c4651fa-12c2-4ced-b4ea-2200c0a630ed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Monitoring-your-Yammer-data-Yammer-admin-guide-8c4651fa-12c2-4ced-b4ea-2200c0a630ed</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)For turn off group creation you should be an verified admin again</p>
<p><span>Than in Network admin In Security Settings Check “</span><span style="color: rgba(52, 58, 65, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span>Enforce
 your Exchange Online Exchange Transport Rules (ETRs) in Yammer</span><span style="color: rgba(52, 58, 65, 1)">&nbsp;“</span></p>
<p><span>Than in network setting External network please check Only admins.</span></p>
<p><span>Now by these only Admin can create groups.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Payal.</p>

    <title>Google Maps voice search broken on s60v3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kurtkaufman---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Google Maps voice search broken on s60v3</h2>
                    
<p>I have noticed that as of the past few days, the voice search feature on the s60v3 Google Maps (v.4.1.1) no longer works. The app returns the error "Voice search can't connect". I see the GPS active, and I also see activity on the 3.5G data connection as
 well as a WIFI connection (if I'm in the range of WIFI). Text-entered search still works as usual, but with my n79, it's not very convenient.</p>
<p>I would appreciate confirmation from anyone experiencing the same limitation on any s60v3 or newer device.</p>

<p>@aspergerguy</p>
<p>Thanks for your message. I was able to confirm that on newer hardware (E6-00), Google Maps voice search brings up the same error. At this point I wouldn't be surprised if google did not bother to fix a problem relating specifically to Symbian clients. [somewhat
 off-topic:] It seems to me that the general shift away from self-contained data (such as Nokia Maps) to network based brings with it major advantages in the sense that the data is updated constantly. But it also points to how problematic it can be when slight
 changes to the server software configuration can render the client partially or totally useless. Also see:</p>

<p>What happens is that Google periodically revises the required format of search queries. Google will normally roll out revised versions of their search apps for the various platforms concurrently, so as to cause as little disruption of services as possible.
 However, as the following link <strong>MAY</strong> indicate (I'm protecting myself from censorship here):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!search/symbian/websearch/0qygFjedSPc/tLcW9KHBGuUJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!search/symbian/websearch/0qygFjedSPc/tLcW9KHBGuUJ</a><br />
<br />
The Symbian version of the Google search app may no longer be supported, and as a result, the app appears to be not fully functional. It
<strong>MAY</strong> be that the voice search function of the Google Maps app has also been similarly neglected, and that
<strong>MIGHT</strong> be the reason for it no longer functioning across <strong>
MANY</strong> Symbian models.</p>

<p>As Google appears to be no longer supporting the Symbian OS, I would not expect any fixes to any Google Symbian apps. You can still use Vlingo to search Google by voice without using the Google search app itself (and I find it works well), but as far as
 Google maps are concerned, you have to enter the text manually.</p>

    <title>Footers in Master slide not showing on others - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Footers in Master slide not showing on others</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am creating a Powerpoint template and have tried adding footers to the master slide, but they aren't showing up on the slides beneath of it. I am trying to have 3 footers at the bottom- Date, Title and Slide #. I have tried to set it up using the "Master
 Layout" option and by going to the "Insert" tab and clicking "Header &amp; Footer" but neither are working. All other aspects on the Master slide are showing up on my other slides, including shapes, images and text. I have 2 master layouts. The first is for the
 title slide and it doesn't have any footers. The second master layout applies to the rest of the slides and that is the one I have been trying to add the footer to.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>In addition to having those placeholders on the master slide, make sure they are also present on the slide layouts below the master. You'll want to make the footer text a lighter color, it's nearly invisible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you may be having another issue. Judging by how short the scroll bar is on the left-hand window, you appear to have a LOT of slide masters and layouts in your deck. A couple of weeks ago, someone with a similar problem was able to get the footers
 working by deleting the unused masters and layouts.</p>

                    I recently received an anonymous phone call on my cell phone from woman stating she is from Microsoft Windows. She said she is calling because my computer is downloading malware to the hard drive and she wants to help fix it. She wanted me to turn on my
 computer so she could connect to it and I was suspicious right away and told her I Was not at home. She said she will call me later this afternoon and I said why don't you give me your number to call you back and she refused. I hung up on her. I contacted
 my ISP right away to get advice and they said Microsoft will never do that and it's a scam. Is there anything else I should do?

<h2>            Why is Excel automatically changing formula result to value&#63;</h2>
                    I have two cells that excel is automatically changing to the results of the formula. When I re-enter the formulas, sometimes it works showing the formula in the formula bar and then if I go to another sheet and come back to the cell, it will just be the
 result of the formula in the formula bar. I tried making the formula an array but same thing. I suppose I could write a macro to insert formulas each time I open those sheets, but I am more curious as to why this is happening. &nbsp;Thank you in advanced

            Is it possible that your workbook has macro code that is doing the conversion? If your file is a macro-enabled .xlsm, try opening it with macros disabled (some Excel developers use events to change worksheet cells).

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook 2013 Office keeps disconnecting from server</h2>
                    About 10 minutes in every hour my Microsoft Outlook 2013 Office keeps disconnecting from the server, my internet connection is OK. Is there a problem with the server again? My e-mail is Outlook.com

            <p>I have been having the same problem - and believe it or not have tried the suggestions all mentioned including 1) in safe mode 2) rebooting the computer 3) Running chkdsk 4) even deleted accounts and reset them up to Exchange Active Sync 5) Invoked On line
 support and so on </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sometimes these work. The interesting thing is I am completely up to date (Microsoft Office 365 &nbsp;subscriptions) Windows 8.1 etc...
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Its intermittent - as I am typing this it just reconnected... </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I know how hard this is to "diagnose" but since I have not changed anything on my end.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I guess my expectations are low - so I keep on keeping on, but I also know if we (the Microsoft diehard community) don't give you feed back - you won't know "WE ARE HAVING PROBLEMS" and should not be having to deal with this.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks' for listening - but please figure out what's going on. </p>

            OK - I am prepared to try this. But before I do this - can you explain to me what this means? Does this mean that e-mails I have to keep that are older than one month will be deleted form my computer (Outlook 2013 desktop version?) It specifically says
 keep off line for one month? Thank you

<p>
</p><p>After mulling around a bit on the net, checking all the trials and failures i think i might have a found a solution. Its worked once for me so far. You ready? here goes. Click on "Work Offline" to disconnect outlook from the connection then click on it again
 to reconnect and bob's your uncle! </p>
<p>
</p><p>If this works for you, it sure beats trudging around settings, rebooting and wondering why you have an outlook account. All the best.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth Pairing not supported</h2>
                    <p>Windows Phone 7.5 (OS version 7.10.7720.68)</p>

<p>HTC Titan</p>

<p>PC operating system Windows 7</p>

<p>I'm trying to pair two HTC Titans but get message "not supported" every time. The Titans specs are identical. I then try to pair a Nokia N97 to the HTC Titan and I get the
 same message. I follow all the procedures and check that the Pin requested on both devices is corrected, but pairing does not happen. Now I'm wondering if the Titan will pair with my Bluetooth Hands free kit. Please advise.</p>
Thanks

            The only bluetooth profiles that are supported by windows phone are audio profiles.&nbsp; There is no way to pair two bluetooth phones to share files, so you won't be able to pair two windows phones with each other, but you should be able to pair a windows
 phone with a bluetooth headset or even your bluetooth hands free kit (if audio is what is used there)<br />

<h2>            Moving PST file to non-domain computer</h2>
                    I have a user who has a computer on a .local domain. &nbsp;He wants to move his PST file to his personal computer, which isn't on any domain. &nbsp;When I attempt to import the PST on the user's personal computer, I get a message of, "File Access is Denied. &nbsp;You
 do not have permission required to access the file." &nbsp;On the original PC, I gave read/write access to the file to "everyone", but "everyone" doesn't apply to the new PC. &nbsp;What do I need to do in order to import the PST on the user's new PC?<br />
<br />
Thank you!

            I closed outlook on the old PC and it still gave me the same error. &nbsp;Could it be related to ownership? &nbsp;I see on the PST file on the old PC that it's owned by the domain user, but on the new PC, it says that it's owned by the local user. &nbsp;Could that be
 causing the problem? &nbsp;If so, how do I fix that?

<p>
</p><p>If so, what are the exact steps you're taking to "import" it? Any chance that PST file is marked as "Read-only" by the way? Make sure it's not - Outlook doesn't like Read-only PSTs.</p>

            On the old computer, I created a PST called "Outlook Transfer." &nbsp;I used a flash drive to transfer the PST to the new computer. &nbsp;It's currently located on the new computer's desktop. &nbsp;In Outlook 2016 on the new computer, I'm going to File--Open and Export--Import
 From Another Program or File--Outlook Data File--and then I'm opening the PST that I moved over. That's when I get the error.

            I made sure that it wasn't read only, and that the user has full control of the file. &nbsp;Could it be related to the fact that it was originally created with his domain account?

            <p>I don't think so - I've seen domain users create PST files before that opened fine on non-domain machines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose it's possible the PST is somehow corrupted. Could you go back to the original machine and re-create the PST file from scratch?</p>

<h2>            Parallel installation of MS Office versions. MS Word is crashing when opening text files &#40;&#42;.txt&#41;</h2>
                    <p><span>I have parallel installation of MS Office 2000 Premium and 2010 Pro (with no-reregister lines in Registry to stop "Installing Office" delays when opening a different word version, as per Article ID: 92809.</span></p>
<p><span>From some time I am unable to open any text file by neither Word2000 nor 2010.</span></p>
<p><span>Word 2010-32bit works fine after editing the Registry and assigning every winword to Word 2010. After the install it would crash on text files as well.
</span></p>
<p><span>The error is: It tells me that word stopped working and needs to close. The text file may be of an ordinary .txt extension or any other: ini, ion, log, etc</span></p>
<p><span>Is this a known problem? On another PC where I have dual install of 2003 and 2007 under Win XP, I am getting sometimes (rarely) the same problem. But it usually works.
</span></p>
<p><span>Operating system is Win7 Ultimate 64bit - where the problem is persistent and WinXP SP3 where I do not experience this problem, only occasionally.</span></p>
<p><span>The application event logs the following error:</span></p>

<p>I've got Vista Business 32 bit SP2, with a triple parallel installation: 2003/2007/2010. I haven't had that problem with TXT files.</p>
<p>Till you figure it out, try using Wordpad or Notepad to work on txt files.</p>

<p>How are you attempting to open the files--from Word directly, or by double-clicking on the file in Windows Explorer?</p>
<p>Regardless of how you're attempting to do it ordinarily... what happens if you start Word in Safe Mode (click Start, type winword /safe, and press Enter--this most likely will default to starting Word 2010, unless you specify the full path)? Do you still
 get the error when Word is started in safe mode?</p>

            Double click a *.txt file and it opens Word 2010 and it works fine.<br />
Only when I try to open a text file from within Word 2000 it crashes. All other files: doc, html, rtf Word2000 is opening correctly. Only *.txt is causing problems<br />

            Are you sharing the user templates and startup folders between the two versions? They should be separated - see
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/Toolbars_in_word_2007.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/Toolbars_in_word_2007.htm
</a>- or they will conflict.<br />
<br />
Having created and assigned separate folders - see <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/what_to_do_when_word_crashes.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.gmayor.com/what_to_do_when_word_crashes.htm </a><br />
<br />
I would then suggest re-registering Word 2000 (which should fix its registry entries) , and then having done so, if you want Word 2010 to be the default re-register Word 2010.<br />

            <p><span>Installation folders are separated during the installation.</span></p>
<p><span>Template and start-up folders are separate.<br />
Re-registration does not solve the problem.<br />
Originally I had both Word 2000 and 2010 crashing in the same way - while opening text files. I have fixed word 2010 crash by assigning all winword keys in the Registry to Word 2010 (they were at random before).<br />
What is peculiar with this simplest of documents formats - text, that is crashing Word? Word does NOT crash on anything else.</span></p>

<p><span>I have discovered, that the parallel installation of MS Office 2000 (32-bit) and MS Office 2010 64-bit works for me without a glitch. Both Words are opening text files and I can separate what files will be opened by either
 Word 2000 (doc, etc) and by Word 2010 (docx, etc).</span></p>
<p><span>I tried the same with 2010 32 bit version and both Words are crashing on text files every time.</span></p>
<p><span>I have observed several other differences when 2010 64bit is installed instead of 32bit - differences in favour of 64 bit version.</span></p>
<p><span>OS = Win 7 64 Ultimate.</span></p>

            Although I don't have the solution, the clue to your error is in the line:
<div>
<div><span>Faulting module path: C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ntdll.dll</span></div>
<div>This is the 32-bit handler dll in Windows 7 64-bit and if you search Google, there are thousands of such errors reported. It is not a Word problem but a&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;problem that effects many applications. You may elicit a more authoritative answer by posting
 the question in the Windows Forum.</div>
<div><span>Are both Windows and Office patched fully up to date? </span></div>
<div><span>Sorry I cannot help better than that and other than say I use&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;7 x64 with 32-bit Office without seeing the&nbsp;</span><span>SysWOW64\ntdll.dll bug.</span></div>

            <p>I assume your 2000 is&nbsp;32 bit? I am surprised. It is my understanding that we can't run mixed 32 and 64 bit Office installations.
</p>
<p>I am not too surprised that there aren't many other people with similar installations, 2000 is pretty far back.</p>
<p>What sort of "other differences"? I'm interested since the official "party line" is that the primary&nbsp;difference is ability to handle larger files.</p>
<p>I am not surprised that there are differences. When you recompile for 64-bt there are times when you have to make code changes, especially in the "older", "legacy" code.</p>

            <p><span>Surprise, so far Office 2000 (32-bit) + 2010 (64bit) works without a glitch for me.
<br />
They are both fully up-to-date.</span></p>
<p><span>The major difference between mixed Office 2000 and 2010-32bit and 64 bit is in Default Programs -&gt; extensions, where</span></p>
<p><span>I can see two versions of Word when I try Word 2000 + Word2010-64bit combination and only one version of Word with 2000 + 2010-32bit. This is probably a clue why they have trouble to coexist.</span></p>
<p><span>Long documents?? I had some issues with Word 6 in old days and 200+page documents split in subsections (Long Document feature). Since Word 2000 I have not seen any problems.<br />
Why do I stick to Word 2000? - This is a separate issue. </span></p>
<p><span>(MS Office 2000 was, in my opinion, the best Microsoft Office released, and MS Office 4.3 was not bad either)</span></p>

    <title>E72 keeps asking for type of connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmxman  say:</h3>
<h2>            E72 keeps asking for type of connection</h2>
                    
<p>Every time I take my keylock off, the phone id asking me to "select connection" between "search for WLAN", "Internet" or " WAP services." Seems to make no difference to the operation of the phone whichever I select, or if I click Cancel</p>
<p>This only appears every 10 mins or so, and I've tried looking for an app wanting this, or any that are set to always ask, but no joy</p>
<p>Help- it's really winding me up, and I've only had it 3 weeks!!!</p>

<p>How can I tell what's triggering the never ending connection prompts or how I dissble them? This is on a fully updated E72 (051.018)</p>
<p>It even asks when in "Disconnected" mode, really annoying :smileysad:</p>

<p>I guess there's no general answer to your question/problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I would do is simply to go through the applications you have installed and see what settings you have for internet access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have set the e-mail to poll every 10min without a default access point (and therefore it asks you), or some weather app, or podcasting, or who knows what.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just go through the settings of your applications and hopefully you'll find the app that is trying to connect.</p>

<h2>            Some pictures won&#39;t load.____</h2>
                    I know this problem has been on here a lot, but I thought my specific problem might require a different approach. Anyway, some of the pictures from certain sites won't show up. They have a red x. However, if I hit refresh it usually fixes it, but its a
 pain. Also, MSN homepage always misses loading the first picture at the top on the slideshow when it hasn't been opened in a while. Any help?

<p>But the same site is not available in MSN, does it means we put a seperate request to inclusion in MSN? (if there is an option of inclusion available).</p>
<p>Anyone here can suggest us some points regards MSN inclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi david,</p>
<p>i understand that the link to team site is missing in the following page. to add it back (add a new tile), you can click manage &gt; add a promoted site &gt; enter title and link location (team site url, e.g.
<a href="https://contoso.sharepoint.com/)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://contoso.sharepoint.com/)</a>&nbsp;&gt; click
<strong>click here&nbsp;</strong>to end editing.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>Sorry for not being clear in my last post. To manage the tiles, we need to have
<strong>SharePoint admin or Global admin rights</strong>. You can share the article below with your organization admin and let them add the team site link.</p>

<p>Hi Ryan, thx I am the admin for our company. I follow you but I still don't see the "manage" option.</p>
<p>1st I should say that we were trying to clear the "sites I'm following" when this happened, but in the end the site and this option " to manage" was missing.</p>
<p>In addition we found our home page would not launch. I can find the home (team) page if I enter it in the search field.
</p>
<p>but thats as far as I can go. </p>
<p>Good news is we haven't launched yet. (if I need to start (reset) again the home page, &nbsp;it is not a large problem</p>
<p>thx for the help &nbsp; </p>
        </p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>Can you try another browser (e.g., IE/Chrome/Firefox) to see if the Manage the promoted site function appears? And also check if this function appears using another global admin account.</p>
<p>If both of them do not work, please let us know.</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t sign into Classic Skype v.7.41.0.101</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Currently on Windows 8.1, Skype updated itself to skype App v8.18.0.6. Despite being signed on "green" I appear offline to my contacts.</p>
<p>After reading through all comments from the Skype support team I uninstalled Skype App v8 and installed Classic Skype&nbsp;v7.41.0.101 but I can't manage to sign in despite correct skype username and password. However I can sign into my Skype account.</p>
<p>Why can I sign in to skype App v8.18.0.6 and NOT Classic Skype v.7.41.0.101? I want to keep on using Classic Skype not Skype App.</p>
<p>Could you please help as it is so frustrating! Thanks</p>

<p>I had no message error just kept on going backing to the sign-in screen to re-enter the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have finally found the issue. My Internet Explorer was partially working on 64-bit. Checked the IE Settings\About Version Explorer\Tools\Internet Options\Advanced\Security and ticked "Enable 64-bit processors for Enhanced Protected Mode" and also
 "Enable enhanced Protected Mode" and restarted the computer... tried again to sign into&nbsp;<span>Skype&nbsp;</span><span>7.41.0.101 and ... it worked!&nbsp;</span><span>I have found out that this Classic Skype does not allow to turn off the
 automatic updates at present what was possible in the previous versions. Could this option be re-instated?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Still need some help though!</span> Why have I lost all IM history despite having the "keep history "forever" box ticked in Classic Skype
</span><span>Skype&nbsp;</span><span>7.41.0.101</span><span>? How I can retrieve the IM history? This is not the case in Skype App 8.18.0.6 as the IM history for each contact is still there.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Can we also download both Skype App and Classic Skype on the same computer and have 2 icons or the lastest skype (App) will take over classic skype&nbsp;?</span></span></span></p>

                    <p>Okay, so on a Mater Slide in Powerpoint (2013) you can insert a picture placeholder on the master slide then click on it to change the picture on the individual slides.&nbsp; Can you do this in Publisher?&nbsp; I would like to use the picture placeholder on my Master,
 but then in the normal view be able to click on it and change the photo like you can in Powerpoint.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions, I would think if you can do it on Masters in one you would be able to do it in Masters on the other?</p>

            <p>The only way to change a picture on the Master Page in Publisher is to change to Master Page view. It cannot be changed from the normal view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can have multiple master pages. You can put a picture in the background on the main page. Though Publisher does not work like PP, there may be a way to do what you want. Tell us the specifics of what you are trying to accomplish and perhaps someone here
 will be able to give you a method using Publisher.</p>

<h3> origami1212  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to tell Outlook to auto-download pictures from a mailing list&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Many newsletters today use mailing services that send each issue of the newsletter from a different domain. E.g., for the Wired newsletter:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>WIRED &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;; on behalf of; WIRED &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</strong></em></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><em><strong>WIRED &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;; on behalf of; WIRED &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</strong></em></p>
<p>are separate issues on separate days.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em><strong>Add the Domain @domain to Safe Senders List</strong></em> option (from the
<em><strong>Click here to download pictures </strong></em>dialog at the top of the email in the reading pane does not work. Neither does a similar dialog to "add the newsletter @..." which I found from the "<em><strong>Tell me what you want to do</strong></em>"
 search on the Outlook menu bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to tell Outlook to auto-download pictures from such "on behalf of" mailing lists?</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To address your concern, please follow the steps below on how to unblock automatic picture downloads.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the File tab, choose <strong>Options </strong>&gt; <strong>Trust Center</strong>.</li><li>Under Microsoft Outlook Trust Center, click <strong>Trust Center Settings</strong>.</li><li>Clear the<strong> Don't download pictures automatically in HTML e-mail messages
</strong>or<strong> RSS</strong> items check box.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Unblock picture downloads for all messages from a particular email address or domain.<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>In an open message that was sent from a particular email address or domain, right-click a blocked item.</li><li>Do one of the following:<br />
<br />
Click <strong>Add Sender to Safe Senders List</strong>.<br />
<br />
Click <strong>Add the Domain @domain to Safe Senders List</strong>.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply, but this DOES NOT solve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to blanket unblock ALL automatic picture downloads. I still want to have a choice so I don't allow just anybody (e.g., spammers) to download pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the two "Click to Add" solutions that you propose don't work for domains where part of the domain name is a serial number to distinguish between various issues of a periodic newsletter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do is to:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1. allow a user such as: "<em><strong>wired.com@&lt;wildcard&gt;.rsgsv.net"</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>OR</strong></em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2. specify a domain such as "<em><strong>rsgsv.net</strong></em>" and have that allow "<em><strong>&lt;wildcard&gt;.</strong></em><em><strong>rsgsv.net"</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This kind of newsletter seems to be growing increasingly popular; it seems like there should be a mechanism to allow it.</p>
<p>TIA</p>

            <p>The instructions at the link provided DID NOT SOLVE the problem. Let me restate the issue since clearly people have not been understanding what I am trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that while the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>root domain</strong></em></span> remains the same, the
<p>One day the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>subdomain</strong></em></span>&nbsp;might be&nbsp;<em><strong>&nbsp;"</strong></em><em><strong>mail16.atl111.rsgsv.net"</strong></em>&nbsp;as in "<em><strong>WIRED
 &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;; on behalf of; WIRED &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</strong></em>"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>and the next day it might be:&nbsp;<em><strong>&nbsp;"</strong></em><em><strong>mail148.atl221.rsgsv.net</strong></em><em><strong>"</strong></em>&nbsp;as in "<em><strong>WIRED &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;;
 on behalf of; WIRED &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</strong></em>"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The suggested solutions apply to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em><strong>subdomain</strong></em></span>&nbsp;names and thus will not work for a newsletter that is sent using this method. They would only permit future newsletters from the same
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do is to instruct Outlook to automatically display pictures from a root domain (e.g., "<em><strong>rsgsv.net</strong></em>") and have it allow all
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">and </span></em>"<em><strong>mail148.atl221.rsgsv.net</strong></em>"
<em><strong>subdomains</strong></em></span> of that root <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
(</span>i.e., "<em><strong>&lt;wildcard&gt;.</strong></em><em><strong>rsgsv.net</strong></em>").</p>
<p>
</p><p>More and more newsletters are being sent using this method (of varying the subdomain of the sender for each issue) and it is a real nuisance to have to manually ask each issue to display pictures. I am not so lazy that I am complaining about the
 extra clicks, I am complaining about the time that it takes when one is trying to skim through a bunch of emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help me with this I will be most grateful.</p>
<p>

    <title>MS Access - How to set the data type in Column alias - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MS Access - How to set the data type in Column alias</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have created a table named&nbsp;XYZTable and&nbsp;I named the columns in XYZTable as Column1, Column2 etc (The skeleton of table).<br />
<br />
I have a file which is the combination of several tables and it has more than 400000 records. The values in some record types in Column2 and Column3 are more than 300 characters in text file, and I need all the values to be imported into table without truncation&nbsp;.
 So I have changed the data type to 'Long Text' (Memo) for all the columns in XYZTable to accept the data when importing the text file into MS Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have separated the records into several tables based on the type of record using where clause.
</p>
<p><strong>Eg:</strong> </p>
<p><em>- Select Column1, Column2, Column3 into Table1 from&nbsp;XYZTable where Column1= 'Record1'</em></p>
<p><em>- Select&nbsp;Column1, Column2&nbsp;into Table2 from&nbsp;XYZTable where Column1= 'Record2'</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>My scenario is to do the validation to check whether all the values from Column2 of Table1&nbsp;are present in Column3 of Table2. I have used Joins to get the result faster as it deals with lakhs of records.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Query used</p>
<p><em>- SELECT A.Column2&nbsp;FROM Table1&nbsp;AS A Left JOIN Table2&nbsp;AS B on A.Column2&nbsp;= B.Column3&nbsp;where B.Column3&nbsp;IS NULL</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Following error is displayed on running the query.</p>
<p>'Cannot join on Memo, Hyperlink or OLE object. <em>A.</em>Column2&nbsp;<em>=&nbsp;</em><em>B</em><em>.</em>Column3)'</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Table1 and Table2, the values in Column2 and Column3 are not greater than 100 characters. So is it possible to change the data type to 'Short Text' using alias when moving the required records to Table1?</p>
<p><em>Select Column1, Column2, Column3 into Table1 from&nbsp;XYZTable where Column1= 'Record1'</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is there any other way to handle Long text? Could you please help me to sort out this issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Btw, there are a variety of functions that will have the same effect as the Left function. &nbsp;The idea is perform the comparison on converted strings instead of directly on the Memo field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will work as well, without the 100 character limitation on the length of the strings being compared:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">SELECT <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
DISTINCT</span>&nbsp;A.<span>Column2&nbsp;</span>FROM Table1 AS A Left JOIN Table2 AS B on cstr(A.<span>Column2&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span>&amp; "") &nbsp; = &nbsp;cstr("" &amp; B.<span>Column3</span>) where B.<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Column3&nbsp;</span>IS
 NULL</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">(but again, if the data length is usually going to be less than 100, I would simply convert the field to Text, 250 or similar... keeping it text with allowance for some longer entries.)</p>

<p>
</p><p>To return rows from Table1 with no match in Table2 you might try this:<br />
<br />
SELECT A.Column2 <br />
FROM Table1 AS A <br />
WHERE NOT EXISTS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT *<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM Table2 AS B <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE B.Column3 = A.Column2);<br />
<br />
As far as I can see, from trying this in Access 2007 at least, memo (long text) fields can in principle be used to correlate a subquery in this way, though whether the length of text in them will make any difference I cannot say.&nbsp; Interestingly it also seems
 to work if the column in one table is Text data type, and that in the other is Memo data type.<br />
<br />
However you do it performance is likely to be inhibited when comparing memo fields because of the inability to use the indexes. &nbsp;<br />

</p><p>A JOIN cannot be made on memo fields, but I can successfully correlate a subquery with an outer query on memo fields.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>My understanding is that JOIN works by using the Indexes defined on the field - and Memo fields cannot be indexed. No index = no join.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since a Memo field could be millions or billions of bytes long, I think this is not a surprising restriction.</p>

            I can't reproduce the error in Access 2007.&nbsp; It may be that the Long Text data type in 2013 differs from a memo field in earlier versions other than its renaming.

<h2>            New update process - UUP, we need the speed and ESD we had back&#33;</h2>
                    &nbsp;Before Microsoft came out with this new UUP (Universal Update Program), updates to new builds went significantly faster and provided us with ESD files we could use to install on multiple systems.&nbsp; While it's significantly better in 15014 than it was in
 15007 and before, it's definitely a step backwards as it currently is.&nbsp; This is not progress, it's a step backwards.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to give us back the speed and capability we had before.&nbsp; UUP may make things better for MS, but it's sure a step backward
 for Insiders.&nbsp; I sure hope they either fix it or give us an option to go back to the old way of upgrading to new builds.&nbsp;
