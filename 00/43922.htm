<h2>            Surface Book 2 Random shut down&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I bought brand new Surface Book 2 ( pre- ordered the minute it opened and received on 16th November). The laptop keeps randomly shutting down, sometimes even while I am working on it. I also had issue with booting the laptop back with the power button (happened
 3 times in 2 days) and had to start the laptop by holding the power button for an elongated duration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did complete reset of the laptop but the problem persists. I love the built and design. But this is unacceptable for such a costly product. Please provide fix. Else will have to return this unreliable product.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I don't get any error message. The laptop just shuts down abruptly. I have had more than 10 instances of random shutdown over 2 days. A&nbsp;couple of times I was using youtube, or browsing on edge. Thrice it shutdown right after logging
 me (within 5 seconds).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as mentioned, sometime there is a issue&nbsp;with turning the laptop on. the button on the top doesn't work with a short press and i had to turn the laptop on by holding the button for a longer time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned, I did a complete reset of the laptop but the problem persists. If you think its a hardware issue, can you please help process a replacement order. Customer service has been horrible and unresponsive throughout the day.</p>
        </p>

<p>I find it funny (sadly so) that the only resolution is to take it to a physical store.&nbsp; As if that is a convenient option for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>I'm having this same issue and based on this level of support, will be returning mine and going back to my Thinkpad.</p>

<p>I, too, have a new Surface Book 2 that has shut down on its own, seemingly with no pattern. &nbsp; I'd had earlier problems with freezes&nbsp; and the screen not shutting off that I'd written off as my inexperience with Windows, but I agree, when you spend so much
 for a piece of equipment, you expect consistent performance.&nbsp; It's a really beautiful piece of hardware that I am still just exploring, but the fact that I have talked to people at the Microsoft store who have had their Surface devices replaced two and three
 times is really giving me pause.</p>

<p>After a week of use, I just had the same issue. Was using it with only a few apps open: Word, Chrome and Whatsapp. Went for a short walk and when I came back the entire machine seemed dead - hard to get working again - needed toi press down for 30 seconds
 or so to get a reaction. Interestingly, Word seemed to have been closed, Chrome gave message of random shutdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First Surface, Microsoft and Windows product in years - hope it does not happen again as it shakes confidence in an otherwise fine product.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Random shutdown can be associated with several issues: it can be heat related, failing hardware, issues with Windows, and it can be because of a virus or malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, we suggest that you run the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong>
 - this tool will automatically identify common Surface issues and it will try to repair them for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will also help to make sure to install all&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023505/surface-install-surface-and-windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface and Windows updates</a></strong>, or if you have other pending
 updates, try to restart your Surface device to let the updates push through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have other questions or concerns, please let us know.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 cannot update, I have tried everything.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to update windows 10 for like 6 months now, my computer restarts 2-3 times every day to try and install the updates. I am trying to use this computer for mining and of course it is pretty pointless when my computer can't stay on very long.
 Every time I wake up or come home from work my computer is on the blue screen asking me to chose a keyboard layout. I have read multiple forum posts and tried every single one of them, I have spent total probably close to 100 hours just trying to update this
 computer. My computer is an ASUS GL502V. The latest thing I have tried is everything on this list (besides the last which is reformat my computer).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing the second to last one It now cleared my update history so I cannot even see what version I am running. I do not run any antivirus besides the windows defender. I am now getting a message after trying to install the update that microsoft will
 start not supporting my version soon since it is so old. I tried manually doing the creators update, I have manually installing the next update I need, tried running crazy command commands to try and reset updates, tried the update troubleshooter, all sorts
 of things...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do now? I really do not want to reformat my computer.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,
<br />More details needed. You said you get greeted with Choose keyboard layout-that means the update has been successfully installed. So when you do a restart, does that undo the changes?
<br />Assuming the update to be Feature update to Windows 10 1803

<p>Here is exactly what happens every time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your computer is ready to install updates, restart now to complete</li><li>I click restart now</li><li>It says you are bout to be signed out</li><li>Then it says restarting</li><li>I now see the Asus ROG loading screen</li><li>It now says please choose your keyboard layout</li><li>I choose US</li><li>It now says chose an option</li><li>I choose Continue to Windows</li><li>I now see the ROG symbol again as it loads</li><li>Then it goes to the desktop screen</li></ol>
<p>Before when I went to the windows updates history it would either say failed, or most of the time showing no record of anything happening. Now after trying the site I linked in the original post, it will never show me my history, just says "No updates have
 been installed yet".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of the probably 500 times doing this, sometimes it would say update failed going to a previous version, sometimes it would do just like I listed above, some updates would actually work but most won't. I believe I was at version 1709 but I can't be sure.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,
<br />Looks like the PC is on version 1703 and PC is trying to update to 1709.
<br />
<br />Would like to look at Rollback logs.
<br />
<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.
<br />
<br />You can use any file sharing website to send the files to me.

<p>How do I share the files, and which files do you want, there is 10 files in the rollback folder and 3 more folders, the panther folder has like 20 files.</p>

            There are very limited options left now.
<br />You would have to start over by doing a clean install or a fresh install that would remove all your existing applications and files(you can move the files to other drive so that they are not lost)

    <title>Can&#39;t run as administrator from User account. Says &#34;needs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ada-adam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t run as administrator from User account. Says &#34;needs permission from SYSTEM&#34; when making changes to certain files.</h2>
                    <p>When using the standard user account on the computer, "Run as administrator" does not work on ANY program or shortcut. Also when trying to do ANYTHING that would normally prompt for an administrators password results in a error message saying I need permission
 from "SYSTEM" to make changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not as simple as just changing the owner of the file to the user. In fact I get an error when trying that route as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read just about all forums I could find on the issue and all seem to have to problem where they can't delete certain files until they either boot into safe mode or change the permissions on the particular file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I am having effects everything within the user account. Cannot access UAC. Cannot run anything as admin including CMD. Can't even install/update without logging out of the standard user account and logging into the admin account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything, however, seems to be working ok from the admin account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this? Change the permissions globally for the whole account? Possible corrupt system file?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! This has happened a few times on different machines in my office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Two user accounts. &nbsp;- 1 admin and 1 standard user. (problem only seems to be on the standard user account)</p>

<p>
</p><p>I had disabled the UAC in the Admin account on the computers as that account is only used to make changes to the computer such as install or update programs. Typically I would update many programs at a time so it became very annoying having to click allow
 every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enabling the UAC from the Admin account fixed the issue on the standard account.&nbsp;</p>

            I have installed Steam thinking this may help. No dice. Why does it seem so complicated when it used to be so simple. Do I need to buy the steam version of the 2000 program ??&nbsp; All I want to do is fly again, that's all. Thanks, NAM VET 67

<h2>            Magic Jigsaw Puzzles</h2>
                    Magic Jigsaw Puzzles keeping jamming because the ads are getting stuck. I notice ACT ON, GOOGLE and MERCEDES ads were jamming today and possibly more.&nbsp; I love this game, but I had to delete the app about 6 months ago because of this issue.&nbsp; I recently
 downloaded it again to try it&nbsp;but the issue is still not fixed.&nbsp; I play this on&nbsp; a Windows 10 laptop.

<p>Hi Virginia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could be some changes (Windows Update, software installation) on your computer that causes the issue. Compatibility could also be the reason why the issue with the ads on the game is happening. However, let us not assume anything yet until we isolated
 your concern. Can you provide us the answers to these questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried to replicate the issue through other games?</li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps you've tried to resolve the issue?</li><li>Have you tried replicating the issue using other device?</li><li>Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>
        </p>

<p>I have other Microsoft games and do not have this issue.</p>
<p>I have downloaded all updates to Windows 10 and also to the games.</p>
<p>I previously had a different laptop with Windows 10 and had the same issue.</p>
<p>No changes were made to this computer and I have always had this issue,</p>

            This is a 4 TByte disk that requires a GPT partition table. MBR partition tables can only cope with disks up to 2 TBytes. Is your BIOS set to&nbsp;<em>Legacy</em> or

<p>I have no experience with such large disks but I have a vague recollection that Windows 7 can access half the capacity, i.e. 2 TBytes. I would connect it to a Windows 10 PC, then initialise it as an MBR disk and format it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Windows 10 you can convert an MBR disk to GPT with the command MBR2GPT.exe. On the only Windows 7 PC I have access to, I was unable to find this command. Maybe the conversion is not possible under Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seeing that Microsoft will stop supporting Windows 7 in January 2020, you might consider doing a fresh installation of Windows 10 right now. This would solve your problem in a neat way. Make sure to set your BIOS to UEFI rather than "Legacy" boot mode before
 you start.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Since it is under warranty check with ASUStek Support, their on-line documentation |<br />
and drivers, diagnostics, and ask in their forums about any known issues. Keep in
<br />
mind the more you do the more they will say it is something you have done. They<br />
will want to revert the system back to the out-of-the-box state so have backups <br />
made off the Windows drive (best on removable media) and be prepared to re-install<br />
the programs.<br />

<br />
===============================================================<br />
<br />
<div>
<p>Could be heat related - try using a small fan to blow into the air intakes to see if that helps.<br />
Does it just act like it loses power or does it shutdown in a normal manner? Keep in mind<br />
that heat related does not always mean too much heat as often it is a part or component<br />
which is too sensitive to even normal levels of heat.<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power&nbsp;-&nbsp;remove the dust bunnies and clean&nbsp;the vents. Check that the fans work&nbsp;<br />
for a &nbsp;laptop about all you can do is reseat the memory and clean the vents (try adding a small<br />
fan as a test).<br />
<br />
This sounds like hardware so if the above does not help then you probably need the help of a real
<br />
computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a Best Buy or other Big Box Stores) or the System Maker's
<br />
Support.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Frankly you should work with ASUStek however if you really want to try to troubleshoot the issue<br />
(which I don't recommend on a new computer under warranty).<br />
<br />
Resolving stop (blue screen) errors in Windows 7 - has a section for if you can or can't start Windows.<br />

We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the SkyDrive or other file<br />
sharing sites. You need to try to solve or reduce the issues - when there are that many
<br />
different Bug_Check hardware is usually involved.<br />
<br />
Zip or upload the contents of C:\Windows\minidump</p>
<p>Use SkyDrive to upload collected files <br />

Also do this so you can see the likely bluescreens.<br />

Windows Vista automatically restarts if your PC encounters an error that causes it to crash.<br />
(also Windows 7)<br />

<br />
===========================================================</p>
<p>Check with these utilities to see if any information can be gathered :<br />
<br />
This is an excellent tool for posting Blue Screen Error Information<br />
<br />
<strong>BlueScreenView</strong> - Free -&nbsp;scans all your minidump files created during 'blue screen of death' crashes,<br />
and displays the information about all crashes in one table.<br />

<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
MyEventViewer can be checked at the time of the BlueScreen (BSOD) to within a second or so of the<br />
time of the BSOD to provide more information as to possible cause - see TIP.<br />
<br />
<strong>MyEventViewer</strong> - Free -&nbsp;a simple alternative to the standard event viewer of Windows.<br />
<strong>TIP</strong> - Options - Advanced Filter allows you to see a time frame instead of the whole file -<br />
set it to a bit before and&nbsp;after the time of the BSOD.<br />

<p><strong>AppCrashView </strong>- Free -&nbsp;a small utility for Windows Vista and Windows 7 that displays the details of all<br />
application crashes occurred in your system. The crashes information is extracted from the .wer<br />
files created by the Windows Error Reporting (WER) component of the operating system every<br />
time that a crash is occurred. AppCrashView also allows you to easily save the crashes list to<br />

<p>Hello, I am following your advise after sevreral crash with bluescreen on my DELL Optiplex 990 (Windows 7). I don t know if it is related or not but the problem seems to occur since I added 4Gb RAM memory (4Gb -&gt;8Gb).</p>
<p>I have zipped all the mini dump files + Msinfo to this link :</p>
<p>http://1drv.ms/1hbx4Cx</p>
<p>I should add that up to now the crash happens while the PC is in the "save mode" (mode veille) and not while in use.
</p>
<p>Thank you for helping to find out the cause of the crash. </p>

</p><p>Based on your post for having an issue with the blurred screen, we would to confirm which of the following are possible cause of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried open an app on a display with a high resolution and&nbsp;then move the app to another display that has a different resolution?&nbsp;</li><li>Have you tried docking the laptop or tablet to a display that has a different resolution, and then you project in
<strong>Second screen only</strong> mode?</li><li>Have you tried connect remotely&nbsp;to another PC, and the display for the PC you’re connecting to has a different resolution than the one you’re connecting from?&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If apps appear blurry on your Surface device, you may try the steps below might help fix the issue:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do one of the following, depending on whether you're prompted with&nbsp;"Fix apps that are blurry?"
</p>
<ul>
<li>If the prompt appears, select <strong>Yes, open Settings</strong>, and then select
<strong>Apply</strong>. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>If the prompt doesn’t appear, select the <strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;button &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Display</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced scaling settings</strong>&nbsp;(under
<strong>Scale and layout</strong>).&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the <strong>Advanced scaling settings</strong> window, turn on the&nbsp;<strong>Let Windows try to fix apps so they’re not blurry</strong>&nbsp;option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check whether Windows can fix the problem, close a desktop app that appears blurry on your main display&nbsp;and then open it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted so we can assist you further.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
It's not recommended to use a system image created on a different device. That being said, you should be able to boot from the image and install it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Option 1: Start from a bootable USB device when Surface is off</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Attach a bootable USB device to the USB port</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Press and hold the volume-down (-) rocker</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>-<strong>&nbsp; </strong>Press and release the power button</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; When the Surface logo appears, release the volume rocker. Surface will start the software on your USB device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Option 2: Start from a bootable USB device when Surface is on</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Attach a bootable USB device to the USB port</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Swipe in from the right edge of the screen and tap <em>Settings</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Tap or click <em>Change PC Settings</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Tap or click <em>Update and recovery</em>, and then tap or click <em>Recovery</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Under <em>Advanced Startup</em>, tap or click <em>Restart now</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; On the <em>Choose an option</em> screen, tap or click <em>Use a device</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; </em>On the <em>Troubleshoot screen</em>, tap or click <em>Advanced options</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>-&nbsp; On the <em>Advanced options</em> screen, tap or click the name of the USB device. Your Surface should restart and boot from the USB device.</p>

<p>Hi Rajendra,<br />
<br />
This could be due to recent changes on your computer. To further isolate this issue, kindly verify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did the issue start?</li><li>Any recent changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done to resolve the issue?</li><li>Have you recently performed Windows Update?<br />
</li></ul>
<p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>1. I had purchased this dell laptop 2 years back with windows 8 installed. But I did not use so long. I started using 2 months back. When I started using there were 57 updates which were installed. As I remember this issue started after update.</p>
<p>2. Thinking it might be keyboard issue I contacted Dell support as it is under extended warranty. They took 15 days. I shuttled between software team and hardware team who were giving contradictory statements. Finally they performed some test with passkey
 keyboard test software and said it is not a keyboard issue. They informed that some patch will come from Microsoft and only then issue will be resolved.
</p>
<p>3. Dell had also advised to install windows again and I did that but issue remains.</p>
<p>4. I also contacted Microsoft answer tech. One of technician took remote control and he updated some HID driver from Dell's site and issue was resolved. But next day same issue started again.</p>
<p>5. It will be worthwhile to mention that with external USB keyboard and right shift key there is no issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is all what I did to resolve. I searched google but could not get proper solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a non technical person. But this issue is causing working issues.</p>

            To further isolate this issue, have you tried reinstalling the <strong>HID driver</strong> from the manufacturer's website? If the issue persists, we recommend reinstalling the driver while your PC is in

<p><span>My platform: ordinary PC, Windows XP, Home User, SP3 installed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Trying to update Java (6 -&gt; 7), or Adobe Reader X ( -&gt; 10.1.4): installation aborts, (translated from Danish: “…running Windows in protected, fail-safe mode, [which I am not] or defective installation of Windows

<p><span>The file C:\\Windows\System32\msiexec.exe /V<span>&nbsp;

<p>Hi Az oldguy, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And a few variants on Microsoft fora. Still no cure.</span></p>
<p><span>I reckoned that I have a defect somewhere in my Registry.</span></p>
<p><span>I then registered and paid for the commercial “RegCure Pro</span>”</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Diagnosed and fixed with this (several rounds) to be sure.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But I am stuck with this Installer error. Yours Ole H.<br />

<p><b><u><span>Here's how to<span>&nbsp;
</span>make a bootable xp recovery console cd</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>Courtesy of JoseIbarra
</span></p>
<p><span>You need to start by booting into the XP Recovery Console using a CD you can make (no XP media required) and run a chkdsk with error correction
 enough times until it runs clean and if that doesn't work, you can create a new boot.ini file (it is usually one of those two things).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here's how:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Use the XP Recovery Console to verify the file system on your HDD and correct any problems&nbsp;and then try to boot your system - this may be
 all you need to do. &nbsp;Or, you are welcome to&nbsp;just start trying things that might work.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Boot into the Windows Recovery Console using a bootable XP installation CD.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure what you have (no XP
 media required).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</span></p>
<p><span>rc.iso&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the ISO file from here:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</span></p>
<p><span>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments
 are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Press any key to boot from CD...</span></p>
<p><span>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</span></p>
<p><span>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</span></p>
<p><span>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</span></p>
<p><span>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</span></p>
<p><span>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted
 drive.</span></p>
<p><span>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</span></p>
<p><span>chkdsk C: /r</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient.&nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is
 doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Thank You Elizabeth23 for engaging in my XP Windows Installer problem. Which remain unsolved, alas.<br />
I <u>did</u> make a bootable XP Repair Console C for the chkdsk job.<br />
I could succeed in performing only CHDSK c: from the fail-safe Windows mode (i.e. without the repair argumant :-( &nbsp; It performed all steps and said "c: errors in 0 sectors", and no other errors detected.<br />
The chkdsk c: WITH the /r argument requires a true program run from the CD, That proved impossible because the blue errorscreen appeared with pci.sys repported as program error :-(<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before and after the PC is working with mail, internet, and other daily jobs.
<br />
Only <b>installer</b> and <b>pci.sys</b> (maybe ?) are on strike. The PC is not updated (JAVA, Adobe, Win)....<br />
<br />
Sincely<br />
Ole H.<br />

            Dear Elizabeth<br />
<br />
Truly grateful to have a rapid, sympathetic answer! Accomplishing the tasks is not straightforward :-(<br />
1) I should gladly "unmark question as answered" but in&nbsp; the reply field i have only:<br />
reply//Reply with quote//Report abuse. No "unmark" option visible<br />
2) I entered Your SkyDrive domain: Impressive; I saw a virtual "cupboard" with 29 labelled areas, mostly gray,. But lost in front of this "cupboard" could not discern appropriate single files to copy/paste as the recipe said ?<br />
Thanks again<br />
Ole Heltberg<br />

            <p>in the reply that is marked Answered is the place to mark unanswered, only you can see this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>skydrive, if you look to the upper right, you can change the view to list versus the boxes,that will make it easier to see as they should be alphabetical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>once you select a file, look on top and there will be a download selection, proceed from there with instructions in previous reply. :)</p>

<h2>            Surface Book making buzzing noise</h2>
                    <p>Recently purchased a Microsoft Surface i7 w/ Performance base no more than around a week ago, extremely happy with it although I seem to be experiencing a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep on getting a buzzing noise each time the fan starts to work, I'm assuming its something loose inside vibrating, doesn't seem to affect the performance but I don't exactly want to have to put up with the fault given how new and expensive it is. This
 noise only came about recently and was never apparent throughout the first few days of using it.</p>

<h3> forester101  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB4013214 Failed to install - Error 0x80070643</h2>
                    I'm running Version 1607 build 14393.1358. 64 bit<br />
<br />
Another update which installed broke iCloud working with Office 2007 - this has been reported elsewhere. In order to get things working again I had to do a system restore to roll back a couple of weeks. All the other updates have reinstalled again ok apart
 from KB4013214 which gives a failed to install - Error 0x80070643 every time I reboot the machine.<br />
<br />
To also note although I'm sure not related is that after I did the system restore I also decided to upgrade Office so uninstalled 2007 and installed 2016 pro. That all installed fine and is working including the iCloud link.<br />
<br />
These are the updates installed on my machine...<br />
<br />
How do I fix it? Thanks

            <p>I don't believe this is correct. I have two Windows 10 systems. One has the booklet style available in the .NET Windows Printing Control and one does not. I tried setting the default browser to Internet Explorer on the system without, but the result was
 unchanged. The option disappeared from the control about two months ago but remains on the Microsoft Surface Pro.. Software on both systems is fully up to date.</p>

<h2>            Streets of Rage 2&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So, a while back I bought the full version of Streets of Rage 2, and it was on my Xbox for quite some time. Yesterday, I was going to try to play it and when I turned it on, it started the game, but wouldn't let me do a multiplayer game. It said to unlock
 the full version in order to do that. I had already bought the full version, so I figured I'll just go to my download history and download it again. I did, started the game again, and the same thing happened.<br />
<br />
Then, I figure, well, maybe I'll just delete it completely and re-download it from the marketplace. Bad decision. I delete the game, and look for it in the marketplace only to see it's gone COMPLETELY from the marketplace. Now, all there is is a Streets of
 Rage collection with the first and second game.<br />
<br />
Are they allowed to do this? Just take a game off of XBL that people have already purchased and are supposed to own? I want my Microsoft points back for it NOW. Either that, or put the game back up. This is unbelievable.</p>

<p>Here's a link to the page for SoR 2, where there is no option to download it, or anything else for that matter.</p>
<p><a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Streets-of-Rage-2/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8025841086d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Streets-of-Rage-2/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8025841086d</a></p>

<p>Sorry I forgot to say how to do it. On your 360, go to settings, then account management then download history. You made be able to download it again from there.</p>

<p>Also, yes, they are allowed to remove content from the marketplace. Content can be removed for several reasons and is usually removed because of licensing issues with the developers.

<p>No. I went to my download history when I first had the problem. When I finally found it in my massive list, I went to it only to find that there was no option to download again.</p>
<p>Streets of Rage 2 doesn't exist on the XBL marketplace anymore, so this leads me to believe it's been taken down completely.</p>

<p>Are you sure this is the account you purchased it on?&nbsp; The best option is go through your download history here at Xbox.com:
<a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-GB/Download/History" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://live.xbox.com/Download/History</a><br />
<br />
Use the filter on the left to change to 'Arcade Game'.&nbsp; The list will then populate with all of the arcade games you have purchased via LIVE, whether they are still on the Marketplace or not.&nbsp; I purchased Streets of Rage 2 back in 2007 and it's on my download
 history to download again.<br />
<br />
To download a game from the list, click 'Add to Queue'.&nbsp; It will download to your console the next time you connect to Xbox LIVE.<br />
<br />
It was de-listed from the marketplace because it has been re released as compilation along with the original Streets of Rage and SoR3.</p>

<p>Hello Todd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A stop error (also called a "blue screen" error) can occur if a problem causes your PC to shut down or restart unexpectedly. These errors can be caused by both hardware and software issues. Th error indicates that the DPC watchdog executed, either because
 it detected a single long-running deferred procedure call (DPC), or because the system spent a prolonged time at an interrupt request level (IRQL) of DISPATCH_LEVEL or above. The value of Parameter 1 indicates whether a single DPC exceeded a timeout, or whether
 the system cumulatively spent an extended period of time at IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL or above. DPCs should not run longer than 100 microseconds and ISRs should not run longer than 25 microseconds, however the actual timeout values on the system are set much higher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you with your concern, I'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your device?</li><li>Were there any recent changes made prior to this issue?</li><li>To determine what may have happened and to identify a potential resolution, it is important to know what the computer was doing at the time just before the event occurred.</li><li>Which version of Windows you're using?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Thank you for letting me know. Let's troubleshoot the issue by performing the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Method 1: Hardware and devices troubleshooter</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In order to check if this issue is caused due to hardware problem or due to any incorrect settings, We suggest that you run the built-in hardware and devices troubleshooter. Here's how:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>1. Press <strong><em>Windows key +X</em></strong>, then click on
<em><strong>Control Panel</strong></em>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>2. </span></span></span><span><span>Search for
<strong><em>Troubleshooter</em></strong> and </span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>click on the
<strong><em>Find and Fix problems.</em></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>3. </span></span></span><span><span>Click on the

<p>4. Select <em><strong>Search automatically for updated driver software.</strong></em></p>
<p>5. <span><span>If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</span></span></p>
<p>
