<h2>            Microsoft Word 2013 - Where is the Notebook Layout Template&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is it just me or did the new Microsoft Word (2016?) not come with a Notebook Layout template?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used that religiously on my old Mac and I just bought a new Mac yesterday, downloaded the Microsoft Office and I can't find the Notebook Layout on Word... any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I liked most about the Notebook layout was that I could write notes and record lectures. &nbsp;When reviewing the notes later, you can click on a line/sentence and there was a little speaker button next to the sentence that had the point in time of the recording
 when you began typing that sentence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be very much appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Notebook Layout was a template that had a little extra support from Word 2011. I've posted it here, feel free to download and try it out:&nbsp;<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=632339FD1E381DE3!266&amp;authkey=!ABuf_FLy4x9b99M&amp;ithint=file%2czip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Notebook
 Layout Template</a>. Some users report they can work in it for awhile and then it stops accepting keyboard input. Please post how it works for you.

<h2>            I lost then locked my phone, found it but now my PIN does not work.</h2>
                    A few minutes ago I lost my phone, used the Microsoft find my phone to lock it, then managed to find it again. The "find my phone" says that my previous lock pin will unlock it, however this is not working. What pin did the thing use? How can I make it
 use the regular lock pin that I have turned on all the time?

</p><p>We're glad to help! To unlock the phone again, you have to access your Microsoft account. This link will give you the details:

    <title>Outlook Calendars - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rick_urquhart2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Calendars</h2>
                    I need some clarification on the use of Calendars in WM6.1 and synching to my Treo 750 device from Outlook 2007.&nbsp; I brought over my Palm Treo 600 Calendar using a 3rd party program for Outlook 2007.&nbsp; I do have the data in a pst file.&nbsp; I thought I had everything
 working in January 2007.&nbsp; I am using a Treo 750 with the&nbsp; Windows Mobile 6.1 and synching with a Windows Vista 64 bit OS.&nbsp; I had a calendar that continued with my past calendar that I imported.&nbsp; And yet I started to notice that some of my older appointments
 were not on my Treo, even though they were in Outlook.&nbsp; I always get an error that Outlook cannot load all my appointments (I think - I am not at home right now), and I have tried to fix it and found nothing that worked.&nbsp; The problem is I did not think at
 the time that I was having a problem.&nbsp; Just two weeks ago when I left for my trip, I synched my phone and THERE ARE NO APPOINTMENTS on my Treo calendar anymore.&nbsp; I know they are on my PC at home.&nbsp; What has happened?&nbsp; This might relate to the question above.&nbsp;
 I need to learn how to use and manage calendars on my PC (I think I know) and my Treo so that I can keep only the appointments on my Treo that I need.&nbsp; I need someplace where to learn this information.&nbsp; And I need help how to synch and restore my appointments
 to my Treo 750.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.<br />

<blockquote>1. I did add and modify a couple of contacts on my phone while I was away.&nbsp; I connect the phone to my PC and it does sync.&nbsp; However when I check the contacts on my PC and my phone, new contacts are not transfered to my PC and the modified contact
 is not changed in either location.&nbsp; no data is being transfered I guess.&nbsp; So If I remove the partnership and create a new one, will my new and modified contacts on my phone get lost?<br />
<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
Download and install PIM BACKUP from <a href="http://www.dotfred.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.dotfred.net</a>. It is free and invaluable in case you lose your contacts.&nbsp; Download the cab to your PC if you can't download directly to your device and then copy it over to your memory
 card (I assume you have a card reader to do that if you cannot connect directly to your device via your PC)<br />
<br />
So in theory, when you delete the partnership from BOTH the devie and the PC, all your information will be merged together on the first sync.&nbsp; It has ALWAYS worked for me!<br />
<br />
<blockquote><br />
2. I am not sure where on the PC is the calendar part of mobile device settings, change content synch settings,&nbsp;there are only 5 items, E-mail, tasks, notes, mobile favorites, files and microsoft office onenote.&nbsp; Only the first 4 are checked.&nbsp; I do not see
 calendar at all.<br />
<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
It certainly does not appear as if it is seeing Outlook as being installed.&nbsp; It is installed&nbsp; ... correct?&nbsp; And it is a registered copy (not a trial) ... correct?

<h2>            Receiving an error code&#58; 0xC00D11CD &#40;0x88890001&#41; in Xbox Music and Video</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Basic
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><p>After a Suggestion from&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/218f502f-1fef-4df3-b82b-d8c7148572f2">Smittychat.</a><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;I have decided to&nbsp;write&nbsp;a Wiki Article regarding
 this error code:&nbsp;</span></span>0xC00D11CD (0x88890001) and&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;0xc00d11cd (0x8000ffff)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So throughout this article, I will go through suggestions and troubleshooting steps that other members of the community have posted, and that have helped other members with resolving problems with this error code they have received.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember, if you have a solution that has worked with this error code, please suggest an edit to this Article, for me to put it into this article:</p>
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><p><strong>What does this error code mean?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When looking through the forums, it seams that the error code appears when people are trying to listen to music and streaming videos on Xbox Music and Video. This could be on the PC, or even on other devices such as the Surface. Even if people have got a
 Music pass or if they are trying to buy the Video from the Video App.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How can I resolve the problem?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try the normal trouble shooting steps like, making sure your Video Drivers are updated. You can do this through this&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/835636/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Manage your device Drivers</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From here you will be able to see if you need to update your Drivers. If that does not work, then you may need to preform a full re installation of your Video driver. If you have just recently upgraded to Windows 8, there may not be any Sound Card Drivers
 for your PC or Laptop. This means you can contact your Computers Manufacturer, to see if they are planning on releasing any drivers or can recommend any drivers that you can download onto your PC. However you should also trust the source which is why you should
 stick to official drivers for your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work then you could try this solotion if you feel confident enough:</p>
<ol>
<li>Got to [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Audio]</li><li>Right Click, then new, then DWORD (32-bit) Value</li><li>Then name it: DisableProtectedAudioDG</li><li>Then Double Click onto the name&nbsp;</li><li>It should then already have a 0 in the Value Data field. If it doesn't, you can simply change the value to 0</li><li>Then press Ok</li></ol>
<p>This has been suggested as answer and placed as answer by allot of Community Members who use these forums. Which is one of the reasons why I have placed it into this article for you and others to try yourselves. After you have done this, please restart or
 reboot your computer or device and see if this helps you with your issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you, and if you have any suggestions. Please suggest them so I can edit this article with more helpful advise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>

            Yes, thankyou. I had since rang pcworld and asked for technical help, this was free, they talked me through deleting video drives on registry editor, you must not tick the little check box in each deletion confirmation box, otherwise the files wont automatically
 reinstall. Anyway this did fix it! I think this is a similar solution to yours. :)

    <title>Current Start menu poorly designed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Current Start menu poorly designed</h2>
                    <p>With the Build 9926 Start menu, Microsoft has made a number of questionable design and UX decisions. Why, why, WHY, if we're going back to the Start menu for good, is it justified so awkwardly and have so little economy of space?</p>
<p>The layout of elements in Start has been completely scrambled. I'm including a marked up screenshot to illustrate what I'm talking about:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4b90c84-6eef-4f03-a13e-20dd70a8f88a" /></p>
<p>And then there's the matter of spacing. Why is there so much empty space between elements? I get that the interface is supposed to be more touch-friendly, but the icons don't need to be that large and spaced that far apart! I've been able to easily navigate
 through much smaller menu elements on Windows 8.1 with a touchscreen. The iconography and typography in the app list is just too big. I mean, count the number of items Bogdan's screen is showing! He's been able to fit a total of&nbsp;<strong>three</strong> system
 links and <strong>eight</strong> apps on his menu! This is counterintuitive. If the whole idea of the Start menu is to be able to quickly get to what you want on your computer, the current version is sadly lacking. The tiles and links don't need to be this
 big or arranged this way.</p>
<p>As a quick example, here's a concept I patched together of a more traditionally arranged Start. I feel like this would be more functional and accessible for most users, and still retain the touch-friendly nature of Windows 10 without sacrificing the complexity
 desktop users expect.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02d12109-c009-4d3d-a627-2c58543c586b" /></p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

            <p>I like your version also. For me as long as I can add and remove&nbsp;my own items to the LIST side and reduce the ICON side to a single column I am happy.&nbsp; The last commenter wants FLY OUTs and I agree they are very convenient and getting them back would be
 fantastic, or if not FLY OUTs maybe indented fly-downs if you will that do the same but downward.&nbsp; Also important to me is to have RECENT FILES returned from Win-7 as a FLY OUT and/or the option to make some settings that specify if I want RECENT or MOST USED
 or FREQUENT give some user options.&nbsp; Search&nbsp;located on the MENU not on the TASK BAR is great, user option to place it either OK as well, oh and please put the cursor focus inside the search box on opening the MENU sheesh.&nbsp; I do not care where the USER and
 POWER icons go but they need to be there, option for your third ICON to be LOCK or SLEEP user selectable would be good as you show.&nbsp; Now a little off topic but the window icons MIN MAX and CLOSE&nbsp;have got to have more meat I mean thicker, I am 65 and can hardly
 see them, also off topic the new modern flat icons need to be sent to a professional designer or at least one with a sense of visual beauty and effectiveness, nuf said.</p>

            I think the reasoning for keeping the tiles on the right is so it an be expanded when you have a lot of tiles (Mimics the metro screen on windows 8, 8.1). The app list is a good idea. However, I do wish that the slider bar can be actuated as soon as the
 start menu pops up, instead of searching for that itty bitty 'all apps' button to initiate the slider. This way, scrolling with the mouse wheel would be a lot more efficient.

<p>Absolutely NOT!! No tiles on the menu PERIOD. They take up far to much space, it should be fully customisable to allow complete removal. or be able to put the traditional Windows 7 start menu in it's place.</p>

<p>
</p><p>interesting, with the layout, but missing 2 important issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) the "billboard tiles" look.&nbsp; NO, we are *NOT* "advertising reception units".&nbsp; No more "I *FEEL* like everyone wants XXX to be ginormous".&nbsp; Make them all SMALL, or don't install by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) 'all apps' shouldn't be needed.&nbsp; EVAR.&nbsp; Its alphabetized list of *EVERYTHING* and it's brother is completely unacceptable.&nbsp; It's like "data" vs "information".&nbsp; Too much DATA stops being INFORMATION.&nbsp; An alphabetical list of 99 things I won't use [because
 they're pre-installed] does NOT help me to find the 1 thing I *do* use, even if it's just to 'pin it' someplace.&nbsp; Except that the 'pin to' area is filled with BILLBOARD NOISE as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>otherwise, your observations are pretty much spot on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I have the windows 2000 start menu back?&nbsp; I like that BETTER than the XP one, even.</p>

            Has anyone else used the taskbar on top? When you use the Start Menu as a pull down it gets overlaid many times by the taskbar itself. You need to click someplace on the pull down to give it focus and bring it to the front. I may be in the minority but
 there are lots of times funky things happen when you put the taskbar on the top. Some of these only happen when you auto-hide it.

<p>I personally like live tiles. That said, I think an option to view Start in a more classic mode for power users would be a good idea.</p>

<h2>            Outlook &#34;write a new message&#34; window won&#39;t open, contacts not appearing</h2>
                    Nothing happens when I click on the new message tab. And when I go to "People" the little dots just go round and round and none of my contacts appear. Seems to be related to Chrome as these things work fine in IE. Also I just installed Avast.

<h2>            Docx and doc not opening in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I can't open docx and doc attachments in Outlook 2016.&nbsp; I get the message: This file cannot be previewed because there is no previewer installed &nbsp;for it. When I select Open from the right-click menu, I get the message from Word that it experienced a problem
 opening this file.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if I save such files, Word 2016 will not open them,&nbsp; the file cannot be restored, nor can the text be extracted, although I can open them normally with OpenOffice 4.1.1.&nbsp; This is a problem which has arisen over the last week or so.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word 2016 will open files (both doc and docx) which have been written on this computer, but&nbsp;will only open some e-mail attachments which have been sent in the past. I can't quite work out any logic as&nbsp;to which it opens.</p>

</p><p>1. Windows Defender Security Center displays the yellow exclamation warning for 'Device performance &amp; health'.<br />
2. I click 'View health report'.<br />
3. Alongside 'Device driver', it displays 1 recommendation. "One of more device drivers may not be working properly. Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to try to resolve this."<br />
4. I click 'Open Troubleshooter'.<br />
5. On User Account Control prompt, I click on Yes.<br />
6. From Hardware and Devices troubleshooter, I click Next.<br />
7. An error appears: "An error occurred while troubleshooting: An unexpected error has occurred. The troubleshooting wizard can't continue."<br />
8. I click 'View error details'.<br />
9. It displays:<br />

    <title>&#34;Media Unavailable&#34; with animated GIFs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> macevanscb  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Media Unavailable&#34; with animated GIFs</h2>
                    I am building animated GIFs in Adobe Photoshop and inserting them into PowerPoint slides.<br />
I am running into problems with the slides not playing the GIFs.<br />
<br />
I have two different PPTX files, each with four slides and one animated GIF per slide.<br />
GIFs are inserted with Insert &gt; Video &gt; Video from file without problem.<br />
<br />
In one file the third GIF won't play in either edit mode or in the slideshow.<br />
When clicking play in edit mode, it shows a "media unavailable" error.<br />
<br />
In the other file, all GIFs play in edit mode, but both the third and four GIFs won't play in the slideshow.<br />
<br />
All eight of these GIFs were identically assembled and saved out of Photoshop.<br />
Further, when I take these PPTX files over to my Mac (PowerPoint 2011), they play just fine.<br />
But I need them to play properly under Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Does any one have any questions or suggestions??????<br />

            First thing I did was regenerate the GIF and re-insert it.<br />
Didn't help.<br />
<br />
What I found is that PowerPoint seems to break subtly when facing inserted files that are too large.
<br />
I intended that all the animated GIFs were to be generated at 180dpi, but a bunch of them ended up being 300dpi because I wasn't watching what I was doing... &lt;sigh&gt;<br />
<br />
After resizing all the offending GIFs to 180dpi and redoing the PowerPoint files, all is well.<br />
<br />
It is interesting that Powerpoint 2011 for Macintosh handled these files without problem, while PowerPoint 2010 in Windows 7 acted screwy.<br />

            2010 has a nasty hidden trick. It downsamples anything more than 220dpi when you insert (not just when you save). In the process gifs are broken.<br />

Somebody must have thought this was a good idea - It isn't!!<br />

            Good call, John. &nbsp; Turning off file compression would keep PPT from downsampling ALL inserted images. &nbsp; It'll still downsample any that are inserted into placeholders (or inserted onto a slide while there's an empty placeholder ON the slide, amounting
 to the same thing, only more insidious).

<div>SO MacEvans, when starting a new file or adding new slides/graphics to existing files:</div>

<div>Do File | Options | &nbsp;Advanced</div>

<h2>            how to get full version of one note for Mac&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a big fan of one note and have been using it for ages on windows. Recently I switched to a MacBook and now with my office 365 home subscription installed office on my matchbook. However I noticed that I got the mobile version of One Note installed,
 not the full one I am used to on windows with all the extra functionality. How do I get the full version on my Mac?</p>

<p>
</p><p>For checking the version of OneNote: </p>
<p>Open OneNote application&gt; OneNote&gt; About OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you’re not using latest version, we recommend keeping your Office updated to have a better experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For updating: Open OneNote application&gt; Help&gt; Check for Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don’t see the features that are used in OneNote for Windows, we suggest to add your vote and provide feedback to

<h2>            SharePoint&#58; change &#34;Friendly&#34; dates to standard dates</h2>
                    <p>I am using Office365 and SharePoint. Dates such as created, modified, etc. in "friendly" format like "3 days ago". This is seriously annoying, I don't know why anyone thinks that's "friendly", I want to see the actual date and time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to change the display for some sites, but can't remember how I did it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been invited to a new site and the date and time columns show in "friendly" format. How do I change to normal date and time for date and time columns across all sites that I visit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to able to do this as a normal user, not as a designer or creator of sites.</p>

            <p>No, you can't change it - you are limited to the defaults - here it's 15 before start, 10 before start, 5 before start, and 0&nbsp;before start.&nbsp; (These options are not available if the start time is too soon or overdue.)&nbsp; If you want a different time, open the
 appointment and change the reminder time instead of snoozing it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, 0 before start isn't useless (although it is poorly phrased), it tells outlook to trigger the reminder again when the appointment is due.

            How is it that such an obviously useful feature as &nbsp; &nbsp;setting the default Snooze time to a value of one's own choosing &nbsp;is not available? &nbsp; &nbsp;The user shouldn't have to manually change the snoose time for each reminder.

<p><span>Original Title - After running the setup for Internet Explorer 8, I can no longer access Facebook</span></p>
<p>I purchased a new laptop last week with Windows 7 Home Premium and Internet Explorer 8.&nbsp; Every day when I opened IE, I'd get a box telling me to set up certain options - search stuff, accelators, etc.&nbsp; I finally ran it today, and immediately afterwards was
 no longer able to access Facebook.&nbsp; I got the message Internet Explorer&nbsp;Cannot Display the Web Page every time I tried.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read that Facebook uses Adobe Flash player, so I downloaded and installed that, just in case that had somehow gotten changed or damaged.&nbsp; After that I could bring up the Facebook home page but when I try to log in I get the "cannot display" message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went into IE and reset it: Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Advanced&gt;Reset.&nbsp; I'm at the same point where I can bring up the facebook home page, type in login info, then get the "cannot display" message.&nbsp; Now I have a feeling I'll never be able to use&nbsp;Facebook in
 IE again and will have to move to another browser.</p>
<p>Anything else I can try?</p>

<p>Create two MyPhone accounts using different login information.&nbsp; Sync one device to one account and the 2nd device to the other.</p>
<p>Once the information has been sync'd is is on the MyPhone site, I would delete the PIM on each device (or rename to PIMOLD in case you want to have a backup if something goes wrong) then soft reset the device.&nbsp; A new PIM will be created with NO contact,
 calendar, task etc information.</p>
<p>Now open the MyPhone site for device #1 and under connected phones, remove the phone from the account.&nbsp; Now there should be NO devices registered BUT all your sync'd information will be there.</p>
<p>Take the device that you want this data on and open MyPhone on the device.&nbsp; You will have to go to Menu then Account and choose the second option in the list (Change Windows Live ID).&nbsp; Change the ID to the ID that is being used for this account and sync.&nbsp;
 All the info will be brought down to the device.</p>
<p>Now log onto the second MyPhone account using a different ID.&nbsp; Repeat the process with the second device that you followed above.&nbsp; Just don't get confused with the IDs ... think what you are doing and it should work rather easily.</p>

<h3> sg-london  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2016 for Mac - Paste Special from PowerPoint to Word has only fewer options</h2>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Please note that this question is specifically for Office 2016 for Mac.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>macOS Sierra version 10.12.3</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Office2016 - Version 15.31 (170216)</strong></span></p>
<p>I took screenshots of a web page, inserted the png file in a ppt, added some comments, arrows, circles etc. to high light areas of interest, selected all the elements and copied them. Then I
 switched to word where I needed to paste the entire thing. I chose paste special and the only options are
</p>
<ul>
<li>PDF</li><li>Picture (TIFF)&nbsp;</li><li>Microsoft Office Graphic Object</li></ul>
<p>There are no JPEG, Metafile, Enhanced metafile, PNG etc. that windows users seem to enjoy....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all three options:</p>
<ul>
<li>PDF: the resolution was awful, really blocky, looked like a screenshot from minecraft&nbsp;</li><li>TIFF: colour reproduction was terrible, resolution was average at best but it showed the borders of any "hidden" graphics i inserted in the ppt diagram (e.g. a white square to hide a certain part of the picture)</li><li>Microsoft Office Graphic Object: the formatting is not preserved unless you "group" all elements before copying them. The problem is that if you try to resize the picture in word, then all the formatting (sizes, positions and shapes of the additional elements)
 goes out of the window (no pun intended as I use OSX)</li></ul>
<p>I am really disappointed with this as I use this feature a lot for work reviewing web applications and producing user guides with screenshots.&nbsp;</p>

            If you are seeking a document for a residential lease or rental, you should probably check with a Tenancy Authority in your legal jurisdiction as in many cases, there are minimum requirements for such agreements.

<div>If you apply a particular paragraph style to your table captions and create the list of tables based on that style, the numbering will be included.</div>

<div>For example, if you apply a style called Table Caption to all of your captions, you could then create a TOC field as follows:</div>

<h2>            How to change order of Endnote in references &#43; in the body of text</h2>
                    <p>Deeply appreciate if could help! I am writing an article by using endnote embedded&nbsp;in&nbsp;MS word 2016. &nbsp;What I wanted are:</p>
<p>1/ Some of references appear in the middle numbers are wanted&nbsp;to appear at the top. How Can I do that? I attempted rewriting with no success (it automatically started the number from the 1st paragraph, even though I deliberately started middle paragraph
 reference at first&nbsp;point).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2/ why cross references are not updated automatically? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have&nbsp;Endnote X7 in the word toolbar but I didn't like using due to appearing citation (long word) in the article and also I was unable to find references at the bottom of article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward </p>

<p>Endnotes will renumber if you reorder the corresponding endnote references in the body of the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that if you want a list of references in a particular order it would be easier to create that list first and apply auto numbering to it; then use Word's cross-reference function to insert references (to paragraph numbers) in the main body of the text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want me to have a look at the document, you can upload an exampe version (with any sensitive data removed, of course) to OneDrive or Dropbox, make the document public and post a link here.</p>

            Well, I was not suggesting entering 1-62345 but in fact 123456 ("insert the notes as usual but without the commas"), then insert the en dash, then select 2345. But no matter how you do it, provided you select only 2345, only those should be Hidden.

<h2>            Delete Bluetooth message</h2>
                    
<div>Hi all. For some reason I cannot get rid of some Bluetooth messages from my Nokia C6-01. All I get when I try to delete is a message, is saying 'General Already in Use'. What does this mean? Does anyone know how I can delete these Bluetooth messages? Any
 help would be very appreciated. Thank you very much.</div>

<p>i had the same problem with my n79.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SOLUTION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>connect the phone to the pc via mass storage mode.</p>
<p>in your pc select show hidden files from &nbsp;view tab of folder options from control panel.search for the bluetooth message and delete &nbsp;it.</p>
