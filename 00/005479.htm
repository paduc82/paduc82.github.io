<h2>            Table Slicers not showing on SharePoint Web Part</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a table in excel (not a PivotTable) and I have created some slicers to easily filter the table.
</p>
<p>Now when I publish this workbook to a SharePoint the slicers disappear. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When its a Pivot it works but&nbsp;I need to display as a Table. </p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 installs without Word or Excel</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a new computer. &nbsp;It came with a trial version of Office 2016, which I do not want. &nbsp; I uninstalled this package and then&nbsp;</p>
<p>downloaded Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 from <a href="https://c2rsetup.officeapps.live.com/c2r/download.aspx?TaxRegion=PR&amp;version=O15GA&amp;language=en-US&amp;Source=O15HUP&amp;ProductreleaseID=ProPlusRetail&amp;platform=x86&amp;act=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a> provided with my product key. &nbsp; The installation appears to go smoothly, however, when it is done, I see Outlook, Publisher, and Access, but not Word or Excel. &nbsp; &nbsp;I am not asked which programs I want to install. &nbsp; &nbsp;If I search for Word, I get
 Word 2016 and a broken link. &nbsp; Same for Excel. &nbsp; For some reason this was not cleared with the uninstall of Office 2016. &nbsp; &nbsp; I have uninstalled the package, restarted, and installed again. &nbsp; I have tried to modify and repair the software, to no avail. &nbsp; What
 is going wrong???? &nbsp;How do I fix it?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I would use the MS tool to completely remove Office 2016, and again Office 2013, then restart the PC and reinstall 2013</p>
<p>You might also want to run sfc prior to reinstalling</p>

<p>&nbsp;I think we have a lot of folks here who've ignored the warnings about the TP in general, then again for the fast ring. &nbsp;When you see a whole lot of complaints about a relatively minor bug in the start menu, you have to wonder. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I had no trouble downloading and installing 10061 in 3 different environments in both 32 and 64 bit versions. &nbsp;I did run into a bug where I couldn't uncheck the box for Onedrive, but I figured out that was because I was using a local ID. &nbsp;When I signed
 on with an ID &amp; password, that worked for me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Maybe I'm just lucky because I'm using older hardware or maybe it's because I don't install games, but I'm just not seeing many problems. &nbsp;I really hate what they've done with the UI, but as far as upgrading, downloading, and getting most things to work,
 I really can't complain.</p>

<p>Agree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>20 years ago when I worked for a computer company in the US, we were Beta testing Windows NT and Windows 95. Those were solid and fully functional at least 6 months before commercial release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We used Automated Test Procedures on every module of the application code we developed. Test, test and fix regressions before showing to anyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot see any such quality controls in the releases of Windows 10 TP... chuck it out and see what the users stumble into.. is that the paradigm of today?</p>

<p>&nbsp;That's probably why you've seen a lot problems I haven't.&nbsp; Laptops have mostly proprietary hardware, so you've likely had driver compatibility problems.&nbsp; I've stuck with a couple of several year old desktops.&nbsp; I have a laptop, but since I use it 85% of
 the time, I don't test pre-release software on it.&nbsp; I've been surprised at how few problems I've had on my primary test computer.&nbsp; Even when I added an SSD, it was strictly plug and play, no drivers to add, no settings to tweak.&nbsp; That sucker (120 GB PNY SSD)
 just came up and ran like a bat out of ****.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have to say I've seen some serious bugs on release 1.0 of some Windows versions, viz. Vista.&nbsp; Frankly I doubt any businesses will be going to Windows 10 within the next couple of years.&nbsp; The county I live in just upgraded to 7 from XP, and I believe that's
 pretty common.&nbsp; Heck, my dentist is still on XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck with that laptop!</p>

<p>&nbsp;Eureka moment - <strong>I just found out how to disable Onedrive</strong> when you can't uncheck it via the taskbar.&nbsp; You start the
<strong>Task Manager</strong> and click on the <strong>Services</strong> tab.&nbsp; There you'll see Onedrive listed.&nbsp; Lo and behold you can right-click it and then click DISABLE.&nbsp; Who knows what hoops we'll have to jump through in the next build, but for 10061
 that works.&nbsp; I might have to drink an extra beer tonight to celebrate.&nbsp; :-)<br />

<p>I think I knew all of that except that I had to figure out from the way it behaved that it was a service but when I did I quickly killed it. I never wanted or asked for onedrive and I am used to OS's that ask before they give you a service that you've never
 seen before and never wanted :|.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 - Track Changes to Messages</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking for a way to track changes between email revisions, similar to the way MS Word has the track changes options. Is this option completely removed in Outlook 2013 and if so does anyone have any suggested tools that might serve as an add in for this
 functionality. I believe in the past you were able to use Word as an e-mail editor in Outlook that allowed you to track changes but I may be mistaken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I got a an update for my c6-01 but I can only update it via nokia suite. When I try to update it, it reconnects my phone and then says I have no internet which my internet is working perfectly fine. Should I update it? Its trying to update to 25.008 version.
 Thanks.</p>

            You can update... But its not essential if you've already updated to Anna. This release is for minor bug fixes and stability improvements. You can directly update to belle if you decide not to update... Belle's just round the corner with a scheduled release
 beginning from February.

            Yes, eventually belle will be available in the US as well... I don't think so... Nokia has already released videos of first generation symbian 3 phones running belle. It doesn't look slow to me. Its as fast as the newer belle phones. You'll only notice
 the difference when you go into intense processor centric or graphics related apps or games. And already Nokia Vietnam has said that it's going to be available there from 8th February.

            As of now, belle is to be available only via Nokia suite... As its a major update. Nokia recently released a stable version of Nokia suite 3.3.86. Try installing it for updating to belle.

            That I cannot answer because I do not know... No one knows. It depends on when Nokia plans to release it in the US and when it'll be available after carrier approval.

<h2>            Windows 10 Phone Vibrate</h2>
                    Hello everybody. I'm just disappointed that there's no 'vibrate while ringing' or 'Vibrate only' setting in Windows 10 Mobile. I have so much missed calls because of that. My phone only vibrate once and I cant hear ringtone in noisy environment. Is any
 chance to make it work in future updates?&nbsp;or current version? &nbsp;I just wanna know, it's just a simple thing to do this. I really like Windows Phone but this option is 'must have'

<h2>            how to install ovi suite to a drive other than C&#58;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>how to install ovi suite to a drive other than c:??? my c: drive is almost full with other partitions perfectly free to install it, how do i do that? can i use previous versions of ovi suite to use with my e63? at this point, i'm unable to use ovi suite
 at all, because there's no room to install it on my c: drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>allllllllso there's one more thing, when i originally had tried installing ovi suite on my computer i had more than 1gb free. after installing it i on'ly had 500mb free. i had only intended for it to use a very small amount of space, and since i also use
 my c: drive for virtual memory i quickly uninstalled it, looking for an option i'd maybe skipped over while installing it the first time. no luck. anyways, when i looked in the add/remove programs control panel the installed size of ovi suite was only 40-50mb.
 even after uninstalling ovi suite the extra memory space that seemed to all of a sudden taken up by the installation stayed used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when looking at the file sizes of everything on my hard drive, (including system files and paging file) there is still a descreprency between the amount of memory used and the size of all files total on the drive. at this point im quite disgusted and disapointed
 in ovi suite as i'm mostly unable to use it to connect my phone to my computer and i'm also having problems with the CA101 cable as well. i guess i'll have to go check for another cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>nokia!!! wake up and fix yo **bleep**!!!! :D</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>anyone have any solutions for the main problem? (installing to a drive other than c:)? is there support for this option in any of the new beta versions? can that be included in the newest betas? i'm suuuuuure i'm not the only one begging for this option!!!</p>

<p>Hi ostrenga4, sorry to hear about your experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When installing Nokia Ovi Suite to PC, Windows makes "system restoration points", which are available to restore operating system to previous condition, if something goes wrong, for example in driver installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can change install location of Nokia Ovi Suite with following:</p>
<p>- Download Nokia Ovi Suite install package from <a href="http://www.ovi.com/suite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Ovi Suite pages</a></p>
<p>- Start Windows Command prompt</p>
<p>- From Command prompt, navigate to folder containing Nokia Ovi Suite install package, which you downloaded</p>
<p>- Start Nokia Ovi Suite install package with command line "<em>Nokia_Ovi_Suite_webinstaller.exe /TARGET="D:\TestDir\Test</em>"</p>
<p>- This results, that Nokia Ovi Suite installer creates folder D:\TestDir\Test (if that doesn't exist) and installs Nokia Ovi Suite there.</p>
<p>- Unfortunately, Windows Installer still keeps installer cache files and system restoration points in C: drive (or whatever your system drive is)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see, this is possible, but it is very much recommend to have enough space for installing software into system drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers, Samuli</p>

<p>The main problem is that if you do a full install of OVI suite, you can select which drive to install it to,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>but as soon as you update OVI Suite with the "Update Software" function, it will go to C: without asking or any possibility to change the path.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i install software on D: (where all my other application software "lives") I expect updates to be "in place" not move the software onto another. Drive again. Someone definitely has no clue about writing installers. This is beyond inept, sorry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just one more in the almost endless list of bugs, issues and design faults in OVI-Suite.</p>

<p>change your windows default installation directory. For example: by default it is set to C:\Program File and you want to make it to
<strong>D:</strong>\Program Files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For that do these followings:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to Run menu, and type regedit and press Enter.</p>
<p>2. Navigate to:<strong> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion</strong><br />
2. Find <strong>ProgramFilesDir</strong> whose default should be <strong>C:\Program Files</strong><br />
3. Change this to <strong>D:</strong>\Program Files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart your windows and then install the Nokia Ovi Suite.</p>

<p>Can you, please, explain the gap 2. and 2.</p>
<p>I've navigated to:<strong>&nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion</strong><br />
Just can't find&nbsp;<strong>ProgramFilesDir</strong>&nbsp;whose default should be&nbsp;<strong>C:\Program Files</strong><br />
So I can't hange this to&nbsp;<strong>D:</strong>\Program Files</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW: Is this regedit mean, that all previous programs could not get updated now?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>I have tried the suggested solution with the current version 3.2, now called Nokia Suite and it does not work, even with the /Target switch. It still tries to force the install into c:\program files (x86)\Nokia. This is no use to me as my C:drive is a small
 flash card and does not have the space for extra software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has this command changed? I must be able to install this to the D: drive.</p>

            So, any resolution to this? Is Nokia going to force install on C: drive on all of us with small SSDs? This is one of the few programs that don't allow you to select the destination.

    <title>MS Project 2010 resource balancing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dallasdave22  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Project 2010 resource balancing</h2>
                    <p>Hello experts – I need assistance or advice with resource balancing with Project 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a multi-year project divided into 3 months phases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each task in the project has actions that need to be performed by different groups.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A group may consist of one or more resources.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, the Off Shore Programmer groups consists of 5 full time resources, but the Engineering group only has 1 full time resource.<span>&nbsp;
</span>As an example a task might need 5 hours from the Engineering group and 80 hours from the Off Shore Programmer group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some tasks must be completed before others, while for others is does not matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m trying to organize my tasks into the different phases so that each group is fully utilized (or as close to 100% as I can).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could not figure out how to do this with Project 2010, so I manually did it using Excel and pivot charts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’d like to learn how to correctly do this with Project.<span>&nbsp; </span>I started playing around with the Team Planner Tool and the Prevent Over Allocation option, but couldn’t get it to work the way I thought it would (especially with task dependencies).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’d appreciate any advice.</p>

            <p>Dallas,</p>
<p>I though someone might jump in with some sage advice by now but since they haven't let me at least give you my thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, do you have SP2 installed? If not, install it. It won't help you with your issue but it does fix many things that you likely will run into while using Project. I also suggest you install the June 2013 cumulative update since it was released
 after SP2 and also fixes several issues. I wouldn't worry about installing the latest cumulative update (June 2014), but if you already have, that's okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that task dependencies are just that, task dependencies and are not related to resource availability/dependencies. If indeed certain tasks are related, and most should be, than a link is appropriate. However, there may be some cases where a
 particular task or tasks can be performed anytime during the life of the project but are not directly related, dependency-wise, to other tasks (e.g. impact study that is one of the many outputs of the project).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention resource groups but it's not clear if you understand that Project can be set up to use resources in group fashion. For example, you can create a single Offshore Programmer group with a max unit level of 500% (5 people) and an Engineering group
 with a max unit level of 100% (1 person). That will allow you to assign the resources as group instead of by individual name. But bear in mind that a resource group considers each individual resource in that group to have the same capability, so by assigning
 the programmer group at 200% to a task, you are indicating that any two of the individual resources that will be doing the work is equivalent to any other two members of the group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project does not have the resource optimization capability that you want. The resource leveling feature can be used to help resolve resource overallocation and the Team Planner can be used to facilitate resource assignments but neither can be set up to optimize
 resource utilization, that is a manual task best left up to the project manager. Why? Because there are so many variables that come into play, it is difficult to develop an efficient algorithm. You could potentially create such an algorithm based on your specific
 requirements and develop that into a VBA macro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2007 - Sent emails not reaching the destination.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I am using Outlook 2007, all of sudden, the emails are not reaching the destination but &nbsp;"Outbox" is empty and emails are showing in the "sent folder". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Emails sent to the same domain address are being delivered. &nbsp;contacted my hosting company, &nbsp;they set up my email id in their outlook on their system, same configuration setting as mine to send the emails and these emails were delivered too. But emails sent
 from outlook on my system are not being delivered, except to the same domain emails id..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help ?</p>
<p>

            <p>If the messages are in the Sent Items folder, then as far as Outlook is concerned, the messages have been sent. In order&nbsp;to move&nbsp;a message from Outbox to Sent Items. Outlook must contact what it believes is the outgoing mail server, perform the necessary
 protocol exchanges, send the message, then receive an acknowledgement from the outgoing server that it has accepted the message for delivery to the next-in-line mail router. Once Outlook has received the acknowledgement, it moves the message to Sent Items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, seeing the message in the Sent Items is assurance that the message has moved successfully to the next step in the delivery process. If the message never arrives, the problem lies after Outlook. One common cause of this is an antivirus scanner pretending
 to be the mail server wedged between Outlook and the real server, where the scanner drops the ball.</p>

            I didn't mean to imply I thought it was a virus. I meant to type "antivirus scanner"; programs like Symantec/Norton Antivirus, McAfee Antivirus, Avast, and Kaspersky. If you have an antivirus scanner installed and scanning email, that is a potential source
 of the problem. It's just one variable to eliminate, but it's frequently (although not always) the cause.

    <title>N81 8GB Volume Key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andygaffney---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N81 8GB Volume Key</h2>
                    My Volume Up / Zoom Out side key appears to have stopped responding.<br />
<br />
I can still use the Volume Down / Zoom In function (the bottom part of the key).<br />
<br />
I've updated to the latest software, doesnt seem to have worked.<br />
<br />
A few days back the phone went a bit scitz with random keys not responding, however this seemed to calm down BEFORE i did the software update, leaving me with just this one key not responding - pain in the **bleep** cos theres seemingly no other way of turning
 the music volume up.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? Is it worth trying a factory re-set? The button itsself feels fine, it presses firmly down &amp; doesnt feel sloppy or damaged.....strange.

Try to restore to factory settings. If same<br />

            Can you feel the bunnton physically clicking like the other? If not, then software won't help, so it will have to go to a care point to get repaired.

I found that just deleting the Building Blocks.dotx file in their profile fixed the problem.Windows Vista &amp; 7 Location:

<p>These are system folders and may be hidden. You need to substitute your user name in the document path. If you type that out in notepad and then put it in the address box of a Windows folder it should take you there.<br />

<p>I think there is nothing you can do. If the phone is unable to find bootable option the hardreset may also not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should contact any care point.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to get rid of the merged cells and just use formatting with borders to indicate what belongs together. With merged cells, some of the following formulas won't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the range starts in cell A1, then the cell with the word "July" is in B1. Based on that, you can use this formula in cell R2 to get the current month (or type in the date manually)</p>
<p>
</p><p>=MAX(IF(A2:Q2&lt;TODAY(),A2:Q2))</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is an array formula and must be confirmed by hitting Ctrl+Shift+Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In cell R3 you can get the $ values for that month with this formula</p>
<p>
</p><p>=INDEX($B3:$Q3,MATCH($R$2,$B$2:$Q$2,FALSE))</p>
<p>
</p><p>In cell S3 you can get the percentage with&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>=INDEX($B3:$Q3,MATCH($R$2,$B$2:$Q$2,FALSE)+1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy both formulas down.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Build 10130&#47;10159 - Stuck at &#34;Installing drivers and features&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've downloaded Build 10159 today and is currently installing it on my system from Build 10130 via Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But, I'm having a little problem here. Whenever it reaches the 'Installing features and drivers' stage, it seems to get stuck there at 91%. It has been around twenty minutes since it's been stuck there. Very weird indeed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This same issue happened when I upgraded from 10130 to 10158 yesterday. I had to turn off my PC and let it roll back to 10130 with a little more instability than usual.</p>
<p>
Why is this happening? How do I fix this? Thanks.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I just noticed you are a phone user not a PC user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I had the same problem when I installed both builds, one after the other, on my Toshiba P750, core i7, 8 Gb's DDR3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose to wait mine out in both cases. Mine was stuck there for about 35 - 45 minutes before it completed that part of the install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, on both builds, it took about 3 hours to download and another 3 - 4 hours to actually install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can, just be patient. As long as the indicator light on your HDD is either constantly lit, or even just blinking a&nbsp;little, rest assured that it is still working on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other note for both installs, the OS changed my power settings and my machine actually fell asleep while waiting to complete the install. LOL. I just jiggled my mouse about every 8 minutes or so as the system changed the sleep timer from never to 10
 mins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hi there and thanks for answering my question </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's been six hours into this upgrading thing and I've decided to force shutdown my PC as it seems to be taking forever without a sign of it going over 91%. My laptop had to be connected for a long time for this to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the install taking a long time and why is it during the installing features and drivers that it sticks onscreen forever?</p>

<p>Hello MichaelShutter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no need to have a Skype number if you will call your spouse's Skype account. All you need to have is a Skype application installed on his/her computer and on your device. Both of you should have installed the application. Also, make sure that you
 are both added as contacts of each other, from there, you can now follow the steps below to do a Skype to Skype call or video call:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to Skype</li><li>Click your spouse's account/name from your contact's list</li><li>Click on <strong>Phone (for Skype call)</strong> or <strong>Video (for video calling) icon</strong></li><li>Then you're all set</li></ol>
<p>If you want to do a video call through Skype, sign in to Skype &gt; choose your preferred contact &gt; click the video call button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Cant view old emails in office 365.</h2>
                    I have recently started using the office 365 email platform, however, i cannot see emails older than 4 days old. Whenever i have used hotmail/outlook previously i have pages of emails to see but that doesn't seem to be the case here. In my junk email account
 the emails go back to since i set the account up, it's just the main emails i don't go past the last couple of days. Any help will be much appreciated.

            <p><span>Hello Carl,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue may occur if the Hotmail account has not been setup properly. Hotmail accounts need to be setup as Exchange Active Sync (EAS) accounts in Outlook 2013 (part of Office 365). Check in the
<strong>Account Settings – E-mail Account </strong>box (Accessed from <strong>File &gt; Account Settings &gt; Account Settings</strong> drop-down menu) and make sure that your Hotmail account has been setup as EAS. If not then follow the steps shown in the following
 Microsoft link to set your Hotmail account as EAS account in Outlook 2013.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://blogs.office.com/2012/11/15/put-the-power-of-outlook-2013-behind-your-outlook-com-email/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://blogs.office.com/2012/11/15/put-the-power-of-outlook-2013-behind-your-outlook-com-email/</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once setup as EAS allow all the emails to sync with Outlook 2013; note the synchronization may continue in the background even after the synchronization indication stops in Outlook 2013. After the synchronization competes make sure to restart Outlook
 2013 and check if you are able to view old emails. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope the above steps help you to resolve the issue. Let us know the status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            Your Office version is too old to function correctly. 
<br />
<br />You need to update both OS and Office to latest. To update Office -

<p><span>Hi J</span><span>abberwokker</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check if Custom Dictionary is selected when old document is opened. You can go to Word menu&gt;Preferences&gt;Spelling and Grammar&gt;Under Spelling, click Dictionaries&gt;Select the check box next to
 the custom dictionary that you want to use&gt;Click OK twice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you confirmed the Custom Dictionary is checked, regarding Custom Dictionary is not invoked only on those old documents, please try copy the contents from old documents to new document to see if
 Custom Dictionary works.</p>

<p>I would (with the device disconnected), open Outlook on your PC and click Help - Detect &amp; Repair. Connect your device after the repair is done and see if that helps. if not, I think I might try deleting the partnership and then
 re-establishing it again.&nbsp; </p>
