            <p>#1 - Would you hae happened to install the 64bit version of Office instead of the default 32 bit version? (that by itself accounts for the vast majority of errors like this)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#2 - Have you confirmed that whatever program you are using related to your PDF files actually supports Office 2013 and more specifically, the bit version of Outlook installed?</p>

<h2>            Excel Data Model - How to Append Data to make one Power Pivot</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some help. I have a separate Excel workbook for invoices for each month in 2017. So, I imported each workbook (just the sheet with the invoices) into a data model in a new workbook using the Power Query Get and Transform. But I can't seem to append
 February's invoices to the end of January's, and so forth to make one big list of invoices for the full year 2017. And, each month's workbook looks exactly the same, all the columns are named exactly the same, fields are the same. I can't copy and paste because
 it will add up to 2 million rows. (about 200k rows per months).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

<p>Hey man, i had your problem!&nbsp; It was one of my first complains and one of the reasons I joined this forum awhile back. I did a software update and the problem was still there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone hangs and when you open installation files rite?&nbsp; You know what I found, if you let the phone be for a long time, about 15 mintues, then sometimes it opens the contaning folder.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although your files are on the memory card this can happen.&nbsp; What
 I did was, access that folder, install everything I wanted and deleted all the programs I had on there that I didnt want and that were big in size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example: snapp life is 2mb installation file.&nbsp; I deleted that one and some others.&nbsp; Well basically everything from 800kbs up.&nbsp; Now its much better.&nbsp; Takes a minute or two to open but it opens faster than it did before.</p>

<h2>            Overcoming Excel 2011 for mac 256 Character limit in cells</h2>
                    <p>I have found that despite the fact that a cell can hold much more than 256 characters, when this is the case many functions in Excel 2011 for Mac don't work. In particular you can't use VLOOKUP using such cells for reference (it returns #VALUE instead).
 I tried to overcome this by using the LEN function to shorten to 255 Characters the offending cells before running VLOOKUP on them, but incredibly even LEN does not work with cells &gt;256 characters.</p>
<p>This is obnoxious. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I thus have two questions for the community:</p>
<p>1 - Is there any way to shorten cells to less than 255 characters so that all functions can be used?</p>
<p>2 - is there a repository list of Excel functions that are affected by the 256 characters limit?</p>

            Yes, responsible postings to the UserVoice forum are evaluated by the development team. Contrary to the expectations of some, however, posting an issue or suggestion doesn't necessarily mean that it will be implemented later that afternoon... and Microsoft
<em>rarely</em> sends a Thank You card :-)

<p><span>Unfortunately, these type of malware attacks are difficult to keep up with because they trick you into letting them install. They usually come from an infected
 web site, and usually through an advertisement. You get a pop-up from the infection and you click&nbsp;it to close the pop-up - which allows the infection to install.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They can also be delivered in a "drive-by" fashion with no action needed by the user due to the system being unpatched, no matter what security software is running.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When you encounter one of these fake virus pop-ups while browsing, immediately do the following:<br />
<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">-Do not touch any browser window to close it or browse further</span><span>.<br />
-Immediately press Ctrl-Alt-Del and bring up Task Manager and forcibly end all instances of iexplore.exe, if using Internet Explorer, or the executable for your browser for any other web browser.<br />
--or--<br />
-Go to Start/Shut Down and restart the PC without touching any browser windows.<br />
-If you used task manager to close browser instances, reboot the machine.<br />
-Then go to Control Panel/Internet Options and delete all temporary Internet Files and cookies. If you are using an alternate web browser, open the browser settings to do the same - delete the local cached files and cookies.<br />
-Perform a full scan with MSE.<br />
<br />
The above steps should prevent the infection from taking hold.<br />

<p><span>Start here -

<p>This web site - <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.bleepingcomputer.com</a> -<span>&nbsp; </span>contains details for many of these common infections, often immediately after they began to appear in the wild, and instructions are provided for how to remove the infections using their malware removal
 guides. They also have forums where you can seek help from people who specialize in malware removal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides MSE, the following recommendations will assist in protecting the PC from infection:</p>
<p>-Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled.</p>
<p>-Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update (Windows Update).</p>
<p>-Make sure Internet Explorer is at version 8 or 9 and updated with all patches.</p>
<p>-In Internet Explorer 8 or 9, use the SmartScreen Filter.</p>
<p>-Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).</p>
<p>-Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.</p>
<p>-On Vista and Windows 7 make sure that
<span>User Account Control (UAC) ON<span>&nbsp; </span>and not running with elevated privileges.</span></p>
<p>-Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible
 after being notified of available updates.</p>
<p>-<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Make sure that installed applications, especially Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash, and Java are at their latest versions. Many
 vendors are regularly updating and patching for security holes.</span></p>
<p>-Never click through links from unknown sources and use caution even if they are from a "trusted" source.</p>
<p>-Never open unsolicited email attachments.</p>
<p>-Practice safe web browsing.</p>

                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a monthly Office subscription and have been using Outlook 2013 upto now. All of a sudden, everything (all the office products) were removed from my&nbsp;PC and I had to go into my Office account to install Office again. It switched everything from 2013
 to 2016 but I now have lost all my emails. Not only that, the Outlook 2016 doesn't get past the 'loading profile' and I'm stuck.&nbsp; I had my work emails routed through the exchange so I could open them up via Outlook but now have no access.</p>
<p>Please help as I'm desperate!</p>

            You said the hyperlink was to a bookmark, but a bookmark name cannot contain spaces, and yours appears to. It's also an unusually long bookmark name. It appears you're using multilevel list numbering. If so, you could insert a cross-reference to "Numbered
 item" (or "Heading" if it's in one of the built-in heading styles), and the cross-reference would automatically be hyperlinked; you wouldn't then have to assign a bookmark.

<p>Okay, so something is happening when you save, close, and reopen. A few things to check:</p>
<p>
</p><p>At <strong>File | Options | Advanced: General</strong>, if the box for "Update automatic links at open" is checked, you could try clearing it to see whether this makes a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At <strong>File | Options |&nbsp;Trust Center | Trust Center Settings | Privacy Options</strong>, make sure that the box for "Remove personal information from file properties on save" is not checked. This really shouldn't have anything to do with hyperlinks,
 but it's worth a shot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What file format are you using for the save? Hyperlinks should work in .doc, .docx, and .pdf files but not in, say, .txt files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you tracking changes? That might be relevant. Obviously, I'm grasping at straws here, but I do think your bookmarks could be part of the problem.</p>

            I initially asked whether the hyperlinks were to bookmarks, and you said they were. Since the headings seem to be numbered, you will likely have to update the HYPERLINK fields if the numbers change. If you are tracking changes, the numbering won't be stable
 till you accept the changes.

<p>I am sorry I told you they were bookmarks.&nbsp; I'm an old dog trying to learn new tricks.&nbsp; I didn't think there was a difference between bookmarks and headings.&nbsp; Now I do.&nbsp; I really do appreciate your efforts to help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The headings have not been changed since I finished putting them into the document several months ago. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are two things that I do not understand. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I repair a link and check it numerous times to make sure it works.&nbsp; Then I exit the program, and open it again, and the link is no longer working.&nbsp; I don't understand why the program will not "remember" that link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Some links work and some do not.&nbsp; I did not do anything different when setting up those links.&nbsp; I do not understand why some work and some do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started looking into using cross references last night instead of hyperlinks.&nbsp; It appears to be a process that would take even longer to get done.&nbsp; Do you have any advice on doing that?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>The first step in deleting an account is you need&nbsp;to know the sign in credentials of the account because you will be asked to first sign in to the account&nbsp;closure page before you proceed.&nbsp;If&nbsp;for example, your&nbsp;multiple accounts are tied up to one email address,
 you can check the&nbsp;tied-up accounts <a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here.</a> If you do not know the passwords for your other accounts. then try to go with the password reset flow first.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've found out log in credentials of the account, check this <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-account-for-skype?q=close+skype+account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
account closure FAQ</a> for the tips and guides before you delete an account. Please be reminded that when closing an account, the Microsoft account and all Microsoft products and services tied with it will also be closed.&nbsp;<em>Tip: Once you are on the closure
 page, you will be asked to merge your Skype account to an email address to fully integrate it as a Microsoft account, if you do not want your existing Microsoft account to be included in the deletion choose use another email address and create a new email
 account which you can tie up with the account you will be deleting. </em></p>

    <title>Changed Password and another account received changed password email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seanmcclary  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changed Password and another account received changed password email</h2>
                    <p>I changed my outlook/hotmail password yesterday and as usual I did receive the email notification letting me know that my email password had been changed and If I did change it to disregard the email notification. &nbsp;Then about 10 minutes later my wife calls
 me to ask me if I changed my email password. &nbsp;I said yes I did and how did she know. &nbsp;She said she received an email notification of the change, the same exact one that I had received. &nbsp;Our accounts are not linked and I double checked it to make sure at least
 on my end. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have two questions. &nbsp;Do I need to check her account/security settings to see if she has added me to her account? &nbsp;Or is possible that there is spyware on my computer that I am unaware of and she is receiving information on my accounts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for the assistance.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for posting in Microsoft Communities.</span></p>
<p><span>As per your description I have understood that after changing your outlook.com password, a notification e-mail was sent to you as well as your wife’s e-mail address about the changes.</span></p>
<p><span>Notification e-mails will be sent to the e-mails that are added as aliases or alternate e-mail address.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If you do not want notifications to be sent to any e-mail address, then you have to remove that e-mail address from your account’s security information.<br />
Please follow the given below method to remove the e-mail address from the security information:<br />
1.&nbsp;Sign in to your Microsoft account.<br />
2.&nbsp;Under Password and security info, tap or click Edit security info.<br />
If you're prompted to enter a security code, check your alternate email or phone for the code from the Microsoft account team.<br />
3.&nbsp;On the Security info page, under Alternate email address, choose the e-mail address that you want to remove and click on delete/remove.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Note: It will take 30 days for the changes to take effect.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.<br />

                    <p>Hello,</p>

<li>Create a recurring event in a Calendar.</li><li>Start a workflow on the start date of each event.</li></ol>

<p>I resisted using the updated version of skype on my PC but on Friday 23/3/18 when ringing out to landlines i could not hear the dial tone or voices even though it was ringing. I updated to new version and could hear dial tone and voices perfectly but now
 when people ring me it does not make a sound, i find out that ive missed a call later when i get notification. I have tried so many fixes and updated latest versions of Microsoft including drivers for sound. The sound still works with things like youtube etc
 so the problem lies firmly with Skype and the new software, so over to you Microsoft, you have bought the company now make it work !</p>
<p>temp fix for those in similar position ; upload skype to your mobile and leave on next to pc at least you can hear when your getting a call and can answer on PC .</p>

<p>Thanks just tried that no difference, skype just does not ring this end. If you put this same question (skype does not ring my end ) on google you will see there is hundreds of scenarios, this is obviously a major fault as people like myself use this for
 work but cannot receive calls, definitely needs some urgent attention can you call me on&nbsp;*************** please.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>can&#39;t use desktop shortcuts - when internet says it&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 1satchmo  say:</h3>
<h2>            can&#39;t use desktop shortcuts - when internet says it&#39;s connecting there isn&#39;t a url in address location</h2>
                    I have a couple of questions.<br />
When I want to add a Desktop Shortcut I go through normal steps and an icon shows on Desktop - when you try to open from desktop you are taken to internet but there isn't an address in url field for browser to use. If you right click on destop icon and go to
 properties it shows address in url field but in shortcut key field it says "none".<br />
Next question pertains to Outlook and inablity to make "No Reading Pane" setting stay set - I have it set through "VIEW" but when I change grom InBox to another location within Outlook and then go back to InBox reading pane is open - very frustrating.<br />
Thanks for the help in advance

Hello<br />
Welcome to microsoft answers.<br />
<br />
Do you have this issue with one particular website or all the websites?<br />
<br />
(A). Check in safe mode with networking<br />
I would suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode with networking and check if the you face similar issue<br />
Steps to boot to Safe mode with networking<br />
1. Restart your computer if it is powered on.<br />
2. Tap the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.<br />
3. Once you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.<br />
4. Use the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.<br />
5. Select Safe Mode with Networking and press Enter.<br />
6. You should see drivers loading, and then please wait.<br />
7. You should then be at the Welcome Screen.<br />
8. Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.<br />
Start your computer in safe mode<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a><br />
<br />
(B).&nbsp; Perform SFC scan and check if it helps.<br />
Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
1. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password,
 or click Allow. <br />
2. Type the following command, and then press ENTER: sfc /scannow<br />
The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />

            I'm currently trying to find a resolution to the desktop url shortcut issue as well.&nbsp; I've seen this occur to random users who are running XP and IE8 and now I have the same problem with a brand new load of Win7.<br />
<br />
I've dragged and copied the url shortcut to my desktop several different ways and still all it does it open a blank page of IE, no address in address bar and goes nowhere.<br />
I have went to tools, internet options, advanced and reset IE settings -- this resolved the problem for one&nbsp;attempt of the url shortcut.&nbsp; After that it stops working.&nbsp; However, this method does not work everytime.<br />

My XP users do not have a problem with the desktop shortcuts....instead their issues occur when trying to open links that are contained in emails.&nbsp; All they get is a blank IE screen and goes nowhere.<br />

<p>Try working it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;E.g. the "shortcut" may be a .URL file; so you could open that in Notepad to see how it compares with other .URL files, such as ones in your Favorites directory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you would want to know how does a .URL file get opened and&nbsp;is IE
 the default browser and (perhaps) is IE X64 involved?&nbsp;&nbsp; So you could inspect the assoc and ftype data:<br />
<br />
&lt;cmd_output&nbsp; OS="VistaSP2"&gt;<br />
E:\&gt;assoc .url<br />
.url=InternetShortcut</p>
<p>E:\&gt;ftype InternetShortcut<br />
InternetShortcut="C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe" "C:\Windows\System32\ieframe<br />
.dll",OpenURL %l<br />
&lt;/cmd_output&gt;<br />
<br />
Then you would want to know is&nbsp;an instance of&nbsp; IE&nbsp; already running or not?<br />
If yes, are tabs allowed and what happens to popups, (etc.)?<br />
<br />
You could even simulate, e.g. via the Run... dialog what that open action would do in each case.<br />
<br />
Finally, to really understand what is going on I would try capturing a trace of its activities using ProcMon.&nbsp; It would undoubtedly help to have two traces, one from a case where IE appeared to be working normally and a second for the problem case and then
 try to get some insight by comparing them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<br />
It would help for you to specify your "normal steps".&nbsp; One interpretation of what you have written is that you are creating a new Desktop shortcut (aka .lnk file) and have created one with&nbsp; iexplore.exe&nbsp; -nohome.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then if you wanted to open that with a shortcut
 keystroke of Ctrl+Alt+I you could use set keyboard focus to that field and press I to specify that.<br />

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if anyone can help me, but thought I would try before tearing my hair out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working in Visio 2013 Standard, and am trying to draw lines in a diagram.&nbsp; Every time I get three lines, they automatically connect to each other in a shape (for example, two parallel lines with a perpendicular running through them automatically become
 a rectangle, and can only be resized as a rectangle would be).&nbsp; This is driving me crazy and making it virtually impossible to do my diagramming!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have fiddled around with all of the Snap and Glue options I can find, and I cannot find anything that will disable this and leave the lines separate.&nbsp; Can anyone help???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and PS, I tried calling the Microsoft help desk, and after confirming the spelling of my name 14 times, the guy said he could not help me.&nbsp; Isn't that the purpose of a HELP desk???!</p>

            <p>Two parallel lines become a rectangle? That's not possible.</p>
<p>They might be grouped, they might be connected - anything. But not turn into a rectangle, because when being parallel, they don't touch. A line in terms of Visio is always straight, anything else is either a connector or a polygon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post a screenshot so we can get a real clue what's going on.</p>

            <p>Actually it is quite easy to get a few simple lines being joined together as one shape by Visio. The answer is to draw the lines in an order such that Visio doesn't connect them. Hard to describe.</p>
<p>Also lines in Visio are not always straight (nor is evrything else a connector or polygon). Just try selecting freeform, arc or pencil drawing tools!</p>

            <p>You cannot join two parallel lines, else they're not parallel or not joined.</p>
<p>Lines are straight, else it's - like you wrote - an arc or a freeform, but not a line. Selecting the line tool does only draw straight lines.</p>

                    <p>I get error on circular reference, and would like to know where to locate this error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This file is used to work with a list of folders, whenever I make any modification on this file, and will copy this updated file into a list of folders for latests version, it works find on my desktop with Window XP, but when I work on ABC.xls file on my
 notebook with Window 7, once I modify ABC.xls, which works fine on D:\Folder1 directory without any error, I make a copy to following list of folders, when I open D:\Folder2\ABC.xls, I get a circular reference error, but there is no location on status bar,
 and I have checked it on every sheets within this workbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how to locate this circular reference error on Excel 2003?</p>

</p>
<p><br />
</p>
What Is a Circular Reference?
<p><span>Microsoft Excel 2010 Formulas &amp; Functions Inside Out (ISBN 9780735658028)</span></p>
<p><span>Circular references are mostly generated by input errors. A circular reference is a reference to a cell containing the formula, in other words, a reference to itself. Excel cannot resolve formulas with a circular reference.
 Instead you receive the message shown in Figure 3-11.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Figure 3-11 Wrong input in cell D3 and error message.</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>If you click OK in the error message, the circular reference toolbar appears in the table window of Excel 2003 (see Figure 3-12).</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Figure 3-12 The circular reference toolbar in Excel 2003.</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>You can use the circular reference toolbar to iterate through the cells within the circular reference. Use the Trace Dependents and Trace Precedents buttons to see what caused the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>If you click OK in the circular reference warning in Excel 2010, a help window shows instructions on how to handle circular references (see Figure 3-13).</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Figure 3-13 Excel 2010 help for circular references.</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>In Excel 2007/Excel 2010, you can find the search and remove options for circular references on the ribbon, on the Formula tab. In the Formula Auditing group, click the Error Checking and then the Circular References
 button. Then click the displayed references (see Figure 3-14). However, here (and in the status bar), only the circular reference entered last is displayed.</span></p>
<p><span>Caution</span></p>
<p><span>If you close the warning and the help window and don't correct the circular reference, no other warning is displayed when you enter another formula with a circular reference in a cell. However, the status bar shows
 circular references. So correct circular references immediately, because you might forget later.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Figure 3-14 Finding circular references in Excel 2007/Excel 2010.</span></i></b></p>
Inside Out More about Circular References
<p><span>Microsoft Excel 2010 Formulas &amp; Functions Inside Out (ISBN 9780735658028)</span></p>
<p><span>Excel cannot calculate all open workbooks automatically if one workbook contains a circular reference. You have to remove the circular reference or you can calculate each cell included in the circular reference by using
 the results of the previous iteration. If you don't change the default settings for iterations, Excel ends the calculation after 100 iteration steps or if the values in the circular reference change by less than 0.001 between two iterations (depending which
 happens first).</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>*****************************</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
Locating Circular References
<p><span>A circular reference occurs when a formula directly or indirectly refers to its own cell. This causes the formula to use its result in the calculation, which can create errors. When a workbook contains a circular reference,
 Excel cannot automatically perform calculations. You can use error checking in Excel to locate circular references in a formula, and then remove them. If you leave them in, Excel calculates each cell involved in the circular reference by using the results
 of the previous iteration. An iteration is a repeated recalculation until a specific numeric condition is met. By default, Excel stops calculating after 100 iterations or after all values in the circular reference change by less than 0.001 between iterations,
 unless you change the Excel option.</span></p>
<span>Locate a Circular Reference</span>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click the Formulas tab.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click the Error Checking button arrow, point to Circular References, and then click the first cell listed in the submenu.</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Review the formula cell.</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you cannot figure out if the cell is the cause of the circular reference, click the next cell in the Circular References submenu, if available.</span></p>
<p><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Continue to review and correct the circular reference until the status bar no longer displays the word “Circular.”</span></p>
<span>Did You Know? You can enable and increase formula iterations to make a circular reference work.
</span>
<p><span>Click the Office button, click Excel Options, click Formulas, select the Enable iterative calculation check box, enter the maximum number of iterations you want (higher the number, the more time Excel needs to calculate
 a worksheet), and set the maximum amount of change you want to accept between calculation results (smaller the number, the more accurate the results).</span></p>

<p>The Hotmail server will delete messages from the Deleted folder after 30 days.</p>
<p>An IMAP account will sync the deletion in Thunderbird.</p>
<p>If you want to keep the messages longer, move the messages to a user created folder instead on deleting the messages.</p>

            The limits on the server are whatever the admin sets. In office 365, the popular subscriptions have either 50 or 100GB, but some plans has only 2GB.
