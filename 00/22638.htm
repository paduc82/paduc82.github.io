<h2>            GETTING BACK DELETED EMAILS .....private email support</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I think I am writing this on private email support (as recommended). I have recently discovered that I have deleted many important emails (organized in a folder) from my account of *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any way that those
 emails can be restored ? (Since April 2013)<br />
<br />
Please let me know if it can be resolved.<br />
<br />
Thank you-<br />

<p>
</p><p>I do apologize but once you've not recovered the deleted emails, we don't have option to retrieve it. Outlook.com can only recover deleted emails not more than 5 days.</p>

<h2>            Blank save as menu when saving an email attachment</h2>
                    <p>Hi all -&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've tried just about everything with this issue so I'm hoping you may be able to lend some insight.<br />
<br />
After Outlook runs for awhile, when I go to save attachments it brings up the "save as" screen but unfortunately, the file navigation on the left side is blank. I've included a screenshot of the issue. This issue is not mirrored by other office programs so
 I know the issue is isolated within Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone dealt with this before? Let me know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>General specs:</p>
<p>- Windows 10</p>
<p>- Outlook 2016 (exchange email)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5be0a62a-5c5b-4499-ba8f-9895978d023e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5be0a62a-5c5b-4499-ba8f-9895978d023e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Actual save menu should look something like this:</p>

            <p>Unfortunately that cannot be done.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you want to&nbsp;watch the video, you can do it from a PC&nbsp;&nbsp;or download it to your device and then play it. You cannot stream music from Skydrive to your device</p>
<p>Using IE in desktop mode on your device you only get these options for a video file you have saved:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffarm9.staticflickr.com%2f8066%2f8208864217_9116de3d33.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when you view the same page from ANY PC, you get these options for a video file:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffarm9.staticflickr.com%2f8488%2f8209949140_8a24cacfa0.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see you can download. So if you don't have the video on your device and want to view it from your device then you will have to download the file to a PC then sync it to your device for viewing when you want to watch it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you want to use your device to watch a video, you will have to think ahead and save it to your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So all that said, this might be worth looking at:</p>
<p>I've never tried this&nbsp;but for those that have a lot of video that they want to stream, this article may be of interest:</p>

            <p>So after investigating a bit further, I was wrong in my comment above&nbsp;but the solution I have is not optimal but it works and only needs to be done once as far as I can tell.&nbsp; I will continue to look for a better solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I did try a couple of things with limited success.&nbsp; Not a perfect solution but it does work unless and until I can find a better way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find the video via the SkyDrive app on your device.&nbsp; Long press on that video and select "share" then select "send a link&nbsp;in email".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That link will open the folder containing all&nbsp;your videos and you CAN stream any of them that are in that folder.&nbsp;<strong> It is important that you share the link to a specific video NOT the folder.</strong>&nbsp; If you share a link to the folder, the videos
 will not play (at least they would not play on my 920).&nbsp; Sharing a link to a specific video opens the folder and you can stream ANY video in the folder.</p>

            Jack, thanks for your efforts (here and elsewhere, including YouTube tutorial) on this topic. Just to add my experience: I uploaded a video to a new SkyDrive folder (type pictures), and that folder showed up as an Album (<i>Videos from SkyDrive</i>) in
 my Photos on my 920. I can open the album, and play the video from there.
<div><br />
<div>advantage: my photos and videos can be accessed from the same place, rather than going to a "Music" app (which is counterintuitive for some folks). No shared links.</div>
<div><br />
<div>disadvantage: you are streaming from the cloud, and there appears to be no "save to phone" option for video as there is for pictures. So to actually get it stored locally, you need to move it directly from your desktop, not through SkyDrive.</div>

<h2>            How to revert back to a usable version of hotmail</h2>
                    <p>Hello &nbsp;- I am a mac user and log into my hotmail account via safari. &nbsp;I know some will say silly you but hey we all can't be perfect. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hotmail had been working fine until yesterday (25/09/18) when the powers that be YET AGAIN changed outlook for the beta (don't get me started on that!!!) and now I can't log out of one of my hotmail accounts to check the others and the advice that I finally
 gave myself after about an hour on the help chat with someone who didn't quite know what was wrong was try using chrome to log in and out (which did indeed work). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link that the help chat gave me to revert back to old hotmail is well out of date and i wondered if anyone knows how I can do this or if its possible to do it!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers in advance&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you were unable to log out to one of your account using Safari but when you try to use Chrome everything is working fine.</p>
<p>With that, I suggest that you try to clear the cache and cookies of your Safari and try to sign-in and sign-out and check if it works.</p>
<p>(To clear cache and cookies of your Safari, kindly contact Apple support.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your Hotmail is on Beta version? It will be more helpful if you could send us a screenshot of the page of your Hotmail so that we have a better view of what your concern is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have cleared the history and cache but this hasn't helped - this is what it looks like on safari and it is the same for all the icons showing - i never accept the beta version but they did something to it the other day and changed the look - hope this
 helps</p>

            I did not ask for Outlook but somehow I got it without asking for it. After&nbsp; I read an email it the disappears and the only way I can find it again is by searching for it. I do not like outlook and I want my MSN account restored. I have been using it for
 quite awhile and it works well for me. Please put it back the way it was before outlook took it over. My browser is Firefox. and my email should be MSN.<br />

<p>Thank you for standing by.</p>
<p>Based on your screenshot, it seems that it's already in the beta version.</p>
<p>Just a follow up question, after the change, you were unable to logout on your account, are you getting any error messages when signing out?</p>
<p>And to clarify, this is only happening with Safari?</p>
<p>Have you also tried using a different computer or device with Safari and getting the same issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted.</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. I never accept beta so the powers that be must have started making accounts on this!!! &nbsp;It was only on safari and I had been checking this account on my ipad which worked fine. &nbsp;The help team asked if I was still having issues with
 it so i checked on my lap top via safari and it has now corrected itself. &nbsp;Many thanks for your time and effort.</p>

<p>Hello MarkHill79,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my understanding, if you migrate users from local Active Directory to Office 365 cloud, the users will appear in Office 365 Admin center as Active Users.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, you failed to migrate two specific users to Office 365 because the domain in their suffixes are not added to Office 365 as an accepted domain. Please remove the affected users from the synced Organization Unit and run the Azure
 AD Connect again. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please give us the below information for further processing.</p>
<p>1. Did you add the domain in the affected users‚Äô suffixes to Office 365?</p>
<p>2. The screenshots of the error message. Since it may contain private information, we will send you a private message to collect them. Click your name on the forum and select
<em>View private messages</em> to access it.</p>
<p>3. Do any other users with the same suffix encounter the same problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Barry</p>

    <title>Xbox Music service &#40;real&#41; music quality - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the_d0lph1n  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Music service &#40;real&#41; music quality</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a question and kind of a discussion starter on music quality. How does Microsoft curate and check the quality of the content on the Xbox Music Marketplace? I'm asking because a lot of the songs I bought on Xbox Music are of rather low quality. Yes,
 I know that they are 320 kbps MP3 files, but it seems a lot of them were converted from lower-quality files, perhaps 128 kbps files. The reason&nbsp;for my suspicion is that if you analyze the purchased MP3 files using an&nbsp;audio spectrum analyzer (I use&nbsp;Spek for
 my analysis), you see a graph that has the telltale marks of a &lt;192 kbps recording.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a real 320 kbps MP3:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9083d348-c34b-43a3-b0cc-c442825bd2d3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is&nbsp;a "320 kbps" MP3 purchased from the Xbox Music Marketplace:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce1497eb-05d2-49b7-8e44-f1890d72a7dd" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will notice that the lower-quality recording has a cut-off line. A lot of the data above that line is missing unlike in the full 320 kbps file where much less data is missing and the cut-off line is both higher and less significant. This results in a
 lower-quality music file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I'm bringing this up is because I like the convenience of Xbox Music as a music player, but the quality of the music is off-putting. By comparison, MP3s bought from the Amazon Music store have real bitrates generally between 224 and 256 kbps compared
 to 192 or below for Xbox Music. And&nbsp;iTunes uses&nbsp;high quality&nbsp;M4A files for its music.&nbsp;Since I use Xbox Music as my daily music player, I would also&nbsp;like to buy music from the store due to its diverse selection (I often use Radio or Explore to find new music
 to listen to). But the lack of quality is making me go to other places to&nbsp;buy music, then play it in Xbox Music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is both a question and a discussion: <strong>can Microsoft make the music publishers sell music at a quality on par with the Amazon marketplace or other services</strong>? And for the community,
<strong>do people care enough about music quality</strong>? I know that I'm a bit more on the technical side of music, but I think all people appreciate high quality music. And if the Xbox Music Marketplace's 30 million songs could all be real 256 kbps or 320
 kbps MP3s, this service could have an advantage over other services that offer lower-quality music (like Spotify)&nbsp;or a weaker selection (like Beatport).</p>

            Second that. I was using Xbox music and was quite happy with it until i tried spotify and the sound quality was immediately and noticeably better (using meridian explorer USB DAC connected to a pair of Ruark Audio MR1). I stopped my xbox subscription.

            I also cancelled my subscription due to the noticeable thin audio quality. This article sums it up exactly. Such a shame as Groove is being integrated in to XBOX games. I can't support what they've done.

            <p>Ugh, that looks pretty disgusting. Now to be fair to Groove Music, I have noticed a marked improvement in the music quality since my post in 2014. I recently redownloaded all of the music I bought on Xbox/Groove Music and almost all songs have better quality
 than before. At some point, the Groove Music team brought higher-quality MP3s into the service, so if you haven't redownloaded your purchases in a while (it was only by accident that I redownloaded a song and discovered the difference), I would suggest doing
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For comparison, the song that I analyzed in the original post was redownloaded and shows a better spectrum graph, shown below. There is noticeably more data in the upper frequencies, as well as a boost in the lower parts as well.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the hint!</p>
<p>Off to re-downloading my purchases...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently "The Final Cut - 2011 Remaster" album is no longer available in the store, so I cannot re-download the song. Still, "The Final Cut" album is available, so I bought the one song for quality comparison purposes (even though is not quite apples-to-apples
 as it is a different master).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that the mp3 quality of this new download&nbsp;is indeed better:</p>

            All PCs and Macs can install and run Microsoft Office, but only ARM devices can install and run the Android version. Hopefully that changes over the next few weeks or months. Maybe Microsoft can do something like an Office Insider program for Intel Android
 device users? <br />

<p>You can only reinstall the same win 10 version you had before signing up for the Preview. If you had Pro you can reinstall it. You don't get to upgrade to Pro if you had Home. It will be the latest version of the RTM windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Horse Betting Advertisement</h2>
                    A lot of people are unaware of the cruelty and slaughtering that happens to the horses in the racing industry. Since I am educated on the issue here, I do not like seeing an advertisement about such a cruel industry. I don't think cruel industries should
 be advertised like this. I do not like being reminded of the barbaric nature of such things. There is no option to close the advertisement. Skype, please inform yourselves on what you're supporting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Hide or Unhide Rows based on a drop down list - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jedediahwebster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hide or Unhide Rows based on a drop down list</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to hide and unhide complete rows if the selection from drop-down changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am doing calculations for the future value of money and I&nbsp;want to show rows (based in years) 1 through 20 only if it is selected, but also show all numbers from 1 to whatever is selected.&nbsp; I probably&nbsp;said that wrong so let me show you below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If 1 is selected from the drop-down box on tab 1 (Data Input C15) then on tab 2 show the row that has 1 in the year spot (Data Table D3).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If 2 is selected from the drop-down box (same as above) then on tab&nbsp;2 show both year 1 and year two (Data Table D4)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If 3 is selected (same as above) then show 1, 2 and 3&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So on and so forth through 20 years and stopping there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, this makes sense and any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Hello JedediahWebster. You want to use a drop-down list and selecting one item, in your example the number 1 would return year 1 on a separate worksheet and hide years 2 and 3. If I selected year 2 from the drop-down list, I would get years 1 and 2 on a separate worksheet. Year 3 would give me years 1 through 3. 
<br />
<br />If would be easy and more practical to use Filters in Excel? That would achieve what you want. Let me know if filters will work. One screenshot.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/359209b1-64c4-43c1-9665-4f3b2e4c40ab?upload=true" />

<p>When i try to insert a caption in my word 2007 document, the document freezes for a while, the caption options box come up but the documents has automatically put itself into protected mode so that i cannot edit it. I unprotect it (there is no password)

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Try the steps in the following order:
<br />
<br />If you have a click to run installation ( office that is activated with an user and password )
<br />
<br /> 1- Reset your password account online first and check if you can sing in online with the new password.
<br /> 2- Just If are you using an office 365 click to Run Product follow the steps: Remove Office 365 license for Subscription based installs (not Shared Computer Licensing scenarios): To remove the Office 365 license, you must run two cscript command lines. The command lines are:         
<br />A. Run C:\program files &lt;x86&gt;\Microsoft office\office15&gt;cscript ospp.vbs /dstatus The above command line will generate a report of the currently installed/activated license.  
<br />B. Make note of value for ‚ÄúLast 5 characters of installed product key‚Äù         
<br />C.  Run C:\program files &lt;x86&gt;\Microsoft office\office15&gt;cscript ospp.vbs /unpkey:‚ÄúLast 5 of installed product key‚Äù For example: C:\program files &lt;x86&gt;\Microsoft office\office15&gt;cscript ospp.vbs /unpkey:WB222. Repeat the step above if necessary until all keys are removed. After running the /unpkey: command line you will see a ‚ÄúProduct Key uninstall successful‚Äù message. You can now close the Command Prompt and move onto Step 2. 
<br />3- Remove cached identities in HKCU registry:   
<br />A. In the Registry Editor navigate to HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0 or 16.0\Common\Identity\Identities and remove all of the identities under \Identities. 
<br />NOTE: If using Shared Computer Licensing remove the above Identities from HKEYUsers\SID. 
<br />
<br />If are you using an office that needs a product key, please save the product key, then repair the office, before do it, you have to check and install the operative systems and office updates.
<br />
<br />Repair steps:
<br />Go to the control panel &gt; open programs and features &gt; click office &gt; click change &gt; and try the quick repair. This will take a few minutes.
<br />If this doesn‚Äôt work try the online repair.
<br />Go to the control panel &gt; open programs and features &gt; click office &gt; click change &gt; and try the online repair. This can take around 10 minutes or more.
<br />
<br />Let me know if this worked for you.
<br />I hope this help. 
<br />
<br />Regards.

<h2>            Mac and the 5300 Xpress Music</h2>
                    Am I right in assuming that there is no way that I can download software that will allow me to transfer songs from my iMacG5 (pre-Intel) (OSX 10.4.1)into my mobile handset? The PC Suite supplied only runs on Windows and the nearest compatible handset is
 apparently the 5700. Any wheezes??

            You don't need PC Suite to transfer songs to your phone. Just connect your phone in normal data transfer mode and drag'n'drop your songs to your memory card.<br />
<br />
Or simply use a card reader.<br />
<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work because your songs are crippled by DRM you've found yet another reason for sticking with non-DRM'ed music.

            I worked that out in the end -thanks. However, I can't work out how to organise the music once the track is "dragged and dropped". Presumably the PC Suite has got some sort of playlist facility so that I wouldn't have to reselect at the end of each track-
 or am I asking too much.

    <title>Microsoft Project Outline Field Codes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eduardoortega3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Project Outline Field Codes</h2>
                    <p>I am currently using Microsoft Project 2010, 32-Bit. I have a rather LARGE FILE. I've experience a&nbsp;loss of data from the certain Outline Code fields when I filter extensively other fields. Has anyone experienced this before?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was is the difference between 32-bit vs 64-bit?</p>

<p>Eduardo,</p>
<p>What do you consider a "large file"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What exactly do you mean by "loss of data"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What other fields are you filtering and what do you mean by "extensively"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The difference between 32-bit and 64-bit is simply to make use of your processor's buss capability, there is no physical or performance difference in Project itself although the 64-bit version may run a little faster for some operations simply because it
 can handle data in larger "chunks".</p>
<p>
</p><p>And perhaps the most important question, is you version of Project fully updated? It should be at version 14.0.7197.5000. If not, run Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

<p>Hello John</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The mpp file I have is 50MB, close to 15K lines.</p>
 and finish fields, and Text7 and Text 8, the data that was previously coded in this field disappears. The entire field does not go black but chunks of the field code disappears. At first I thought perhaps a filter was applied, so I missed certain tasks from
 being coded.&nbsp;I then made sure that no filter/grouping was applied and all tasks were showing. I recoded the field and highlighted all the coded tasks in the outline code fields. After doing my filtering, I noticed certain areas in the outline code were missing

<p>Eduardo,</p>
<p>Except as otherwise noted, (MSFT after the user name), none of us who regularly answer questions on this forum work for, nor are we associated with, Microsoft. We are volunteers who give freely of our time to help users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be really helpful to see any example of your outline code field and the types of filters you are applying. A screen shot might help but if you are unable to post a screen shot, a descriptive example would help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there might be something quick you can try. Try saving your file to XML. Then re-open the XML file in Project. Do you still see the issue? Note, you will lose any custom formatting with this process.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the clarification John.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I cannot provided a screenshot. </p>
<p>As for a descriptive example, I manually inputted a name onto Text2 for all the tasks that belong to a person. (No lookup table was used, just manually inputted the names). Text2 has multiple names inputted for the tasks each name is responsible for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For outline codes, I inputted a task description for Outline Code 1 using a lookup table. I then went to that Outline Code 1, selected a description that applied to every tasks using the pull down option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then used filters, and realized data from, i.e. Outline Code 1 and Text2, these fields was missing (no longer there). The lookup table in Outline Code 1 was still populated, however the actual outline code field column on the schedule was not coded with
 the descriptions I had previously chosen.</p>
<p>Text2, data I had manually entered was no longer there. or partially missing throughout that Text2 column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for saving as an XML, I tried this option (had never done it before) and I got this error. This is what I did. "Save as --&gt; XML formatting --&gt; saved it as an XML --&gt; closed MS Project completely --&gt; Start MS Project --&gt; Open XML file --&gt; I get this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I doing something wrong? </p>

</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Eduardo,</p>
<p>It sounds like you file is corrupt. Often, simply saving to XML and then back to Project will clear minor corruption but that didn't work so you need to use another method. Try methods 1 and 3, in that order explained in the following Wiki article.</p>

    <title>Using programmable mouse buttons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> supagram  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using programmable mouse buttons</h2>
                    My new mouse has a slew of programmable buttons which I would like to put to use - specifically I would like to raise and lower the volume, pause and skip songs.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My computer (Dell Studio 1555) has a set of media keys that can do this but, in the key mapping software I got with the mouse it doesn't recognize these media keys - how can I use programmable mouse buttons to skip, pause, raise and lower the volume of
 songs?</div>

            That really depends on the software that controls the mouse. There's not really anything that can be done on the Zune end. You could try contacting the developer of the mouse software and see if you want to do with it is possible.<br />
