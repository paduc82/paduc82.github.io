    <title>Can Not Download Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can Not Download Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I have a&nbsp;Desktop with windows XP SP3 on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a windows 8 key and I want to upgrade from XP. My plan was to download a windows 8 ISO using the key and&nbsp;install it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Here's the problem though. I go to the Microsoft website at <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only</a> and select "Install Windows 8".&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;new window says "just a little bit longer" and says it's going online, presumably to actually connect to microsoft servers in order to get ready to
 download.&nbsp; At this time my pc is on-line and actively connected to the Internet.&nbsp; About twenty seconds later,&nbsp;the screen&nbsp;says "We can't connect right now" and that I should check my internet connection. However, my Internet connection is working properly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have repeated this several time over a few days with the same results.&nbsp; How do I move forward here?</p>

<div>I updated all drivers.</div>

<div>I ran the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant.&nbsp; My hardware and resources were sufficient.&nbsp; The Key was verified as acceptable.&nbsp; There were no critical issue identified with the compatibility checker although there was an indication of an available update for

<div>When I click Install I get the same problem (" can not connect right now - check the Internet connection").</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Next I try to create installation media by going to the site you suggested ("windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media") which is exclusively for upgrading to Windows 8.1 not 8.&nbsp; As the site says you can not upgrade from XP to 8.1.</div>

            It is 2+ weeks since the first message in this thread. &nbsp;I am getting the same can't connect message while using my browser to research the problem.....I have an adequate connection to the browser and the computer transferred to the download site. &nbsp; I am
 trying to reinstall on a laptop that I had to restore to factory status with Vista operating system. &nbsp;This computer previously upgraded to windows 8 three years ago when I purchased the on-line Windows 8 Pro product key... it worked 3 years ago.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem may actually be with Internet Explorer 8...</p>
<p>You might consider trying Mozilla Firefox or Chrome and see if you have any better luck..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other option I could think of would be to borrow another machine to download the media...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... you can actually install Win 8.1 with a Win 8 key... You just need to use a temporary installation key for the install, then enter your good one after the installation completes to activate it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a list of keys depending on the version you are trying to install...&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I initially thought the problem was with explorer 6 that resulted when I restored the factory installation. &nbsp;I installed all updates, SP1, and SP2. &nbsp;I found I could update the explorer 6 to explorer 9. &nbsp;Both Explorer 9 and Chrome failed the download installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read that the download product key was only good for one computer (and maybe one installation). &nbsp;When I restored the factory installation, the C: drive is reformatted and undoubtedly lost the information of the valid product code on the hard disk. &nbsp;No
 doubt, Microsoft has retained records on previous use of the product key and may be rejecting the latest installation on the original reformatted computer with reinstalled Vista as a second use on a second computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is true, where do I go to in Microsoft to find out if they can reset the product code for another attempt?</p>

What about the second scenario? Your Windows 8 PC dies, and you need to reinstall Windows or transfer the license to another PC. The Microsoft rep explained the process as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
The OEM license is actually non-transferable to another PC. When you buy a PC preinstalled with Windows, that version of Windows is only licensed for that PC and cannot be transferred to a new PC. The transfer of the license must accompany the PC it was licensed
 for. If the customer were able to get that machine fixed, they would simply need to call customer support to re-activate if there were changes big enough to merit PC reset or system recovery unusable.</blockquote>
<p>
So that option would cover a motherboard replacement. But what if the dead PC couldn't be revived and you wanted to install Windows 8 on another PC? You'd be out of luck.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not an expert on the licensing stuff, but preinstalled Windows is not transferable...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had cases in which a motherboard was replaced under warranty by HP...</p>
<p>They had to give the new motherboard the same serial key as the previous one for Win 8.1 to activate...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a OEM System Builder available through retail... It is not transferable either...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that would be transferable would be a the Full Retail version, and most likely a Upgrade version... All providing it was no longer installed on the previous machine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a secondary issue to your not being able to download Win 8 though, and is not related... The key should be valid for a download... Whether it would activate might be another issue, but I couldn't see how it would apply to you regardless...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding is that you have not even been able to download, whatalone install and activate...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through the reinstallation of&nbsp;XP in a HP Desktop recently, and the upgrade to SP3 and all the mess involved... In my case I could not even do most of the Windows Updates required because the Update servers would not function with IE6...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the websites that I tried to find IE8 or higher would not work with IE6 either... I did eventually manage to get IE8&nbsp;for XP installed and everything updated...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is entirely possible that the Win 8&nbsp;download website simply will not function with IE8... It's not that much different than having updates for a OS that can't be accessed by the browser that is included in the OS... Almost like they don't want to make
 it possible...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That stuff about IE9 for XP is baloney... I came across that as well... Microsoft has never made IE9 for XP available...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may even have a IE8 that is NOT for XP... Vista or 7 maybe... just a possibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't&nbsp;even know if Chrome is available for XP, but you might want to give the Mozilla Firefox a try&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>HDMI cables don't need to be 'gold plated to support 4K</p>
<p>
</p><p>There're no such thing as 1.4 HDMI cable or 2.0 cable. </p>
<p>
</p><p>HDMI cables are dumb, they don't have versions, only the interface has versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, any HDMI cable - even the&nbsp; dirt cheap ones -should be good enough for 4K60.&nbsp; The Xbox One X HDMI isn't gold plated.</p>

    <title>Random shutdowns, stop error c000021a - caused by ATI driver&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> f35acepilot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Random shutdowns, stop error c000021a - caused by ATI driver&#63;</h2>
                    Specs:<br />
<br />
I have an hp slimline s3600t with 4 GB of RAM - <a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01570965&amp;tmp_task=prodinfoCategory&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=ca&amp;product=3832297&amp;lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01570965&amp;tmp_task=prodinfoCategory&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=ca&amp;product=3832297&amp;lang=en</a>
<br />
<br />
Except that I replaced the graphics card with the ASUS EAH4650 with Radeon HD 4650 (Which draws too much power for this computer but the technician at the store assured me would work fine)<br />
<br />
<br />
My system worked perfectly for about a month with this setup. But, about a week ago, my vista home premium (completely up to date, 64 bit) started to just randomly shut down while I was playing games, with no warning (no shutdown screen, just instant power
 off). I instantly thought this was an overheating problem, and so rebooted by computer and just let it sit on the desktop for a while. I saw the temperatures seemed to climb gradually until the GPU reached a temperature of about 100 degrees C (The CPUs stayed
 at normal temperature). So, in order to double check, I booted my linux installation and did the same experiment, but here the computer did not shut down, but stayed on as normal while the temperature hit and leveled off at 100 degrees C. When I rebooted my
 computer into windows, I got a blue screen after the windows loading bar and before the login screen. It reads:<br />
<br />
"STOP: c000021a {Fatal System Error}<br />
<br />
The initial session process or system process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0x00000000 (0xc0000001 0x00100438)<br />
<br />
The system has been shut down"<br />
<br />
Using driver verifier, I got a 0x000000d5 error, but it did not display the offending driver.<br />
<br />
So this would happen whenever I rebooted my system, but sometime it would randomly let me through. I decided to reinstall windows since I didn't have anything important on there, but I still had the same problem. Finding that Safe Mode still worked, I tried
 to tinker with the driver settings and found that if I disabled my graphics card driver I could successfully boot into windows. I tried into install the original drivers that came with the card, the latest version of the drivers (10.4), and the last version
 of the drivers (10.3), but still the same error. With the new reinstall, even on safe mode, instead of shutting down the monitor would lose the computer's signal even though the system stayed on. The only way to get it back was to reboot. I could still hear
 the windows logoff sounds when I pressed the power off, so I'm sure the computer was still working.
<br />
<br />
I decided that since I was intending to upgrade soon anyway, that I would buy windows 7 home premium and try to upgrade, but in the middle of installation after a reboot a pop-up box would appear for a split second and then the computer would shut itself down
 instantly. I think it said "Setup cannot configure windows for this hardware". <br />
<br />
I have no idea why this started happening. I didn't make any changes that I can think of before the problem that could have caused it. Anyone have any clue?

<p><span><span>Since you re-installed Vistta, it is most likely a hardware or driver problem (perhpas a conflict with Vista) but I can't
 tell without more information from the blue screen.&nbsp; Please post EVERYTING it says EXACTLY word-for-word including all the codes.&nbsp; Then we might be able to find the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Read the posts and follow the procedures set forth by Spirit MVP in the following thread regarding the Blue Screen of Death.&nbsp;
 They should help you resolve your problem. </span><span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/8cd8362e-7d06-46fb-afd7-84d54b6a8ea7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/8cd8362e-7d06-46fb-afd7-84d54b6a8ea7</a><span>.&nbsp;
 Ignore the options checking the system files and software since you did a full re-installation - concentrate on the bluescrreen solution links and anything hardware or driver-related.</span></span></span></p>

            Ok, this morning the computer decided to boot normally into vista without a problem. The drivers and video card worked then, and I left the computer on for more than an hour without it shutting itself down. But when I tried upgrade to windows 7 again,
 I got the "Setup cannot configure windows for this hardware" error and the problem reappeared.<br />

    <title>Stolen Surface Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mercedespaulino  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stolen Surface Pro</h2>
                    Hello all: I purchased a brand new surface pro 4! well, I went to Starbucks and somehow someone walked out with a brand new surface pro that they didn't pay for! The location where I was supposedly didn't have visibility in the camera -___-. So, my question
 is: can this device be reported stolen and locked? I mean, I don't want the person who stole it to use it, it is not fair. I asked the person in the store and they said Microsoft doesn't offer such service -which I think it's a bit incredible taking in consideration
 the price of the pro-, so I wanted to know if anyone here knows how to go about it.

<h2>            HRESULT&#58; 0x80070003 is making me crazy&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I was attempting to make my already smooth running Asus UX run smoother by getting rid of some Windows applications and running Slim Driver. Everything seemed to go fine until I tried to download iTunes and I recieved this message:<br />
<br />
An error occurred during the installation of assembly ‘Microsoft.VC80.CRT ,type=”win32”,version=”8.050727.6195”,publicKeyToken=”1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b”,pro cessorArchitecture=”x86’”. Please refer to Help and Support for more information.
 HRESULT: 0x80070003. <br />
<br />
From the research I've done it seems that the problem lies in the Framework.net I tried to repair and download a new version of it and it still gave me the above message. All my drivers and updated as well as windows.<br />
<br />
I do not have my original Windows 7 disk or else I would try reloading it. If anyone has any ideas on what I can do to fix this problem I would be forever grateful.<br />
<br />
Thanks!!<br />
Noah

    <title>Windows Media Player 12 doesn&#39;t recognize RTSP protocol - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fred.mcfly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 doesn&#39;t recognize RTSP protocol</h2>
                    I am trying to stream a live feed through RTSP and get the error: "Windows Media Player cannot play the file because the specified protocol is not supported. If you typed a URL in the Open URL dialog box, try using a different transport protocol (for example,
 "http:" or "rtsp:")."<br />
<br />
I have read http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940029/en-us and tried the resolutions suggested and they have not worked.<br />
<br />
I have removed WMP through "Turn Windows Features On and Off" and then manually deleted WMP from Program Files and also the files in the User directory. Yes, I reboot after turning off WMP.<br />
<br />
The URL is valid as I can get the feed through VLC just fine.<br />
<br />
I have turned off the Firewall in an attempt to verify that it is not blocking ports (you would think it would not be blocking ports since I can get the feed through VLC, but I tried it just in case).<br />
I have also reduced my IE security settings to the lowest settings to see if it was a settings issue. Still got the error.<br />
<br />
I do not have McAffee (others have suggested that this might cause some issues with streaming).<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 x64 Professional. Other computers using Windows 7 x64 Pro can get the RTSP stream from Windows Media Player 12 (I have verified that they have the same build of WMP that I do).<br />
<br />
I have compared registry settings between those computers that work and mine for Windows Media Player with no success.<br />
<br />
I have tried to connect to different RTSP feeds and I get the same error as stated above.<br />
<br />
I could really use some help I am out of ideas.<br />
<br />

<h2>            HOW TO TURN OFF NARRATOR ON LOG IN&#63;</h2>
                    I cannot get past logging in. Narrator is turned on. I cannot type properly. I tried to turn off Narrator and it will say it is turning off but narrator is still saying everything I do. Everytime I try to hit the keys random letters it says HIDDEN. However
 Control keys, Alt, &nbsp;Shift and Caps Lock works. But I cannot log in and type my password. &nbsp;I cant access anything. Please help. Im going crazy. I want to smash my laptop. I am using windows 8.

<h2>            Can&#39;t click or activate the lower-right part of screen&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ok. For some reason, I cant seem to click or activate the lower part of my screen.. I can use my scroll bar, click on links, etc-- Anything that's close to that space and area makes the window header at the top white, meaning it hasn't been clicked. And
 to make mater worse, right-click and this box pops up with this menu.&nbsp;And it does nothing? Even when I restart everything, this problem still occurs and its very frustrating.. Is this some sort of virus or have anyone of you dealt with this before?</p>

<h2>            Peculiar carousel&#58; endless Windows 1903 update cycle</h2>
                    <p>Trying to update Windows 10 from version 1809 to version 1903. <br />
Update seems to go well until Windows asks, as usual, the user to restart, but after restart Windows boots only back to1809, not to 1903.<br />
<br />
Windows update history is very peculiar, showing this endless cycle:<br />
<br />
UPDATE HISTORY&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Feature Updates (1)<br />
Feature update to Windows 10, version 1903 <br />
Requires a restart to finish installing<br />
<br />
Feature Updates (2)<br />
Feature update to Windows 10, version 1903 <br />
Requires a restart to finish installing<br />
<br />
Feature Updates (3)<br />
etc etc - the same cycle continues endlessly<br />
<br />
Any fellow sufferer with this kind of symptom? </p>

<br />Additional troubleshooting tips:
<br />
<br />We are aware of reports from users experiencing problems installing the latest Feature Update, version 1903 which is in the process of rolling out.
<br />
<br />A couple issues we are aware of that might block the upgrade include the following:
<br />
<br />- You need to ensure you have 10 to 16 GBs of free space.
<br />- If there is a SD card installed, uninstall it or disable it.
<br />- Disconnect any usb drives.
<br />
<br />Free up space:

            Hi Markku
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>Same issue here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem on 1803. Microsoft support were useless. I went through all of the suggested solutions online (the same ones being suggested this time). I had support connect to my computer and go through all the same steps again (they insisted as
 if i was lying about having completed them). There was hours and hours of wasted time while they romised to escalte trough tires of support and call me back but calls were not completed when promised more often than not . In the end the official advice was
 to complete a full destructive reinstall of Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is compatible, has enough memory, has no external USB, full bios updates, etc etc. Last time I managed to get a non-destructive update to run from the media Creation Tool. But even that won't work this time. (sighs)</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have tried from a USB image this time but it just says "install failed". (After a few hours, of course.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be dual booting some flavour of Linux if I have to destroy Windows with a view to moving from MS altogether. Software as a service is just not working, is it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS really need to get this resolved. Stop concentrating on your cloud users and get back to basic. Without windows, you're nothing. Over time the leak to elsewhere will hurt the bottom line.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
The real issue is how well the 90 minute disks work.<br />
<br />
If your drive supports it then WMP should also play them (assuming the information is written<br />
in standard formats).<br />
<br />
Where can I find the new 90 minute CD-R discs? Why were they previously unavailable?<br />

<h2>            Black screen in Windows Vista.</h2>
                    When my computer has not been used for a while, the screen turns black. Normally I can turn it on again by moving the mouse or touching the keyboard. But sometimes it is not possible to turn it on again and I have to use the main power button on the CPU
 to shut it down and start again.

<h3> wafflegod54  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t prioritize Etherenet for File Transfer</h2>
                    <p>Windows wont transfer files over Ethernet, It keeps doing so over WiFi, Unless WiFi is off, Then it transfers no problem. If WiFi is re-enabled Ethernet continues to transfer but only while that transfer is running</p>
<p>Windows is up to date: OS Version 1809</p>
<p>Drivers are up to date</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a small Ethernet Network I'm building for CompTIA Network+ Training. There are currently 4 devices online. (All APIPA because its just for private use only)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Node00(Raspberry PI) Switch 1: 169.254.103.190/16</p>
<p>2.Node01(Raspberry PI) Switch 1: 169.254.1.226/16</p>
<p>2.Node02(Windows 10) Switch 2: 169.254.1.15/16</p>
<p>4.Node03(Manjaro Linux on Laptop) Switch 2:169.254.10.21/16</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two switches involved,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switch 1(S1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -Node 00 &amp; Node 01 Connected</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -Link/Act Connected to other switch</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switch 2(S2)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -Node 02 &amp; Node 03 Connected</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -Link/Act Connected to other switch</p>
<p>
</p><p>All IP addresses are APIPA addresses in the same subnet(/16) and can all ping each other and access each others smb Server shares</p>
<p>Node 03(S2) can connect to Node 00(S1) &amp; Node 01(S1) and automatically transfers Via Ethernet but node 02(S2) wont send via Ethernet unless WiFi is disabled</p>
<p>So, Everything is properly connected and configured and both switches can talk to each other.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried prioritizing based on metric over power shell which did nothing</p>

<p>
</p><p>So i checked Control Panel&gt;Network and Internet&gt;Network Connections&gt;Ethernet&gt;Properties&gt;IPV4&gt;Advanced to see if the priority showed the same, and it did</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried completely resting all Networking Setting via: Settings&gt;Network &amp; Internet&gt;Network Reset and redid everything with the same results</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now I'm just completely clueless as to why this wont work, Any idea's?</p>

            I am not a networking expert, but most systems will give priority to Ethernet whenever it is available.&nbsp; I see you are using a 169.xxx.xxx.xxx address, which will usually pop up if the network cannot find a correct IP address....&nbsp; Maybe if you used something
 else it would behave differently.<br />

                    What is this file? When I open it, it looks like someone/thing is trying to access or change the passwords for my user accounts on this computer. The date/time of the file is a date/time when I was not at home. Any help would be appreciated.

            Привет АлександрВасильев3, 1709 - это уже не последняя версия Windows 10, 1803, вы должны перейти прямо к этой версии, чтобы обновить вашу систему и сделать все предыдущие обновления устаревшими. , ,
<br />
<br />При таких основных обновлениях наиболее успешным методом является обновление с Windows 10 ISO - вы загружаете ISO, а затем выполняете автономное обновление
<br />
<br />Нажмите эту ссылку:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />для загрузки средства создания носителя (нажмите «Загрузить инструмент сейчас»), с помощью которого вы можете загрузить последнюю версию Windows 10 ISO (выберите «Создать установочный носитель для другого ПК»), затем выберите ISO
<br />
<br />Когда файл ISO завершает загрузку
<br />
<br />Отключиться от Интернета
<br />
<br />Отключите любой сторонний антивирус, который вы можете запустить
<br />
<br />Затем дважды щелкните по нему, а затем запустите программу Setup.exe, чтобы начать обновление. , ,

            система обновилась у меня до версии 1803. еще начале мая, когда вышло обновление. и все нормально работало. вот вчера пришло обновление&nbsp;<span>KB4103729 и после этого домашний компьютер после перезагрузки выводит черный
 экран вместо рабочего стола. сегодня вот принесли ноутбук с такой же проблемой. я и решил сперва потренироваться восстановить систему на нем. в итоге вы предлагаете скачать ISO образ и установить его по новой на ноутбук?</span>

<h3> bakelentil  say:</h3>
<h2>            LGPO - transfer policy settings between machines</h2>
                    <div>
<div>I wonder if you could help with transferring policy settings from one PC to another.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have used MMC with GPEDIT snap-in to create a fairly robust lock-down policy for non-admin users on my setup machine which I have saved in My Documents folder. I want to apply this policy to other target machines. All the machines are running the latest
 version of Windows 10 Pro and are 'stand alone' machines, not part of a network or domain etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried using the latest version of the LGPO.exe utility from Microsoft but it doesn't seem to work. The backup and restore seems to go through ok but when I sign into the non-admin account none of the policies have been applied.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have any thoughts on why this is happening? I'm working at the limits of my knowledge here so simple answers with explained jargon would be appreciated!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks in advance.</div>
</div>
<div><br />

            Hi Bakelentil ... try the steps in the link provided.
<br />I have done this on many occasions and it has worked.

            Thanks very much for your response. I had come across the method you mentioned but it looks quite complicated and I'm not sure I understand all the steps. Will give it a go. Can some clever person write a script to do this?
