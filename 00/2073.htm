    <title>Old hacked email account, HELP&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Old hacked email account, HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my VERY old email account was hacked around 5 years ago, and since then I have invariably tried to get access to it. I always try and fill out the form that Microsoft suggest, but they tell me that I haven't provided enough information, but I literally
 haven't had access to this account for around 5 years, so there's no way I can possibly provide answers for questions that ask for
<em>recent</em>&nbsp;subject titles (or anything 'recent').</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said, I remember by old password, I have a lot of contacts I can provide, and I also have an email from an old friend saying my account was hacked and I have emails from my hacked account that were sent to another email address I have, which are
 obviously spam messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm asking is if anyone knows how I can contact someone/team/department that can help me, as filling in this recovery form is completely unhelpful, and doesn't allow me to provide my information. If not, maybe someone has some suggestions? I'd be incredibly
 grateful as this is something I've been trying to resolve for years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

<h2>            Personalization of Start Menu on Windows 10 Technical Preview</h2>
                    Hiya, I have pinned all the folders that I use onto the start menu and resized them to small, I wanted to run them down from top to bottom, to give the same degree of functionality as the old start menu, but am unable to find a way of making the slots
 single unit. It places the next icon next to the one I have placed rather than below it, my question is how do I make the tile spaces single slot.<br />

            Hi Daemon,
<div><br />
Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
First of all, you can drag the top of the Start Menu up or down to control how tall it should be. You can stretch it to the top of your display for a tall, thin Start Menu or down toward the task bar for a wide Start Menu. This is particularly useful if you'd
 like to stretch the Start Menu up so that more <br />
application shortcuts are displayed in the left pane. When it comes to the tiles on the right pane, if you really just want the old-fashioned Start button/ Menu experience, without any of the Modern UI live tiles, you can just unpin all of the tiles from the
 Start Menu.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If&nbsp;you want to change or personalize some aspects of the Start menu. Here's where your right mouse button comes into play. For example, you want to add your Documents folder as a tile on the right side of the menu. Right-click the folder and click Pin
 to Start. A tile for your Documents appears on the right.&nbsp;You can just click on any live tile or app or document on the start menu or the desktop simply move it to wherever you like.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If&nbsp;you want to manage certain apps. Click the All Apps setting. Right-click any app, and you'll typically see four options: Open, Uninstall, Pin to Start&nbsp;and Pin to taskbar. Simply click the option you want.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can pin as many tiles as you like and the right pane will automatically expand to accommodate them. Just as you could in the Windows 8 Start Screen, you can also resize the tiles - small, medium, wide, or large depending on the tiles and choose whether
 or not live tile-capable tiles should automatically refresh with live content.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps. Get back to us for further assistance on Windows.</div>

            Hi, thanks for the reply, I already have the tiles as small, what I wanted to do was run them down the side, so they stacked on top of each other, but I can't get the start menu to accept the single tiles it groups them in sets of 4, so the tile I am trying
 to place underneath automatically goes to the side of the previous one. What I wanted to know was how to reduce the tile space on the start menu so it accommodated the small single tiles as units.

            <p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the tiles are resized to small, you will&nbsp;of course find more space to include another tile right next to it. that's how the start screen works!.&nbsp;The app/tile will automatically move to the right side of the available space. You can stack the tiles one
 below the other either by resizing it to a larger size&nbsp;(size 'wide' works perfectly and you will be able to stack them one below the other)&nbsp;or just by moving the same tile to the left side of the Start menu.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: All apps/tiles cannot be resized to all the sizes.&nbsp;There are some limitations.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Office 2013 External WebDAV Trusted Location&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since I am not getting anywhere fast with IIS (here is thread on <a href="http://forums.iis.net/p/1226411/2103348.aspx?WebDAV+with+IIS+8+0+using+Office+2013+Externally" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Office 2013 opening a document on a Windows Mapped WebDAV drive continually prompts for credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way, a setting within Word, <strong>Excel</strong>, Powerpoint, that can ignore that the location is untrusted and open it anyway without prompting for authentication (it does open if we cancel the login prompts and saves directly as well)?
 Or force Office apps to use the windows authentication that successfully mapped the webdav drive?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Auto-updating TOC in PPT 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael simmons pm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto-updating TOC in PPT 2010</h2>
                    <p>OK, so I have a PPT with over 50 slides that we use to track project summaries. The first three pages of the PPT are an index&nbsp;of slide numbers and what is on that slide. The problem is, when projects are added, or projects are completed, slides are added/removed
 and the order changes. This makes it so someone has to go in and change the numbers to all of the slides represented in the index so that the index is accurate.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way, to make it so that if someone adds a slide in the 26th slide order (example), that it calls out that slide in the index as number 26 and adds one to all of the corresponding slides.. old slide 26 will now be 27 etc.. And now whenever I add
 or delete a slide, the index will still accurately indicate the slide number and title automatically. Is this possible?</p>

<p>Sorry I don't know PPT well enough to provide a good answer, hopefully one of the "pro's" will come up with something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a couple of questions and an alternative approach to suggest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are you doing this in PPT?&nbsp; Simply because you are most familiar with it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is using PPT an absolute requirement?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How are you creating the TOC? It sounds like it is completely manual. In a quick google I could not find a native way of generating a TOC in PPT. Automated TOCs seem only to be available through various addin tools or macros.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestion 1: in the "TOC", rather than referring to slide numbers insert a hyperlink to the slide title text. That won't change, and the link should get you to the right place regardless of changes to slide order (I hope).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The alternative I am suggesting is to move this document into Word instead of PPT.&nbsp; Using heading styles you can autogenerate the TOC as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you must bring it into PPT, set the Word document up as a PPT "Outline" that you can "import" into PowerPoint, ie:</p>
<p>http://www.indezine.com/products/powerpoint/learn/interface/creating-outlines-in-word-2010.html</p>
<p>That way you can use heading styles to auto generate the TOC in Word.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So the process could be, make changes in the Word "Outline", then import them into PPT to completely regenerate the slide show.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I haven't tried exactly this, so I don't know if the Word TOC will still be useful after being imported into PPT &lt;sigh&gt;.

<p>Rohn's correct, there's no built-in way of creating TOCs in PPT; his suggestion of creating links to the slides rather than to slide numbers is a very good one, and probably your best bet (unless one of the macros/add-ins he mentions might meet your needs/budget).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think a TOC created in Word and brought back into PPT would work, but you could possibly create your document in Word, with slides pasted in from PPT or exported as, e.g. PNG, then inserted into Word.&nbsp;

<h3> pauby  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2013 - Microsoft Clipper Not Working In FireFox</h2>
                    <p>I have Firefox 29 (just updated) and also just installed the Microsoft Clipper for Firefox (from https://www.onenote.com/Clipper/OneNote). Note that this
<strong>isn't</strong> a Firefox Add-On but the actual Microsoft provided one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I try to clip a web page using the bookmark installed from the above page, I get:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1. The page 'Sign in to save your clip' with the 'Sign-In' button appears;</p>
<p>Step 2. I sign-in, (note this only happens sometimes so I assume it's dependent on cookies etc.);</p>
<p>Step 3. I get the page asking me to confirm I want to clip the page or cancel it. I click the button to clip it;</p>
<p>Step 4. The same page as appears in Step 1 appears again right away; and I click the 'Sign-In' button;</p>
<p>Step 5. That page disappears for a second or so and we go back to the page at Step 1 around and around;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the upshot of this is the page does NOT get clipped. No matter what I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A slight slant on this however is that if I try to clip the OneNote page (the clipper page at the start of this for example) it does clip fine and I get a bar at the top of the screen telling me it has clipped the page. No other Microsoft sites appear to
 work the same way however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have done to troubleshoot:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have restarted Firefox without any add-ons installed just to ensure it's not one of them;</p>
<p>2. I have turned off pop-up blocking;</p>
<p>3. I have enabled cookies being stored for third party sites for *.onenote.com and *.microsoft.com;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure where else to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody help?</p>

            <p>After trying to sign in using the bookmarklet from Firefox on Windows 7 x64, I got stuck at 404 Not found on a redirect URL beginning with https://www.onenote.com/authredir?url=.... And I was happy to find a clipper officially provided by Microsoft. ;)
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit</strong> - I was too hasty - it works, in other tabs than the one in which I've signed in. Seems there is some server misconfiguration that prevented sign in from working correctly all the way through, but otherwise, it works.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Windows is 7, both latest FireFox and IE11 expose the same behavior: the Sign In screen with the Sign In button, click it, get the login form, log in, will get back to the Sign In screen with the Sign In button. No clipping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I retry clipping after this, I will get the Sign In screen with the Sign In button again, click it, the login form won't appear anymore (it will just blink an empty pop-up), and I will get back to the Sign In screen. No clipping, of course.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Lol. Microsoft don't care about these issues. The new agile Microsoft release cycles are much quicker now. That should also include releasing fixes but it doesn't. It seems to be release it. Leave it. Release it with more features. Leave it. Release with
 more features.... ad infinitum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, we could forgive that if they had the decency to even reply to this thread. But they don't even do that. It;'s only a few of us that have this issue but we've shown it's diverse enough that others WILL have this problem but don't post here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>... that's the world of software these days. That's the world of Microsoft. And others. And they are all wondering why Open Source is so popular. Generally you can at least speak to somebody who can help you either a developer or support.

<h2>            MS Project will not let me change task type</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I change the task type in MS Project (either directly in the column, or under the advanced tab in the task information), MS Project resets it immediately. It is not greyed out and the tasks are of course auto scheduled, it just will not change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I change the default task type, then new task have the change I applied - but I would rather not have to make new tasks every time I want to change an activity...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions? All help is appreciated! Thanks!</p>

<p>SindreSa,</p>
<p>First of all, what version of Project are you using? Is it fully updated? Note, subscription forms of Project (e.g. Project 465 or Project Online) are updated automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't think of any scenarios where Project does not allow the user to change task type. Does this happen on just this file, or does it also occur if you create a new test file and attempt to change the task type after creating tasks? If it only happens
 with the one file, the file might have some corruption. You can try saving to XML and then re-opening the XML file in Project. If it also happens with a new file, you might try repairing Project through the Windows Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might also be a corrupt Global. In that case, find your working Global file, move it to the trash and then restart Project. A new default Global will be generated. Note, you will lose any custom views, tables, filters, etc. with this process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>John</p>

<h2>            Opening downloaded free resume from MS Office online .docx file in 2003 office&#63;</h2>
                    <p>XP Pro, sp3, Office suite 2000 with upgrade to 2003. I have all the XP updates to date and office service packs 2003. I thought Office 2003 Standard edition had resume templates in the program but I searched and nothing comes up but it lists a online link.
</p>
<p>I went there (Office online) and downloaded a free resume but it's a .docx file. &nbsp;Can't open it. What's up?</p>

            You cannot use Word 2007 templates in Word 2003. While there may be some Word 2003 templates in the Office Templates Gallery, you should have

<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t everyone see the voting buttons when I send out a polling email&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently sent a voting email out to several clients, all of whom use&nbsp;Office 2007 or 2010. Most of the people had no problem and voted, responses were recieved from people using both 2007 and 2010. A few people did not have the buttons appear on their message,
 but all insist that they have used voting button successfully in the past. We are all using a Microsoft Exchange Server, but probably different versions. An ideas on why they can't vote? The only thing I am coming up with that we aren't all using the same
 ISP or web client?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Created functions not updating&#47;calculating automatically</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have found a couple of formulas on this forum to count cells in a range by color. Both formulas work but neither update automatically. ( have pasted the simplest of the two below).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my Calculation Options set to Automatic and the standard formulas update automatically as they are supposed to. It's only the created function that doesn't automatically update. Any ideas?
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Function:</strong></p>
<p>Function Countcolour(rng As Range, colour As Range) As Long<br />
Dim c As Range<br />
Application.Volatile<br />
For Each c In rng<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If c.Interior.ColorIndex = colour.Interior.ColorIndex Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Countcolour = Countcolour + 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
Next<br />
End Function</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
<p>=Countcolour(B5:S37,A8) </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p><span>Generally, there could be a way to do it by a circumvention. The method of an auxiliary (helping) column parallel to active cells was used currently in the older programming; now is being partly
 forget. If you set a flag (number, character etc.) into a cell adjacent (or equally distant) to the cell you want to color up, you can set each of cell colors by a conditional format. It is usually required that the flag column would be hidden, though this
 need not to be a common situation. The trick is then in setting such a flag. The best way is a macro subroutine. After you activate a cell to be colored up, you call the macro that changes the flag (i.e. from empty to 1). The macro should be best activated
 by a key shortcut. An example of macro that even toggles, as the result, the color on and off:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Option Explicit</span></p>
<p><span>Sub ColorCell()</span></p>
<p><span>Const Flag As Long = 1, Zero As Long = 0</span></p>
<p><span>If ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1) &lt;&gt; Flag Then</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>
ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Value = Flag</span></p>
<p><span>Else</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>
ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Value = Zero</span></p>
<p><span>End If</span></p>
<p><span>End Sub</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you can see, you will obtain the readily activated conditional sum of A1:A20 with input 1’s in B1:B20 as the function</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>=SUMIF(B1:B20, 1, A1:A20).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you can also see, when there is no need for hiding the auxiliary column, you can input the flags in a direct way.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards</span></p>

<h2>            SSL Certificate expired in one computer but OK in other &#40; the time in both computers is the same&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello and thanks in advance. I have a problem with a https conexion in one computer. I have tried with IE, Firefox, and Chrome but always it sais that the certificate is expired. It expired two days ago, I've checked the date time in my computer and its
 fine. But when i try to connect to the same web page with an other computer, it goes ok, and has an other certificate with an other expiration date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I have a new not-expired certificate from that page like in the other computer?</p>

                    I have been using Microsoft Lumia 640 xl for past two months. I brought it from my near local store. It works fine for few days. After some days I have issue that while I'm calling to somebody It shows dialling for about 10 minutes. While I'm pressing
 "End Call" button it shows ending for about 10 minutes and so on... So I restart the phone and it works fine.... The problem persists in my phone at least daily 2-5 times so i'm unable make urgent calls..&nbsp;When I'm calling from my landline to my Lumia it&nbsp;told
 "not reachable". Please help me to fix this issue&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Try soft reset the phone. This will refreshes the OS and will not occur data loss.

 office Chennai. It has come back repaired, but the service centre cannot tell me what repair has been carried out. The problem however remains ( a little reduced compared to before it was sent). So i am notable to use the phone to its actual potential. From
 the screen i cannot know if something is wrong. Only when i make a call then i realise there is a problem. if i switch off and on then it works fine.
</p>
<p>Did you get the problem rectified. if yes how. pls share. I dont think the nokia service centre knows anything at all.</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>best regards</p>

            <p>Hi <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/705d8a32-0f95-4521-9e15-0999394551f2" title="maheshsubramanian">
The first thing to try in case of connectivity issues is replace the SIM card. The operator should provide a replacement SIM for free when the trouble is explained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your 640 is the dual-SIM variant, things may be more complex. - There is a bug in older Lumia dual-SIM phones that is so far not resolved, and that may have carried forward to the new models. The ugly, but most reliable workaround on e.g. Lumia 630 DS
 is to set the maximum speed on both SIMs to 2G, and only enable higher speed when needed. - Please read the post by

<p>
</p><p>Once the basic troubleshooting is completed, a persistent issue in a basic phone feature must be resolved by replacement, repair, or ultimately a refund, through your retailer and the local, official support channels.<br />
It is up to you to persist until resolved. The forum cannot help with that.</p>

            I am also facing similar issue. But for me it happens overnight. Not during the day. If i use the phone without micro SD card, it works fine. I feel it is something to do with the micro SD card slot or the ability of the phone to handle the card slot.
 When I took it to service center in Bangalore, they performed SW update(once), factory reset (3 times). But problem persists. I dont think the service center's are equipped to handle such issues. Only step they know is factory reset

            My phone freezes with out using the sd card also. I have tried 3sim cards of 2different service providers still I face the same Problem. Thanks for the replies though. I complained and got a call from technical department too. The guy in fact asked me
 to see for few days and if problem persists then asked me to report to the service centre. Don't know what to do with the phone.

            <p>Hi Karolina</p>
<p>i have checked the SD card requriements and using as per the recommendation. I was initially using Sandisk 32gb class 10. Then I bought Transcend 32GB class 10. I am facing problem with both. That is the reason I was mentioning that it is something to do
 with the slot handling capabilities. BTW is skype for business recommended to use on 640 XL</p>

            yes, I have done. But all they do is factory reset or say that we have upgraded the SW. I have already visited 4 times for this issue. Not sure what else I can do to get this resolved.

</p><p>I have skype version 7.40.0.151 the reason I have this one is because I can go back into the history of the chat months to one year back and I also by pressing Ctrl F (open a window to find a keyword) I can retrieve a file, a document, and the buttons Next
 or previous appears to facilitate the search of the keyword you are looking for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By updating to newest version of skype Will I retrieve after the update all my hisotry back and all chat in each contact? will the update keep all informations and files and data that have been sent?</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that you'd be able to retrieve the entire chat history after updating the Skype version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be advised that history older than a year is only stored locally on your machine and is not backed up in the cloud. We recommend that you export the history file from Skype and save it to your preferred storage location.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a desktop computer where power is always connected. Therefore, the bug does not affect me and all those with desktops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, a new build can be released with known issues published so that insiders that connect power to their devices do not install this build.</p>
<p>

            Except that it is unlikely that many Insiders read the known issues <em>before&nbsp;</em>installing previews.&nbsp; In fact, I wonder how many ever read the blogs and how many don't even know about them.&nbsp; I am going to shamelessly plug again for an
<strong>Insider app </strong>that could flash this kind of info to <em>all 14 million</em> Insiders.&nbsp; Then maybe it would be feasible to flight a build with such a problem, though I doubt the wisdom of doing so in any scenario.

            &nbsp;Yes I'll vote for that, Colin.&nbsp; It's an interesting phenomenon that there are people who can write but can't read.&nbsp; I don't know where they come from; I never met any of them when I was in school.&nbsp; But even if we get that&nbsp;<strong>Insider app&nbsp;</strong>that
 flashes the info to 14 million insiders, do you think they'd all read it?&nbsp; I'm inclined to wonder about that.

            Of course they won't all read it.&nbsp; Some would even turn off the notifications.&nbsp; Millions would ignore flashes.&nbsp; But the point is that MSFT is relying on Insiders to pro-actively look for info while flash communications are at least sent to all.&nbsp; You can

<p>Hi Hula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're pointing out to me to be the person who can write but can't read, that was a joke I made. I wasn't serious. I thought it could be understandable. I guess it is cultural differences that my joke is not understood.</p>

            Thats odd, in the 17025.1000 update log (slow ring), I noticed power checks before package updates and close to end it was reporting Power to be (unknown), then recovered with AC. Wonder if that's what Dona is referring to?

    <title>Opting out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dragun50  say:</h3>
<h2>            Opting out</h2>
                    <p>I have been around computers since they first came out. I started with a Vic 20, then Commodore, on to a Tandy, then to my first 286. I built my own in the day when you wanted to increase the RAM, you had to unsolder and solder in the new on the motherboard.</p>
<p>As far as software, it was DOS, and so on.</p>
<p>I went with PC as apposed to Apple because even the first IBM were like the Apples. One had to take them back to the store to get improvements. I am not one to do that when I can do it myself.</p>
<p>I think I have always been a Microsoft person, partly because back then it was Microsoft that was really being jerked around.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am now to the point that I will probably start getting rid of all Microsoft. For me it is just disappointing that they no longer allow anyone to join the "Skip ahead" part. If this is how it is, then why even show it in the Windows Insider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, but it is just stupid to leave it as an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me it is now time to say good bye to a company and program that I have liked, defended and when I had my own computer business prompted as the only way to go. Time have really changed and in a lot of ways not for the better. I/t was easier to get to
 test things like Windows 95, NT as well as Office then it is to get involved with the cutting edge now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will be different, but I will be making the switch to Apple and see if they are at least somewhat more attune to people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have fun all.</p>

            Skip ahead is only short term with a limited number of seats. It is done on a first come first served basis and you need to check back every so often to see if you can get in. It will be merged back into the fast ring once the next public build of Windows
 10 has been released.

<p>Agreed. They have opened it and closed it again recently. Even if you clean install it seems some of us have rejoined Skip ahead without problems.</p>

<p>Skip Ahead is a limited choice in order to ensure enough folks remain with the current cycle to finish the job.&nbsp; Skip Ahead is boring the first couple of months anyway because all of the development is focused on building the foundations for new features
 rather than on the new features themselves.&nbsp; There is literally nothing new to see, usually until a month or so after the launch of the latest version.&nbsp; In this case, I don't expect to see anything new in RS5 until at least May.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, in RS4 the in-box apps are frozen (no updates) and in RS5 the apps continue to be updated.&nbsp; That is the only visible "newness" in RS5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a word of advice.&nbsp; If you think threatening to do something, like "leaving Microsoft behind forever" is an effective way to get change, it isn't.&nbsp; Folks just see it as a play for attention and ignore it.&nbsp; If you really mean to do something, just do
 it in the first place.</p>

<p>If you think I was making a threat, sorry to disappoint. What I was doing was stating fact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want attention, in fact I really don't want anything. I was just stating that is if the Skip Ahead was so limited, then why leave it in the Windows Inside place.</p>
<p>Hell once they had the number they want, just remove it until they need it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Microsoft used to do beta testing, that was the route they took. After Windows 95 in fact, one had to be invited to Windows NT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, just so you know, I was making no threat, I already know what I do matters not to Microsoft or anyone else.</p>

</p><p>Skip Ahead is a rough and ready addition to Fast Ring and certainly not a polished product.&nbsp; But who cares?&nbsp; It gets the job done, which is to give a few people who care more about seeing what is developing with in-box apps a continuing look and an escape
 from the tedium of the last month or so of "spit and polish" bugswatting.&nbsp; MSFT freezes the current cycle's in-box app development the last six weeks or so in order to shift the build lab's focus to finishing the core components for the fast-approaching release
 of the new Windows version.&nbsp; In-box app development by the teams that own the apps does continue and these changes are incorporated into the next cycle's development (Skip Ahead) and can be reviewed by Skip Ahead Insiders. &nbsp; Skip Ahead is for folks more interested
 in the apps than in Windows itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I'm in the Skip ring on one of my 9 Insider installs, and I agree with Colin's comments that you're not missing much.&nbsp; As to background, I've been working with computers since the mainframe's heyday, long before the Vic 20.&nbsp; If you're leaving Insiders because
 you're bored or tired of it, that's fine.&nbsp; If you're leaving because you can't get into the Skip ahead ring, I have to say I think you're "making a mountain out of a mole hill".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Microsoft is a big corporation, and most of these are far from perfect.&nbsp; Windows is far from perfect, but still it's a pretty d*mn good OS.&nbsp; MSFT stock is up over 60% in the last 12 months, so I have to believe they're doing a lot of things well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not feasible to update the Office activation reports manually. Also, we originally see the same behavior, but now it seems that activation report is not available now. You can also check if it works on your side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand it is poor experience with the wrong data in reports. For this behavior, you can share the same with our related team via Uservoice, which is the best channel to influence the product.</p>

            The 6110 uses route 66 for it's navigation program and you have to pay route 66 for map updates.<br />
<br />
It's like most sat navs (tomtom, garmin, navman etc) you have to pay to get new maps.<br />
<br />
Nokia maps is the exception, you get the maps for free but you have to pay for navigation.

My partner has a Garman GPS and they didn't have to pay for any of their maps so why do we have to pay for the basic gear to get the phone to work.<br />
If I knew that this phone was going to be such as pain to get up and running I would have never bought it. I bought this phone on the hear say of others but not one **bleep** person told me that every map was going to cost me 9.95 euro to get a map for this
 phone. It is going to cost me 140euro just to get basic maps of adelaide for me to use with this phone

            You do have to pay for Garmin maps, Im not sure what your on about.<br />
<br />
You might have the Euro maps package, but for updated maps you still have to pay.<br />
<br />
And the maps come free with the navigator for your region. If you bought the phone from another region however, you obviously wont have the correct maps prepaid.

            and if you want australia, get the australia map for nearly 50 euro, and not he single citymaps for 10 euros. the australia map includes those cities with the same detail as the city maps, so it would be a total waste of money.<br />
if you buy a pna, the navigationmaps are preinstalled, however the preinstalled cards also depend of the price of the PNA, and dont forget, those are just for navigation, the nokia 6110 navigator is still a phone, and was not JUST designed for navigation. each
 nokia 6110 navi however comes with a new regional map preinstalled, if you bought it in australia, you usually got already australia map preinstalled, ready to use and for free.

You have two options:<br />
<br />
1) Use Nokia Map Loader. That takes forever, requires you to install .net framework, and if you run Linux or have a Mac it won't work at all.<br />
<br />
2) Go to <a href="http://nokiamaps.moo.no" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://nokiamaps.moo.no</a> and follow the instructions on top of the page. Works on any operating system with any browser, and you don't need to install anything.

            @ Diabo ,Nokia map loader is for N-series phones.6110 Navigator uses route 66 and has the Nokia map manager for installing maps which is fast and no hassles.<br />
<br />
My question was not issues with map but how to update them.When i did route 66 sync it told me "you have new free updates" but when i installed them it still shows "middle east 2006 Q4" while new maps are "Persian Gulf 2007 Q2" Navigation wise i have had no
 problems with this phone and it outperforms the smart2go solution of N-series anyday.Its only that maps are getting too old and as some guys have mentioned here its EUR 9.95 for each city. Well thank God the UAE is a small country :)

<h2>            Mail Merge &#39;if&#39; statements not working with negative numbers</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a really strange problem. I can't get Word to deal with negative numbers as I'd expect when I'm attempting to show numbers less than -0.2.<br />
<br />
The statement looks like this:<br />
<br />
{IF { MERGEFIELD variable } = "" "No Data" {IF { MERGEFIELD variable }&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; "0.2" {MERGEFIELD variable } {IF { MERGEFIELD variable } &lt;"-0.2"&nbsp;{ MERGEFIELD variable } "No Change" }}}<br />
<br />
What I'm expecting to happen is every score between -0.2 and 0.2 is reported as 'No Change'. As some examples of what I'd expect:<br />
<br />
School 1's score is 1, Word reports it as 1</p>
<p>School 2's score is -0.1, Word reports it as 'No Change'<br />
School 3's score is -0.4, Word reports it as -0.4</p>
<p>School 4's score is missing, Word reports it as "No Data"<br />
<br />
Everything is working, except in my example School's 2's actual score 0.1 would be shown. If I move the "&lt; -0.2" part to being a positive number, this works perfectly. Is there a trick to getting Word to recognise 'Less than -0.2'?</p>
<p><br />
I've been wrestling with this on and off for over a week! Any help appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Anthony Roppa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and we are happy to assist you in setting up your Outlook account from your phone. This happens when your account went out of sync with the phone, or the mail server settings were not configured properly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can resolve this through any of the following steps:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Removing and re-adding your account from the phone. Check out this link for the steps:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook-to-go#1TC=t1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Mobile Outlook.com</span></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-style: italic">(Restart
 the phone for the changes to take effect.)</span> </span></li><li><span><span>Ensure that the mail server settings are properly configured. Refer to this link for the values:<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/send-receive-email-from-mail-client" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Send and receive
 Hotmail from an email app</span></a></span></li><li>
<div><span>Set the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Mail days to sync<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>to a shorter timeframe since this will eliminate any bandwidth issues.</span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span>Moving the emails from inbox to a temp folder. This is to determine if there are corrupted emails causing synchronization problems.</span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span>Make sure that your Microsoft account password is not too long, and must be no longer than 16 characters. If it is too long, go to the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://account.live.com/Password/Change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Change your password</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span>page
 and change it to a shorter password.</span></div>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if the above steps worked. If not, you can also try the following on your phone:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Remove the email account from the Outlook mail app.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Add the account again using<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Mobile data</strong>, not WiFi.</div>
</li><li>
<div>It should prompt for the following message "<em>The server is using a self-signed authentication certificate. Do you want to login anyway?</em>", then click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Accept</strong>.</div>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inform us if it worked or if you need further clarifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hello. I tried all of your suggestions. They do not work. According to a recent thread on MS site there are many people with this issue. I have used Hotmail and outlook for almost 20 years. A few days ago I was forced to upgrade from Hotmail app to outlook
 app. I did and received authentication failure. Please help.&nbsp;

            <p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My experience is as above and the fixes suggested do not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 'authentication failure' message appears after I have clicked either yes or no to
<a href="http://www.seven.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.seven.com</a>&nbsp;permission to manage contacts, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps you could offer a solution without the <a href="http://www.seven.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.seven.com</a>&nbsp;add-in?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried removing all email and accounts from my HTC Android, restarted the phone and re-installed Oulook mail for Android, all to no affect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, Nick P</p>

            Hi Everyone here,
<div><br />
<div>I'm sure many of you already know this, but just in case, here is a short term fix until Microsoft fixes the app - as opposed to the suggestions which obviously don't address the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To get email on your android phone, use the generic "Email" app. It's preloaded on your phone and can be found in the "Applications" section.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you have a Samsung, I suggest you use "Samsung Email" - again, it's on your phone and under "Applications".</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps a little until the whole silly Outlook thing is addressed. I'm not optimistic it'll be addressed anytime soon...</div>
        </p>

            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand your frustration regarding the authentication failure message that you're getting when using the Outlook application on your mobile devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read your posts and confirmed that you are indeed experiencing the issue that&nbsp;is now&nbsp;being encountered by&nbsp;many users. This issue is already known to us and our product group is currently looking to it. For the meantime, a workaround is by using the
 previous application. It's the application for Hotmail. Since you are using Android devices, you can download it
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hotmail.Z7&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate your cooperation regarding this matter. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
If you have additional inquiries, please post back. We'll be more than happy to help you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately the link you have provided takes us to the Hotmail upgrade to Oulook button which takes us back to where we started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do though like the idea of your giving us Hotmail back, perhaps you could arrange that?</p>

            <p>Should be as simple as uninstalling then reinstalling on the new device, reusing the same license key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you've lost the license key then you can get it by downloading and running the Belarc Advisor utility. This will list all the applications you've got installed and the licnese keys used.<br />
