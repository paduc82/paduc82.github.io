<h2>            The Hierarchy of Xbox customer support</h2>
                    
<p>Whom should I ask for in order to get to someone of significance on the&nbsp;(non-tech) support phone line? &nbsp;I have asked for a supervisor or manager several times and received no help. &nbsp;Are there specific titles that can be referred to in order to get different
 levels of support? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Unauthorized access and everyone at microsoft refuses to help. &nbsp;I understand it is in the fraud department's hands and that this is an "unreachable" department and I should just "wait for an e-mail" but I've been waiting for 52 days, I think that's long
 enough. &nbsp;I've also been yelled at, hung up on and told that if I call microsoft will intentionally make it longer for my claim to process. &nbsp;that was from a "supervisor". &nbsp;So I'm looking for someone different to talk to so perhaps I can get someone to help
 me.</p>

<p>I havent gotten the "if you call it will make it longer" response yet but I am sure that is next I am close to day 80 so you best just hunker down and enjoy staring at that brick next to your tv for another month or two. I guess above the supervisors are
 "site managers" which I beleive you will need to request one to call you back as they are not on call center floor. I am sure they will respond just as quickly as the UA folks though</p>

<p>I didn't respond again tothis thread because when I called last week for my weekly "what is Microsoft doing to solve my problem" call a customer service rep said that she was going to re-escalate my problem and that I should get a response within 7 days,
 but more likely less than 3 days because I've been waiting for so long. Well Tuesdays are usually when I call Microsoft, so tomorrow morning will be no different seeing as how I still hadn't received any information. &nbsp;If my case is familiar it's due to me
 posting my story on as many places as I could....but I've given up. I don't expect Microsoft to help anymore. &nbsp;I mean, look at this thread, I'm asking for a hierarchy because I obviously haven't gotten help and I didn't get that information from anyone affiliated
 with xbox, but I do get information from another potentially former Microsoft customer giving their experience. &nbsp;I will ask for a site manager tomorrow, thanks spiderweb.</p>

<p>Right, I've been made aware of that, but I'm not looking to speak to the fraud department, I'm looking to speakto a high enough person on the totem pole that can figure out watt the problem is and offer a resolution. &nbsp;The thing is everytime I call I have
 to explain what I'm going through to a customer service agent then hear their "just wait for an email" response....I'm trying to skip that so when I call each week I can speak directly to someone high enough to see that things aren't getting handled properly.

<p>You're not going to find something like that. They can only transfer to other customer facing lines, not any higher tiers or people with special powers. Unless they're in the same building and they can run and grab somebody, its not going to happen.</p>

<p>Miss Portia - I sent a PM yesterday with my reference number. I also called yesterday and was assured that this time they're going to help me in about 3 days or less. Although this service rep was apologetic and seemed sincere, I heard a very similar response
 last week. &nbsp;I'm just not sure what to believe anymore.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 is garbage</h2>
                    Just wanted to vent and post about how horrible Windows 10 is.  Microsoft has outdone themselves in making such a convoluted mess of an OS.   This is the most frustrating **** I have ever used.  I personally love getting a pop up every minute telling me to update info that I CANNOT ACCESS because Microsoft is making me wait 30 days before accessing to change and update the aforementioned info.   I can't believe we have to put up with this nonsense in order to access services and programs, I would switch to Linux in a heartbeat if it was compatible with more ****.   Thank you Windows 10.

<h2>            &#34;Access denied&#34; when doing ANYTHING with a folder</h2>
                    I downloaded a zip file from usenet and unzipped it. &nbsp; I created a folder c:\temp\ProblemFolder.<br />
<br />
With ProblemFolder I can't do ANYTHING, even as administrator.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't see what's in it, I can't delete it, I can't take ownership, ..., NOTHING.&nbsp; Everything results in an "Access Denied" message.<br />
<br />
This is a major bug in Windows7:&nbsp; NOTHING should be able to stop the owner of a computer, when running Explorer in admin mode, from doing what he please with ANY file or folder on his computer.<br />

            The bug is that Windows doesn't let the me see what it is, take ownership, delete it, rename it, ...,  NOTHING.   Windows won't even tell me who the current owner is!  It should be impossible for someone to not have full control over EVERYTHING on their own personal computer.   The fact that Windows denies me access to something on my own computer is the bug.   What if it is something malicious and I am prevented from deleting it?   What if it is not what I thought I was downloading (subtitles for a TV show) and is kiddie **** instead and I can't even find that out - and delete it?

            <p>What you can or cannot do with a file or folder is strictly spelled out by the Security Permissions that exist on this file or folder...&nbsp; and yes, it is possible for you as administrator to remove all access to a file or folder such that even an administrator
 cannot access it.&nbsp; Think of it as protecting you from yourself.&nbsp; What the administrator can do, though, is change those permissions.&nbsp; You do this by using the "Security" tab under Properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another possibility is that this is an Encrypted File System (EFS) encrypted file.&nbsp; If you do not have the certificate to access this file/folder, it may behave like this.&nbsp; Bring up a command prompt window (Start -&gt; "cmd" (in search block) then "Enter" in
 the search window) and enter the command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cipher /c&nbsp; c:\temp\ProblemFolder</p>
<p>and see if it indicates that it is encrypted.</p>
<p>You may also be able to right-click the directory -&gt; Properties -&gt; Advanced and see if "Encrypt" is checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may get some help or insight from the following articles:</p>

            When I said I couldn't do anything with the folder in question, I meant it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have NO access to this folder of any kind other than seeing its name and location in Explorer.<br />
<br />
The computer in question is one of my home computers and I am the sole user and the sole administrator, yet I can do NOTHING with this folder.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only can I not change the permissions, I can't ever VIEW them to see who has what permissions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly,
 I not only can't take ownership, I can't even see who the current owner is - Win7 shows me, literally, ". . ." where it should be showing me the owner and tells me I don't even have the rights to know who the owner of something on my own computer is.<br />
<br />
I did try your cipher suggestion ... and the same old thing:&nbsp; access denied.&nbsp; And yes, I ran CMD as admin.<br />
Similarly, even merely trying to see the folder's attributes - even at an admin CMD prompt - is ... access denied.<br />
<br />
So I repeat my point:&nbsp; this is MY computer - not MicroSoft's and not the person's who created the file I downloaded.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is absolutely no excuse for my not being able to take ownership and/or change permissions of ANYTHING on *MY* computer.&nbsp; It is a huge
 bug when a computer owner cannot do ANYTHING to examine and, if necessary, delete a potentially hazardous file or folder on his own computer.<br />
<br />
This specific incident is in the process of being solved the hard way by a reformat and reinstall because there seems to be no other way to get that folder off of that computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That should really illustrate the severity of this bug when I can't get rid
 of a potentially hazardous folder in any way other that wiping one of my systems and rebuilding it from scratch.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
BTW:&nbsp; I'm deaf as a doorknob. &nbsp; The file I downloaded was supposed to be zipped up subtitles for a TV program. &nbsp; &nbsp; The subs should have been text files - nothing remotely "executable" or otherwise hazardous.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I upzipped it, it created this utterly inaccessible
 problem folder.<br />

            <p>Wow.&nbsp; If I were you at this point, I'd create a freeware "Hirens Boot CD"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirens Download:&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a>&nbsp;&gt;</p>
<p>(don't be fooled... the real link is a .zip file in a light green rectangle at bottom)</p>
<p>Then you will need to burn it specially using the instructions here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirens Burning &lt; <a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/burning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/burning/</a>&nbsp;&gt;</p>
<p>Then boot your computer from this CD.&nbsp; At the first Black/white screen, select "Mini Windows XP" and let it continue to boot.&nbsp; It will boot into a pre-environment version of XP which pretty much ignores file protections and should let you delete your file.</p>

            After thinking of this for a while, I realize that deleting a file or folder is actually an operation on the folder that contains this file/folder.&nbsp; Perhaps the reason that you have absolutely no access to the folder in question is that the containing
 folder of this folder has given you permission to view the folder but nothing else.&nbsp; Try concentrating on granting yourself full privilege to the containing folder...<br />

            The computer in question has been wiped and rebuilt but I'll remember your suggestion for next time.<br />
<br />
The last thing I tried before the wipe/rebuild was a utility called "Boot Deleter" from BiQubic Solutions.&nbsp; I tested it on meaningless files and folders and it worked OK - then hung the system when I tried it with the problem folder.<br />

            My normal everyday user account had ownership and full control of the containing folder and everything in it until I unzipped file downloaded from usenet.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
As previously discussed, I could not take or even see ownership of the folder created by unzipping that file but I did not think to check if unzipping that file affected ownership of the containing folder.&nbsp; And I have wiped and rebuilt the system - too late
 to check now.<br />

    <title>Windows Defender Memory Leak &#40;Windows 8.1&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Defender Memory Leak &#40;Windows 8.1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Recently, my Acer Aspire V5-573PG has been acting up by stuttering/minor lag whenever I'm playing games. I've noticed that my RAM would rise up until 30-32% even though I'm on desktop without any programs running whatsoever and concluded that this might
 be the cause for the lags I'm experiencing. By checking Task Manager i can see that the usual culprit would be the svchost.exe (which I think MOST users are having issues on, come on Microsoft) but mostly is caused by MsMpEng.exe (Windows Defender) and if
 I disabled it my RAM would drop out a bit but it'll leave me without any protection. Yes I've already updated everything, there are no virus detected at all and my usual RAM usage before was 19-22% without anything running. Is it the Windows 8.1 faulty?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Acer Aspire V5-573PG</p>
<p>Intel core i7-4500U 1.8GHz (Turbo Boost up to 3.0GHz)</p>
<p>GeForce GT750M 4GB</p>
<p>4GB DDR3 RAM</p>
<p>500GB HDD</p>
<p>Windows 8.1 64bit</p>

            Thank you Arun!&nbsp; I did what you suggested and it has worked.&nbsp; I downloaded and ran the Auto run program and it located and highlighted a lot of files including the one I needed to remove.&nbsp; I removed the files in question and I have not had anymore error
 messages since.&nbsp; It did highlight a lot of files that said "file not found"...I am wondering if it would be safe to remove those as well.&nbsp;

<h2>            Skype for Business Video meeting &#40;Only able to view one video at a time&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Could someone point me in the right direction please.<br />
We are new to using Skype for Business, and as great as all the promo videos look on this product, we are currently struggling to set up meetings for more than one person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Skype for Business 2016 MSO 32-bit</p>
<p>Office 2010 on a Windows 7 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time we create meetings I can get more than one participant in the IM window, but no video.</p>
<p>If I then start a video chat with someone, i can only get a single person, as soon as I try to go to another video chat, the first person is automatically put on hold?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me if I'm doing something wrong or is there a set-up issue? Everything I look at online says it should be as simple as drag and drop into a conversation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Hi G,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates and I’m sorry for my carelessness that I forgot to mention the license differences between Skype for Business Online Plan 1 and Plan 2. You are correct that only peer-to-peer video conference is supported in Skype for Business Online
 Plan 1. Therefore, you may need to upgrade to Skype for Business Online Standalone Plan 2 or some other Office 365 subscriptions which contain Skype for Business Online Plan 2 like Office 365 Business Essentials to get the multiparty video conference feature.<br />
<br />
Let me know if any further information is needed.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Sam<br />

<p>&nbsp; Bom dia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Estou com um problema que acredito que já ser de conhecimento geral de todos, no jogo KILLER INSTINCT no modo MULTIJOGADOR EM PARTIDA POR RANKING.<br />
&nbsp;O jogo fica procurando por mais de 20 minutos para encontrar um jogador.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Acredito que o problema começou após a correção da prisão para os rage-quitters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Já existe uma solução para o problema ou uma previsão para correção do mesmo?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Muitos dos meus amigos deixaram de joga o jogo por causa do problema.</p>

<br />
I've been randomly getting these system crash and reboots. When I look in the log it says bugcheck. I have attached my mini crash dump file via my OneDrive.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If anyone can analyze it and tell me whats wrong.. that would be awesome.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My drivers are up to date as far as I can tell. Should I run driver verifier?&nbsp;<br />

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView -&nbsp;set VIEW to
<br />
Hide Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names (and BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created
 the driver, and more.<br />

<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version
 info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure
 it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all
 memory tests fail to show a problem.<br />

    <title>Nero Vision 10 has experienced serious problem and must close - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the-hat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nero Vision 10 has experienced serious problem and must close immediately</h2>
                    
<p>I know this question was asked in another post back in July however there was never an answer posted. Actually the error message before the one saying "<span>Nero Vision – Nero Vision has experienced
 a serious problem and must close immediately</span> <span>
" </span>is "<span>Nero Vision – Cannot find SolutionExplorer.dll. Please reinstall the application"</span> Even after reinstalling the application three time the same sequence<span> of error messages appear.
</span></p>
<p><span>I also contacted tech support concerning the problem and sent the the requested files plus a very detailed description of how I was proceeding when the error surfaced. However before I tell you what Nero Tech Support said, I want to point out that
 every other application on my machine is working perfectly including all of the other applications in the Nero 10 Multimedia Suite. I also did a search for the offending file, "Solutionexplorer.dll, and found it in each and every Nero 10 application folder
 including Nero 10. </span></p>
<p><span>I was totally flabbergasted when Nero TS first response back to me was "</span></p>
The problem is that a Windows file crash during using Nero VisionExtra. Several customers reports us that the problem could be fixed after a reinstallation from Windows. I know it is big process but could you please try this too?<br />
I mean completely reinstall windows because of supposed Windows file crash to me is a ridiculous answer when all other programs on my machine are in working order.Moreover when I go into the event viewer immediately after Nero Vision 10 shuts down I find an application error that says "<strong><em><span>Faulting application nerovision.exe, version 7.2.9.100, faulting module kernel32.dll, </span></em></strong><strong><em><span>version 5.1.2600.5781, fault address 0x00012afb." </span></em></strong> <strong><em><span>" </span></em></strong><span>If I'm not mistaken, kernel32dll, is a dynamic link library that is used by just about every windows program. If so if that file was bad they why isn't every other application crashing on start up like Nero Vision is. Maybe I'm wrong but that's the reason I refuse to reinstall Windows</span> plus all of the other applications on my machine.<br /><br />It is my hope that some person on this board has a possible solution to this problem other than reinstalling Windows.

            As I've said in my first post Badoo works just fine on my laptop and the site is confirmed to be up and working but my desktop won't connect to it, I've tried all browsers it won't work on any browser on my desktop, I've cleared all the cache and cookies,
 I set Badoo as a trusted site on Firefox it still won't connect to it, both the laptop and desktop use the same modem. I checked out my firewall and it looks like it's only for programs (apps) I didn't see anywhere to type in websites, the firewall program
 is just a list of apps you can allow or block, websites are not on it.<br />

            <p>I fixed it myself and the website works fine now, I did some googleing and going by a solution I found I went to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc and removed Badoo from the hosts file and saved changes and Badoo works now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'd like to better understand why it got blocked like that, what is that hosts file and why did Badoo get blocked?<br />

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>This happens when the Conexant Utility service, “<b><i>CxUtilSvc</i></b>” failed to run when the computer starts. This could be due
 to an issue with the Conexant High Definition SmartAudio drivers that you have installed on the computer. It would be great if you can answer to these questions for a better understanding:</font></font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if that resolves the issue.</font></font></font></p>

            Hi devtags , that infection seems to have been successfully removed, all that remains is a reference to that Driver.js file - you need to find that on your Startup settings and remove the reference . .. 
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />With that utility, you can right click and delete any startup item in Windows 
<br />
<br />Look for any reference to that Driver.js file on the initial list and also on the Logon Tab of Autoruns, then untick it . . .

<p>
</p><p>Btw ... &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a Norwegian computer .. so if you try to tell me what to do, i will maybe not uderstand what you are trying to tell me ...</p>
<p>Sooo if you got a way to fix this for me, then send some pictures or a video how to fix it. Plz ..</p>

<h2>            i HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REMOVE SOME .INI FILES AND WINDOWS REFERRED ME TO THE Windows Driver Development Kit</h2>
                    <p>I don't know that this download is still available.&nbsp; I am trying to make sure of the installer or driver before I delete these files and Microsoft suggests
</p>
<p>Retrieve the path and file name of your .inf file: </p>
<ul>
<li>The .inf files are located in the %Windir%\Inf folder, and are accompanied by a system-maintained .pnf file with the same root name. When third-party drivers are installed correctly, the .inf is renamed to Oem<var>xx</var>.inf (where
<var>xx</var> is a sequential number) to make sure that there are no name conflicts with drivers that are included with the product and with other third-party drivers.
<strong>You can find the installed name of your driver by using the SetupCopyOEMInf function with the SP_COPY_REPLACEONLY flag and the full path name to your original .inf file</strong> (<b>SetupCopyOEMInf</b> is documented in the operating system SDK).
</li><li>If the original .inf file has been moved, use the full path name to the new location of your .inf file. If the original .inf does not exist on the system, you have to enumerate all the Oem<var>xx</var>.inf files. In each one, check the Provider, DriverVer,
 Hardware IDs, and other properties to identify the .inf files that you must remove. There is code that does the enumeration and details retrieval in the
<b>FindCurrentDriver</b> routine in Dump.cpp of the DevCon sample code (in the Windows Driver Development Kit under Src\Setup\Devcon).
</li><li>You can also retrieve the Oem<var>xx</var>.inf name from the "InfPath" REG_SZ value under the associated device's driver key, before the device has been removed.
<ul>
<li>For Windows XP and later versions, use <b>SetupDiBuildDriverInfoList</b> with
<b>DeviceInstallParams.FlagsEx</b> set to DI_FLAGSEX_INSTALLEDDRIVER to obtain details about the installed driver.

    <title>Xbox.com not showing offline achievements - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox.com not showing offline achievements</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Sorry but I sincerely don't know where to talk about this (I hope that this is the right section), but I might found an issue with xbox.com achievements list...<br />
<br />
Months ago I played for the first time the (old) "The Last Remnant" for Xbox 360 for some minutes; the game was listed in the games that I played in the "achievements" section on xbox.com (with obviously 0G since I did nothing). Two weeks ago I started playing
 "The Last Remnant" offline in order to get 1000G (I got the last 2-300 today), <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
ALWAYS playing in offline mode</span> (so EVERY achievements have no timestamp associated,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">never done with other games</span>).</p>
<p>After I unlocked the last Achievement I turned Xbox Live ON in order to syncronize achievements.</p>
<p>The "problem" is that while on my Xbox 360, my Xbox Games App (on Windows 8.1) and on my TrueAchievements profile "The Last Remnant" is listed with 1000G associated, on the achievement section on Xbox.com the game is missing at all!<br />
<br />
I tried to start again the game (I played both the disks), but "The Last Remnant" is missing from my Achievement section (oh, and even from my "Home").</p>
<p>After that I got 2 achievements (tried to play offline) with "Metal Slug 3", (I already unlocked several achievements online 2-3 years ago) and immediately after I unlocked each achievement it was listed correctly on my xbox.com profile.</p>

<p>Fix this as soon as you can please :)<br />
( I mean, I'm not scared of losing achievements, but I think that this is a big error that should be fixed... )</p>

            <p>Hey there Gin no Tsuki,</p>
<p>Are you able to see the achievements on the United States locale of Xbox.com? Check <a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Achievements/Compare?gamertag=Gin%20no%20Tsuki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a> to see if your profile shows the achievements properly. If it shows fine, that means those specific games may have not been added to your country's locale on Xbox.com.</p>
<p>Give that page a look and see if those games show up properly! Be sure to post back here the results! :)</p>

    <title>Win10 &#40;64 bit&#41; all DVDs appear empty with just desktop.ini - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericqc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 &#40;64 bit&#41; all DVDs appear empty with just desktop.ini &#34;ready to be written&#34;</h2>
                    <p>When I insert a DVD, File Explorer does not show any files, and only displays "Files Ready to be Written to the Disk (1)" with a a single desktop.ini. This consistently happens with SW distribution DVDs (including a Microsoft Office installation DVD) where
 it <em>should not even be possible</em> to write files. <br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not attempting to write any files to a DVD.</li><li>The problem is not with the DVD reader because I have the same result on a different Windows 10 system.</li><li>Uninstalling the DVD driver in Device Manager and rebooting does not resolve the problem.</li><li>All files on the DVDs appear when I put them into my Windows 7 laptop.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know when this problem started since I seldom use DVDs any more. However, the last SW I installed from a DVD was in November 2016, so I suspect this must be related to an update since then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else encountered this? More importantly, is there a solution?</p>
