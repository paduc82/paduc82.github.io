<h2>            Persistent slow and erratic performance on Excel for Mac for over a year</h2>
                    <p>I have been seeing slow and erratic performance issues on Excel since I started using Office 365 Home two years ago.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sometimes takes up to a full minute for even a simple sort (e.g. just now 150 rows, 7 columns simple alpha sort on one column, very few formulae, no references outside the sheet) to update. The same is true of sheet calculation - I sometimes find it takes
 a long (i.e. very noticeable) time for a sheet to recalculate - even not very complex or large sheets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I often (sporadically, not all the time) find I can't select specific rows or columns, only those adjacent to the chosen column and I have to wait for maybe 2 minutes before they magically become selectable. I try to select them by clicking on the column/row
 header and only the adjacent row or column will highlight for subsequent action (e.g. formatting, deletion...). These rows/columns are not protected. I occasionally find the same problem trying to select individual cells. As I said, the problem usually resolves
 if I wait a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it all gets too bad, I have to close down Excel and it works fine again after a restart - not good!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not about resources, right now, after a 3 minute wait to select a specific column in a sheet with very few formulae, I am 10 minutes after a computer restart with only Safari,&nbsp;Adobe Acrobat, Steam, Calendar and Address book open (no files/games running
 in Word or Steam).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very annoying and I had never before seen these problems since&nbsp;I first started using Excel (grief, nearly 30 years ago - v. 3.0 in 1990 !!) on a PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My set up:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Excel for Mac 16.20</p>
<p>&nbsp; Mojave 10.14.2</p>
<p>&nbsp; MacBook Pro 15" 2017 touchbar 2.9GHz Intel Cor3e i7, 16GB RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These problems are not new for me, they were true from the end of 2017 on my previous MacBook Pro (2013) and earlier macOS and Excel versions at the time. I just never thought to post and assumed an update would deal with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand this may have nothing to do with Office 365 but I am bothered by the idea of having to wait for minutes for a sort or sheet recalculation and not being able to make simple cell selections because of performance issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on? Am I alone here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

Most new machines (preloaded with Windows by OEM's) come with a recovery partition allowing you to go back to the time of purchase, you will have to check your user guides (or the manufacturer's Web Site) for instructions.&nbsp; Choosing that path requires you to
 save all valuable data first. </p>

    <title>Current email will be deleted in my n95 even if no new mail is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josen---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Current email will be deleted in my n95 even if no new mail is received</h2>
                    I have spent at least 2 hours on different days with my email provider and nokia help line trying to figure out the solution to this issue and still nothing.<br />
<br />
I use outlook in my PC and the n 95 to view my mail. The email provider I believe stores the mail at squirrel mail website. The settings used are in pop3. What happens is when I received for example 3 mails using my n 95 then open my outlook and download the
 same 3 mails, the 3 mails I received in my n 95 will be deleted once I connect to my mail box to try to retrieve new mail.<br />
<br />
However, during the period when outlook does not access mail, old mails are not deleted but add on to new ones. In other words, if I did not access my outlook for a day, the mail in my n 95 will merely add on to the old ones. But once I access mail with outlook
 and thereafter connect to mailbox using the n95, ALL PAST EMAILS WILL BE DELETED EVEN IF NO NEW ONES COME IN OR NEW MAIL COMES IN. What triggers my old email to be deleted in my n 95 appears to be the prior access done by my outlook (2003).<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with the server and site since outlook does not delete its old mail when it connects to the server after the n 95 connects ahead of the outlook. But when opposite occurs meaning outlook connects ahead, the old/current mail in the n95 will be deleted
 when the latter connects after, and worst as I mentioned even if no new mail comes in. The retrieval amount of my cel has already been adjusted to 999 so that is not the solution. Thanks for your interest in my problem.

            I'm not a 100% sure I understand what you're saying but I'll try nevertheless.<br />
<br />
In Outlook, go to Tools&gt; E-mail Accounts&gt; check View or change existing e-mail accounts&gt; Next&gt; Change&gt; More settings&gt; Advanced&gt;<br />
Check Leave a copy of messages on the server.<br />
<br />
See if that helps.

            Thank you very much Kevinue. Even as you claim you did not understand the problem completely, you guessed it correctly and gave the right solution. To restate the problem hopefully clearly this time for the benefit of others, I view my emails primarily
 thru outlook in my PC and thru my n95 in the alternative. Retrieval of email thru my PC is done regularly whenever it is switched on. Retrieval of emails thru my n95 is done only when I am not using my PC and connection to the web with the n95 only occurs
 during retrieval. My problem was when I retrieved mail thru my n95, the current mail appearing in my mobile would be deleted and replaced with the new mail would just be deleted of no new mail comes in. However current mail would not be deleted but would instead
 be added to the newly retrieved ones only during the period I do not retrieve email using the outlook of my PC. In other words, it appears that whenever I retrieve mail using outlook, my next email retrieval using my n95 would result in the deletion of all
 current mail stored in the n95.<br />
<br />
With your suggested setting in my outlook WHICH LEAVES A COPY OF THE MESSAGES IN THE SERVER OF THE EMAIL HOST, this problem was solved since, apparently absent your settings, mail in the server will be deleted upon retrieval by the outlook in my PC. When the
 n95 would subsequently retrieve mail it would only copy whatever is in the server and delete old ones during the update. I have chosen the settings which delete email in the server only when the email has been deleted from the “deleted items” folder in outlook.
 I am really very grateful for your help since both the supervisor of our nokia customer support and the email host could not resolve this issue. I must admit that this is the first time I have asked for help for the web community and was so pleased that there
 are still (lots of I hope) altruistic souls around that will help without asking for prior consideration.<br />
<br />
Kevnue if ever you are in my part of the world, do not hesitate to contact me at *** Email address is removed for privacy *** so I may return the favor. Thanks again.

            <p>I agree with trbogt, but there are some options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;You can try a repair installation first. &nbsp;Use the tutorial at</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html?filter[2]=Installation%20and%20Setup</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;If that does not fix you up, then do the clean installation using the tutorial here</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1950-windows-10-clean-install.html?filter[2]=Installation%20and%20Setup</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;If you are not comfortable with doing it yourself, you are entitled to free installation and set-up support from Microsoft, just use the Contact Support App on your All Apps Menu.</p>

            <p>Yeah...and you can also try a 'Pc Reset' from 'Recovery'.</p>
<p>or run windows 10 from the 'Setup' file of the ISO and just do a 'Re-install' by choosing to 'Keep existing files'...and if that does not work then do a '<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/search/search?SearchTerm=How+to+perform+a+clean+install+of+Windows+10&amp;IsSuggestedTerm=false&amp;tab=&amp;x=13&amp;y=14&amp;CurrentScope.ForumName=insider&amp;CurrentScope.Filter=insider_wintp&amp;ContentTypeScope=Wiki#/insider/insider_wintp/Wiki/1">Clean

<p>apologies for not providing feedback - after 3 or 4 days it came good again but as usual it only lasted until the next restart (either from updates or from internet freezing up)&nbsp;but has come good again (and back to only taking&nbsp;about a day or so). I did attempt
 your ms-settings suggestion but comes up with error message of 'windows cannot find ms-settings' and I cant go any further (same message no matter if working properly or not). I am not confident enough to do a clean install or try to go back to&nbsp;Win 8. It is
 very frustrating - I purchased the PC in early 2014&nbsp;PC with Win 8 already installed (not with touch screen)&nbsp;and it was set up at home for me by a computer expert friend who is no longer available and had no problems until I accepted the 'free' offer to upgrade
 to Win 10late last year. I seem to get updates regularly and from time to time when I put into sleep mode the PC 'wakes up' and starts to whirr away for a short time then off for a short while and on again - keeps doing it for hours sometimes but never fixes
 anything!</p>

            PLEASE provide information we can &nbsp;use, like the make and model of your computer, details like memory and hard drive space, etc. &nbsp;What version of Windows did you upgrade from? &nbsp;If that version was having issues then an upgrade sometimes is a bad idea and
 a clean reinstall would work much better. &nbsp;Help us help you by telling us about your system. &nbsp;Then others who also use your system can give you much more specific advice.

            The behavior sounds like a corrupted user profile. &nbsp;This happens with upgrades to 10 because of changes in how 10 handles the profile. &nbsp;Apparently 10 is sensitive to problems in the profile that Windows 7 and 8 were able to ignore. &nbsp;I have had this happen
 twice using the GWX upgrades. &nbsp;The test is to create a new admin user profile and log into it and check for the misbehaviors. &nbsp;If everything works normally the original profile needs to be replaced.

<h2>            Bing reward from level 2 down to level 1.</h2>
                    I recently made it to level 2 Where I could earn 250 points a day. But I clicked on Microsoft edge to day and looked at my points bar and now It says I'm a level 1 and only allows 50 points a day. Is there any way to fix this.

<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer the following questions so that we can help you.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Do you have any Security Program installed?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Are you using a Local account or Microsoft account?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><strong><span>Check if the Date, time and Time zone is set correct</span></strong><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Follow the steps to set the date and time:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;<strong><span>Windows key + C</span></strong>&nbsp;on your keyboard to show the Charms bar.</span></li><li><span>Type “<strong><span>Date and Time</span></strong>” in the charms bar search.</span></li><li><span>Click&nbsp;<strong><span>Change date and time</span></strong>&nbsp;button.</span></li><li><span>Click&nbsp;<strong><span>Apply</span></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><span>Ok</span></strong>&nbsp;to save the date and time.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>Note: Click on the Time Zone tab to check the Time Zone.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: C</span></strong><strong><span>lear Windows Store cache</span></strong></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you have a third party security program, then I would suggest you to contact the technical support of the Security program and temporarily disable the software.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Antivirus software can help protect the computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable the antivirus software. If you do have
 to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time the antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>

<p>Are these files saved in OneDrive?</p>

<strong><span>Files Read Only Office 365 - OneDrive</span></strong>
<p>it seems like Office is trying to take over the syncing in order to make the fikes available online for usage with, and only with, Office online.</p>
<p>Right-click on OneDrive in the Notification Area (right side of the taskbar) and go to Settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the “Office” tab and&nbsp;<strong><span>Uncheck </span></strong>“Use office 2016 to sync office files that I open.”</p>

<p>No matter how many times I would uncheck the check box, when I would restart my machine, it would have rechecked itself. I don’t seem to have the issue anymore, but it appears to have been divine intervention, rather than any “aha”
 moment on my part.</p>

<p>I’ve been having the same trouble with excel files opening as read only. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I work on one PC and then save so that I can open it on a PC at another location. &nbsp;After much frustration, pointless reading and one desk bang I figured it out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I saved my file on PC#1 which uploads to onedrive then I click “file” &amp; “close”. &nbsp;Now when I open the file on PC#2 it downloads &amp; opens as writable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you just close the excel window with the “X” PC#1 seems to keep the file open in memory and opens as “read only” on PC#2</p>
<p>Works for me ;)</p>

<p>I am writing an ordinary Word 2010 .docx. Most of the time when I click on Save it saves. But then suddenly, out of the blue, it tells me the document is Read-Only. I have to copy what I have just written, close the document, reopen
 it and paste the new material in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Windows XP and saving documents to a My Documents folder on my hard drive. I’m using Microsoft Office 2010 for Home and Office.</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Try disabling background saves and see if that helps.</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced tab &gt; Save group &gt; Allow background saves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Check the security permission both on the folder level and the document level. If the common users (not the built-in administrator) don’t have Read permissions on the folder or
 document, the Read-Only issue may occur. Add the Administrators group or the user account to the permission list with Write authorities.

<p><strong>File Locked – Read-Only</strong></p>
<p>I had the same problem. In my case, after applying the latest updates (June 2015) word started locking files and all files i opened in Word were read only.</p>
<p>The problem was the Preview pane in Windows Explorer. When you click a word file, Winword.exe runs as a background process, locking the file. Even if you unselect the file, it is still running. Although before the update it worked correctly,
 somehow now is broken or a new ‘unknown to me’ setting has been added.</p>

<p>The scenario typically looks like this: you want to delete, move, or rename a file, or maybe even just use it in another application and you get a message that says you can’t. The message indicates that another application is using
 the file.</p>
<p>Great. “What application?” you ask.</p>
<p><strong>Files in Read Only mode after using windows “Easy Transfer”</strong></p>
<p>I just found this link which explains, among other things, that you need to re-install programs BEFORE running Windows Easy Transfer. THIS CONTRADICTS THE INSTRUCTIONS FROM MICROSOFT IN THE DOCUMENT ‘Upgrading from Windows XP to Windows
 7’ WHERE IT CLEARLY STATES IN STEP 4 THAT YOU SHOULD RUN WINDOWS EASY TRANSFER BEFORE RE-INSTALLING YOUR PROGRAMS! SHAME ON MICROSOFT!</p>

    <title>msmpeng.exe memory leak&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tatsuyame  say:</h3>
<h2>            msmpeng.exe memory leak&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm dealing with what appears to be a memory leak with msmpeng.exe.&nbsp; The Issue has only occurred since earlier today when MSSE updated.&nbsp; I tried a reboot, nothing changed.&nbsp; In Process Explorer, msmpeng.exe only reports to use ~150,000K, but as soon as I
 kill the process, my ram usage drops from ~1.8GB to ~800MB.&nbsp; Vista 32-bit SP2, Microsoft Security Essentials Version:&nbsp; 1.0.1961.0,&nbsp; Antimalware Client Version: 2.1.6519.0,&nbsp; Virus&amp;Spyware definitions 1.83.1755.0.&nbsp; Ram usage&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">only</span>
 climbs when msmpeng.exe is active, the speed at which it climbs seems inconsistent.&nbsp; See linked graph, the cliffs are where I killed (and subsequently restarted) msmpeng.exe.&nbsp; http://i149.photobucket.com/albums/s42/tatsuyame/09b0a909.png</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit:&nbsp; Reinstalling MSSE appears to have fixed the issue.&nbsp; Quite odd, but I'm not complaining about a simple fix. :)</p>

<p>The strike-through suggests you have an IMAP email account. IMAP email accounts (at least before Outlook 2010, and then it's only pretend) don't HAVE a "deleted Items" folder. Reason? an IMAP account mirrors the folders on the IMAP mail server, therefore
 a "Deleted Items" folder is superfluous.</p>
<p>To see the other folders you need to SUBSCRIBE to them.</p>
<p>Do Right-Click on the account in the Folders pane, choose IMAP folders and then you can subscribe or uninscribe to different folders.</p>
<p>To remove the "struck through" emails, click on the folder and do Edit-Purge. You need to tell the IMAP account where to store sent Items as well.</p>

<p>You can specify the default document folder for Word at <strong>File | Options | Save: Default local file location</strong>. When you first start Word, this will be the folder Word looks to when you use the
<strong>Open</strong> or <strong>Save As</strong> command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you open a document from a different folder (or subfolder) or save a document in a different folder, that folder becomes the new default for opening and saving files, with the exception that, if you use
<strong>Save As</strong> to save an existing (already saved) file under a new name, Word will default to the folder where the existing file is saved.</p>

            It may not solve your problem, but it does answer your question ("Is it possible to set a default folder that Word opens with clicking to open or a default folder to save a document when clicking save?"). The answer is no, it is not possible to do what
 you apparently want the way you want to do it. Suggestions for Microsoft may be posted at

</p><p>I have been utilizing this site quite extensively as of late and I come across your replies quite frequently. They are all of the same nature, you don't resolve anything, just post that it's not possible or give some generic answer that doesn't help the
 original person posting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you ask, "Is it possible...?" and it's not, what sort of answer would satisfy you? I have suggested that this might be possible with a macro, but otherwise you just have to be able to take no for an answer. If you want Word to work some different way,
 then posting at <span><a href="http://word.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://word.uservoice.com/</span></a></span>&nbsp;is the way to bring your idea to the attention of Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't need to get points or kudos from Microsoft; for the past 19 years I've been recognized by Microsoft as a Most Valuable Professional. And I don't need a job from Microsoft because I have my own business.</p>

<h2>            Word&#58; insert citation that is part of the grammar of the sentence &#40;no parentheses&#41;</h2>
                    <p>There are many forms of in-text citations, but it seems that Word has only one option for each style other than to suppress some parts. For instance, one sentence might read</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Among unmarried respondents to the 1971 NSYW, oral contraceptive use was higher for women who lived in US states with liberalized youth consent laws (Goldin &amp; Katz, 2002), while Bailey, Hershbein, and Miller (2012) showed similar
 results with married women in the NFS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first citation is easy. The second seems to require inserting only&nbsp;the year as a citation. This does not seem to match standard practice. For instance, biber / biblatex allows \parencite and \textcite (among many other options), which will produce the
 citations above. It is also common to have more than one citation within parentheses, and that seems impossible without manually typing the citation text in Word (which will lead to errors during editing).&nbsp; Am I missing something?&nbsp;</p>

            Word's citation/bibliography tools have limited functionality and poor compliance with the relevant standards. What I do for a citation like
<span>Bailey, Hershbein, and Miller (2012)</span>&nbsp; is to copy the author names from the citation &amp; paste them into the preceding text before editing the citation to show only the year. As for inserting multiple citations in the same parentheses, that
 is quite easily done by inserting the first citation, then clicking on it before inserting the second, and so on. That would give a combined citation like (<span>Goldin &amp; Katz, 2002; Bailey, Hershbein, and Miller, 2012)</span>

<h2>            Lumia 535 Touch screen sensitivity issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently bought a new Lumia 535 just over 1 month ago and I knew there were issues with the touchscreen but that a patch would come shortly. nothings happened. My touch screen seems to be too responsive at times and really unresponsive at other times, don't
 even get me started on using the phone in the rain. I like lumia phones but really regret getting this phone, store won't accept a return as just over 30 days and nothing proven with phone, surely there should be a recall, Microsoft know all about this and
 promised a patch to fix this issue, I've reset my phone, cleaned the screen, etc and still persists (just the fact the phone cannot function in the rain- i.e a water droplet doesn't allow you to use touch screen, this is a fault and its not fit for purpose)!!!!
 Where should I go from here, I am disabled and need a phone that can function and not drop calls as my ear has barely touched the end call button!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>You&nbsp;could try to soft reset or full reset the phone but it might be a temporary solution to that issue.</p>

            The issue with the printing was almost certainly connected with the fact that the tables (which is all labels are in Word) was set the have the text wrapped around them.&nbsp; The least painful way around the issue is to save the document as a pdf file and
 then print it from Adobe Reader.

<h2>            Automatic Spelling Correction in MS Excel 2007</h2>
                    Hi, as we write something mistakenly or intentionally in ms word, so it underlines the word or sentence with green or red color right. I'm converting my data of ms word to ms excel, but today i found that Excel does not check spelling nor it does underline
 the word with colored line. So please tell me that if there any way to correct spelling in ms excel, as we correct in ms word. Please guide me.

            <p>You cannot change the default selection color in Excel 2007 when only one cell is selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are ways to color format the found cells but then you have to deal with uncoloring after.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Methods of coloring could be manual or by VBA</p>

<h2>            E72 gps looses fix</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;i have problem with my E72 and gps signal. Before it worked ok, now i dont know what is the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looses "fix" every few seconds even in the open sky. I switch phone off and on. And it fixes for a few seconds, but it loses fix quickly. i dont know what is the problem. I use sports tracker and google maps, and the same thing in both programs :(</p>
<p>Does anyone have the same problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have everyhing turned to on&nbsp; in "positioning methods" (exept external gps): A-gps, integrated gps, WiFi/Network, Network based.</p>
<p>Shoud i turn something off?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use mobile phone for cycling so i have a few questions.</p>
<p>I have my phone on the handelbar while i'm cycling. If i would use external gps (bluetooth) and put it in my back pocket on the jersey will it be able to pair iz with device thatis on handelber? Will my body block the bluetooth signal?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will Nokia LD-4W gps modul give me a better gps signal? Or it is the same chipset as it is in E72?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also use Polar for nokia bluetooth heartrate strap. Will i be able to pair external gps and the heartrate strap with the mobile phone in the same time?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>tnx</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I disabled wifi/network method and now everything's ok :)</p>
<p>obviously that was probably the problem.</p>
<p>tnx</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i use new sportstracker, but that's not an issue any more :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also thanks for the input about external gps!</p>

            <p>Sometimes networks override this so previously it may have been just what you are doing..... now it may require you to ask customer services to turn it on for you, then you can toggle on /off as delivery reports cost money to receive for me and many others
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Confirmation could potentially double the SMS volume traffic if we all used it

            Hi Keith<br />
<br />
There isn’t any function that I know could accomplish this.<br />
Given the situation, I suggest you post your feedback via our Office 365 UserVoice and vote on the post, as it will bring attention to the related team regarding Subscription Renewal Calendar or List.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alex<br />
