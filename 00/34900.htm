<h2>            Surface Docking station USB not working and Surface dock updater not detecting dock</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have a Surface Pro 3 and originally I had a Surface Pro 3 docking station. Last week the USB ports on the docking station
 stopped working. Specifically,&nbsp; the keyboard and mouse connected to the docking station still have power, but besides that the keyboard and mouse do nothing. The monitor connected to the station still works fine when I connected my surface to the station.
 I figured it was a hardware problem since the docking station was old, so I got a new Surface Dock, but it is having the same problem (monitor works, but keyboard and mouse plugged into Dock USB do not). I tried downloading the surface pro dock updater, but
 when I run it, it just says "please connect to a surface dock" even though it is connected. Any help would be most appreciated!</span></p>

<p>So you're telling me that this ONE system for everything won't play the classic games that we so enjoy playing? Sounds like to me it's not one system for everything.</p>
<p>It should be called XBOX NEXT instead of ONE. I think I'll be sticking with my 360 until (if or when) they can make it compatible. Don't get me wrong voice control is great</p>
<p>but it seems like to me that is main difference in these consoles, I can watch movies and save on the cloud with what I've got. I guess I'll miss out on some new games</p>
<p>but nobody wins in that scenario including Microsoft. I may be the only concerned about it so they won't lose too much but &nbsp;I mean I've dropped thousands of dollars on</p>
<p>my gaming and if I'm going to buy something new it should do</p>
<p>everything I've got now and then some (i.e. 360 and classic XBOX games), I mean come on man.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just too old school but that's my opinion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You're too "old school"? &nbsp;I'm sorry, but old school consoles are not backwards compatible. Hence the reason I've still got a NES, SNES, and N64. Ya know, since you need each system to play their specific games. Funny how when you buy a new console, your
 old one doesn't explode. You can actually keep it and continue playing games on it. Why is this such a hard concept to grasp for some?</p>

<p>Still would be nice to play some of our old 360 games. &nbsp;I am a tad bit irritated that they released a game like Arkham Origins so close to the new console release and did not release it for the new consoles as well. &nbsp;I want to pack up the 360 and send it
 to my boy's room but right now it has too many good games to still play. &nbsp;Would love to play them all through my new console.</p>

<p>I'm incredibly upset about the lack of backwards compatibility. &nbsp;I bought an XBOX One so that I could play my current games on the new console. &nbsp;Even if I had to save my old games on the cloud and then bring them up on the XBOX One, that would be fine. &nbsp;But
 as it is the only way I can play Halo 4 is to connect my 360 up to my XBOX One. &nbsp;If I knew that I was going to have to do this I would have waited to buy the XBOX One. &nbsp;None of the One games are any good and I play a primary game, Halo. &nbsp;And this console wont
 do that!! I'm beyond frustrated and I'm even considering selling my console until the new halo comes out. &nbsp;After all, the One wont do me any good until the new game comes out. &nbsp;I'm just so disappointed to finally get the new console and be unable to play any
 of the games I love on it. &nbsp;I wish XBOX would fix this matter sooner rather than later. &nbsp;</p>

<p>So you bought a next gen console to play last gen games? Also you didnt research the product you were buying before making the purchase. You cab be disappointed all you want, but you should be disappointed in yourself and not Microsoft. Or you should have
 said Microsoft should have released a Halo game for xbox one, then you'd be hapoy right?</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Play them on a 360 that's what it's made for. It's been clear for a very long time that BC would not happen on the Xbox One and if you do some further research you can easily find out why it will probably never happen.</p>
<p>It's not like 360's just vanished when the One released so if you want to play 360 games you have that option. I purchased a One and have quite a few games for it but i still play and buy games for my 360 just yesterday in fact i got 6 games for it(taking
 advantage of huge pricedrops).</p>
<p>The One does having some glaring omissions and is far from a perfect console but BC is not one of those things, Id rather see MS get the One running at full tilt than looking back.</p>

            <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 15 2 in 1 with same 1920 x 1080 resolution with default DPI at 125%. Obviously the solution I guess is set DPI back to 100% normal DPI which fixes the blurry menu boxes and some other apparent display issues with setting DPI to 125%.
 Some suggest setting DPI to 150% to see if it fixes the issue. Apparently some think the issue is with certain monitors and DPI setting at 125%? This is my first HD screen and frankly even with higher resolution the 100% DPI makes text too small for my eyes
 and I would be zooming all the time with web pages. </p>
<p>I also seem to have corrupt video playback at times with Amazon prime where video playback is corrupted and scrambled. Going to DPI 100% seems to fix it? I never had a higher resolution screen but I guess these problems are rather common and no happy solution
 is perfect for everyone. I'm think about returning my Dell 15 2 in 1 and buying a laptop with a more traditional 1366 x 768 screen resolution. It just seems to work better with the OS and software.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you receive the same message when you try to download the update manually?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may temporarily disable the third-party security software and firewalls installed on the system and check if you can download and install the updates.
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Make sure to enable the security software on the computer after checking for the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, as I mentioned in the previous post you need to get in touch with Games for Windows Live support for further assistance. You need to login using the Windows Live account to post a query in the Forum.</p>

            Hello Kimberly, hope this message finds you well.
<br />
<br />Your first Microsoft Account that you used for the initial setup is your primary account. You cannot remove it by signing in to your primary account. If you want to remove it, sign in to your new account and then remove your primary account.
<br />Go to search window -  type in Mail app to open it.
<br />Click on Settings option within mail app  - select Manage your accounts
<br />- Double click on the primary account -  select Delete this account
<br />You will remove this account from the application.
<br />____
<br />Steve

 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<br />

Hope this helps. Good luck!</span>

<p><span><span>Thank you for using
<strong>Microsoft Answers </strong>Forums!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would like to ask a few questions to help focus in the right direction:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Are there any other specific details that you can provide that will help us to understand and resolve your issue?
<span>Since when are you receiving this error? Did you make any changes to your system? Did you Install any Software/Updates?
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try moving the picture to a different folder location, such as Desktop or "my pics" and try again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If this does not work try this step:
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1: Giving Permissions to EVERYONE.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Add Everyone group with Full Control permissions to the Permissions list of the Picture Folder.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Go to your picture folder (donâ€™t open it), right-click the&nbsp;folder and then click Properties and then click the Security tab.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the Edit... button and on the next screen click Add.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the next screen, in the large text window type&nbsp;Everyone and then click Check Names -&nbsp;Everyone&nbsp;should then be underlined.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Check the box for Full control under the Allow column, and then click OK, then&nbsp;OK again, and OK again to close&nbsp;all the windows.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above does not work try this step.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><strong><span>Fix a corrupted user profile</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></a><span>

    <title>Minecraft Story Mode Season Two &#40;360&#41; Episode 3 not showing as - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mathguy42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minecraft Story Mode Season Two &#40;360&#41; Episode 3 not showing as Free</h2>
                    <p>Edit: Issue solved. Feel free to lock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happily, the Minecraft Story Mode 360 episodes were just relisted so that season pass / disc owners can download them. Specifically, Season One, Episodes 2-8 and Season Two, Episode 2-5 were relisted. They are "purchased" for
<strong>free inside the game</strong>. The price for those without a pass or disc is $99.99 each to highly discourage real purchases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, <strong>Season Two, Episode 3</strong> still appears as $99.99 in-game, instead of Free like the other episodes. According to
</p>
<p>https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/important-minecraft--story-mode-information
</p>
<p>the episodes will be delisted forever on June 25, so this needs a fix soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: This is <strong>not</strong> the same issue as the locked thread</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/xba_gapp/minecraft-story-mode-season-two-xbox-360-season/37b00bd9-bcd5-478c-868e-09c01499892a</p>
<p>This relisting of episodes effectively solves that issue, except for this new bug regarding Season Two, Episode 3.</p>

            The .wlmp project files can't be combined..... you need to make video files from each and combine the saved movies in another project.

    <title>Question About Using Sandboxie&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adamlee-vanwijk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question About Using Sandboxie&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good day. I'll be as straightforward as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My sister, whose husband used to work in computer security, and I often discuss computer security. She suggested that I download and install a program called Sandboxie. She, as well as others, claim that if I use my web-browser and other programs
 in Sandboxie, Sandboxie will contain and barricade any virus or malware infections, in the sandbox virtual environment, and prevent it from reaching my computer. She says all I would have to do is delete the files contained inside Sandboxie after every use
 of the program and I would be virus and malware-free. She says it's one of the safest ways to browse the web. I'm using an HP Compaq with a duo-core processor, 2 GBs of RAM and Windows 7 Professional. I don't download anything unless I know it's very good
 and reputable program, and I don't download anything I don't trust.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is simple:&nbsp;<strong>is this true, and if so, what is the official site of Sandboxie?</strong>&nbsp;<em>Also, please feel free to tell me anything and everything I may need to know about using Sandboxie.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Thank you! Stay safe!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?DownloadSandboxie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?DownloadSandboxie</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you finish setup, a tutorial ("Getting Started with Sandboxie") is displayed.<br />
In Start Menu, under "Sandboxie" group you have shortcuts to "Run web browser sandboxed", "Run any program sandboxed".<br />
From "Sandboxie Control" you can configure Sandbox Settings ( Sandbox menu -&gt; DefaultBox -&gt; Sandbox settings )<br />
In restrictions category you can block Internet access to files that will run in this sandbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To delete the contents of a sandbox, right-click the sandbox and choose "Delete contents".<br />
</p>
<p>To run a program sandboxed in Windows Explorer, right-click it and choose "Run Sandboxed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a mark that an application is running sandboxed, the application bar title will have a "#" sign before
<br />
and after the text ( when you run notepad in a sandbox, window's title will be "# Untitled - Notepad #" ).</p>

            <p><span>Hi Divesh,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above issue might occur due to missing or corrupted app files and folders, uninstalled pending updates, recent changes made or if the user profile is corrupted on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we assist further, I would like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Did you make any recent system changes prior to the issue?</span></li><li><span>Do you get any error message or error code on accessing Start button or pinned icons on the computer?</span></li><li><span>Did you check if similar issue persists on another user account?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if you have any pending app updates available for download on the computer. If yes, download and check if the issue is resolve. If the issue persists, follow the methods below and check
 if either helps in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Run
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Windows apps troubleshooter</span></strong></a><span>&nbsp;to
 check if any of the app files and folders are missing or corrupted on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In many cases, <strong>
Windows Store</strong> will automatically notify you if thereâ€™s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, this tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: The issue might have occurred due to system changes made which is conflicting with the apps you
 are trying to access on the computer. If you have made any recent system changes, revert and check if the issue is resolved.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong><span>: If the issue persists, run
<strong>SFC scan</strong> and <strong>DISM scan</strong> by following the steps below and check if the issue is caused due to any of the missing or corrupted system files and folders on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">SFC scan
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. If a
<strong>Windows Resource Protection (WRP)</strong> file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows corruption errors may prevent Windows updates and service packs from installing. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The
<strong>DISM</strong> <strong>scan </strong>or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><span>Open an
<strong>Administrator command prompt </strong>window by</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press<strong> Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> option.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>
Yes</strong> and <strong>continue</strong>. Provide administrator password if prompted.</span></li><li><span>Check if it says
<strong>Administrator: Command Prompt</strong> at the top of the command prompt window.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>Type the following commands in the
<strong>CMD Prompt</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><strong>Dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth </strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:
</span></strong><span>Close the command window and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>

            <p>Dear Ms.Likhitha</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>the answers to your three questions asked is as follows :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) No i did not made any system / setting changes . The issue started all of sudden</p>
<p>2) No error code is displayed . Infact a click of mouse on start button or windows 10 built in apps does nothing . All windows10 built in apps ( edge,store,media player, photos, notification centre etc ) are not getting opened and simply nothing happens
 on mouse click.</p>
<p>3) i did not exactly understood the question , but my friend who is also a computer professional , is facing the same problem ( he helped me in updating to windows 10 from windows 8 ) . As per his say this issue previously got resolved all by itself within
 a day or two and it is due to some updates going on in background ( HDD light is continuously flickering ) . Currently he is also &nbsp;facing the same problem on his personal laptop . But since he is busy in her daughter's Medical admissions , he is out of town
 and would try to resolve once he comes back on Monday .</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other methods as suggested by you are bit technical , so I will have to wait till he comes back on Monday . &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>There is one more problem I am facing in my Laptop and its bit unusual . Whenever I switch ON the Bluetooth , the WiFi gets disconnected ( Indicating no wireless networks are available ). The moment I switch OFF the bluetooth , the WiFi gets connected
 by itself . I am facing this problem in two laptops , after being both updated to Windows 10 . Please suggest necessary setting changes for the same and oblige .</strong></p>

<h2>            Windows Update Troubleshooter</h2>
                    Hi.&nbsp; The Windows update troubleshooter continually tells me I have pending updates, despite applying the fix, rebooting etc.&nbsp; I noticed in the report it says the following "<span>Problem
 with BITS service : The requested service has already been started. More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 2182.".&nbsp; What does that mean please and how can I fix it?&nbsp; Thanks.</span>

            Hi Justine,
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what version of Windows 10 are you running?
<br />
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Windows Updates
<br />
<br />What update(s) are showing as pending on your system?       
        </p>

            Hi justine8088, well, Windows is right up to date . . .
<br />
<br />It is probably a Windows Defender Update that is causing this issue . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run the following commands, one at a time and hit Enter after each one:
<br />
<br />SC config wuauserv start= auto
<br />SC config bits start= auto
<br />SC config cryptsvc start= auto
<br />SC config trustedinstaller start= auto
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and restart your PC

            The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

            It called a Dell Dock, and is&nbsp;Dell's software, not&nbsp;Vista's, if you have a Dell computer.<br />
<br />
Acer computers have a similar thing.<br />
<br />
You do not mention your brand of computer.<br />
<br />
Look under Start &gt; All Programs&gt; Look in Dell/Acer software there.<br />
<br />
If no luck, contact your computer Manufacturer.

            Hi Bruno
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />This might be a bug or limitation in Microsoft Edge. Try using another web browser such as Internet Explorer.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: iexplore
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Try opening the PDF there to see if it appears in the correct landscape orientation.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, you can using a supported PDF Viewer such as Adobe Reader DC. 
<br />
<br />I would also recommend you file a bug report; send me the short link so I can vote on it and bring it to the attention of the Windows engineers.

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your fast answer, but it is not only at the Microsoft Edge Program. If I have written above i can view this also in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC and the view is the same (like above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i copy the created pdf from this PC on different PCs the view on this is also wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion it must be from the creation PC but is there a option to change this because on other PCs it works perfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Bruno</p>

<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />Thatâ€™s it, the Windows 10 Feature Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1903 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.

            I had the exact same problem. The solution is to go into c:\users\"username"\AppData\Local\ &nbsp;then right click on "temp" and choose "properies". Choose "security" --&gt; edit --&gt; add, and add the username you are using, and give yourself all rights. After
 that it'll work :)

<h2>            Minecraft&#58; Better Together is not free.</h2>
                    <p />

<p>Hello. I need a help.</p>

<p>I bought a disc:&nbsp;Minecraft: Xbox One edition in somewhere around 25-28th of January.</p>

<p>In game i saw a message,&nbsp;that new Minecraft edition (Better Together/Bedrock Edition) is free for owners of Minecraft: Xbox One Edition. In my situation - i needed to play for 5 hours in Minecraft: Xbox One edition.&nbsp; I played that time in 25-29 of January. But new Minecraft edition was still not free for me. It says that offer ended in 30th of January. So - i didn't take new version of Minecraft for free because of this bug. So why is that happened? Help me please. I want that version so much!</p>

<p />

                    <p>Which browser works the best with the Pro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chrome seems to not like touch, at least in desktop mode and that's where a lot of stuff works. Java doesn't work in Metro mode so half the net won't work there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet Exploder is the prime target of all the hackers. I suppose they start there cause it is easiest to hack into. Very insecure.</p>
<p>I only use it when sites that I absolutely have to interact with won't work right with anything but IE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to love Firefox but over the last year or so it seems to have deteriorated and I've had nothing but trouble with it so since I went to Windows 8 I haven't installed it.</p>

            If your display DPI/scaling options are set above 100%, this has shown to cause issues in Chrome. Might check that as well.<br />
<br />
I have about a bajillion add-ons for Firefox and have yet to see a crash in ages. Of course, I wipe my history every time I close Firefox so that may have something to do with it.<br />
<br />
Dragon may have caused some FF instability but I cannot say for certain as I cannot test it to be sure. I do know that for my relatives and users that I support who use Dragon, they often are battling it but I am not aware of them using it in their browsers.
 It is certainly a big program.<br />
<br />
But in any case, at this point, I would not recommend the Metro FF anyway as it is still in beta and very unstable.<br />
<br />
IE is likely your best bet with Metro for now until other browsers began ramping up or allowing Java.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10, Office 365 - wont print text via HP Photosmart 5520</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Recently I have been having problems printing from Outlook - specifically the images print out but not the text.&nbsp; It's now got worse because .xls files print gridlines only.&nbsp; Tested the printer and its working fine - no ink blockages or anything.&nbsp; Have reinstalled
 printer driver, shut down both laptop and printer several times and restarted and nothing works.&nbsp; Have noticed for some months now that my laptop doesn't always connect first time with the printer (wifi) and I have had to reboot the printer to get it to respond
 to the laptop.&nbsp; Also, sometimes unprinted documents&nbsp; can't be deleted from the printer queue and again I have to shut down laptop and start up again.</p>
<p>I did manage to successfully print a .pdf document today, but with my luck that will probably no longer work tomorrow.</p>
<p>Can I get some help please?</p>

            An additional comment - If I access the print function via HP Smart (new app that suddenly appeared - don't know where it came from but assume Microsoft?) I can only see pdfs and images - which sort of makes sense that that is all that will print.&nbsp; How
 do I set it to recognise word and excel and outlook etc files?

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
It is possible that this is due to the printer driver issue. To properly isolate this issue, we'd like to ask some questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried using other computer to print wirelessly (Wi-Fi) using the printer?</li><li>Is the issue only happens when printing using Office applications? </li><li>Have you tried updating the printer driver?<br />
</li></ul>
<p><br />
In addition, to fix printer issues on Windows 10, kindly refer to the articles below:<br />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions.&nbsp; Another laptop connected to the printer via wifi has no problems (but it's Windows 7).&nbsp; My laptop is windows 10.&nbsp; I've run the printer troubleshooter and found no errors.&nbsp; The problem started when an app called HP Smart suddenly
 appeared in the Start Menu - and it's this which is governing my HP printer.&nbsp; When you open HP Smart and try to print from the app, only pdfs and images are displayed as printable options.&nbsp; If you try to print from a .docx or .xlsx you get the gridlines on
 .xlsx and any images in .docx but no text, same if you try to print an email from Outlook.&nbsp; It seems HP doesn't recognise Office applications any more.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm considering uninstalling HP Smart as I never installed it in the first place.&nbsp; Any suggestions?<br />

<h2>            KB4093118, PC keep restarting</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm experiencing strange problem in our company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot install monthly rollup security update KB4093118 on computers with 32bit windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use DELL Optipllex 780 computers and opriplex 3010 computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation always ends up with computers restarting right after boot. PC starts till 'Wait Please' message is displayed and then after few seconds it reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only help is 'Safe Mode', roll back changes, normal boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I thought it's and isolated incident, but this happens the same way on all computers with 32bit windows 7. I have 7 of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already called DELL support, they cannot help me 'cause the PC's are no longer under support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you plese help me, I'm kinda desperate, i do not have time to reinstall all affected comupters</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards</p>

<p>Hi, thank you for answer</p>
<p>
</p><p>affected computers are 3xDELL Optiplex 780 and 1xDELL Optiplex 3010</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not think it's realeted to corrupted installation files. I've tried it several times, on all computers even downloaded KB installation file and run it offline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried&nbsp; Windows Update Troubleshooter with no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to stop update services and delete softwaredistribution directory .... with no effect</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it will be some library or driver, which cannot be loaded during boot, but i cannot find it in log files. I went through windowsupdate.log and cbs.log file, and didnt find the reason. Possibly becasue cbs.log is really huge :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards</p>

<p>Thank you for the information you have provided, Peter. We would like to know more about your concern. Do you receive any error messages when trying to install KB4093118? Since the Windows Update Troubleshooter did not work, we recommend that you manually

link</a> and look for <em>2018-04 Security Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 7 for x86-based Systems (KB4093118)</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, we suggest that you follow thoroughly the troubleshooting steps provided on this link:

    <title>Windows 10 Activation Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> captaincadmium  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Activation Problems</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: justify">
<p>Earlier today, I downloaded the upgrade to go from Windows 7 SP1 to Windows 10, and I tried to install it on my SSD rather than my original boot drive, that Windows 7 was installed on, using a USB drive. After it installed, it has prompted me to input my
 activation code, so I have repeatedly tried to put it in and it constantly gives errors. When I put the code in, it outputs the error code 0xc004f050, however in the error details, it gives me error code 0xC004C003 that says my product key has been blocked?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Thought I'd post what it says in the activation panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows</p>
<p>Edition - Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>Activation - Windows is not activated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Activate Windows</p>
<p>The product key doesn't work. You might need to get in touch with the shop you bought Windows from, or you can buy a new key from Microsoft (Ha, I don't think so).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on, because I haven't got a clue...</p>

            So I have to upgrade from my original boot drive for it to actually work? If I did that, how would I then install it onto my SSD, and use that as the boot drive? The only ways I've found include buying software or downloading free versions that I don't
 exactly trust. You'd think Microsoft would have included an option to put it onto a different boot drive, due to the recent increase in popularity for SSDs.&nbsp;

            <p>Ok, so after a lot of trouble, things finally fixed for me. I think I managed to trick it into activating the SSD install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For any one interested in how to change the boot drive:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I will use the terms Old Drive and New Drive. The former refers to the existing drive, and the latter refers to the fresh drive that you wish to use, in my case an SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Upgrade through the original Windows 7/8/8.1 install on your system. After this is complete, go to step 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Use the Media Creation Tool to create a USB installation drive. Plug it into a spare USB 2.0 port.<br />
</p>
<p>3) Enter the BIOS and go into boot settings. Change the priority to the New Drive &gt; USB &gt; Old Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Install Windows 10 on the New Drive using the USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It won't activate, as it is a fresh install and the key it comes pre-keyed with is a temporary key. You will get the option to purchase a key and to enter a new key, however do not do either of these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Restart the system, enter the BIOS and boot into the Old Drive with out changing boot priority. (Most recent motherboards will have this option, just refer to the manual, or go exploring in the settings. I found it in the UEFI BIOS under BOOT MANAGER,
 for my Asus Motherboard).</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) You should now be loaded up into the activated version of Windows 10, as this was done straight through upgrading your previous OS. Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Updates and Security &gt; Recovery &gt; Reset this PC (Get Started).</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) Once you click Get Started, you will be prompted to restart the PC, so do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of the boot options, it will then load straight into the New Drive, and it effectively swaps the activation so that the New Drive is activated and Windows deactivates the Old Drive.</p>

            <p>I had to do a clean install of windows 10, bc my windows 8 was stuck in a perpetual loop of 'preparing automatic repair' for 2 weeks. The fix Microsoft recommended did nothing, and I couldnt restore, refresh, repair, nor reset my windows 8 version using
 the windows 8 or 10 tool. I was also unable to perform a clean install of win 8, but i was able to do a clean install of win10 - and it completely erased my Win 8 (which came preloaded on my asus K55N).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>how, then, can I get a win 10 prod key to activate my clean install - bc I was eligible for the free upgrade, but windows 8 automatic repair function, broke my laptop.</p>

            <p>Taking this advice, I have reinstalled Windows 10 to a new hard drive. My existing hard drive had a copy of Windows 7 upgraded to 10 through Windows Update, correctly activated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the old drive has been having a lot of problems so I decided to be safe rather than sorry and install Windows on the new drive. I did this by booting to the media creation tool ISO and choosing the partition to install to. When I tried running Setup
 from within Windows it never gave me an option to choose install location. At this point Windows on the new drive is telling me it's not activated. I'm hoping that it will activate in a few days once it realizes it's the same device as an activated one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edited to say: continuing to have problems activating. I'm getting Error code: 0xC004C003; the activation server determined the specified product key has been blocked.</p>

            Well, 1st of all, don't really, actually, need to install 1 as WMP is there, already.&nbsp; If you want to look into others, as well or instead &gt; Store &amp; search for Media Players.<br />
<br />
To find WMP, hit Win &amp; type Windows Media Pl...<br />
<br />
If you need a DVD player &gt; Store &amp; VLC is available @ no charge.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
