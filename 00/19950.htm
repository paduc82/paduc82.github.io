    <title>Equally space out phase separators - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ladymuck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Equally space out phase separators</h2>
                    <p>This applies to both Visio 2010 and 2016 - the former is what I have at my client office and the latter is in my office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a cross functional flow chart which has multiple phase separators inserted. For the purposes of the diagram being created, these separators need to be spaced equally apart. Selecting them all and chosing any option from the align or position menus
 has no effect at all. The only option I can see is to manually move them using the grid lines as a guide and counting each square to ensure the lines are exactly the same distance apart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping there is an easier way to achieve this!</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want/need to resize the swimlanes. It is the phases that I want to have equally spaced across the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have horizontal swimlanes, that are fine, and vertical phases, that need to have the separator bars spaced equally apart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only assume that, as you have suggested I change both the horizontal and vertical swimlanes, there is a type of cross functional flow chart that has swimlanes in two directions and doesn't use phase separators. Thanks for the tip, I'll see if I can
 find it in the templates.</p>

<h3> user_zero  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change Podcast Playback Order&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to change the playback order of Podcasts in Windows Phone 8.1 with the Podcast App?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm new to using podcasts... there's a channel I'm listening to. The channel currently has 90 or so podcasts. The problem is that the default option appears to play newest first, since i want to catch up though, I started from the oldest and am working back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not a really big deal, but when a podcast ends, i need to unlock the phone and (assuming the podcast app hasn't minimzed), manually back up to the 'previous' track. I primary listen to podcasts via my car's audio as i'm driving to/from work so it ends
 up being a bit more involved then I'd like to be, especially if the app got 'minimzed'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<h2>            I have been getting a lot of what appear to be temp folders, that I think are associated with MSE</h2>
                    <p>I have been getting a lot of what appear to be temp folders, that I THINK are associated with MSE.<br />
All of the folders have names in this format:&nbsp; "TEMP ----followed by a BUNCH of numbers --- SIGNATURES".<br />
Each folder contains:&nbsp; mpasbase.vdm, mpasdlta.vdm, mpavbase.vdm, mpavdlta.vdm &amp; mpengine.dll<br />
They are all 64.2 megs, with one exception being 64.1 megs. I currently have 9 of these fodlers.<br />
They are a concern, only because I have a small solid state C drive, and they take up quite a bit of room,<br />
578 megs right now, which may not seem like much, but the C drive is only 4 gigs.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what they are for sure (I have read LOTS of theories),<br />
Why are they being downloaded so frequently (I also have capped 3G broadishband, so that's an issue too),<br />
CAN I delete them?<br />
I HAVE been deleting them but similar folders just keep appearing, eating up my capped bandwidth &amp; filling<br />
my very small C drive.<br />
I find it hard to believe these are some sort of virus/malware updates, as a lot of people seem to think.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts/advice.<br />
<br />
Cheers, Kevin Logan</p>

[Whether or not certain folders or files in those folders&nbsp;that are or&nbsp;are believed to be&nbsp;MSE folders and/or files&nbsp;(hence MSE can be assumed to be installed)&nbsp;can or cannot be safely deleted for purposes of conserving space is a highly pertinent question to MSE
 functionality as deleting required folders or files&nbsp;could hose MSE whereas deleting folders or files&nbsp;containing information which is not required but is truly temporary and could be cleared without consequences determines whether or not it is a way to conserve
 space.&nbsp; I'd even add to the question the concept of whether or not and/or when these folders or files will be recreated to see if deleting them is a permanent solution or only good until the next update or scan or opening of MSE or system reboot so the value
 of doing it can be determined in the long run.&nbsp; How much more pertinent to MSE functionality can a question be?]

            <p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have only one such folder in C:\Windows with all those files having a total size of 62MB.&nbsp; They show as being last modified 11/2010 or 12/2010 and created 12/17/2010 and last accessed 12/1/2010.&nbsp; mpengine.dll has a description of "Microsoft Malware Protection
 Engine" and the others have no descriptions.&nbsp; The&nbsp;product name of mpengine.dll is "Microsoft Malware Protection" and its&nbsp;product version is 1.1.6402.0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frankly, I'm not even 100% certain if this is MSE or the Malicious Software Removal Tool (but would bet highly on MSE based on the filenames and the one description I found).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If other folders are created or have existed and been removed in the past (and, if so, why this one still exists) I do not yet know.&nbsp; At the moment, my computer is running a quick scan, and I don't know if that's a factor.&nbsp; I last updated yesterday and do
 so every day or two.&nbsp; I do a scheduled quick scan daily and a full scan every 2 weeks.&nbsp; I've not been infected except intentionally by eicar just as a test in so long I can't remember the last time.&nbsp; My system is current except for definitions which are only
 slightly behind and not an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it seems to be obsolete information in this one folder on my 32-bit Vista Business SP2 machine which has been using MSE since it was first released, I've not looked at it before and am not completely certain.&nbsp; I'd be interested if any of your 9 folders
 show more recent information and what is the most recent and when you first started using MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime while you gather the information requested above and below, I need to research these folders and files&nbsp;and/or seek assistance understanding it more fully before I can give you any accurate and dependable advice (despite my intuition and expectations).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tell me more about your folders and the dates in them and if you deleted them on say a Monday, when would they reappear and/or what event would trigger their reappearance?&nbsp; Would nine appear or would there be only one and it would grow over time as something
 caused a new one to be created?&nbsp; Would it grow beyond nine to fifty if you let it or&nbsp;is nine as high as you've seen it (or what's the max you've seen)?&nbsp; When you delete them, do you delete the entire folders or just the contents of the folders?&nbsp; If you deleted
 them on Monday at 9 AM, would you notice any changes in how MSE operated - would anything fail to happen or would it cause anything like a scan or an update to occur? Was there ever a time since you started using MSE where this did not happen - or when did
 it start to your recollection?&nbsp; What is your Operating System (e.g., 32-bit Vista Business SP2 - and yes, that much detail)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What version of MSE are you running?&nbsp; Please open MSE and click the arrow next to Help and click About... and copy and paste the results in your reply.&nbsp; Here, for example, is mine:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security Essentials Version: 4.0.1526.0</p>
<p>Antimalware Client Version: 4.0.1526.0</p>
<p>Engine Version: 1.1.8304.0</p>
<p>Antivirus definition: 1.125.1553.0</p>
<p>Antispyware definition: 1.125.1553.0</p>
<p>Network Inspection System Engine Version: 2.0.8001.0</p>
<p>Network Inspection System Definition Version: 11.0.0.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and good luck.&nbsp; We'll get to the bottom of this eventually - I just need some time to find the answers.&nbsp; I'll start shortly, but I suspect I won't be able to make a great deal of progress until I get your response to these questions.</p>

            Hi Kosh,<br />
Thanks for the reply. I'll try to answer as logically as I can &amp; remember doing.<br />
First off, I am using XP SP3 &amp;<br />
Security Essentials Version: 2.1.1116.0<br />
Antimalware Client Version: 3.0.8402.0<br />
Engine Version: 1.1.8304.0&nbsp; (MPENGINE.DLL)<br />
Antivirus definition: 1.125.1581.0<br />
Antispyware definition: 1.125.1581.0<br />
<br />
 the folders I deleted. I could ZIP them &amp; send them to you or anyone else if that's deemed a good idea. To the best of my recollection though, whenever I deleted the folders, there were at least 4 or 5, and within a few days, they would be back, albeit with
 different folder names.<br />
 In fact, seemingly 1 more has been added today since I last posted (I am keeping, or trying to keep better track).<br />
 started looking to see why,,and then I started deleting these folders.<br />
</span>MSE, and entire computer seems to be working fine, except as I mentioned, my paltry C drive gets full I have run at least 1 full MSE scan (prob 2) since this started happening a few weeks ago.<br />
 26, 2012<br />
<br />
</span>FYI, I starred out some of the numbers in the folder names, just in case SOMEHOW it has some relevance to some sort of security thing on my particular computer.<br />
PROB nothing, but any significance to Friday the 13th as mpengine.dll being modified? :)<br />

            Could you tell us the exact path to these temp folders?
<div>They certainly appear to be the signature/engine update folders. The size suggests that it is the complete database.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My advice is to remove MSE completely and reinstall it. Go ahead and delete those folders.</div>

<div>You are running the old version of MSE. A new install will get you up to date.</div>

            <p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):
</p>
<p>1a. Was&nbsp;Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) offered &amp; installed via Windows Update or did you intentionally
<em>choose</em> to install it?</p>
<p>1b. In <em>Windows</em> Explorer [<strong>WinKey+E</strong>], navigate to &amp; right-click on</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>C:\Program Files\</strong><em><strong>Microsoft Security Client</strong> &lt;=this folder</em>
</p>
<p>Select <strong>Properties</strong>: What is the <strong>Created</strong> date displayed on the resulting
<strong>General</strong> tab?</p>
<p>1c. Are you in the habit of installing MSE Defs updates manually via the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Definitions/HowToMSE.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Security Portal</a> (or have you had to resort to doing so)?</p>
<p>1d. Has <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2691905" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB2691905</a> ever been offered to your computer?</p>
<p>2. What anti-virus application was installed <em>before you installed MSE</em>, was your subscription still current, and did you uninstall it before you installed MSE?</p>
<p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>5. Open <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> &amp; make sure the <strong>Show Updates</strong> box at the top is checked (and leave it checked); then select the
<strong>Name</strong> option in the <strong>Sort by</strong> box on the right. Now scroll down &amp; tell me if ALL of the following updates are listed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) KB2676<u>562</u>, KB2659<u>262</u>, KB2686509 &amp; KB2695<u>962</u>;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) KB2675157, KB2653956; KB2621440 &amp; KB2647518;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) KB2661637, KB2598479, KB2631813, KB2585542, KB2618451;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) KB2633171, KB2393802 <em>and especially KB971029</em></p>
<p>Most will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows XP</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>If IE8 is installed,&nbsp;two&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 8</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>6. What Java version is currently installed?&nbsp; TEST HERE =&gt; <a href="http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp</a></p>
<p>7. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>8. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; Advanced
 System Optimizer; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; CCleaner)?</p>
<p>9. Have you ever had occasion to do a <a href="http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/XPrepairinstall.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair Install</a> or <em>a clean install</em> of WinXP for any reason? </p>

<p>Hi Laurie Bejoian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the error code 5.1.8, your account may be blocked by Office 365 EOP. In this situation, I suggest that you use an admin account to log into
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange Admin Center</a>, and then click Protection&gt; Action center to check if your account is blocked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is an article for your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn458545%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Removing a user, domain, or IP address from a block list after sending spam email.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After unblocking your Office 365 account, you may wait for hours to let it take effect. If the issue persists, we need to collect the entire NDR and your tenant information to help you resolve it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To protect your privacy, you can send us the required information via <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
private message</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can protect the worksheet by click Home Tab - Format - Protect sheet. See the snip below</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you do is apply a check mark against all things you want then to be able to do so leave add/delete rows and columns un-checked. You can also add a password.</p>

            It doesn't work when I protect the sheet, this takes away the ability to type content into cells, which I need them to do, just need to restrict the ability to add or delete columns and rows.

</p><p>It does work. See the snip below click the symbol above the 1 to select all cells then right click any cell and click 'Format cells' and on the protection tab remove the checkmark from the 'Locked' box.</p>

    <title>Why does morph work intermittently&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> i&#39;m rendrag  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does morph work intermittently&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a series of 6 slides that I want to morph in a sequence. There are 6 pictures on the slides. I copied the first slide to make the additional slides so I know the pics are EXACTLY the same from slide to slide. Basically I am making one pic
 on each slide grow to ~200%, then I morph to the next slide so that the pic looks like it is shrinking back into position. I am doing it this way instead of morphing both steps because Grow in the Animation menu makes the appearance of the text getting bigger
 much smoother. And also because I need to do this same sequence for a number of other photo groups and my client will not like all those additional slides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that half the morphs are not working. I just spent 4.5 hours trying to figure out what could be causing it. I thought maybe PPT does not like certain image file formats. Since these were supplied by the client right in the PPT file
 I do not have the originals so I made pngs out of one of them to test it but the problem is still happening. As far as I can tell every single thing from one slide to the next is EXACTLY the same but some of the pics are morphing and some are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am losing a whole night's sleep over this and have literally started pulling my hair out. Crying and screaming don't seem to be helping either. Can anyone PLEASE shed some light on this? Here is a link to the slides
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fz71xcb8lyw1cwl/morph%20sequence.pptx?dl=0&amp;preview=morph+sequence.pptx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
&nbsp;https://www.dropbox.com/s/fz71xcb8lyw1cwl/morph%20sequence.pptx?dl=0&amp;preview=morph+sequence.pptx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: Why does morph work on some of these slides and not on the others?</p>

            Basically the issue seems to be with the image size growing from slide to slide. You can set an image size for morph but suggest you to limit the size to a minimal value.

<h2>            How to show &#39;categories&#39; and &#39;show time as&#39; feature on the calendar on the android platform</h2>
                    <p>Can somebody please help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have finally been forced to move from my W10 phone onto Android (due to lack of support and banking apps now being stopped, pdfs not opening etc etc) but after plumping for a Samsung Note 8 I've found that the Office 365 app isn't fully compatible of is
 lacking some key features for me at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I use all the time are the categories and the show time as, I do this on the pc and did on my W10 phone, however there seems to be no way to set these or if you can set the show time as, then the screen shows no difference until you open the event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example if a save an event as 'out of office' on the pc it shows a thick line down the left hand side of the event (when in normal calendar view) and on the W10 phone it showed the full event coloured in (the colour of the category) when I change this
 to 'free' it clears the line on the pc and changes the colour to a pastel colour on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may sound like a silly thing to do changing the show time as, but it means at a glance I can see what is left over at the end of the day. It's a great use of the program (not what is was intended for I'm sure, but great use for it!) I'm used it this
 way for about 12 years or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody help me use it again, or is there a work around or update coming?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris.</p>

    <title>Word Mac 2016 will not underline spelling errors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dabad123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Mac 2016 will not underline spelling errors</h2>
                    <p>The document is rather large, 150,000 words (its a book).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Smaller documents are fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a bug or a feature?<br />
<br />
2011 did not give the word count over 99,000 words, this one does. &nbsp;Did they skip the spelling?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done all the obvious things with language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only other solution I saw was reinstalling, but since i get them in new documents, I don't think that is the problem and it's too much hassle to try.</p>
<p>

            <p>Sorry to contradict Joseph, but at the moment there is a known issue with spell check in Word 2016. Wait until the next update to turn spell check on. The next update should come out Mid-May.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To install updates, make sure your Mac has a working internet connection, then:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update Mac OS X</span></strong><span>. Open the App store and click on the Updates button. Install the updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Credentials needed OneDrive for Business - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Credentials needed OneDrive for Business</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>It is a few months that I am experiencing a big problem with OneDrive, it request me to enter my credentials, but nothing happens when I click on the message.</p>
<p>So each time I have to interrupt the syncing and to recreate the directory, really boring.</p>
<p>I have seen that a fix has been released for Office 2013, but I use Office 2016.</p>
<p>I have noticed that even if the syncing does not work, it still drains my internet connection for an infinite time if I don't stop OneDrive. And strange thing, every time I stop OneDrive for Business (groove.exe) it restarts automatically a few seconds later.</p>
<p>Could you please look into that issue?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>hi fabien,</p>
<p>i'd like to confirm which kind of library you are syncing now. if you are just syncing your onedrive for business library, please consider using our next gen onedrive for business sync client, as it is more stable and removes more limitations than onedrive
 for business 2016. for the detailed steps, refer to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/get-started-with-the-onedrive-for-business-next-generation-sync-client-in-windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
get started with the onedrive for business next generation sync client in windows</a>.<br />
note: the feature to sync sharepoint libraries will come soon.</p>
<p>if you also sync sharepoint site libraries or want to continue using legacy onedrive for business 2016, please perform the following steps to check the outcome first.
<br />
1. exit all office applications including the onedrive for busuiness sync client.<br />
2.clear onedrive for business cache with&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">fix it tool</a><br />
warning this tool can cause data loss. to reduce this risk, read this article in its entirety before you use this tool.<br />
after you use the tool, navigate to the following folders and check if there are some files in them. if so, empty them:<br />
<strong>c:\users\username\appdata\local\microsoft\office\spw</strong><br />
<strong>c:\users\username\appdata\local\microsoft\office\16.0\officefilecache</strong><br />
3. removing all the stored credentials in the credentials manager (control panel &gt; user accounts &gt; credential manager &gt; windows credentials). (note: this will remove your stored passwords.)<br />
4. run regedit as administrator -&gt;from registry editor, browse to: <strong>hkey_current_user\software\microsoft\office\16.0\common\identity</strong>, and then delete the identity folder.<br />
5. restart the computer and resync the library.</p>
<p>if the issue persists after trying the steps above, please provide the following information for further analysis:<br />
1.go to task manager-&gt;details -&gt; right click groove.exe -&gt;properties -&gt;details to let us know the onedrive for business version.<br />
2.the screenshot of the error message "credential needed"<br />

<h3> serge_o  say:</h3>
<h2>            C5 calendar display</h2>
                    
<p>Is it possible to see all my calendar events for the day on the display as soon as I turn on the phone? Right now I can only see the fist line (event) and have to go into the function to view the rest. On my previous Nokia model N70 I can. So I'd like to
 be able to do the same with the new C5 model. Thanks.</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />I recommend using SFC. During the analysis carried out by SFC on the files of the system, it will check the versions of each one of them and in case it finds one that has been overwritten or is damaged, the tool itself will proceed to recover a good version of that file to replace it. It is a tool based on the command prompt that offers several commands to perform these tasks of file analysis and recovery.
<br />
<br />Check this link, it is to run (Scannow and Dism) that are used to repair Windows system files.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />
<br />If the above does not work, follow these steps: 
<br />
<br />1) launch powershell 
<br />2) Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3) Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

                    Hello, I have an ASUS laptop that came pre-installed with Office 2013.&nbsp; I have the Product License code, but no installation CD (if there even was one, I cannot remember).&nbsp; Also, it is a Windows 8 OS, I haven't upgraded to 10 yet because I don't have enough
 memory at the moment.&nbsp; Can I install Office 2013 onto my Windows 10 OS&nbsp;desktop?&nbsp; And if so, how?&nbsp; The desktop is recognized as a device in my Microsoft account, but the ASUS is not (which I am not sure why).&nbsp; Thank you.

<p>
</p><p>I know how to correctly connect a projector, and it projects just fine - until I enter presentation mode. As soon as I start my slideshow, the projector miraculously loses the signal and does not find it again. Once I quit presentation mode, however, the
 signal returns.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>when you cut some text into your clipboard, and paste it in an Excel 2010 sheet,sometimes the pasting fails.&nbsp; The real problem is, that your clipboard is empty after this, so you lose the data you cut!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be depending on the excel file in which you try to paste, with a new blank Excel file, the pasting works fine.<br />
however, when the data could not be pasted, the clipboard should not be empties (it should not be emtied in any case actually)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known bug?</p>
<p>Vincent</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is exactly how I can reproduce it:</p>
<p>1) open 2 notepad instances</p>
<p>2) type text in the first</p>
<p>3) select and cut</p>
<p>4) pasted multiple times in the second ,notepad, no problem</p>
<p>5) paste in excel: there is a "paste assistance icon" that appears, but no text is pasted</p>
<p>6) go back to notepad and paste: no more text</p>
<p>
</p><p>No error messages are given.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the Excel file was protected or had some flag?&nbsp; I received it with skype, and i remember that at first i could not enter any text in the sheet , not before I clicked on some message: "this file was received by the internet, it could harm your pc, .......
 do you enable anyway" or something...<br />
The pasting works well in a blank file...<br />

            <p>Hello Raju,</p>
<p>is there any cause or fix for the fact that the clipboard gets emptied whenever I open an Office application (Word, Excel, Outlook,...)?&nbsp; This is a really annoying problem.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks Raju for the replies and help.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>I have found the problem for Word: Word was emptying my clipboard because of an add-in (send to bluetooth):</p>
<p>
</p><p>c:\program files (x86)\Intel\Bluetooth\btmoffice.dll</p>
<p>I disabled this add-in and my clipboard is no longer emptied when I start Word :)
<br />
<br />
I tried the same for excel.&nbsp; However, when I start Excel, clipboard is still emptied and I don't see the add-in.</p>

<h2>            How do I stop Word and Excel from pinning all recent files even though I didn&#39;t pin them&#63;</h2>
                    In the past couple of days, Word and Excel are putting all recent files as Pinned -- even though I have not pinned them.&nbsp; I remove the pin and if I open the file again, it gets pinned.&nbsp; I have not checked other applications, but it's happening consistently
 with Word and Excel.&nbsp; And because in each of those applications I do keep a few files pinned that I use daily, it's making it useless to even have the pins.

<p>I have the same version here, though not with a subscription version, without that issue, but as your post is the third one with the same issue in the last couple of days, I have reported the issue to the Word Product Team.</p>
<p>

<p>OK, thanks.&nbsp; I think it is an Office problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an issue with OneDrive, so updated and rebooted whole system on Friday.&nbsp; When I did that, OneDrive wouldn't open.&nbsp; I had opened a ticket with them on it, then figured out on my own how to reinstall.&nbsp; So when they responded about that, I sent them back
 reply about this issue, but haven't heard back...which is why I posted out here.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll see if it gets fixed....{sigh}...</p>
