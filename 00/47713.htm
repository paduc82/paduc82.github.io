<h2>            External USB drives not being detected by Windows 10 after applying the Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>There have been many complaints and exchanges on this issue of version 1607. There have also been many suggestions on how to fix it. None of these have worked for me by the way. The only workaround which I did not try was to roll back to version 1511. I
 saw a post by someone who claimed that rolling back did not solve the problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that everybody agrees that this is a MAJOR BUG with SERIOUS implications. I would expect Microsoft to solve this issue as soon as possible. Although the problem has been reported sometime at the beginning of August, I have not seen any official statement
 from Microsoft concerning this problem and when it is going to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only post to that end which I have seen is at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/4vyifo/bug_windows_10_anniversary_update_tanked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/4vyifo/bug_windows_10_anniversary_update_tanked/</a>, by someone describing himself as a "Microsoft Employee".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody please shed some light on this issue and when it's going to be fixed?&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks Raymond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Hardware and Device troubleshooter. It only asked me to restart the machine. I did, but the external storage drive was still not detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reinstalled the controller of the USB mass storage device and rebooted. Still not detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My next step will be to use a 3rd party software to back up the disk's content and reformat the disk. Hopefully this will solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

            <p>There is no problem with any of my USB flash drives. They are all recognized. The problem only exists with my Transcend StoreJet 750GB external USB HDD - which ever since installing the Windows 10 Anniversary Update does not show up in File Explorer. To
 be more specific: the disk shows in Device Manager and is correctly listed under Disk Drives. It also shows in Disk Management (no drive letter, no file system, one healthy partition, and 3 unallocated areas). I connected this HDD to a Win 7 machine and it
 was successfully recognized by Windows Explorer.</p>

            <p>I have activated Device Manager and then activated the "Update Driver Software" command for both the disk drive and the USB controller. The message displayed in both cases:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows has determined the driver software for your device is up to date".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I greatly appreciate the time you are taking to look into this, but please be reminded that the device was working just fine from Day One. The device stopped working only after the Windows 10 Anniversary Update was installed. Looks like numerous other users
 worldwide have experienced exactly the same problem. Therefore, in my humble opinion, it looks like the circumstantial evidence points at the Windows fix as the clear culprit. I would therefore expect Microsoft to come out with a clear statement regarding
 this problem. Don't you think so?</p>

<p>
</p><p>It could be the reason of the flash drive was not recognized in&nbsp; the file explorer after the update. Since you have mentioned that "Transcend StoreJet 750GB external USB HDD is the only affected", we suggest you to transfer your files to a different flash
 drive and then reformat the affected one. Thereafter, import all the files to <strong>
Transcend StoreJet</strong> and let's see if&nbsp; the same issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward for the result.</p>

    <title>Is there a difference between Ranked &#38;amp&#59; Player Games&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lord fattieman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a difference between Ranked &#38;amp&#59; Player Games&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>The only difference I have seen is that Ranked matches have to start w/ 10 people, and after the match is done, it will boot you back to the main menu.<br />
<br />
For Public, it can start w/ any combo of bots &amp; gamers, &amp; it can put you into a middle of a game (like CoD). And after the match is over, it will automatically load the next map for continuous play.
</span></p>
<p><span>In Gears 1 &amp; 2 there was an incentive to play Ranked games, as it was the only way to get achievements and XP, respectively.<br />
<br />
But if you can get XP in both, the only reason I see for playing Ranked is to get a more "even" team balance.
</span></p>
<p><span>Other than this, is there any other subtle differences, like more XP, etc.? If not, I really don't see the point in playing Ranked, as Public is a much more faster process.
</span></p>

<p>You have it right. Playing ranked starts the room with full teams, and some say better players. Public either throws you in a room or lets u start one with bots. I hate ranked because when players quit u are stuck with a bot. Public replaces the bot.

<p>Just "Horde" here but,very few times will you get in a ranked horde match and have anyone left past wave 15 or so.For some reason,you get a larger amount of players that don't communicate,revive or use "team"tactics.Mosty are out for an achievement or rank
 I guess.All good,used to get frustrated as hell but,just get another game going.Not saying ranked is all bad,have had some real good games but,majority not compared to social.</p>

<p>Players quit out around 2/3s of the time in Ranked. &nbsp;Lots of players are having good games kd wise, but some scrub is burning through all the respawns. That player can take the loss and improve his kd. Always had full rooms in public and the challenge was
 about the same.</p>

<p>When a&nbsp; RESTART is done, the program (s) I DELETED does NOT&nbsp;start up. </p>
<p>In Start-up, ever&nbsp;again!</p>
<p>Period!</p>
<p>Some software packages will place their TITLE...in Start up, without your consent.</p>
<p>And, this is 'how' I get rid of them. I already have that same title..........in the "All Programs" list, anyway!</p>

            <p>Autoruns is a great program for the geeks but for the average home user it generates so much information it can be a nightmare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stick to the MsConfig - Startup tab in the 1st instance but begin in Programs and Features when cleaning up. You don't need to worry about something in the Startup if you can delete the program anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good example is HP printer drivers. Many have their Customer Participation program and the consumables ordering facility&nbsp;tacked on&nbsp;by default but for the majority of users these are not needed. Despite a message claiming&nbsp;the contrary&nbsp;they do not affect
 printer operation at all.</p>

            <p>When I needed a little insight into this problem--trying to eliminate some startup applications--I ran across a solution on Microsoft TechNet. TechNet distributes a free utility called AutoRuns that identifies ALL startup programs and threads from ALL sources--the
 registry, IE, automatic services, etc., etc.--and&nbsp;provides a way to&nbsp;eliminate them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you download Autoruns,&nbsp;browse the help file. You'll be surprised at the number of Windows resources that invoke startups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 April 2018 Update Windows &#40;File&#41; Explorer &#40;explorer.exe&#41; &#34;Properties&#34; incorrect</h2>
                    <p>This issue only appeared after the Windows 10 April Update, and it occurred on 2 PCs, a Desktop and a laptop. The network drives are only local not through the Internet. This problem was not noticed since Win8.1. The oldest computer is 3 yrs and they started
 with Win8.1. All the hardware was rebooted (PCs, router, Network Drive, cable modem, etc.). Drive checks show no errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using Windows (File) Explorer (explorer.exe) different file and folder counts occur when the Properties for a folder is selected on a UNC versus the same UNC mapped to a lettered drive. Example:<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">UNC \\192.168.0.1\volume1\BU2\B85M-G43 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;25994 files, 1158 Folders.&nbsp;<br />
UNC mapped to W:\BU2\B85M-G43)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50207 files, 5537 folders (correct).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The results using the Command Prompt are 50207 files:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">dir /w /a /s "W:\BU2\B85M-G43"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
dir /w /a /s "\\192.168.0.1\volume1\BU2\B85M-G43"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen this behavior or can you duplicate the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a problem with explorer.exe or some other issue. Is there a fix for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>Andre,<br />
<br />
I'm still experiencing problems.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am hoping you can compare a UNC with a UNC mapped to a Letter drive. More later on trying to characterize what is happening.<br />
<br />
I followed the instructions in the link you suppied on both the desktop PC and laptop PC. In both cases, the systems came up without an Internet connection, but the Windows diagnotic popped up, and it fixed it by restoring DHCP. It used the original IP address,
 subnet mask and default gateway used for the static settings (per ipconfig).<br />
<br />
The Services were updated as recommended, but the symptoms persits. Namely, with Win10 April 2018 Update a different number of files, folders and bytes are counted depending upon whether a UNC (\\Network_path\Folder) is selected or the same UNC is mapped to
 a Letter drive (W:\path\Folder) is chosen.<br />
<br />
Earlier Win10 updates produced the same file, folder and bytes count for the two cases.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There are no HomeGroups and no Shares in the setup.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Something new was learned while trying to characterize what is happening: The file and folder counts for UNC or the UNC mapped to a letter drive appear to agree until the number of files gets near 26000. The count for UNC stops about 26000 while the Letter
 drive continues counting to the correct number. The number of bytes from KB to about 40 GB didn't appear to matter. See figure below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e7fdec6-b0a5-4705-a426-6636c165c874?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e7fdec6-b0a5-4705-a426-6636c165c874?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The CMD with dir /w /s /a continues to give the same results for UNC or UNC mapped to a Letter drive. The consistency is good!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />

    <title>Slow Wi-Fi speed Acer VN7-791 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> viktor.g.ivanov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow Wi-Fi speed Acer VN7-791</h2>
                    <p>So I've purchased a new laptop Acer VN7-791g(pre-installed with windows 8.1). At first everything went great, apart from a high disc usage, I spent 2 days trying to fix the issue and finally as someone had mentioned, although it seemed unlikely to me that
 it would work I installed the available updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This worked right away, however now my Wi-Fi connection went to hell. Tried everything, restarting, fiddling with the settings (following instructions from the web), re-installing or rolling back drivers, stopped Firewall, but nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>Naturally, first thing I did was to check if the fault is elsewhere, however the new laptop gets no more than 2mbps from speedtest.net, meanwhile a Mac, my phone and a PC on Win7 are around 20 mbps and the Acer itself goes to 40, when I plug it in directly,
 so it's not the provider.</p>
<p>Looked everywhere, tried everything but nothing seems to work, any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Removed all Apps that the computer came with (including McAfee), I haven't installed anything apart from Chrome. Turned off both defender and Firewall. To your second question, yes the ethernet connection seems to be fine, only Wi-Fi is the issue. Probably
 some Windows bug but I just cant seem to find the source of the problem</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Updater not Working</h2>
                    <p>Hey Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; So for the last week, Windows update has refused to work. I'm on Build 10240, and I keep getting this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f46d9b8-4eb7-4e0f-b933-430b6af1b1ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f46d9b8-4eb7-4e0f-b933-430b6af1b1ac" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>With no Error Code as you can see, and I just today looked at my update history and noticed it's been installing the same update over and over and over again while failing on the second one (Again over&nbsp;and over again)...<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e51094c9-6ce1-481c-93d4-8ab6b6f1edc7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e51094c9-6ce1-481c-93d4-8ab6b6f1edc7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you shoot off a canned response, I've run the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Update Troubleshooter</a>, and it keeps fixing the same thing to no affect:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/61b3dc8a-e96d-438b-acb7-ac24a4fb1936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/61b3dc8a-e96d-438b-acb7-ac24a4fb1936" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run the System File Checker, and it came back with no Errors [SFC / Scannow]<br />
</p>
<p>I've manually reset my Windows Update Components: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I've even Deleted (Renamed) the Software Distribution Folder And Tried again. I've rebooted Before and After every one of these fixes (And tried to run the update before and after rebooting). I assure you I've made serious headway into trying to fix
 this for myself before posting. ;P</p>

            <p>Hey Sumit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Downloaded them both. Installed them. No Dice. It still tried to download 3106246, and still failed without an Error Code. (Rebooted, tried again, ran troubleshooter again, etc.... still no dice). Also, side note, Catalog ONLY works in IE. Edge fails and
 forces you to load up IE.</p>

            &nbsp; Huh, sorry, I wasn't meaning to insult. Moreso just mentioning it in case it was working in your copy of Edge but not mine (Which would maybe have told us something? ;P). That said, Internet Explorer shows up in my Start Menu, and I can launch it by
 searching for it after hitting the Windows Key. I'm not sure what's up with your build, but I have access to Internet Explorer from mine. O.o!<br />
<br />
&nbsp; As to the Hard Reset, I've tried that manually before, and I just tried it via your script as well, and still no luck. ;? I do appreciate you attempting to troubleshoot this though. What's more frustrating is that I am not having this problem on my Laptop...
 it's updating just fine. It's just my Desktop that's giving me all this headache. ;?

<h2>            My Steam client is crashing 24&#47;7. HELP.</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, my Steam client has started crashing on my PC every 10 minutes or so, I am not sure why this is and it is REALLY annoying.</p>
<p>I don't think the game I am playing at the moment has anything to do with this, considering that it is my Steam that is crashing and not the game.</p>
<p>I've already asked the Steam support about this but I am not getting any help so I thought I could ask it here instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure why my Steam is crashing but when it does, there is a message that pops up. ''Steam Client Bootstrapper is not responding'' or something like that.</p>
<p>As I said before, this happens every 10 minutes or so, it does not matter if I am ingame or just in the library or the store of Steam, the client still crashes.</p>
<p>I've tried putting Steam in compatability mode or whatever It's called, and I have also tried to put ''High'' as priority in the task manager, but it is still crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt this is a virus or anything like that, I have 2 virus programs and CCleaner on 24/7 so that should not be the case here.</p>
<p>I would appriciate some help with this, the Steam support are not being very helpful, I am hoping someone else will be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much love, a slightly annoyed gamer.</p>

            <p><em>"Steam client to ''Beta mode&nbsp;</em><em>seemed to work for now</em><em> ''"</em></p>
<p>Good to hear, and hopefully it will keep you going until the next Steam update.
</p>
<p>Doing the Client reinstall can be a pain (as I'm sure you have gathered, from my rant :)&nbsp; ).</p>
<p><em>"I do not believe my AV's are ones causing the issue but I will try de-activating them."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably not. It was just a suggestion because they can at times cause problems.
</p>
<p>The big three - Norton, Kaspersky and McAfee,&nbsp; had a notorious rep a few years ago, and while
</p>
<p>they have cleaned up their act, their 'suites' can still use a lot of resources.
</p>
<p>Any AV can cause problem now and then though. It's usually not permanent. More often a problem
</p>
<p>with&nbsp; silent blocking of something due to a recent update, and which usually gets rectified in due course.
</p>
<p>- Best practice is to only run one AV&nbsp; always on though.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"CCleaner was one of the things suggested on the Steam forum"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>CCleaner can be a useful tool, and is well regarded. It's just not necessary for it to be always running,
</p>
<p>and do avoid using the registry 'cleaner'.</p>
<p>Cheers -</p>

<h2>            Windows10 freezes and stops responding to any command</h2>
                    I've recently upgraded to W10 from my W.8.1 on my Lenovo Ideapad y510p. Everything was going smoothly until I decided to make OS boot from my superboot m.2 ssd. Since then I get these random freezes and non response situations when I can't even get to
 task manager and command prompt. It can happen when I watch some tv shows, play games or work in visual studio. Even at a login screen.
<br />
<strong>Things like sfc/scannow and those DISCM fixes DO NOT WORK</strong>, they find no issues, please help!

            <p><span>Hi Dave, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do you recall making any changes? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span><span>: <span>If a Windows Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected.
</span>Run System File Checker (SFC) scan to fix any corrupt system files. To do this, follow the steps mentioned in the link below:</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b><span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</span></b></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>M<span>ethod 2:</span></span></b><span><span>&nbsp; </span>Enable clean boot and then check to see if the issue persists</span></p>
<p><span>Follow <b>Step 1</b> in the link below, <br />
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.
</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software you can consider uninstalling it.</p>
</span>&nbsp;
<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span> - Remember to put the computer back to normal startup follow
<b>step 7</b> in the link.</span></p>

It would save us a lot of guessing if you specified which program you tried to start.</p>
<p>The error code usually relates to Windows Defender.</p>
<p>0x800106ba is to tell you that Windows Defender service has been turned off or has stopped working.</p>
<p>If you have one of the following anti-virus programs installed, then you are OK. Those programs have their own defenders. Having 2 defenders running in the same machine will create conflicts. That is why they shut down your Windows Defender.<br />
List of anti-virus programs that will shut down Windows Defender :</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Essentials</p>
<p>Norton </p>
<p>McAfee</p>
<p>AVG.</p>
<p>If you do not have one of the above, here is how to turn Windows Defender back on ....<br />
<br />
<span><span><span><span>Start button &gt; in the search box, type<strong>Services </strong>
&gt; press Enter key &gt; scroll to find Windows Defender, click it &gt; ....<br />
under <strong>Status</strong> heading, it should say ......... Started<br />
under <strong>Startup Type</strong>, it should say ............ Automatic<br />
If it does not say that, Right click at Windows Defender &gt; click <strong>Properties</strong> &gt;<br />
at Startup Type, click the pointer at far right and select Automatic<br />
at Service Status, click Start <br />
click OK when done.</span></span></span></span></p>

<br />
Thanks for your email and help.<br />
<br />
I have followed your instruction to do so. But when I click Start and it is running for a second.<br />
One of window(Serivces) pop up and saying that Windows could not start Windows Defender<br />
service on Local Computer. Error 0x80096001: A system - leverl error occurred while verifying trust.<br />
I can not do anything about it. <br />
<br />
Do you have any idea to solve my problem?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.<br />
<br />
I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br />

<h2>            Windows Timeline - Cannot grab file from another device</h2>
                    <p>I have multiple devices either running Windows 10 home Windows 10 Pro, all with the latest updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using windows timeline with them all and have the following options activated</p>
<p>1. Store my activity on this device</p>
<p>2. Send my activity to microsoft</p>
<p>3. Show activities with these accounts (The account is switched on)</p>
<p>4. Diagnostics Data set to full</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I save word documents or notepad documents or pictures etc on device 'A', I can see them in windows timeline history on device 'B', but I cannot grab them to continue work on them on device B. I can view Bing &amp; Microsft Edge links on Device B that I used
 on Device A but nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing any more settings? For example does One Drive need to be activated or do any Cortana settings need to be activated in order for Windows Timeline to work across multiple devices?</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />If those documents are stored on another PC, you will not be able to open those form Timeline
<br />
<br />If you want to be able to open documents on your different devices from Timeline, the documents must be stored on OneDrive, not locally on a PC . . .

    <title>Windows 10 machine loses the ability to ping websites within an hour - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vh_7721  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 machine loses the ability to ping websites within an hour of booting.</h2>
                    <p>This problem started around Jan 19th 2017.&nbsp; There was a system update on Jan 11th.&nbsp; No other software of updates were performed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The browser stopped receiving data from any website attempted.&nbsp; I have tried on Edge, Firefox, and Chrome.</p>
<p>I then opened a command prompt, and tried to ping various sites / ip address'.&nbsp; I get a "general failure", and the pings fail.</p>
<p>I am able to ping my router / modem however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Closing the browsers and re-opening does not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>The only way to temporarily resolve, is to reboot the pc.</p>
<p>The solution only lasts up to an hour max.&nbsp; Most of the time only 10 minutes or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other devices on my network can access the internet with no issue, such as a laptop running Windows 10, and an Android phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This tells me that it is likely not a browser issue, but an OS issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10, with McAfee Total Protection.</p>

<p>unfortunately its more complicated than that . </p>
<p>luckily i am pretty good when it comes to stuff like this , but this has had me pulling my hair out for 2 days now . Even Microsoft support have no idea why its doing this . The right options are being picked &nbsp;but &nbsp;just for some reason keeps starting the
 game from scratch every time I load the game and pick the RIGHT storage device .

<p>I got a refund only week after I bought this game. Phone MS. Politely explain Popcap still have not fixed the issue, the game is not fit for purpose and MS should not be selling it on their dash, or should at least be warning purchasers that this issue exists.</p>
<p>Money, or loss of it, is the only thing that will make companies pay attention.</p>

<p>Contacted MS support about this last night and they refused to provide a refund. They said to contact Popcap and offered the following suggestions: clear cache, re-install game. I tried both of these and the game still would not save progress. The save icon
 shows up on screen, the save file is created, but no progress is saved. Starts at the beginning every time. Just want to play the game I paid for.

If you need assistance with any other support issues, please do feel encouraged to post up a new thread detailing what you're running into and troubleshooting you've already completed.

            March Cumulative Update has caused many issues for many users.
<br />I would recommend hiding the updates that did not install.
<br />Next Cumulative update that comes out in April will hopefully address these issues.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/3183922/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-windows-update-from-reinstalling-in-windo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/318392...</a>
<br />
<br />Or if you really want to try and get them installed you can install them manually.
<br />Go here <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/3183922/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-windows-update-from-reinstalling-in-windo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/318392...</a>
<br />
<br />Then enter the KB for ones that are having issues and install them manually.

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Regarding your issue, I would first suggest is to
<br />Try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

<p>Hi Sumit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I have been trying to reset&nbsp; Windows 10 updates using the automatic script link you sent me but Microsoft is still unable to update all the updates for MS Office. Here's the message at the end after running the reset:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Successfully flushed the DNS Resolver cache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could not find C: Program Data\Microsoft\Network\Downloader\qmgr*.dat</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could not find C: Program Data\Microsoft\Application Data\Microsoft\Downloader\qmgr*.dat"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use an HP A6 VISION AMD laptop. I read on one of the threads that MS is experiencing a bug with laptops with AMD. Do you have any idea when this will be resolved as MS does not appear to be able to find all of my programs for the updates. This is the first
 time I'm experiencing problems updating despite running the reset and after numerous updates and restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be appreciated. Thanks. Kathryn</p>
<p>

                    I was upgrade my PC running windows 7 to windows 8 , but it seem some of default metro application dosen't work well. so I desire to refresh my windows. Suddenly when I tried to refresh the PC, It showed this message "drive where windows installed is locked,
 Unlocked it first and try again." <br />
What wrong with it? I didn't lock or use any third party software to lock my drive at all. Can anybody tell me how to unlock it?

<br />
My previous windows 7 was the Home premium edition, so it doesn't have the bit locker option.<br />
and when I try to open the default metro application like Music, Video, Photo even The Store it appeared like this:<br />
<br />
http://imageshack.us/f/822/77510846.png/<br />
<br />
I was upgrade my windows via Upgrade Assistant and I choose the keep Personal setting and files.<br />
<br />
I am trying to refresh PC by Typing Refresh PC in search menu, I didn't insert or have any Windows 8 disc but I do have the ISO file that was created when Installing windows 8.<br />
<br />
I can boot and use my PC as usual and just like I said above, I do have windows.ISO and I create the USB bootable media instead of burn it to DVD.<br />
<br />
I hope there was a way to solve this problem beside Re-Install the operating system.

When I pressed Shift + power button on start menu there is no <b>Troubleshoot</b>, it showed only some option like shutdown, restart and sleep.<br />
<br />
I decide to Refresh PC by go to start menu -&gt; S<b>ettings</b> -&gt; <b>Change PC setting
</b>-&gt; <b>General</b> -&gt; <b>Refresh your PC without affecting your files</b>&nbsp;but when perfume the refresh process after the PC restart it show message like I mention above,&nbsp;&nbsp;"drive where windows installed is locked, Unlocked it first and try again." so should

            <p>Can someone tell me why so many people are having the same issue and nothing is being done about it.&nbsp; I cannot keep reading about using .iso and system disks.&nbsp; These do not work when you coninually get the "drive is locked" error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is unacceptable that Microsoft can simply destroy peoples computers...Oh, wait, I paid them to screw up my computer and now they expect me to buy another one?&nbsp;

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran into the same problem yesterday.&nbsp; I was able to solve it by inserting the Windows 8 cd and starting the recovery environment.&nbsp; Once there I selected the
<strong>Advanced</strong> options and opened a DOS prompt.&nbsp; From there I ran the following command
<strong>bootrec /rebuildbcd (</strong><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ht/rebuild-bcd-store-windows.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ht/rebuild-bcd-store-windows.htm</strong></a><strong>).&nbsp;
</strong>This allowed me to identify any Windows installations not included in the Boot Configuration Data.&nbsp; If it finds an installation on your disk type&nbsp;<strong>A</strong> to say yes to all and&nbsp;add installation to boot list. Then restart your computer.&nbsp; When
 your computer restarts launch the recovery console again.&nbsp; Your drive should now be unlocked and you should be able to use the repair or refresh options in the recovery console.&nbsp; In my case the recovery console identified the installation of Windows I had
 installed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Xbox Design Lab Controller Doesn&#39;t work.</h2>
                    I recently designed and bought an Xbox Design Lab Controller off the Microsoft store. Upon receiving the controller I was very pleased with how the whole thing came out. However, when I started to try and play with the controller it would randomly disconnect
 from my console about every 3 minutes. I have tried everything to fix this controller. Updating it, replacing batteries, hard reset on my console, moving closer, moving items, etc. I figured mistakes happen and so I went to try and contact Microsoft Support
 about this issue. For the past week half of the website will not work, and the half that will only direct me to a virtual agent that doesn't&nbsp;help at all. I was finally able to put in a replacement order for the controller and thought it was all over. They
 sent an email saying that further instructions would be emailed to me within 24 hours. Here I am days later still waiting for that email. There is no real person to talk to with Microsoft support, and frankly, the whole sit

<h2>            Automatic restart in a loop after installing update for Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Approximately 2.5 hours ago, I received warning from my Windows 8 that the system needs to be restarted in order to install update 8.1. That happened, obviously, in the middle of an extremely important business conference Skype call. But update 8.1 needs
 to be installed! Since no other alternative <span>was provided</span> me (like...
<span>delaying</span> the update installation by 30 minutes?!), I resigned myself to my fate, and allowed the computer to reboot.</p>
<span>delaying</span> the update installation by 30 minutes?!), I resigned myself to my fate, and allowed the computer to reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, 2.5 hours later, the computer <span>finished</span> installing the update, and keeps rebooting itself. Each time, a message appears that "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to be restarted. We're just collecting some information and will reboot it
 for you."</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it is indeed rebooted, endlessly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've stopped agonizing over the <span>lost</span> business call and work hours, and am starting to feel for the computer itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No exterior appliance is connected to the computer, and even when I turn the power off completely and then turn it on again, it goes back into the loop of rebooting. The computer is Samsung
<span>ultrabook</span>,&nbsp;<span>ver</span>&nbsp;5.</p>
<span>ultrabook</span>,&nbsp;<span>ver</span>&nbsp;5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solutions would be very welcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also hope that these forums are browsed by some higher-ups in Microsoft, who would understand why it may not be such a good idea to force reboots on their users.</p>

            <p>Hello Roey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that your Samsung Ultrabook with Windows 8 computer prompted you to restart in order to get Windows 8.1 update configured. You allowed this computer to restart and ever since that the computer is restarting itself in
 loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</p>
<ol>
<li>Which is the currently installed operating system on your computer? Is it Windows 8 or Windows 8.1?</li><li>Do you remember the KB number of the update that was installed?</li><li>Do you have Windows 8 recovery disk?</li></ol>
<p>You mentioned that you had Windows 8 installed on your computer and it prompted you to restart your computer in order to get Windows 8.1 update configured. However, Windows 8.1 cannot install the updates automatically on Windows 8 computer, it requires you
 to have Windows 8.1 preinstalled. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you had previously initiatede to update your Windows 8 computer to Windows 8.1 from Windows store, possibly the update was getting downloaded in the background and tried to install and configure it with your permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Windows 8.1 currently installed on your computer, you may get Windows 8.1 update automatically downloaded and installed, and if the problem started after installing Windows 8.1 update, let’s follow the methods below to get this problem resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If Windows 8 suddenly restarts without warning, it may be caused by one of several issues. Windows could be set to restart automatically when certain system errors occur. This feature of the Windows 8 operating system can be disabled.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I would suggest you to disable automatic restart during system failure and check if you get any error message.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X.</strong></li><li>Click on <strong>Control Panel</strong>, click <strong>System and Maintenance</strong>, and then click<strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Advanced System Settings</strong>.</li><li>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click<strong>Allow</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Settings</strong> under<strong>Startup and Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>System failure</strong>, click to clear the “<strong>Automatically restart”</strong> check box.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>I would suggest you to start the computer in Safe mode, to start the computer with minimal set of drivers and files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong>Safe Mode</strong> appear in the corners<br />
of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using. Please refer the article below to start your computer in safe mode.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>If the issue persists you may put the computer in clean boot and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Setting the system in clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me start by saying that I did not in any way authorize the rebooting and installation of the update. It was forced on me by the OS, which simply stated that in 15 minutes the computer will be rebooted, unless I choose to reboot right now. I did of course
 download the 8.1 update some time ago, but did not continue the installation process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this is moot now. I sent the computer to a technician to get it fixed, costing me money and a work day. I'm really disappointed with the human engineering decisions behind this update's installation, and feel fortunate that this total shutdown did
 not occur at a more critical time, such as when giving a conference lecture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly pass this message to the engineers and managers in charge of the update.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi</p><p><br /></p><p>If you attempt to repair the Xbox One yourself it is likely to get a device ban and prevented from connecting to the Xbox One servers. If you believe your console need to be sent for service please use the link below and you should be able to arrange this.</p><p>Also if you have not already done so it might be worth resetting the console to factory defaults.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/devices</a></p>
