<h2>            Can&#39;t access old InfoPath forms on office 365</h2>
                    <p>hi</p>
<p>i can't seem to be able to open any old infopath forms on sites in office 365. they were transferred over to office 365 from my company intranet where the use to work fine. i get the following error messages come up when i try to open a document.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0565120c-0ab6-4684-8f2d-e10a50baca77" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0565120c-0ab6-4684-8f2d-e10a50baca77" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/210169eb-93ad-4257-9f02-11b48227c67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/210169eb-93ad-4257-9f02-11b48227c67b" /></a></p>
<p>as part of the transfer from the intranet to office 365 i had to create new forms for delivery notes and others on infopath. as part of the document i had to create a drop down list where i have contact names which is linked to an external data source, which
 is found in office 365 on the new forms and intranet on the old forms. and this drop down list is linked to a repeating table where the address and company name are found for ease of delivery and make it easy to fill in. after completing the document i published
 it into a delivery note tab in the resource management site where i am bale to create and save new documents and edit said documents.&nbsp;my&nbsp;superior transferred all the old documents from the intranet to the delivery note tab by opening the files in explorer
 in both intranet and 365 then copied the documents straight over and after that he relinked the old documents to the 365 site. when we tried to open the old documents the error appeared.</p>
<p>thanks </p>

    <title>Teams&#47;Skype for Business cross chat - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james bradford &#40;jbradford&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Teams&#47;Skype for Business cross chat</h2>
                    <p>(anytime I use Skype here i am referring to Skype for Business)</p>
<p>I have a very specific issue I wanted to see if anyone else was running into. We recently deployed Teams and Skype throughout my company. We prefer Teams for internal chat, but many of our customers use Skype so i was deemed that a select chunk of the company
 would run Skype as cross chat was an option between Skype and Teams. We ran a small pilot group for both Teams and Skype prior to deciding where we would end up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we are experiencing issues with the cross that specifically with users who have logged in with both applications at some point. If a user used Teams prior to using Skype, we are finding Teams users unable to initiate a message with them. This is very
 reproducible now that we know what to look for. If I am to message John Smith, who is a Skype user and I am a teams users. I search for the John Smith user, I initiate a chat session, it does not show the message that the user is on Skype at the top of the
 chat window. I message him and he never receives anything in Skype. John Smith messages me from Skype to Teams, a notification window pops up with the chat message, but nothing appears in the actual Teams chat window. If i click on the notification a new session
 pops up in my chat tab that shows the Skype logo next to his name, and I am now able to chat back and forth with him, as well as initiate contact if I use this correct session.</p>
<p>However if I ever type a message in the original teams chat session, the problem repeats itself, and I have to have the Skype user initiate contact and then I need click on the notification again.
</p>
<p>I realize I can hide the non-Skype chat session, but that will only help after users are sitting in front of their computer waiting for the initial skype message, which defeats the whole purpose of a chat application. This is crippling our ability to chat
 across the company. Anyone with any ideas on how to resolve this&nbsp; would be very helpful. Disabling the Teams and or Skype license has no effect on this issue. Thank you.</p>

</p><p><span>Hi James,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to the description, the issue is that the user cannot rec</span><span>e</span><span>ive
 the message send from Teams in Skype for Business if the user has not been invited to Teams.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As the issue has not been reproduced from my side, please make it sure both Teams &amp; Skype for Business have updated to the latest version.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To move further, please provide the following information to troubleshoot:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. The detailed version of Skype for Business &amp; Teams.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Does the issue persist if send the message from Teams website?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Is there any error message in Teams which is not delivered to Skype for Business?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. Could the message be received in Skype for Business if this user has been invited to Teams?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>It's the same than posted there |:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_o365admin-mso_teams-mso_o365b/teams-vs-skype-enterprise-365-integration/b1c4d530-d0f5-4d27-b8f9-0ccb03be8576</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>the answer is below but I would like to know if there is a workaround. If a user tried Teams, and switch back to sfb, we can no longer initiate a skype conversation with him inside Teams... Any powershell command or attribute to change in azure that could
 revert this back so teams concider the user as Skype User ?</p>
<p>######</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi Jean-PhilippeDesloges-bergeron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test, we cannot start a chat with a skype for Business user (<span>UserA</span>) who already log once to Teams. Unless,&nbsp;<span>UserA&nbsp;</span>sent IMs to you firstly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, the Teams user's status (<span>UserB</span>) is only depended on if he logs into Teams. If he logs in, the status of&nbsp;<span>UserB</span>&nbsp;is Available. If he doesn't log in, the status is Offline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, the issue you mentioned in private message, the user should already log once to teams. Please re-confirm whether&nbsp;<span>Simon</span>&nbsp;already log once to teams.&nbsp;<span>If so, it's a normal behavior</span>.
 Unless he logs into teams, his status is always offline and you cannot talk to him with teams. Since the conversation in Teams cannot be synced to the Skype for Business client.<span>&nbsp;If not, the behavior is that you can talk with him between your
 Teams and his Skype for Business client</span>. However, his status may be Unknown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please kindly check the above on your side. If you can confirm the same situation on your side, it's normal behavior. if you feel this inconvenience, we suggest you submit your feedback to our related team via the link below:</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 920 switching to &#34;No Service - Emergency Calls Only&#34;</h2>
                    Has anyone else had this issue with the Nokia Lumia 920: &nbsp;-- without warning and without (to my knowledge) doing anything, the Lumia 920 just switches to "No Service - Emergency Calls Only". This happened twice to me yesterday - and I wasn't even moving
 around. &nbsp;The only way I could fix it was to switch the Lumia 920 off - and then on again.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a serious issue - because while the Lumia 920 is in its "No service ..." mode, no calls or messages get through.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas, comments, or suggestions to mitigate this issue will be very welcome. &nbsp;Thank you.</div>

            Thanks for the reply David. &nbsp;After the second time this happened yesterday, I powered down - removed the SIM card - and re-inserted it. &nbsp;Haven't had the problem since then ... but because the SIM seemed perfectly installed anyway, I didn't feel that just
 taking the SIM out and putting it back again would have any material effect.

<h2>            Issues with smtp password</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently whenever I try to access Outlook the POP/SMTP boxes start popping up for me to enter the passwords.&nbsp; I hadn't made any changes to my account password at that point, so I'm not sure what caused this to start happening.&nbsp; I seem to be getting through
 the POP box, because once I click OK it disappears and the SMTP box pops up.&nbsp; However, using the same password for the SMTP doesn't work.&nbsp; I finally did go ahead and change my password for my gmail account and then went back and used that password for both
 POP/SMTP.&nbsp; Again, I seem to get past the POP box, but not the SMTP.&nbsp; (The reason I say&nbsp;<em><strong>seem</strong></em> is that the POP box still pops up on every attempt,&nbsp; but once I click OK, it disappears.&nbsp; Please help - I'm totally at a loss as to how to
 fix this.</p>

<h2>            Exchange Active Synch-- Attachments not downloading entirely</h2>
                    
<p>Ok I cannot figure this one out for the life of me.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I switched to a Samsung Ace Windows Mobile 6 Standard from an HTC 6800 Windows Mobile 6 Professional and since then attachments will not automatically download, unless I open the email and select the attachment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm synchronizing wirelessly to an Exchange Active Sync server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Exchange account on my device is configured to download the entire email (there are no specific settings for attachments-- unlike on my 6800, which would download the full email AND the full attachment)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a limitation on Windows Mobile 6 Standard or am I doing something wrong?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incredibly enought I contacted Microsoft support and they didn't seem to have answer as well (I'm still awaiting results from their tests with an "emulator").</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, anything could help. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Try these two possible fixes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go into File Menu / Word Options button / Trust Center option / Trust Center Settings button. Make sure the file is located in a&nbsp;folder that has been defined as a&nbsp;"trusted location".</p>
<p>Take a look at the Add-ins options. Maybe you have the "must be signed" option turned on</p>
<p>Take a look at ActiveX Settings options.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>OR</span> </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>File Menu &gt; Option command &gt; Trust center &gt; Trust center settings &gt; privacy options &gt; in "Document specific settings" uncheck "Remove personal information from file properties on save"</p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- File is in a trusted location.</p>
<p>- I don't see a "must be signed in option" in Add-Ins</p>
<p>- Changed all Active X setting to "enable all": made no difference.</p>
<p>- "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Remove personal information from file properties on save" is grayed out, thus not checked.</span></p>

            <p>Thank you Bruce</p>
<p>I followed&nbsp;your instruction to the dot. (By the way thank you for directing me to right Menu). I have changed the default Programs as Internet explorer instead of Edge, saved, and&nbsp;reboot the system. Nothing changed, and the logo I have on my desk top is
 still Edge. I repeated the exercise several times as&nbsp;I am desperate to get rid of this Fr Edge, but no luck. The ideal like several folks in the community here is to be able to use it for Pogo Bridge that does not work or doesn't&nbsp;load the Java in Edge Browser.
 I am still&nbsp;hoping for a help. I cannot use Firefox the other browser accepted by Pogo, but such browser was hacked by "MyWay" that I can not get rid of it, even after clearing the registry..</p>

                    <p>Good afternoon all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I am trying to add a hotmail account in Outlook 2016 and when I type all my details in it thinks about it for a while then asks me for a second password. I then get an App passowrd out of Microsoft online and paste it in. It then thinks more and
 tells me that encrypted connection to server is unavailable. I then try unencrypted and it throws up an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure it has been asked before, but I am unable to see a thread that would help me.</p>

</p><p><span>I suggest you to try re-configuring Outlook.com email account manually and check if it helps you to connect Outlook.com server.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To configure Outlook. Com Exchange active sync, you need to add email account using manual settings. You may add it through Outlook

Outlook.com or Exchange ActiveSync compatible</strong> <strong>service</strong>, add the account information and check if it helps.</span></p>

</p><p>Even I had the same issue.....</p>
<p>However this resolved my problem and maybe you can try this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Sign into your Microsoft Account in a browser and go to the Account Settings.</p>
<p>2. Select Security and Privacy <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6ac686f-39ae-4af2-b7a9-5ddf222ebf6a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>3. Under Account security&nbsp;select More Security settings.</p>
<p>4. Search for the category App passwords and select create a new app password.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b76a118-98c0-4d41-a6aa-3cd0391ff91e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b76a118-98c0-4d41-a6aa-3cd0391ff91e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This will generate a password which you have to use while setting up your Hotmail account in Outlook 2013 2016.</p>
<p>Please note you that you have to use the Auto configuration and not manual config</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may ask you for the password the second time. if so please enter the same generated password again and check the remember my credentials box.</p>

                    <p>Original title: Accessing Twitter</p>
<p>HP lap-top will give me only intermittent access to Twitter. I can try for days to sign in, nothing. Just says Twitter is not responding. Then suddenly it will let me on. Other times it will let me sign up reasonably easily and will then work for a few minutes
 and will then freeze and fail to refresh. </p>
<div>Problem is not with my sign on, a can access account without problem from main-frame computer. Does anyone have ideas how I can resolve this as really need access to it for work? Many thanks.</div>

            Thank you for your reply. My problem with Twitter happens on all search engines, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox. In fact it is happening right now! Allowed me sign on, but worked for only a few minutes before freezing. It can go days without
 allowing to sign in at all, then suddenly it will let me access Twitter without a problem, able to refresh, post etc.
<div>As I mentioned before, do not have this problem on my mainframe computer, only on Hewlett Packard lap-top.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am not working in a domain environment.</div>
<div>Any further ideas to help?</div>
<div>Cheers and thanks.</div>

<h3> brianormerod  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t see pdf files</h2>
                    I normally attach files to emails by clicking the 'paperclip' icon. I have however lost the ability to do&nbsp;this&nbsp;with pdf files (created&nbsp;in Photoshop CS6). I can see all other files but not pdfs. I&nbsp;have&nbsp;found a work-around involving opening windows explorer
 and dragging the pdf file into the email. Can anyone suggest how I might correct this so that I am able to see pdf files for attachment to an email in the same way that I see all other files?

    <title>Document protection and rich text controls in Word 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanl83  say:</h3>
<h2>            Document protection and rich text controls in Word 2007</h2>
                    I have a form that I am putting together that will feature a couple of rich text controls. We would like to use document protection to restrict editing access to other areas of the form. The problem is that when we turn on document protection, we lose
 the ability to format text inside of the rich text field. Is there a way to enable that behavior so that we can keep the document protection and still allow the user to apply formatting within the rich text control?

            <p>Document protection "for forms" is intended for use with legacy form fields. It doesn't play nicely with several of the newer content controls, especially the Rich Text kind. There are two alternative methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Restrict Formatting and Editing pane, instead of choosing "Filling in forms" in the dropdown, choose "No changes (Read only)". Then select one or more content controls (you can hold down the Ctrl key while selecting more after the first one), and
 check the box next to "Everyone" in the pane. Or you can select one control and check Everyone, select another and check Everyone, etc. When the controls have all been marked, start protection.</li><li>Alternatively, select the entire document; then on the Developer tab, click the Group button and choose the Group command. That adds an invisible "Group" content control around everything.</li></ul>
<p>In both cases, everything outside the content controls will refuse attempts to edit or format. The differences, which may determine which method you prefer, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "No changes" protection lets you set a password to prevent users from turning off protection. The drawback is that by default the Restrict Formatting pane appears next to the document and the unprotected parts are highlighted with an obnoxious mustard
 color. Users can turn off the highlighting and close the pane, but that's a pain.</li><li>The "Group" protection can be turned off simply by clicking Group &gt; Ungroup. There is no provision for locking it down.</li></ul>

            <p>Yes, this is possible by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>With your document open in Word, select a Rich Text Content Control.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Developer</strong> tab and choose <strong>Protect Document</strong>. The
<em>Restrict formatting and Editing</em> task pane opens at the side of your screen.</li><li>Under <em>Editing restrictions</em>, check <strong>Allow only this type of editing in the document</strong>. Leave the drop-down at
<strong>No change (Read only)</strong>.</li><li>Under <em>Exceptions</em>, check <strong>Everyone</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Yes, Start Enforcing Protection</strong>. I do not recommend entering a password. All parts of the document are protected from editing except the field you had selected.</li></ol>
<p>To add more editable fields, click on the <strong>Stop Protection</strong> button. Select another Rich Text Content Control and repeat the steps. Word remembers which Content Controls were editable before and adds the new one to the list.</p>

<h2>            I&#39;d like to re-provision my account&#39;s personal &#34;My Site&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>My account was one of the initial accounts used for testing during our setup, migration and initial testing. As a result, my personal "My Site" in Sharepoint Online has been damaged beyond my ability to repair it. I am unable to
 assign or restore correct permissions to this site, even with alternate global admin accounts and there are several inconsistencies when compared to other accounts in the organization. From what I can gather by reading other posts in this forum, this process
 must be completed by Microsoft engineers on the server-side. Could I please open a request to have my account's personal site re-provisioned?<br />
<br />
Feel free to send me a private message or email requesting whatever verification you may need... thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi CASAbelinda,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your situation, I suggest you try to change the display name in the EAC and check if you can do this there:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange Admin Center</a></li><li>Select the problematic user’s mailbox in <strong>recipients</strong> &gt; <strong>
mailboxes &gt; </strong>Double click on it</li><li>Click the ‘<strong>general’</strong> tab, then type your desired last name in the ‘last name:’ field and click the ‘save’ button</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also try to switch to another browser or clear the cache of your browser and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still unable to change the last name, please provide us some screenshots about your roles and the change information interface like the following screenshot shown:</p>

<p>JoshR3,</p>
<p>John's got it right.&nbsp; Project 2016 has no designated "LOE" field as far as I can tell, so use of an LOE (or hammock) flag is about the best approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple minor technical notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to the last published DCMA guidance I was familiar with (~2009), any tasks that have no baseline dates must be added to the denominator since they are already implicitly included in the numerator, i.e. your first condition becomes&nbsp; ([Baseline
 Finish]&lt;[Status Date] Or [Baseline Finish]=ProjDateValue("NA")).<br />
</li><li>Be careful about presumed equivalence between "Tasks with a baseline duration of zero" and "Milestones." Zero-baseline-duration is the primary condition being referenced, and a "Milestone" in Project need not comply with that condition.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Based on that, this is what I've got:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;BEI Denominator:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>IIf([Baseline Duration]&gt;0 And Not [Flag20] And ([Baseline Finish]&lt;[Status Date] Or [Baseline Finish]=ProjDateValue("NA")),1,0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>BEI Numerator:</p>
<p>IIf([Baseline Duration]&gt;0 And Not [Flag20] And [Actual Finish]&lt;&gt;ProjDateValue("NA"),1,0)<br />
</p>
<p>This presumes Flag20 is your LOE marker, that you are working in an English-language version, and that you are using sum-rollups for your summary tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Like John, I usually prefer nested IIf's, but I find these easier to read.)&nbsp; Good luck, tom</p>

            There's no data communication on 1616<br />
<br />
Card slot No<br />
DATA GPRS No<br />
EDGE No<br />
3G No<br />
WLAN No<br />
Bluetooth No<br />
Infrared port No<br />
USB No<br />
<br />
So i don't think you can transfer anything to 1616.<br />
Sorry.

<br />Is it correct to assume that this involves an IMAP account? The &lt;trash&gt; folder is part of the server's folder set which is used when you access your account via webmail (your browser) and can't be deleted. The &lt;Deleted items&gt; folder is the standard Outlook folder.

            The outlook 365 account is IMAP. Are you saying I should use the Trash folder and delete the Deleted Items folder.?

            let me state that I use office 365 outlook. I wish that Microsoft would use another name for the Outlook.com. It is very confusing when I am trying to find help with my mail. thanks for your quick reply but I am still confused on what I use: Deleted or
 Trash

<br />The outlook 365 account is IMAP. Are you saying I should use the Trash folder and delete the Deleted Items folder.?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />You are not going to be able to delete &lt;either&gt; of those folders. The Trash folder belongs to the IMAP server folder tree whereas the Deleted Items folder is the standard Outlook folder.
<br />
<br />The &lt;Trash&gt; folder should be showing up under your &lt;Inbox&gt; and is one that is located on the server (mirrored on the desktop) whereas the &lt;Deleted Items&gt; folder would be local only. FWIW, have checked multiple profiles where I have IMAP accounts configured and none of the IMAP account folder trees have both a &lt;Trash&gt; and &lt;Deleted Items&gt; folder in the same folder tree.
<br />
<br />Typically items deleted from an IMAP folder located on the server would result in deleted items being placed in the &lt;Trash&gt; folder so two questions 
<br />
<br />#1 - If you show the full folder list in the Outlook Nav Pane (press CTRL+6 to get the full folder view) - do the two folders appear in the same IMAP folder list?
<br />
<br />#2 - What exactly is the concern over Trash vs Deleted Items?
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br /> I wish that Microsoft would use another name for the Outlook.com. 
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />I can assure you that you are not alone with that sentiment when it comes to "Outlook naming conventions" (or lack thereof depending on your point of view).

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Besides AlancitoXV’s suggestion, to better understand the situation, I’d like to confirm the following things:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>With which operation do you get this error message, when you open OneNote app, open a notebook or during editing?</span></li><li><span>If there are other error messages (pop-ups), capture a screenshot of the error message.</span></li><li><span>When does this issue occur, after some Office or Mac OS updates or the issue occurs after initial installation?</span></li><li><span>Is your OneNote included in Office suite or a stand-alone version in Apple app store?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards,</span></p>

            Depends on the file for example, if its a video and its capable of playing it, it will stream, same for an mp3. If its a pdf, excel or word document it will open it. Pictures can be saved to the device. But other file types that the phone does not handle,
 you wont be able to save.

<p><span><span><span>Internet Explorer by default does not give you an option to automatically download the file from the Internet. However, there are
 several Third Party download softwares and plug in that will give you an option to customize the downloads. I suggest that you use your favorite search engine and look for the download software.</span></span></span></p>

<p>The banner at the top of that page uses Adobe Flash. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few things we can try If I turn on ActiveX Filtering the banner goes away. So to see if you have ActiveX Filtering on go to the Toolbar up top&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tools&gt;Make sure ActiveX Filtering is not checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it wasnt checked then I would make sure you have the latest version of Flash installed. Follow the link below to see if you have the latest Adobe Flash installed.</p>

            Something like that since we haven't gotten a tweet from Dona.&nbsp; And of course we don't know whether it will be active or skip ahead (or both).&nbsp; But, based on Dona's silence, I think we will get something today.

            <p><span>You should never have more than one security product installed on the PC providing active protection/scanning. This can cause performance issues, system instability and conflicts between programs, and can hinder the effectiveness all installed antivirus
 products. Even if you attempt to have more than one product installed, with one active and another disabled, the disabled product will likely still have active components and/or drivers installed that will conflict with the other AV program.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>According to your original post and a response to Pa Bear's questions, you are using MSE and Norton.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to keep using MSE, you need to uninstall Norton and use the Norton Removal Tool:
<a href="https://www-secure.symantec.com/norton-support/jsp/help-solutions.jsp?lg=english&amp;ct=united+states&amp;docid=20080710133834EN&amp;product=home&amp;version=1&amp;pvid=f-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www-secure.symantec.com/norton-support/jsp/help-solutions.jsp?lg=english&amp;ct=united+states&amp;docid=20080710133834EN&amp;product=home&amp;version=1&amp;pvid=f-home</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should clear your conflict with MSE so that MSE will run properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to use Norton, you need to uninstall MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find additional information which should assist you in the most recent post of Pa Bear.</p>

<p>The above notwithstanding...</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Support for Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1) ended on Tuesday, <em>12 July 2011</em>.</strong> Computers still running Vista SP1 "will no longer receive software updates [i.e., updates released after 12 July 2011
<em>so you're now at least six months behind on critical security updates!</em> ] from Windows Update" until SP2 has been installed (which will require that several Prerequisite Updates be installed first).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • What does it mean if my version of Windows is no longer supported?<br />

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help/what-does-end-of-support-mean</a>
</p>
<p><strong>OPTION A:</strong> Free unlimited installation and compatibility support remains available (at least for now) for issues related to Windows Vista Service Packs. Availability of chat or e-mail support differs depending on your geographic location.
 Some issues may require more advanced support for which there is a charge: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/oas/default.aspx?prid=13014&amp;gprid=582034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><strong>OPTION B (Recommended):</strong> Chances are you're seeing the effects of a hijackware infection, possibly compounded by a rootkit (or bootkit) infection.&nbsp; See...</p>
