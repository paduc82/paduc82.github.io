<h2>            Keeps Freezing When Running Demanding Games</h2>
                    I have an Alienware Aurora R4 gaming desktop (I don't want to hear anyone's opinions on whether it's an "overpriced piece of garbage" or not, that is not what I came here for) and prior to my update to Windows 10, it worked perfectly fine. I could run
 any game at any time with max settings and the computer would be fine. But once I updated to Windows 10, things started going downhill. If I'm playing a demanding game for a 20 minute or longer period, it freezes. So far this has happened with Skyrim Special
 Edition, Grand Theft Auto V, and The Elder Scrolls Online. I have an Intel Core i7-4820K processor, 8 GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760. This desktop has been able to handle anything that I've thrown at it in the past, so I don't see why now should
 be any different. What should I do?

<h2>            Forza Horizon 4 Download Bug is really starting to piss me off and this has happened before with other games</h2>
                    I've been trying to download forza horizon 4 on my pc for about 2-3 days now and its really starting to piss me the #### off, it takes about 10hrs to download and I've tried 3 times, the first time i paused it and it just completely disappeared at around
 90% done after 8-9 hours that pissed me off but that was just he beginning, started the download again that morning, by night time I realized the download is over 100% done and the download just keeps rising, and keeps using up more of my harddrive but the
 game wont install or even show its downloaded/installed onto my pc so now I'm trying again but I doubt its going to work because so far the microsoft store looks like a bunch of ****

    <title>Xbox Ambassador - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> legend777666  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Ambassador</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;Not sure if this is the correct forum so please correct me if I am mistaken</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>I have recently been investigating the option to becoming an Xbox Ambassador. As an Xbox Enthusiast I was Immediately &nbsp;intrigued. I saw the program as an&nbsp;opportunity to help aid the community by answering/solving
 issues that many users have, &nbsp;as an efficient way to help create better cohesion between customer,product, and producer. Unfortunately there seemed to be one issue that put a halt to my ability to apply</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It mentions that it requires that one most have no history of having the Xbox Live Enforcement Team taking any actions against your account, as required by the check-box, and indirectly hinted in section 1.1 of the&nbsp;Terms
 of Use and Code of Conduct policy. This presents a conflict as, roughly Six months ago I had my Xbox Live account suspended for three days for having inappropriate language under the Bio section of my profile. (this incident was entirely my own fault for not
 originally understanding the terms of agreement when signing up for Xbox live, since then I have made amends and apologized for the incident.) After noticing this I was greatly disappointed, and was curious if there was any other ways I could still apply to
 have the&nbsp;honor of being an Xbox Ambassador</p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>As usual any response, in any timely fashion would be greatly appreciated, and I hope for the best of news</span></p>

            <p>You can certainly become an ambassador. &nbsp;However, you'll have to wait a few more months. &nbsp;The actual rule states that you must not have had any enforcement action taken against your account within the last year.</p>
<p>So, if your enforcement happened on January 6, 2013 you'd have to wait until after January 6, 2014 to apply.</p>

<blockquote>yes , I found a converted and it works now my question is do movie maker let you trim, I don't see a trim option if i split my video the part I don't want is still there I don't see a trim option. movie maker seems simple enough but I dont see away
 to edit out the little details I don't want in my video..</blockquote>
<br />
Open Movie Maker &gt; at the top, click Help &gt; Help Topics &gt; scroll down to Trim, rearrange, and copy imported audio and video clipc &gt; click it &gt; read&nbsp;and follow&nbsp;from there. Read " &nbsp;To split a clip "

                    <p>Hello, the title describes my problem. I first got this error when I was watching YouTube videos using Google Chrome, I have multiple tabs opened before I got the&nbsp;UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP BSOD. At the time I thought it was due to some graphic card error,
 because I saw red and green dots on some tabs. I switched to Edge and somehow everything is fine. However, I got the same

<span>UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP error while using other software like Steam and a third party video player (XLKK.exe in this below debugging detail). Steam works fine if I don't use it to browse the Steam Store or visit my profile page. The video
 player has popup that can sometimes trigger the BSOD. After running into these problems, I tried reinstalling my graphics card and sound card, updating drivers, ran Memory Diagnostics Tool (found no error), updating Windows 10, uninstalling updates to Windows
 10, running sfc and dism commands, and the problem is still here. I don't know what to do now, should I just reinstall Windows 10?</span></p>

<br />C. Recommendations
<br />
<br />1. No driver is getting named. Some driver is riving steamwebhelper.exe to crash. To know if a driver is one of the causes - Enable Driver Verifier and generate dump files and upload to Onedrive and share the link here (Don't forget to turn off Driver Verifier after the job is done). Do read the instructions carefully particularly how to get back into Windows when you get the crash.

    <title>Windows 8.1 WebDAV client SNI support broken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phlux  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 WebDAV client SNI support broken</h2>
                    <p>I am running a WebDAV server which requires&nbsp;Server Name Indication (SNI)&nbsp;to connect. While Windows 7 clients&nbsp;connect successfully without any problem (the requested server name is provided during the&nbsp;SSL handshake), Windows 8 clients can't connect to the
 server (error codes 59 and 1790). The network dump also reveals that the client is not providing the requested hostname to the server when the&nbsp;"Connect Network Drive..." option in Explorer&nbsp;is used or "net use * https://servername.domain/..." is executed. The
 server then responds with a different certificate which apparently&nbsp;makes the Windows 8.1 WebDAV client drop the connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone confirm that SNI support in the Windows 8.1 WebDAV client is broken?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>My Windows Vista color scheme has vanished from my computer. Upon turning on my laptop this morning, I saw that my taskbar was a flat grey strip, and my previously round start button was a tiny rectangle. Clicking on the start button revealed my menus
 to be the uninspired 2D menus I remembered from earlier operating systems. I right-clicked the desktop, clicked "personalize", "window color and appearance", and checked the color schemes in the "appearance settings" dialog box. It listed "Windows standard",
 Windows Classic" and four High contrast schemes. It did not, however, list Windows Vista. Now, I'm getting a little cognitively impaired as I get older, but I'm pretty sure that Windows Vista was listed as a color scheme in this box the last time I looked.
 A quick check confirmed that in every other respect I am still running Vista Home Premium. Only the color scheme, transparencies etc. seem affected. I can recall doing nothing that should have had any effect on my color schemes. Does anyone have any idea why
 my laptop would suddenly lose its Windows Vista color scheme, and more importantly, how do I get it back?</span></p>

Do you see " Windows Aero " also? It should be at the top of the list. If yes, select that, then click APPLY. Wait for it to change. &gt; click OK when it is done changing to Windows Aero.<br />
Now click " window color and appearance ", you'll see the colour scheme back.<br />

<p>I purchased the Call of Duty Ghosts Season Pass on the xbox.com Marketplace.&nbsp; I paid $56.49 ($49.99 plus $6.50 HST).&nbsp; My friend purchased the Call of Duty Ghosts Season Pass in the Ghosts In Game Store.&nbsp; He paid $49.99 total.&nbsp; No tax was charged.&nbsp; We both
 live in the same region (in Ontario).&nbsp; Why was I charged tax and he wasn't?&nbsp; How do I get my $6.50 back?</p>

            <p>Did he use currency that was already in his account to pay for the item? &nbsp;If so, perhaps that is the reason. &nbsp;Currency attached to your account may not have been taxed but since you used paypal the amount came directly from your CC or bank account and had to have been charged.</p>

<p>I know that he uses a credit card on his account. &nbsp;As for purchasing MSP (in the past) or putting money on his account from his Credit card, I am not sure.</p>
<p>It was Microsoft that charged the tax I think. &nbsp;I have never had Paypal charge tax where it shouldn't. &nbsp; I just don't understand. &nbsp;I have never been charged tax for DLC before this.</p>

<p>Thanks for the answers. </p>
<p>I just think that it is ridiculous that there are different costs for the exact same thing depending on how or where you purchase it when it ultimately comes from the exact same place, xbox marketplace. &nbsp;There should be consistency. &nbsp;Bottom line is, one
 person had to pay $56.49 and one person paid $49.99 for the exact same thing. &nbsp;This is not right. &nbsp;It's not as if you can shop around and there is nowhere that tells you which payment methods will charge tax.</p>

<p>G'day Snosra! That difference is a bit perplexing and I'm afraid I don't have an official "this is why" answer, especially without knowing the full details. My only speculation is that perhaps his account details are set to an area that has a different (or
 no) tax rate. If that's the case, I'd recommend he update his account details so they are accurate. Again, that's speculation. Taxes are applied according to local tax rates, so your tax should be the same if you're both set to the same locale.</p>

                    <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0651a90-75b5-4ac2-a4f3-b5129d6a770a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0651a90-75b5-4ac2-a4f3-b5129d6a770a" /></a>
<p>I changed my settings on Windows Update to manual (which requires me to check for updates periodically) because Windows was ignoring my instructions to download updates automatically but choose whether to install them. TrustedInstaller was, without my approval,
 installing Compattelrunner.exe malware that serves no legitimate purpose and causes performance problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked my downloads today, and saw KB3035583 listed as an "important" rather than "optional" update that "resolves issues in Windows." Here is what it actually does: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3035583</p>
<p>
</p><p>"This update installs the Get Windows 10 app that helps users understand their Windows 10 upgrade options and device readiness. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>which means Microsoft is now lying to me about an update being necessary for the security and/or functionality of my computer. This will be reflected in the already poor recommendation I have given Windows products at Amazon.com and elsewhere. I have posted
 the indicated screen shot to describe the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users should now ask for "more information" on all proposed updates because "important update" and "resolves issues in Windows" are fraudulent, deceptive, and misleading descriptions.</p>

<p>There should be a few ways, but its likely dependent upon the specific laptop.</p>
<p>For example, on mine the easiest way is to press the appropriate function keys. On mine this is &lt;fn&gt;&lt;F10&gt; together, and this toggles the pad on and off.</p>
<p>But you can probably do it from control panel - mouse. &lt;device settings&gt; [tab], select the device and click [disable] to disable it. Well on mine you can.</p>
<p>Just be sure you either have another mouse that works and/or know the keyboard keys to be able to navigate around and re-enable it if required.</p>
<p>In short, I guess it will probably depend upon your laptop specific make/model/drivers etc.</p>

<h2>            Fatal System Error&#33; Help&#33;</h2>
                    Recently my computer has failed to start up Windows, and automatically restarts itself. I managed to disable that feature, and I ended up getting the BSOD for Windows Vista and the error was Stop: c000021a {FATAL System Error} The initial session processor
 or system process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0xc0000006 (0x477d493a 0x0026f8d8). The system has been shut down. Does anyone know a solution for this problem? This is the first time it has happened and I am currently running a virus scan to possibly
 see if it a virus (I am running AVAST Anti-virus). The only way I know how to actually get my computer running besides system restore (This is my last resort), is to use the last working configuration that was saved in my&nbsp;registry.

            <p>Hi Joshua,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely try and help you in fixing the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Are you facing this problem after installing Windows updates?
</p>
<p>2. Is that laptop or a Desktop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check in safe mode after disconnecting external devices.</p>
<p><br />
In order to isolate the issue, let us start the computer in Safe Mode and check if system boots fine.<br />
Note: Safe mode loads only minimum drivers and services. As network adapters do not work, you will not be able to access Internet in this mode. Also, display appears bigger as display adapters are disabled.<br />
Steps to boot the computer in Safe Mode:</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer by pressing power button. Also, disconnect all external devices.<br />
Do one of the following:</p>
<p><br />
<br />
a. If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you'll need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon
 prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.<br />
<br />
b. If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.<br />
<br />
c. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the Safe Mode option you want, and then press Enter.<br />
<br />
d. Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.<br />
<br />
If issue persists, please proceed with Step 4. If you are able to boot into safe mode, please follow the steps listed below:</p>
<p>Perform clean boot.</p>
<p><br />
You may perform a clean boot and check if the issue occurs.<br />
How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<p><br />
Note: After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 3 in the above Knowledge Base article. Note: Following these steps lets Microsoft services continue to run. These
 services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing
 restore points.</p>
<p><br />
Click OK, and then click Restart. Try to check if you can boot in normal mode.</p>
<p>If it works fine, it means the non MS Program is interrupting. To find which program is causing this issue, execute Action 1 to Action 6 to find which application
 is causing the issue and uninstall it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Action 1: Enable half of the services.<br />
Action 2: Determine whether the problem returns.<br />
Action 3: Enable half of the Startup items.<br />
Action 4: Determine whether the problem returns.<br />
Action 5: Resolve the problem.<br />
Action 6: Reset the computer to start as usual.<br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</p>
<p>If you still find difficulty in booting into normal mode, please proceed with Step 3.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>Perform Hardware Clean boot.<br />
<br />
Hardware clean boot is a troubleshooting technique that allows you to get the computer up and running with minimal hardware (disabling Display adapter, network adapter and sound card devices) so that you can perform diagnostic tests to determine which hardware
 of the normal boot process are causing problems. </p>
<p><br />
<br />
a. Click on “Start button”.<br />
b. Right click on “Computer” menu and choose “Properties”.<br />
c. Click on “Device manager” option in the left pane.<br />
d. Right Click on Sound Card, modem, Network Adapter, Display Adapter, CD/DVD drive and click disable. (If you are playing game online, please do not disable network adapter)<br />
e. Restart the computer and check for the issue.<br />
f. Then enable the drive one by one to determine which is causing the issue.<br />
g. Once you found the device which is causing the issue, please uninstall and reinstall the driver for the device and check for the issue.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Note: It is always recommended to install driver from the computer manufacturer website. Please download and install the driver from the manufacturer Website.<br />
<br />
Microsoft doesn’t recommend you to leave the computer in Hardware clean boot mode. So, please set your computer to normal boot mode after performing the troubleshooting steps by enabling all the devices.</p>
<p><br />
How to set your computer back to boot normal:</p>
<p><br />
a. Click on “Start button”.<br />
b. Right click on “Computer” menu and choose “Properties”.<br />
c. Click on “Device manager” option in the left pane.<br />
d. Right Click on Sound Card, modem, Network Adapter, Display Adapter, CD/DVD drive and click Enable</p>
<p>If issue persists, please proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform system restore from the disk.</p>
<p><br />
We can perform system restore from WinRE mode of the Windows Vista installation disk. If your system came preinstalled with Windows Vista and has a recovery disk provided by system manufacturer please proceed with Step 5. Recovery disk contains image of operating
 system and does not come with repair options. It can be used only to perform a factory restore that wipes all data and applications installed on the system.<br />
Note: If the system came with Windows Vista preinstalled and have a disk, please check if it says Recovery disk or Reinstallation disk.</p>
<p>If you have a reinstallation disk, please proceed with steps listed below:<br />
1. Insert Windows Vista disk in DVD drive.<br />
2. Please restart the computer by pressing power button.<br />
3. When you see the message “Press any key to boot through DVD ROM drive”, please press Enter key. This message flashes only for few seconds and you have to press Enter key faster.<br />
Note: If you do not see this message, please check the user manual of your computer to check for the key to boot through DVD drive.<br />
4. Choose language and country and choose Next.<br />
5. Select Repair your computer option from Install Now screen.<br />
6. Choose the second option System Restore.<br />
7. Select second option “Choose a different restore point”.<br />
8. Select a date when system worked fine and hit Next.</p>
<p>If you use System Restore when the computer is in safe mode, you cannot undo the restore operation. However, you can run System Restore again and choose a different restore point
 if one exists. You also cannot create System Restore points in Safe Mode. System Restore affects Windows system files, programs, and registry settings which were changed recently. It can also make changes to scripts, batch files, and other types of executable
 files on your computer. System Restore does not affect personal files, such as e-mail, documents, or photos, so it cannot help you restore a deleted file.</p>
<p><br />
It will take few minutes to complete the restore and the system will boot back to desktop.</p>

            Hi,  JeanneWerther
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend using SFC
<br />The System File Checker tool built into Windows can scan your Windows system files for corruption or any other changes. If a file has been modified, it will automatically replace that file with the correct version. Here’s how to use it.
<br />
<br />Press the Start key and type the word CMD, right click on the command prompt and select Run as administrator, enter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key:
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•-  sfc /scannow 
<br />

<p>Your profile may be corrupted , go into settings and accounts and remove it (make sure you have the email and password to get it back) &nbsp;then shut down the Xbox by holding the Xbox logo on the console for 8 seconds , while it is off , unplug your modem and
 router for a minute or so...when your modem and router are back online , start up the Xbox , when it comes all the way up , re add your profile....it may sync a short while but all should be good afterwards...</p>

    <title>Using US Type 2 keyboard cover with UK Surface Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yellgriff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using US Type 2 keyboard cover with UK Surface Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally got to the point where I could get a Surface pro. I eventually invested in a Type 2 keyboard cover, alas only ones available in the desired colour were US. Fab keyboard, love it but my surface insists that it have or at least behave as though a
 UK keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have gon into the language settings and downloaded and installed QWERTY US International but still it behaves as though it has the UK layout. Is this because Win 8.1 conveniently forgets to demand/tell you to do a restart to activate/apply the changes or
 is there something else that I need to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failing that I'll have to get messy with stickers and make mine a trully customised keyboard.</p>

            <p>Hi Yellgriff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your question! I understand that you are using the US Type Cover 2, but it acts as though it is a UK layout keyboard. I'd love to help you with that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see this article on <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/change-keyboard-layout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">how to add a keyboard layout</a></strong>. To set a keyboard
 as your default keyboard, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<strong>Search</strong>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<strong>Search</strong>.)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Enter language, choose <strong>Settings</strong>, and then tap or click
<strong>Add a language</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Tap or click <strong>Advanced settings</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Under <strong>Override for default input method</strong>, choose the keyboard layout you'd like to be your default keyboard, and then tap or click
<strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And just to confirm, do you have all updates installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if this worked!</p>
