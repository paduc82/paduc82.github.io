<h2>            Phones not Synching w Nokia suite</h2>
                    
<p><span>As from &nbsp;today I have two phones with respective contacts in Nokia Suite: A Nokia 201 which I have been using with Nokia suite for some time, and a new 300 for my wife's use. However, now something has gone wrong with the synching for BOTH phones.
 I get an error message, Code 40043ab4, and the advice to restart Nokia suite and try again, and if that fails I have to repair Nokia Suite. I have restarted the suite a few times without improvement. I do not really understand this. The software is up to date,
 and the connection for each phone is being made OK. What should I do? &nbsp; Allanm</span></p>

<p>Hope you have the latest version of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nokia.com/in-en/support/product/nokia-suite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Suite</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>..and try a complete un-install / re-install of the Suite ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just be aware that if you use 2 phones with the Nokia Suite, the data will get mixed up ..meaning contacts / messages from both the devices will get jumbled...It will be difficult for you to separate them when needed .. Not sure, but the work around suggested
 on this Forum is to create different user profiles (e.g. for you and your wife) on the PC... then log-in with these different profiles to SYNC respective phones..</p>

    <title>Preserving style formatting when pasting to Word 2007 from a web page - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Preserving style formatting when pasting to Word 2007 from a web page</h2>
                    
<p>I find that sometimes when I paste text from a webpage to Word 2007, it retains the style formatting from the web page and sometimes it doesn't. And I can't figure out why. The style formatting I am talking about is stuff like h1, h2 etc.</p>
<p>If I create a new, blank document and paste text from a web page, it always seems to loose the style formatting and everything, including h1,&nbsp;is pasted as 'Normal' style in Word.</p>
<p>If I paste to a document that has been used or&nbsp;has previously had different styles applied etc., then sometimes it will paste correctly. So, for example, h1 style text is pasted to Word as 'Heading 1'.</p>
<p>If, for example, I go to <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/top-10-reasons-to-try-office-2010-HA101673609.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/top-10-reasons-to-try-office-2010-HA101673609.aspx</a></p>
<p>and copy...</p>
<p>"<strong>Express your ideas more visually.</strong></p>
<p>Office 2010 opens up a world of design options to help you express your ideas with more impact. New and improved picture formatting tools, such as color saturation and artistic effects, let you transform your visuals into works of art. And a wide range of
 new customizable themes and SmartArt® graphic layouts offer more ways to make your ideas stick."</p>
<p>...and paste to a brand new Word 2007 document, the text is formatted as 'Normal' and the style&nbsp;formatting is lost (font face, size, etc, are preserved OK). If I paste to an 'old'&nbsp;document then it works&nbsp;OK and I see that '<strong>Express your ideas more
 visually'</strong>is h4 and thus pasted to Word 2007 as 'Heading 4'.</p>
<p>Any ideas on why? Thanks.</p>
<p>PS I am using IE8</p>

            <p>SOLUTION - RESOLVED</p>
<p>I'm working on a large template project that is using Word 2007 and I have just noticed this same annoying behavior&nbsp;on my client-site&nbsp;PC&nbsp;- I have a starting set of 85 templates and copying content from one template to another is converting all styles to
 Normal!</p>
<p>These are templates that have the same underlying style architecture.&nbsp; And we may have to do updates, rebuild the style architecture and copy the old content over for small tweaks - this was going to be a disaster.</p>
<p>Changing the Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Cut, Copy and Paste options&nbsp;had no effect.&nbsp; Investigated changes to Keep Source Formatting, Use Destination Formatting in a variety of configurations had no impact.</p>
<p>Luckily I have my own PC with me and checked my Word 2007 and 2010 environments - didn't have the same behaviour - that's a relief!</p>
<p>I then compared the Options settings with my client PC settings in MS Word 2007.</p>
<p>And this is the setting that did it:</p>
<p>1. Go to: Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Cut, Copy and Paste</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Make sure that Use smart cut and paste is ticked.&nbsp; (it's the last checkbox in this section)</p>
<p>3. Click the Settings button next to this option</p>
<p>4. Make sure that Smart Style Behaviour is checked (it should be checked as a default).</p>
<p>In my client Word environment I had inadvertently unchecked the Use Smart Cut and Paste option.</p>
<p>Glad I can breathe again!</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            Minor heating is not a problem, but if your mobile is heating up this much that you can smell burning then first of all turn it off to avoid any damage due to heating, its most likely hardware issue. Take it to a Nokia Care Point so they can diagnose the
 problem.

            Hi, dan9119. Welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions! It is normal for the phone to feel warm when multi-tasking, or when being charged. However, given this information, is right. It is best to take the phone to a Nokia Care Point for an evaluation:<br />

<p>Did the care point actually experience the heat of the device as you say you have experienced? If not sure, go back and make them have a look at it when you have recreated the severe heating issue. And make them comment it while you still at the care point.<br />
<br />
If they still tell you it's okey, and you honestly believe it's not. See if you can take it to another care point.<br />
<br />
If not, I would try to return it to the shop or make them handle the warranty case.<br />
<br />
However, you describe it as one would think it was on fire. If that's the case I cannot believe the care point let you have it back telling it was okey, but feal of heat could be down to personal preferences and as we're not able to feel it our selves. - We
 can only take your word for it.<br />
<br />
If another care point, and/or friends of you with some technical knowledge support the comment from the care point. You should sell it and look for something else.<br />
<br />
Todays smartphones will heat at some point during use and or exessive use. But they will create heat at different levels dependant on what hardware/software it's made of and what casing/spacing and materials it's build in and what tasks you throw upon it and
 what clima it lives under. But I guess you already know.<br />
<br />
I would start out with recreating the issue at the care point and make them feel it before you leave...<br />
<br />
Good luck!</p>

            It won't replay the pen strokes, but it will highlight the words/text/ink you were writing/drawing as that was being recorded. Sort of like "Follow the bouncing ball".

<p>I have 4 different domains that I need to send out email on their behalf. I have added an SPF TXT record in their DNS to show that I can legitimately send on their behalf. I have IIS set to relay from my local application, but what I need is how to setup
 the connectors. The users access the application via &nbsp;RDP and launch e-mails from their own domain address via the application which is currently able to relay via exchange 2010, I want to to decommission this on premise server before it dies.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Visio files crashing while making any changed to them - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Visio files crashing while making any changed to them</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need some help on a situation we have with some of our Visio files in the company.</p>
<p>As an example I have 4 files. All of them were created using Visio 2010 so extension ends in *.vsd</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can open all 4 files no problem, however only one of them I can actually work on without crashing Visio. The other 3 simply crash Visio after you do any of following steps: Scroll up/down (mostly up) in the file, copy objects, try to convert file to another
 version, Save file, Print file, add or remove a shape.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was looking at these files for long time until I noticed that one of them (which works OK) looks different visually while on Desktop of the computer.</p>
<p>If you pay attention, file number 1 (on the left) looks like normal Visio file, where is the other 3 looks like file is drawn over with something?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54b3480b-7453-4e26-996a-0e29d7326e87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54b3480b-7453-4e26-996a-0e29d7326e87" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please advise what is the issue here? How to resolve it?</p>
<p>Tried 2 different computers and files behave exactly same.</p>

<p>We use none, to very little of so called Bloat-Ware (which is what user from referenced article uninstalled)</p>

</p><p>Thanks for reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using 2013 version of Visio. Tried running Safe mode Visio, same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really think this is to do with the file itself and not what is on mine or user's computer. Have a look at how files look like, really shows something is wrong with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>As for the look of Thumbnail - I know it is not something you would care in a normal situation, however in this - it is a pointer, in my head, that something is wrong with those 3 files.</p>
<p>I am hoping that someone in community had this issue and knows what caused those 3 files appear like this and most importantly not how they appear, but the fact that they are pretty useless now as you cannot do anything with them. To recreate the file would
 take hours of work.</p>

                    <p>Problem is internet now has MSN Premium as e-mail default. In the e-mail options of the MSN Premium there does not seem to be simple removal of that choice-I no longer wish MSN Premium to be my default emal.

<h2>            Not receiving emails from Yammer</h2>
                    
<p>I have been receiving emails from Yammer, all was working fine. I changed the settings in
<strong>Notifications</strong> - un ticked the<strong> I receive a message in my Inbox</strong>. And so it did work, Yammer stopped sending messages to my Inbox.</p>
<p>I put the tick back on to the settings, and to see if it would start sending messages, and it does not work. I have logged out of Office365, logged back on again, created a new group and Yammer does not send messages to the
<strong>Inbox</strong>.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Where is the version control in Office 2016</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to use the company Sharepoint server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can open the documents (using URL), but I cannot save them back (they are read only), check them out or influence the version in any way.</p>
<p>The help mentions a FIle-&gt;info menu, which I cannot find either.</p>
<p>In the 2011 Version there was a Checkout / check in mechanism.</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>To investigate the issue, I’d like to confirm whether the library where you store your files has enabled
<b>Require Check Out</b> feature. If not, please go to the library settings -&gt; Versioning settings -&gt; Require documents to be checked out before they can be edited? -&gt; check the Yes option. After that, it will prompt you to check out when you open files in
 this library. And there will be a Check In option in the File tab.</p>
<p>If there is anything different from your side, please share some relevant screenshots with us. To insert a screenshot, click on
<b>Use rich formatting</b> to create your post. On the edit page, select <b>Insert/Edit Media</b> icon to upload a screenshot.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Ran</p>

<p>No , that feature is not enabled, and I do not think we want it enabled. Most users are not supposed to edit the files, just view them. What happens if we enable 'Require Check Out' and several people try to open the file ? (This happens regularly when someone
 posts an update). With 2011 only those wanting to add changes would check out the files.</p>

<h2>            Mac Word 2016 - Save As feature - defaults to last used folder</h2>
                    <p>I just transitioned from 2011 to 2016 Word for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I used "Save As" on 2011, the save location was defaulted to the folder where the current document is located.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But with 2016, it defaults to the last used folder, and I'm having to navigate each time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I change the default save location to be the current folder location?&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>1.Open a Word file from folder A, modify it and click save as from top toolbar. Then it will navigate to the current folder A where the Word
 file located.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.Open another Word file (located in folder B) from All My File, do the same operation as scene 1. Then it will also navigate to folder B.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Given this situation, I would like to collect following information:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Using Excel to calculate scores</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a body of data that I want to score.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a screenshot of a sample of my data:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73a6c501-8bd1-4780-a4a3-a78d7a6b2c24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73a6c501-8bd1-4780-a4a3-a78d7a6b2c24" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Column A are the scores from -3 through to +3</p>
<p>The numbers in Columns B, C and D relate to the items from a survey. </p>
<p>I want to be able to calculate the total score across participants for each item.</p>
<p>For example, Item 12 scores -3, 0 and -1 = -4</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I get Excel to do this for me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>

</p><p>I created a Microsoft account to purchase HoloLens. &nbsp;Unfortunately, this also created an Outlook.com account that I don't need. &nbsp;Every single day (multiple times a day, in fact), I now receive a "Welcome to Outlook" email. &nbsp;After disabling all emails in
 my Microsoft email settings, the emails still continue to arrive. &nbsp;Two questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How do I stop these emails? &nbsp;I suspect a bug in Microsoft's system is generating these daily for some reason. &nbsp;I would prefer not to add a rule to my gmail to filter all office.com emails but if necessary, will have to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. How can I close my outlook.com account *without* shutting down my entire Microsoft account? &nbsp;It seems this is not possible? &nbsp;How can this be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bart</p>

            <p>Hi Bart,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get better clarity on the issue please answer the question below:</p>
<p>How do you access Outlook.com? Is it through a web browser, mail app or email client?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be informed that the legitimate emails from Microsoft</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</span><span><span>has a green shield on the sender's name. </span></span><span><span>This indicates that the email is coming from Microsoft /&nbsp;legit sender.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you suspect that this is a spam, I suggest you to refer Microsoft help article which discuss how to protect your account.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/help-protect-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/help-protect-account</span></span></span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regarding your second question, please be informed that you cannot shutdown&nbsp;your
</span>outlook.com account without shutting down the entire Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft account is a single sign-in account to access all of your Microsoft services – from Office to Outlook to Skype. Your account keeps everything that you need on the device in hand, whether you use Windows, iOS or Android.

            <p>Hi Juzar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've only ever accessed outlook.com through the web. &nbsp;I don't have any outlook app or client. &nbsp;I started receiving the emails prior to my first sign in on outlook.com. &nbsp;I then signed it to see if I could figure out why the emails were being sent, but they
 still keep coming. &nbsp;They are definitely legit MS emails welcoming me to Outlook.com. &nbsp;I think there is an error on your servers that is making my account look perpetually new and sends the email over and over and over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not sent any emails from outlook.com and my inbox is empty. &nbsp;The emails are sent to my gmail.com account (the one tied to my Microsoft web account).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the email title: "Welcome to Outlook.com—One place for files, photos"</p>
<p>The sender is: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you recognize this welcome email and if so, know why it might be sending it daily?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bart</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think my point is clear -- I'm not using Outlook.com to read these emails. &nbsp;So there will never be a "green shield". &nbsp;I'm using Gmail/Thunderbird/Apple Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, office.com is owned by Microsoft. &nbsp;These emails are originating from Microsoft. &nbsp;I am 100% sure of that and would be happy to forward you one of these emails if you can provide me with a contact email to send them to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, I just received another one of these emails *after* you wrote this latest reply. &nbsp;I think it's clear what is happening here: there is a bug of some sort that is causing the Outlook.com account management system to think that my account is a newly-created
 one. &nbsp;This email should have been sent only once, not every single day. &nbsp;It is not a spam email -- it is the first welcome email being sent over and over and over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we please escalate this issue to someone on the team who can inspect the email? &nbsp;That should help us resolve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bart</p>

<h2>            Exceeded the login limit for a 15 minute period</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p><br />
I am considering replacing my current mail provider with outlook.com.&nbsp; I primarily use Outlook 2010 to read my mail via POP3/SMTP.&nbsp; I have always set outlook.com to check for new messages every two minutes.&nbsp; When I enable my outlook.com account in Outlook 2010,
 I receive the following message:</p>
<p><em>Task 'Outlook.com - Receiving' reported error (0x800CCC90) : 'Your incoming (POP3) e-mail server has reported an internal error. If you continue to receive this message, contact your server administrator or Internet service provider (ISP).&nbsp; The server
 responded: -ERR Exceeded the login limit for a 15 minute period. Reduce the frequency of requests to the POP3 server.'<br />
<br />
</em>I then tried increasing the time between automatic send/receives in Outlook 2010; however if I add a few manual send/receives to pull in a message I am waiting for or my phone notified me is sitting out there that causes the frequency to increase and I
 again receive the above error message.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what the limit is for how frequently you can check for new mail via POP3?&nbsp; Is this temporary as part of the "preview" or likely the way it will be?&nbsp; Could there be some "premium" paid upgrade to outlook.com in the future&nbsp;to remove this restriction?&nbsp;
 I am aware of the IMAP option; however I have a lot of mail and like the ability to have it organized the way I want and not have it all sitting on a mail server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<br />
It may have something to do with your particular set up (or perhaps the amount of mail you have on the server).<br />
<br />
I just did 50 straight send/receives manually in under 2 minutes and had no problem<br />
<br />
I also tried it on another computer using Outlook 2013 and again got no errors.<br />
<br />
I realize I only have abt 200 messages on line but it appears it is a local issue.<br />

<p>I really don't have any mail on the server, I am kind of testing the waters at this point.&nbsp; Not using it for my primary mail, yet.&nbsp; So there are usually no emails to even download.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I am using POP3/SMTP on server pop3.live.com using SSL on port 995.</p>

            <p>Hi MikeOrlando,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Based on our investigation, the error message usually&nbsp;caused by the following:<br />
<br />
1. Incorrect POP settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) – check with provider if it is required or not<br />
2. Firewall blocking ports (usually port 25) – could be 3rd party since Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to do so.<br />
<br />
As our initial troubleshooting step, I recommend that you try to reconfigure your account. To do so, please visit the link below:<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for you're reply.&nbsp; I never really found any official instructions specific to POP3/SMTP settings for outlook.com, I did follow the link below which recommended using port 995 with SSL on.&nbsp; Is there a different port that you are recommending?&nbsp; I
 would like to use SSL so when I travel my email credentials are not passed over the wire in plain text.</p>

Also, your instructions/link seem to me exclusive to Windows Live Mail (app), I am using Outlook 2010 with outlook.com as my email provider.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply!&nbsp; The first link detailed how to use the Outlook/Hotmail connector, I would rather manage my email in Outook 2010 "manually".&nbsp; I have multiple email account and do not wish to have the separation between the accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the second link, my account settings are set to the server addresses and port numbers as detailed by the article.&nbsp; The only thing that is not clear is that if the incoming mail server on port 995 should use SSL, I would like it to.&nbsp; When I try to
 turn SSL on POP3 off, it does not pass the account setting test.&nbsp; For the SMTP server I am using 587 with TLS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, It appears my settings are appropriate.</p>

<p>The first link details how to use the Hotmail Connector.&nbsp; I would rather not follow this method.&nbsp; I have multiple email accounts and do not want to separate my email into separate inboxes in this way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reviewed the second link.&nbsp; It appears all of my server and port numbers are appropriate.&nbsp; The only thing that is not clear is if POP3 on 995 should have SSL on or off.&nbsp; With SSL on, everything works; however with SSL off it does not pass the test in Outlook
 2010 so I will leave it on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears all settings are correct.</p>

            Any thoughts if this would go away if I upgraded to the paid, ad-free version of outlook.com?&nbsp; I have been having terrible problems with my current email provider and am looking to migrate to a new email service ASAP!

<p>Any other thoughts or suggestions out there, or is this simply the way outlook.com behaves?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand your concern, you are asking if the log in limit for a 15 minutes period will be removed when you upgrade your account to an&nbsp;Ad-free Outlook and Hotmail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that when you upgrade your account, you can only get certain features like advertisement free, no account expiration, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
        </p>
