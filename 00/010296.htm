</p>
<p>2. Select <strong>Manage Accounts </strong>and click on&nbsp;<strong>Add an account</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Under <strong>Choose an account</strong>, select <strong>Outlook.com</strong>.</p>

    <title>Slow Performance Internet Explorer 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prashant b. sharma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow Performance Internet Explorer 10</h2>
                    <i>Most of user face the Internet explorer 10 slow performance, when they are open any new tab, download the attached file or open any image etc. the solution is&nbsp;<span>you need to do is run a full system scan
 and diagnosis. I promise there are lots of troubled areas of your computer that can be cleaned up and optimized. Lets start with the Windows registry.</span><span><br />
<br />
Or Try this 9 instruction&nbsp;</span></i>
<div><i><span><br />
</span></i></div>
<div>

1 Bookmarking
<p>
One of the things I do most often with a browser is to bookmark pages. I need to do this as quickly as possible so I won’t lose my focus. With Internet Explorer, I need three clicks; with Chrome, just one. That makes Chrome 10 three times faster than Internet
 Explorer 9.</p>

2 Bookmark star
<p>
Often, before I finish work, I check all open tabs to see if there are any pages that I might need the next day. Sometimes I don’t remember if I already bookmarked a page or not. This also happens if I again stumble across a useful page. In Chrome, the star
 icon beside the address bar tells me immediately if I already bookmarked the page; a click on the star shows me which folder the bookmark is in. In Internet Explorer, I have to browse through my hundreds of bookmarks first for this purpose. This makes Internet
 Explorer a hundred times slower than Chrome.</p>

3 Search in bookmarks
<p>
Again, the bookmarks. Well, they are important for a knowledge worker. Now, tell me, am I just blind or did the IE developers really forget the search function in the Favorites sidebar? I don’t have to tell you how much time it can take to browse through all
 favorites until finally finding the important one I bookmarked last month, deep down in a folder where it doesn’t really belong. How many times slower is Internet Explorer here? I don’t know. Maybe indefinitely, if I don’t find the bookmark at all.</p>

4 Title bar
<p>
Okay, this is a minor issue. But it still bothers me. To place the tabs bar at the top of the browser was a very smart idea of the Google developers. Why was Microsoft too anxious to steal this feature and did just waste this valuable space in the title bar?
 Yes, it means only little additional space for the web page. However, if you work on laptop or netbook this little extra page can be very valuable, especially if you use web apps often. Scrolling a web page up and down to interact with the web app can get
 on your nerves and can slow down a browser considerably.</p>

5 Tabs space
<p>
The size of the available space for tabs in Internet Explorer is much too small. It usually takes about 20 minutes on a normal work day before I have so many tabs open that I can no longer distinguish them in Internet Explorer simply because the visible part
 of the HTML title is too small. You can show the tabs on a separate row (right click a tab). However, this takes away even more valuable screen space. Since the default tab bar configuration is no option for a knowledge worker and taking into account the wasted
 space in the title bar, I have considerably less space available for the web page than with Chrome. These simple layout differences boost Chrome’s performance with many web apps on devices with small screens and this without the need of fancy hardware acceleration.</p>

6 Extensions
<p>
Browsers have become platforms. No, I am not talking about web apps. I don’t really like those and you know that by now. I am talking about add-ons or extensions. I think, the number of available extensions is essential for the success of a browser. Microsoft
 is usually quite good when it comes to creating an ecosystem around a software product. Somehow they have problems with Internet Explorer here. The availability of just one add-on can be a killer feature if you can’t find something comparable for an alternative
 browser (Internet Explorer). I don’t really know how far ahead Chrome is here. But if I search for SEO add-ons for Chrome, I get about 100 hits. If I do the same for Internet Explorer, I get about 0 hits. There is no doubt that many of these little browsers
 helpers save me a lot of time which increases browser speed considerably.</p>

7 Superbar
<p>
I don’t really&nbsp;<a href="http://4sysops.com/archives/some-more-thoughts-about-the-windows-7-taskbar-a-k-a-superbar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">find the Windows 7 Superbar so super</a>&nbsp;and in combination with Internet Explorer, it really
 gets on my nerves. Every time I switch back to the browser window, the Superbar shows me my myriad of open tabs and expects me to find the page by just looking at those super-tiny thumbnails. In most cases, I just want to access the last page viewed anyway.
 If I can’t find the page in the thumbnails immediately, I just click any tab and then try to find the right tab in IE’s tab bar. So this extra click-click-click game with the Superbar costs me significantly more time than in Chrome and often is the reason
 that I lose the focus on my work.</p>
<p>
Update: This "feature" can be disabled: Internet Options &gt; Tabs: Settings &gt; Show previews for individual tabs in the taskbar*</p>

8 InPrivate browsing vs. Incognito
<p>
InPrivate browsing in Internet Explorer and the equivalent Incognito feature in Chrome are useful features. I don’t just use this feature if I want to browse a site without being recognized. Usually, when I log on to security-sensitive sites, I open the web
 site incognito so none of the many plugins I use gets a chance to snoop my password. What I miss here in Internet Explorer is being able to start InPrivate browsing by right-clicking a bookmark or a link in a web page. Yes, I can copy the URL, open an InPrivate
 window, and then paste the URL. In Chrome, this procedure can be accomplished with just a click. This is what I call browser performance.</p>

9 Zoom
<p>
I read a lot and try not to strain my eyes too much. This is why I zoom almost every web page I open. Chrome definitely has the better and faster zoom function. It takes two "clicks" with the mouse wheel until the web page reaches the ideal size—that is, when
 it uses all available space of the browser window. With Internet Explorer 9, it usually takes much longer to get the font size I prefer. Again, Internet Explorer 9 came off last in an important browser benchmark discipline.</p>

<p>Are you using Windows&nbsp;8 Consumer Preview as the operating system on your computer or are you using Windows 7 as your operating system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 10 is a Preview version and it is not avilable for Windows 7. For more details you may refer the link mentioned below.</p>

            <div><span>I appreciate your comparisons of various features between IE and Chrome. &nbsp;I was hoping your post was dealing with issues about IE that are problems that can be fixed by tweaking your system or by finding and fixing the cause. So excuse me
 if I reply by adding my issues here. &nbsp;I got to experience IE10 first on my Windows phone 7. Now I got Windows 8 on my desktop and welcome IE10. I do hope the speed has improved over IE9, and that it compares favorably with other browsers like Chrome, Opera,
 and Firefox. One thing about IE that forces me to use it is because certain websites require an ActiveX download, and because old websites may have been using nonstandard IE6 tricks that can be best viewed using compatibility mode of IE9 and IE10. Also at
 work, the Windows Server and Exchange Server is 2003, and there is something about the Outlook Web Access page that when viewed in IE10 requires that it be viewed in compatibility mode. Anyway, I may have to use IE for a few important sites, one being the
 Exchange Server for my company just to be most conformant with Microsoft Server products. And for HP.com where I need to download and run an ActiveX component so that it can detect hardware. &nbsp;Also the website meetup.com seems to work better in IE. I also like
 that when filling out forms, IE remembers what I have written before in the standard fields such as email, name, phone, and so forth. Other than that I really like using Opera and Chrome for various features. Anyway, lately I am having difficulty with my IE
 on Windows 8. So I hope some engineer here can help me with this odd behavior. Excuse me that I post this under an old post that doesn't quite address the same situation.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<span>&nbsp;IE10 goes into "Not Responding" and alternates every second between being in focus and being out of focus where you can't type while it is out of focus. I have tried doing all kinds of things to troubleshoot: reset, delete temp files, cookies,
 etc, removed and reinstalled, run sfc /scannow, run Malwarebytes, and tried installing AOL 9.7 (with the reasoning that since it uses IE browser maybe it will behave similarly) but it is behaving similarly going in and out of focus.</span>

            <p>You should not care how the option value looks in its table.&nbsp; Actually, you and your users should never see a table's datasheet when entering, editing or viewing the data.&nbsp; Instead you should always use forms and reports to interact with the data and your
 option group is as good a way to do that as any.&nbsp; And, if you did change the values in the table, the option group could not be used to edit or view the text that you wanted to store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The preferred way to handle this situation is to add a text box to your form to display the converted text string.&nbsp; For the example you used, the text box could use this expression&nbsp;to display (not store) the letter:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; =ASC(64 + [name of option frame])</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more complex text strings, it is highly recommended that you create a table (named Options)&nbsp;with one field (primary key) that has the option value and another field for the text string.&nbsp; Then, in any report or&nbsp;if the option group is not use in a form
 to modify the value, the form/report's record source query can join the two tables and simply display&nbsp;the text string.&nbsp; In a form where the option group is used to enter/edit the value in the table field, the text box next to the option group can use&nbsp;an expression
 like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; =DLookup("[option text field], "Options", "[option number field] = " &amp; [name of option frame])</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that the word <strong><em>Field</em></strong> refers to a column in a table or query.&nbsp; It does not refer to any control on a form or report.</p>

If you are storing something different that an integer in your table, then the Option Group needs to be unbound and you need to populate it from the table.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The better way is to create a lookup table with an integer key and the a corresponding description. Store the integer as a foreign key. Then join to your lookup table to display the description on your reports.&nbsp;</div>

<p>You will need to set polling at longer intervals so&nbsp;not to interfere/trip on itself. These numbers are variable and I cannot offer you a set amount. A good rule of thumb is to keep auto polling (running a Send/Receive) at no less than 10 minutes. The more
 accounts you have the longer the interval needs to be.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Posted without seeing the replies...weird.</p>
<p>Anyway...With 14+ accounts make sure the auto polling is set beyond 15 minutes. Not sure that 14 is a "hard" limit as Microsoft has no published limits. But that is a LOT of email accounts to keepl up with...</p>
<p>Thanks...&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            SOLUTION to ERROR &#34;Send to Mail Recipient&#34; not working in Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>SOLUTION</p>
<p>=========================================================================</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; In Word 2016, Click quick access tool bar (upper left) &gt; More Commands &gt; Choose commands from = All Commands &gt; select "Send to Mail Recipient" from list &gt; "select Add&gt;&gt;" &gt; click "OK" (bottom right)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Click "Send to Mail Recipient" you just created (Quick Access Tool Bar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; If you get this error message&nbsp;<span>"Word could not load the e-mail envelope.&nbsp; This could be caused by a network connection problem or a problem with your Office installation." &gt; click OK &gt; shutdown your computer &gt; restart
 your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4.&nbsp; Try it again,&nbsp;</span>Click "Send to Mail Recipient", hopefully the restart solved it for anyone else having a similar problem.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Original Post...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to send word documents as email (not as an attachment, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp; added "Send to Mail Recipient" to quick access toolbar but when I click it , word stops accepting any type of input for about a minute, then it posts the following error message...</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Word could not load the e-mail envelope.&nbsp; This could be caused by a network connection problem or a problem with your Office installation."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Office 2016, w10 64 bit with all updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook 2016 and Word 2016 both seem to be working correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Outlook" is set as my default email app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get rid of the error message and get "Send to Mail Recipient" to work in Word 2016?</p>

<p>According to Office Updates my Office was and is up to date.</p>
<p>See the solution in the original post.</p>
<p>Send to Mail Recipient now works and the only thing I did was shut down several hours ago and reboot a few minutes ago, therefore rebooting appears to be the solution, at least it was for me.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone that tried to help.</p>

            As I said in my question there is only 1 .pst file so Ghost Buster will not work. It will only work if there is more than 1 .pst file.

<p>It is 1.81 GB.&nbsp;I &nbsp;did not see an Advanced tab in properties. I ran the scanpst.exe and it corrected errors. I ran it&nbsp;again and it found no errors and I still have 2 Personal Files but only 1 pst file.</p>

<p>If that folder is a duplicate and its a pst data file then adding a new Profile, the pop mail account and pointing it to the original pst data file will have no impact on your data.</p>
<p>To backup a pst data file you simply copy it to some location, <strong>with Outlook closed</strong></p>

    <title>Two shortcuts for &#34;Microsoft OneDrive&#34; and &#34;OneDrive for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jay martin &#40;4&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two shortcuts for &#34;Microsoft OneDrive&#34; and &#34;OneDrive for Business&#34;</h2>
                    Why do I have two shortcuts on my Windows Start Menu for "Microsoft OneDrive" and "OneDrive for Business"?&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Name: <strong>Microsoft OneDrive&nbsp;</strong><br />
Comment: "Keep your most important files with you wherever you go, on any device."&nbsp;<br />
Target: C:\Users\<em>username</em>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive\OneDrive.exe&nbsp;<br />
Result: When selected, a folder opens, C:\Users\<em>username</em>\OneDrive - <em>
Company Name</em>.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Name: <strong>OneDrive for Business&nbsp;</strong><br />
Target: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\GROOVE.EXE&nbsp;<br />
Comment: "Sync SharePoint documents to your computer and work with the content as if you were connected."&nbsp;<br />
Result: When selected, a dialog opens, asking "Which library do you want to sync?"&nbsp;<br />
<p>&nbsp;<br />
What is the problem with my setup? Yesterday I upgraded from Office 2013 to Office 2016. I have an Office 365 account. I have Windows 7 Professional, 64 bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another symptom of the problem is that I cannot access the files on OneDrive through Outlook. When I click Attach File on the Message menu in Outlook, "Browse Web Locations" is grayed out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;</span><span>Cappuzzello</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regarding your description "</span><span>deleted this section in one of my courses.&nbsp;</span><span>", do you mean the section under Teacher-only section group. If yes, according to this prompt after tested, this section
 is permanently deleted. You should created a new one.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a23de952-25c6-463a-92f0-f1a9cf5f9099?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a23de952-25c6-463a-92f0-f1a9cf5f9099?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Or you mean you deleted the Teacher-only section group? If yes, can you show me how you deleted that since the when you enable this section group, it has a hint "This section group will be permanently added." .</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1253a653-f130-4e8c-9949-44b9594db267?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1253a653-f130-4e8c-9949-44b9594db267?upload=true" /></a></p>

<h2>            build 10240 insider, some questions, switch from insider to general version, etc&#63;</h2>
                    <p>several questions</p>
<p>windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>INSIDER version - on copule machines, i want to switch them to actual general windows 10 (not insider);</p>
<p>what do I do to just STOP the insider stuff (I see the switch to do so),and if I DO this, am I then using a REGULAR WINDOWS 10 install (it appears to be activeated)</p>
<p>
</p><p>INSIDER version windows 10 pro - &nbsp;I want to use BITLOCKER (I have instructions to do so), but I want to first make sure that the INSIDER stuff is turned off and that I then have a REGULAR WINDOWS 10 PRO version. &nbsp;HOW TO VERIFY that I am now on the general
 release?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Windows 10 ISO creation - instructions found on microsoft.com, to MAKE an &nbsp;install &nbsp;ISO disk.</p>
<p>If I CREATE this disk, and I want to install WINDOWS 10 home, do I have to CREATE the disk FROM a windows 10 home machine, or can I careate the disk from a WINDOWS 10 PRO machine? &nbsp;(and vice versa, windows 10 pro install &nbsp;froma windows 10 home machine)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Hhave the WINDOWS 10 reservation turned OFF on one critical machine, &nbsp;I have it TRUEcrypted, I need to first do a backup of that machine (Image), and THEN install, and I prefer to install from an ISO idisk for that machine</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am computer savvy,hav backups done, have worked with the insider stuff, it has been GREAT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help with this is apreciated</p>

            <p>You asking too many questions :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just left insider with the push of that button.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It said restart the computer...&nbsp; done deal.. Cant tell an ounce of difference excpt now that button says 'Join the Insiders'
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10">
'Media Creation Tool'</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; I clicked for 64bit and downloaded the tool to downloads folder.</p>
<p>When I ran it... it asks a lot of questions...&nbsp; may not be exact but from memory;</p>
<p>Language</p>
<p>32 or 64bit or both</p>
<p>Windows Home or Pro&nbsp; (maybe both option too)</p>
<p>Install now ,, or create install media, DVD or USB, or create iso.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Maybe some other questions... but it has lots of options that you want to give consideration to or you might end up with wrong bytes or versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have it make an iso, &nbsp;you really don't even need to put it to dvd or usb with win8 you just double click the iso file and it opens in a virtual DVD... just run the setup from within windows for the upgrade to start.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which will ask a couple more
 questions.</p>

<p>Hi Neil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to gather more information to better assist you with this concern. Kindly answer the following questions below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you using the classic Outlook.com or the new Outlook.com UI (Outlook.com Beta)?</li><li>Did you receive any error codes/messages when trying to access your emails?</li><li>Is the issue also happening when using a different web browser?</li><li>Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I would recommend that you optimize your browser, clear cache and browsing history. You may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-osend/cant-open-email-in-outlook/69b7317b-5370-4c0a-a528-e3e7d8ed9867">thread</a></strong> for the steps on how to optimize your browser. Check for

            Hi Andrew,
<br />The trash can is the new icon and unfortunately, you can't go back to the X. They just haven't updated the Customize screens yet. 
<br />
<br />A lot of people don't like the trash can  it took me awhile to get used to it. Another user hated it enough to create a suggestion for it at uservoice. Vote and comment on it at <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows/suggestions/34844983-go-back-to-using-an-x-for-delete-and-make-it-red" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-out...</a>

<h2>            Suddenly I can&#39;t receive any emails on my Hotmail, but still can send</h2>
                    Friends informed my 10 days ago that my email is sending them spam messages, I changed the account password to prevent sending spams, but since then I stopped receiving any messages to this account.

<h2>            OneNote Class Notebook</h2>
                    <p>I am using Class Notebook&nbsp; and adding students via a managed directory.&nbsp; I have a student who is having trouble accessing her notebook on her iPad (version 16.6 on the iPad) via the OneNote app as well as online.&nbsp; On the teacher's end, she has the notebook
 and I can see her is my list of students.&nbsp; When she opens her app she has none of the sections and the content library is not accessible (the page "opens" and the arrow points down but there is nothing displayed.&nbsp; I have tried to remove the student and then
 add her back, I have removed her and deleted content and added her back, I have even gone and fixed permissions but nothing seems to help; she cannot access the notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To compound matters further, when I deleted this student from my notebook and then opened the notebook online and then in the app, she still appeared in the notebook and no matter how I tried I could not delete her.&nbsp; &nbsp; What is also interesting is that this
 same student is using One in 2 other classes and she has no issue accessing those notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am out of ideas, can anyone offer a suggestion?</p>
